Abstract
Sediment biomarkers are important archives of regional, and global climate signatures, particularly in regions which lack continuous terrestrial archives such as the semi-arid deserts of Africa. We measured carbon and hydrogen stable isotopes from plant wax
n
-alkanes recovered from the Holocene Later Stone Age (LSA) sedimentary sequence at Wonderwerk Cave (South Africa), that comprises several technocomplexes (Kuruman/Oakhurst, Wilton, Ceramic Wilton and Historic). The plant wax
n
-alkane results were integrated with published palaeoenvironment reconstructions from the cave based on faunal, botanical, geological and sedimentological proxies which provides a robust comparative framework. The findings match well with other proxy records from the same strata and indicate a semi-arid to semi-humid early Holocene, with a mix of woody C
3
plants and C
4
grasses. In contrast, the mid-late Holocene environment was increasingly arid, open and dominated by C
4
grasses. A distinct humid period at 5300–6200 cal. BP is evident, associated with a high density of archaeological material and a change in cultural expression in the Wonderwerk record. This study provides a step forward in using stable isotopes from biomarkers to create terrestrial environmental records in semi-arid regions.

Introduction
Correlations between local environmental change and cultural markers are usually investigated through the integration of environmental proxy studies and archaeological analysis at a local or regional scale. Firmly correlating past climatic shifts and cultural expression is key to expanding our understanding of human cultural development [e.g.
1
,
2
]. However, to disentangle the expression of macro-climatic versus local environmental changes, as would have been experienced by past human populations, requires a multi-proxy approach, since each proxy record reflects only specific parameters of past conditions. Sediment biomarkers, such as plant wax
n
-alkanes and their isotopic compositions, are an important source of multi-scalar climate signals, particularly in areas where long-term terrestrial archives are lacking [e.g.
3
,
4
]. With their ability to persist across geological time periods
5
,
6
, plant wax
n
-alkanes have enormous potential to provide environmental information on a molecular level since large parts of Southern Africa have minimal organic macroscopic (e.g. faunal remains) and microscopic (e.g. pollen) preservation. This hold true for many Later Stone Age (LSA) archaeological sites spanning the last 46,000 years in the interior of South Africa
7
. Three studies on southern African sites have measured carbon and hydrogen stable isotopes from plant wax
n
-alkanes derived directly from specific archaeological layers [e.g.
8
,
9
,
10
], but none have included sites in the arid interior of the country.
The LSA in the arid interior of South Africa is characterised by short term occupations of both caves/rockshelters and open-air sites

12
,
13

further attest to the interconnected nature of regional LSA groups. Key to our understanding of the full LSA regional variability in this region is a precisely dated environmental record. Wonderwerk Cave, with a near-continuous LSA record of occupation from c. 12 ka to 500 BP, is a key reference site both for the archaeology and palaeoenvironment of the region (Fig.

In the current study, we tested the application of plant wax

Wonderwerk Cave is currently situated with the Savanna biome, more specifically the Kuruman Mountain Bushveld (SVK10), in close proximity to both the Nama Karoo and the Grassland biome (Fig.
1
a)
29
. The local vegetation comprises of grasses such as
Themeda triandra
,
Cymbopogon plurinoides
as well as
Aristida
spp and some small trees and shrubs such as
Rhus
spp.,
Tarchonanthus camphoratus
,
Acacia
spp.,
Olea europaea
ssp.
africana
,
Grewia flava
and
Boscia albitrunca
30
. The vast majority of grasses in the Savanna biome region of South Africa use the C
4
photosynthetic pathway, while trees and shrubs use the C
3
photosynthetic pathway
29
. Therefore, it is possible to trace changes in the proportions of grass and tree/shrub vegetation through the application of stable carbon isotope measurements (
Supplementary Text
)
31
. Hydrogen stable isotopes document water source, rainfall intensity, altitude and temperature amongst others
32
. Additionally, hydrogen stable isotopes are associated with differences between plant ecological lifeforms
33
. In the summer rainfall zone of South Africa specifically, where Wonderwerk Cave is located, the amount of rainfall
34
and/or evapotranspiration
35
have been proposed as the main influences on hydrogen stable isotope values. Today, the Wonderwerk Cave surroundings are dry to semi-arid with an average annual rainfall of 420 mm. Over two thirds of the rainfall occurs during the summer months
36
. Frost is common on some winter nights most years.
The Holocene sequence comprised a total of eight lithostratigraphic layers spanning from historic times to the early Holocene (Table
1
, for details see
13
). This study was conducted on nine sediment samples collected during the 2019 excavation season at the cave (Table
1
, for details see methods section) that span the Holocene sequence encompassing the Wilton (8440 − 4580 ca. BP), Ceramic LSA (4540 − 680 cal. BP) and historic cultural layers (< 100 years) in the Operation 5 profile (Table
1
, Table
S1
). The ages of these layers were newly modelled here by combining the radiocarbon dates in
37
] and [
13
.
Results
The new modelled age ranges for the radiocarbon dates concur with previously published age ranges (Table
1
)
37
. Three additional dates from
13
are in good agreement with the model and do not show any posterior outlier probability, while sample 6319 (layer DL) exhibits 7% posterior outlier probability in the outlier model. Despite this, the modelled age range of layer DL has not changed significantly within this time frame. Overall, the new model’s results have tightened the age ranges of all layers and better constrained layers BWS and FBS, highlighting that they are separate units.
The relative abundance of different biomarker chain lengths can reflect shifts in biome changes over time. The plant wax biomarker distributions show a clear odd-over-even ratio (Figure
S1
, Dataset
S1
). Higher chain lengths dominate indicating a terrestrial plant wax source with average chain length (ACL
27 − 33
) ranging from 30.4 to 30.9 (average 30.8 ± 0.18,
n
= 9) (Table
2
), showing very little variation. If considering more homologues, ACL
25 − 35
is almost identical at a range from 30.3 to 31.0 (Table
2
). All samples display C
31
as the dominant
n
-alkane, while the C
29
and C
33
homologues are the second most abundant, depending on the sample. This is consistent with reports of ACL from modern South African plants
31
,
38
. The carbon preference index (CPI) of the C
25 − C35
n
-alkanes ranges between 6.7 and 13.2 (10.1 ± 2.1,
n
= 9) (Table
2
).

) and δD values of − 141.5‰ (C
29
) and − 144.8‰ (C
31
). We did not correct the modern cave entrance samples or sample GS (< 100 yrs. ago) for the Suess effect as we do not know their exact time depth. Any correction would be based on a guessed value, and their corrected value (up to a maximum of 2‰) would still fall within the range of the archaeological samples. However, we have taken this into account in our statistical analysis (Table
S2
). The archaeological samples δ

C results for the C

exhibit comparable isotopic signatures throughout the sequence (Fig.

C values throughout. The δ
13
C values range from − 25.5‰ to − 28.5‰ in C
29
and from − 25.8‰ to − 29.1‰ in C
31
. In contrast, no chain length consistently shows the highest δD values. For example, δD ratios for C
29
anti-phased from the trend of the δD values for C
31
and C
33
. The δD values range from − 141.6‰ to − 158.7‰ in C

, and from − 142‰ to − 150.4‰ in C
31
for the archaeological samples, which overlaps with the sample from the modern cave entrance.

Discussion
The modern comparative sample from the cave entrance (Sample 4723) reflects the vegetation of the Ghaap plateau today, which has been heavily altered by anthropogenic activities, including overgrazing and the planting of non-native species. Overgrazing and currently high CO
2
levels are advantageous for C
3
plants, which could explain the signal in the isotopic C
3
plant range for the modern and historic sample (sheep were also held in the cave during historic times). The opening of the cave faces north toward the Ghaap plateau which is most likely the main source of the plant wax recovered. This is confirmed by the sediments from inside the cave from Operation 5, which are primarily comprised of quartz sands of aeolian origin matching Kalahari derived sands that accumulated across the landscape outside the cave
13
,
39
. Another potential source of plant wax is via water percolation through the banded ironstone and dolerite formation into the cave. Notably, there is a large stalagmite and various flowstone deposits in close proximity to Operation 5
20
,
40
, however, we did not sample any sediments within the flowstone deposits. Moreover
40
, have shown that the large speleothem in the cave entrance was not growing between 13 ka and 3.5 ka, suggesting very little infiltration of water into the cave over the duration of the period we are researching. It cannot be ruled out that humans and/or animals introduced selected plant material into the cave in the past, (e.g. for fuel, bedding, food and crafts), which served as a source, at least in part, of the plant wax
8
. However, irrespective of the vector of the botanical remains, we consider the resulting data to reflect local environmental conditions in the past. This is borne out by the fact that our results match the other environmental proxies from the same layers of Wonderwerk Cave, including those which track a range of parameters in addition to vegetation cover. This implies that the plant wax data are reliable in reflecting the local to regional Holocene palaeoenvironment.
Burning is a potential source of diagenetic alteration of plant waxes, however, the CPI values indicate that no significant plant wax degradation occurred
41
,
42
despite the variable but clear presence of charcoal in the Holocene layers we sampled
22
and of faunal bone specimens (5–15% across all layers) bearing traces of burning. Additionally, the odd-over-even predominance (OEP
25 − 35
) ranges from 6.4 to 12.8 for the archaeological samples (Table
1
), suggesting little degradation through burning or other processes of organic matter degradation
43
.
The relative abundance (Figure
S1
) of
n
-alkane biomarkers can be used to determine the proportional sedimentary input of woody C
3
plants and C
4
grasses. All samples show the dominance of C
31
, followed by C
33
or C
29
. These results, as well as ACL
27 − 33
and CPI
25 − 35
indices, most closely match the signature of Nama Karoo samples obtained by
38
, indicating a source vegetation at Wonderwerk that is similar to today’s Nama Karoo biome. The exception to this signal is the sample from layer DL (Table
1
; Fig.
2
), where C
29
and C
33
chain lengths are almost equal, indicating a higher proportion of C
3
plants than in the other layers. However, Herrmann et al.’s
38
study included only a small number of Savanna biome samples compared to the other South African biomes, and more samples from the wider Savanna biome region are necessary to refine these values. Additionally, ecological lifeform, aridity, and temperature can influence dominant chain length, while the δ
13
C results are a direct proxy for photosynthesis.
The δ
13
C
n
C
31
results between − 25.83‰ and − 29.09‰ generally indicate a mix of C
3
and C
4
plants in the environment. The δ
13
C values of
n
C
29
,
n
C
31
and
n
C
33
overall, as well as their weighted average, show the same trends, especially in the early Holocene (layers CBS, AAS and DL), with an increase in C
4
plant input from CBS to AAS and further to layer DL. In the mid-Holocene layers AS and BWS,
n
C
33
does not decrease to the same extend as the other chains and the weighted average. As
n
C
33
is particularly representative of C
4
grasses
42
, this could indicate a strong C
4
grass presence from the mid-Holocene onwards as has been proposed by other proxies from Wonderwerk Cave (Fig.
3
).

C
33
trends seen in later levels.
n
C
29
indicates increased humidity in layers AAS and DL while
n
C
33
, indicative of C
4
grasses, indicates increased aridity. The anti-phased trends in the chain length δD isotope values, might indicate changes in either the relative proportions of C
3
and C
4
plants (in the environment or in plants humans brought into the cave), the water stress experienced by each plant type, or a change in plant type, in amount of rainfall or rainfall regime
32
. If the weighted average is taken as measure for overall changes in aridity and our results demonstrate more humidity in mid-Holocene layers DL, AS and BWS, with DL being the most humid. The
n
C
31
values match closely the trends in the weighted average of
n
C
29
,
n
C
31
and
n
C
33
(Figs.
2
and
3
), which shows a wetter mid-Holocene (layers DL-BWS) compared to the layers in the early and late Holocene. Additionally, the indices Norm31 and Norm33, which have been tentatively linked to environmental parameters such as water stress
31
,
44
, are lowest in layer DL (Table
1
; Fig.
2
). Higher ACL have been interpreted as an indicator of more grasses and/or drier conditions in the arid areas of southern Africa
45
, and following this interpretation, layer DL stands out as representing a more humid phase. All these results indicate less water stress and potentially also more C
4
plants in layer DL, which is dated to ~ 5330–6280 cal. BP, and thereafter.
The biomarker results are in good agreement with other environmental proxies regarding general trends in vegetation and climatic conditions in the Holocene layers of Excavation 1 at Wonderwerk Cave (Fig.
3
)
22
,
23
,
24
,
26
,
27
,
28
. The results show an early Holocene (layers CBS and AAS) with a mix of woody C
3
plants and C
4
grasses in contrast to an increasingly C
4
grass dominated later Holocene (Fig.
3
). The faunal assemblage reflects this by the presence of Tragelaphini and a reduced number of Equids in layers CBS and AAS compared to the younger layers (Fig.
3
), the percentage of predominantly C
4
grazers in these layer is the lowest in the whole sequence
27
. The last appearance of the extinct
Antidorcas bondi
and
Megalotragus priscus
in layer CBS, hints at a different palaeoecological structure, including remnants of the Pleistocene grazing succession
27
. The pollen data of the same layers
23
, provides further corroboration for the interpretation of a dry karroid vegetation in the early Holocene. A shift in pollen
23
as well as tree-cover based on charcoal taxa analysis
22
, indicates a change to more humid grassy conditions in the mid-Holocene, starting in layer AAS and reaching its most extreme after c. 6200 cal. BP (layer DL), which has been taken as indication of a shift in rainfall regime
23
. This trend is also mirrored in tortoise body mass, which following changes in plant productivity, was lowest in the drier early Holocene layers, but increased significantly in the moister mid-Holocene layers
28
.
The δD C
29
and C
31
alkanes are an additional line of evidence showing more humidity in layers AAS and DL. Divergent trends in the chain length δD isotope values are especially strong between C
33
(representing mainly C
4
grasses) and C
29
(representing mainly C
3
plants). Modern δD Savanna biome sediment values range from − 119 ± 0‰ to -103 ± 3 for δD in C
29
and − 141 ± 1‰ to -123 ± 1‰ for δD in C
31
34
. The sample from the current Wonderwerk cave entrance is more negative (-141.5 ± 1.7‰ for C
29
and − 144.8 ± 1.2‰ for C
31
), as is entire range of Wonderwerk δD values compared to the modern ones. Indeed, the Wonderwerk δD values fall within the Grassland biome range of
34
. However, the samples in that study were not taken in the Wonderwerk Cave region but further south. If compared to the range of the modern summer rainfall zone as a whole, the Wonderwerk Cave values all fall within these ranges. Another local line of evidence for past humid conditions comes from the ostrich eggshell δ
18
O record from Wonderwerk Excavation 1
26
. Further evidence can be found in the summer rainfall zone, where a mid-Holocene humid period is recorded from studies of the Cold Air Cave stalagmite
46
, Equus Cave pollen and ostrich eggshell stable isotopes
47
,
48
, Wonderkrater pollen record
49
, Kathu Pan 6 sediments
50
and the Florisbad pollen record
51
. Overall, a rise of C
4
grasses following a wet phase is conclusive as reflected in the species composition of micro and macro-fauna, pollen and the biomarker record at Wonderwerk Cave, with C
4
grasses remaining more abundant in the subsequent mid-late Holocene (layers AS, BSW, FBS). Higher δD values, comparable to modern δD values
34
across all chain lengths within the late Holocene layer FBS, indicate an arid phase in the last 2000 years which is in agreement with the pollen data. Alcelaphini and Equids, both grazing species dominate the faunal record in layers AS and FBS.
Small fluctuations in aridity are highly likely in the late Holocene, especially in layer BWS, but are less prominent and poorly time-constrained. Layer DL stands out as a turnover point for the expansion of the C
4
grassland. In parallel, it is associated with the highest density of archaeological material in the Wonderwerk Cave record. We detect a technological shift in the increased frequency of segments relative to backed bladelets and the use chert for stone tool manufacture in layers DL and AS, as well as changes in worked ostrich eggshell abundance from layer DL onwards. Similar shifts in technology and raw material are characteristic of Wilton lithic assemblages from South Africa’s interior, dating to c. 8-2 ka cal. BP (

C values and the amount of lithics per layer (indicating occupation density), as well as between

27
δ
13
C values and the number of recovered ostrich eggshell (OES) fragments (Table
3
). The correlation between increased C
4
plants in the environment and higher site occupation intensity and/or artifact density (Table
3
), might reflect changes in human mobility or an adaptation to a changing botanical and faunal ecosystem. If corrected for the potential Suess effect by 2‰ there are fewer significant correlations (Table
S2
), however, especially for OES the correlations persist. The higher density of lithic artefacts, fauna and culturally modified OES, during and after the humid period of ~ 5400–6300 cal. BP, coincides with the growing dominance of the C
4
grassland. However, the data on site occupation is more nuanced if sedimentation rate is taken into account. Layer DL has the greatest density of lithics/sediment and suggesting clear evidence for an increase in human activity during this period. However there is reason for caution as the rate of sediment accumulation is also a factor in the density of artifacts. When we take this factor into consideration (Figure
S2
) it appears that the high rate of lithic artifact deposition found in DL might continue into the overlying AS, where there is an increase in the rate of deposition (as calculated based on radiocarbon ages), but these two layers are both clearly distinct from underlying and overlying deposits. Considering this, it stands that there was increased human activity in the mid-Holocene at Wonderwerk Cave compared to previous and later layers and at least part of this is linked to wetter and/or more open environments. Increased human activity could also mean increased input from collected plant resources into the cave, which could potentially bias the biomarker results when human-selected plants overprint the signal of the natural environment as a whole. However, as our results are consistent with trends in other proxies from the site, some of which are independent of human plant collection, we assume the
n
-alkane stable isotope values are not influenced by increased human activity in the cave.

In the late Holocene, the initial occurrence of pottery at the site in layer FBS and BWS
11
may reflect increased mobility of hunter-gatherer groups with new technologies at times of aridity. However, there does not seem to be a clear environmental change connected to the introduction of pottery at Wonderwerk Cave, since this was a widespread phenomenon throughout southern Africa, and most likely did not originate in our research region. Likewise, the introduction of sheep into southern Africa ca. 2000 BP, was a general phenomenon
52
. There is limited evidence for the presence of sheep at Wonderwerk Cave and this includes dung and associated spherulites identified in a micromorphology thin section
13
and SEM identification of sheep hair

, both of which originate in layer FBS (dated to 680–2500 cal. BP), which hints at new subsistence practices.
Through the integration of environmental multi-proxy studies and high-resolution archaeological excavation we have demonstrated a close connection between local Holocene environment and cultural change at Wonderwerk Cave. Our study shows that sedimentary biomarkers can provide additional insights into local environmental conditions but demonstrate a complex picture that will require more focused research on the Northern Cape region to fully understand. Increased interest in this region and period will further highlight the complex lifeways of Later Stone Age hunter-gatherers and potentially improve our knowledge about, and cultural perception of, modern hunter-gatherers groups living in similar environments.
Methods
Sample collection
Eight sediment samples were taken during excavation in Excavation 1, Operation 5, located about 20 m in from the cave entrance. Additionally, one sample of the modern topmost layer at the cave entrance near the stalagmite (Fig.
1
b–c) was taken for comparison. This location is within the fenced off archaeological research area not accessible to the public and was taken as a reference for the greater modern ecoregion. Excavation followed a high-resolution approach, excavating 0.25 × 0.25 m squares in 5 cm spits
13
. Samples were taken directly from the excavated sediment bucket during excavation and packaged in paper bags and aluminum foil. In the laboratory, samples were sieved in a 200 μm sieve and then homogenized by grinding in a mortar and pestle. 6 g of sediment from each sample was used for extraction of
n
-alkanes.
Extraction of
n
-alkanes
The sample preparation followed the protocol of the biomarker laboratory at Kiel University. The
n
-alkanes were extracted with an accelerated solvent extractor (ASE-200, Dionex) at 100 bar and 100˚C using a 9:1 (v = v) mixture of dichloromethane (DCM) and methanol. The
n
-alkanes were subsequently separated by silica gel column chromatography using activated silica gel and hexane.
n
-alkanes were further separated using silver nitrate (AgNO
3
) coated silica gel. Individual
n
-alkane homologues were identified with an Agilent 6890 N gas chromatograph equipped with a Restek XTI-5 capillary column (30 m x 320 μm x 0.25 μm) based on the comparison of their retention times with a standard containing the

of known concentration. This standard was used to calculate a calibration factor for quantification of the samples and was additionally measured at the start and end of every batch of six samples. All the samples were measured in triplicates.
n
-alkanes were quantified using the FID peak areas multiplied with the calibration factor of the standard and the original sample weight. The following GC-FID temperature program was used: the oven was maintained for 1 min at an initial temperature of 50 °C, then the temperature was increased to 300 °C (10 min hold) before a further increase to 330 °C (10 min hold). Infromation on the calculation of indices (ACL, CPI, OEP, Norm31, Norm33) can be found in the
supplementary information
.
Age model
We combined the previously modelled Wonderwerk radiocarbon dates from the Thackeray excavations
37
with the four new radiocarbon dates from Operation 5 published in
13
. Dates from Thackeray’s Strata 4d and 5a were excluded, as these layers were not part of this study and have not been investigated in the new excavation. OxCal v4.4
54
,
55
was used for Bayesian analysis to integrate the
14
C data with the Operation 5 stratigraphic information, using the ShCal20 curve for the Southern Hemisphere
56
. We used a Sequence model, with Boundaries between the archaeological strata (prior information), and Phases within the Boundaries (Dataset
S2
). A general
Outlier_model
with prior outlier probability set to 5%
57
was applied. The
Date
function was used to estimate the span of each strata, rather than using the modelled layer boundaries
37
. The modelled
14
C date ranges are presented at 95.4% probability (approximately equivalent to 2σ uncertainty) and the ages are given in cal BP. See the Dataset
S2
for the Model Code.
Stable isotope measurements
Terrestrial-sourced
n
-alkane homologues of sufficient concentration (i.e.
n
-C
27
,
n

29
,
n
-C
31
, and
n
-C
33
) were analysed using gas chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-IRMS) for δD and δ
13
C at the Leibniz Laboratory for Radiometric Dating and Stable Isotope Research at Kiel University. Samples were measured on an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a Gerstel KAS 4 PTV injector and an Agilent DB-5 capillary column (30 m x 250 μm x 0.25 μm) coupled to a Thermo Scientific MAT 253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS). Following GC temperature program was used for analyzing carbon isotopes: 50 °C for 5 min, with 20 °C/min to 325 °C, 325 °C for 18 min and those for hydrogen isotopes was: 50 °C for 5 min, with 40 °C/min to 240 °C, with 20 °C/min to 280 °C, with 10 °C/min to 325 °C, 325 °C for 20 min. Depending on the
n
-alkane concentration, between 0.3 and 1.0 µl and between 5.0 and 10.0 µl of each sample for δ
13
C and δD, respectively has been injected 2–4 times in order to achieve a statistically robust analytical error for each
n
-alkane homologue. To allow large volume injections (LVI), the injector was used in solvent vent mode. The H3 + factor during the measurement period of seven days was 10.33±0.11 ppm/nA (
n
= 7). The δD and δ
13
C values are reported relative to Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (‰ VSMOW) based on Arndt Schimmelmann’s A6 reference mixture from 2015 and Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (‰ VPDB) scales using Arndt Schimmelmann’s A7 reference mixture from 2017, respectively. Statistical tests were run with PAST4.16c
