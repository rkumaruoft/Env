Abstract
Rapid temperature flips are sudden shifts from extreme warm to cold or vice versa–both challenge humans and ecosystems by leaving a very short time to mitigate two contrasting extremes, but are yet to be understood. Here, we provide a global assessment of rapid temperature flips from 1961 to 2100. Warm-to-cold flips favorably follow wetter and cloudier conditions, while cold-to-warm flips exhibit an opposite feature. Of the global areas defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, over 60% have experienced more frequent, intense, and rapid flips since 1961, and this trend will expand to most areas in the future. During 2071–2100 under SSP5-8.5, we detect increases of 6.73–8.03% in flip frequency (relative to 1961–1990), 7.16–7.32% increases in intensity, and 2.47–3.24% decreases in transition duration. Global population exposure will increase over onefold, which is exacerbated in low-income countries (4.08–6.49 times above the global average). Our findings underscore the urgency to understand and mitigate the accelerating hazard flips under global warming.

Compared with independent extreme warm or cold events, rapid temperature flips–a sudden shift in temperature from extreme warm to opposite extreme cold or vice versa–allow a very short time for human and ecosystem preparedness to respond and adapt.

This knowledge gap is of considerable concern given the high vulnerability of human, animal, and plant health to sudden flips in temperature extremes under climate change.
Rapid temperature flips have occurred worldwide and have caused disruptive impacts on humans and the environment

10
. Notable examples of warm-to-cold flips include a March 2012 event in North America, which experienced a temperature drop from ~10 °C above the normal to 5 °C below the normal in less than a week, leading to premature crop blossoming in ‘false spring’ and subsequent damage by an anomalous cold spell
11
,
12
. In September 2020, the Rocky Mountains in North America faced a sudden transition from a severe heatwave to a heavy blanket of snow with a drop of >20 °C within a day, leading to power outages, property damage, and disrupted daily life
13
,
14
. Outside North America, Europe experienced a significant flip in April 2021, when temperatures swung from warm to cold conditions, leading to widespread frost damage to crops
15
. These high-impact disaster incidents underline the urgent need to establish a comprehensive understanding of the rapid flips between two contrasting hazards, which remain poorly understood.
Here, we investigate the changes in temperature flip events as the climate warms using multiple observations and a suite of climate simulations in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6, see Methods). We present their global patterns and possible associated processes in observations during 1961–2023. We then estimate the long-term trends in their occurrence frequency, intensity, and transition duration since 1961, and project the future changes until the end of the twenty-first century under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). We show how these trends vary over different Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report (IPCC AR6) climate reference regions
16
. To explore the impact of temperature flips, we also estimate how population exposure to temperature flip changes varies across different countries and income levels. The results advance our knowledge of understanding sudden and intense weather shifts and highlight the imperative of assessing the full risks of extreme events in a warming world.
Results
Global patterns of rapid temperature flip occurrences
We start with examining the global patterns of the occurrence frequency, intensity, and transition duration of warm-to-cold and cold-to-warm flip events displayed in Fig.
1
. A warm-to-cold flip is identified when temperature shifts from one standard deviation (
s.d
.) above to below the mean temperature within five days, and vice versa for a cold-to-warm flip (Fig.
1a, b
and see Methods for details). Using different temporal intervals (3, 5, and 7 days; compare Fig.
1c–h
and Supplementary Figs.
1
–
2
) and temperature thresholds (1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 s.d.; compare Fig.
1c–h
and Supplementary Figs.
3
–
5
) to define rapid flips yields similar results, demonstrating the robustness of our findings. Different datasets (i.e., ERA5
17
, Berkeley Earth
18
, and NCEP
19
) yield consistent latitudinal and seasonal patterns in the occurrence characteristics of temperature flips (Fig.
1c–h
). While temperature flips tend to occur less frequently in lower latitudes (30°S–30°N) and polar regions, they occur much more frequently in mid-latitudes (around 30°S–60°S and 30°N–60°N), such as East Asia, eastern North America, and southern parts of South America, Africa, and Australia (Fig.
1c, d
). This is expected since stronger synoptic variations in mid-latitudes are associated with eddy activities and frontal systems, which occasionally bring cold air masses from high latitudes and warm air masses from low latitudes
20
, thereby causing more frequent abrupt temperature changes in these regions. Rossby waves also play an important role in the temperature variabilities over mid-latitudes
21
. The areas with more frequent flip events tend to have relatively stronger intensity, which is especially evident in East Asia and South America (Fig.
1e, f
). Different from the occurrence frequency and intensity, the transition duration of the flip events is shorter in the mid-latitudes of both hemispheres, indicating a more rapid warm-to-cold or cold-to-warm shift in these regions (Fig.
1g, h
). Among different seasons, warm-to-cold flips are generally more frequent and more intense in the March-April-May (MAM) and June-July-August (JJA) seasons, with the shortest transition duration observed in JJA. During the December-January-February (DJF) season, these warm-to-cold flips exhibit a lower frequency and smaller intensity but have a longer transition duration. For cold-to-warm flips, there are fewer seasonal differences, although they tend to have a lower frequency in DJF.

Processes of rapid temperature flip occurrences
To show how warm-to-cold and cold-to-warm flip events occur, we first reveal the local physical processes underlying their occurrences (Fig.
2
). Specifically, we compare the composite anomalies of relevant variables between flip and non-flip events (i.e., either warm or cold events that do not flip to the opposite extremes) for each grid cell (Supplementary Fig.
6
), and then examine the evolution of the composite anomalies of these variables during temperature flip events (Supplementary Fig.
7
). In comparison to non-flip warm events, the warm events that flip to cold are featured with weaker increases in temperature, slighter decreases in relative humidity, and larger increases in cloud cover (Supplementary Fig.
6
). Increased clouds lead to weaker net solar radiation reaching the surface, thus providing a beneficial environment for cooling in the coming days. Under a continuously cloudy and humid sky, this cooling during the transition of warm-to-cold flips is also associated with stronger increases in soil moisture (Supplementary Fig.
7
). This increase is likely result of reduced evapotranspiration due to persistent cloud cover and high humidity during the warm phase of the warm-to-cold flip event
22
. These changes collectively reduce surface temperatures, contributing to a rapid flip from anomalously warm to cold conditions. During the cold state of the cold-to-warm flip events, the changes in these variables exhibit approximately opposite patterns to those for warm-to-cold flips (Supplementary Figs.
6
–
7
). Compared with non-flip cold events, the cold events that flip to warm typically exhibit weaker decreases in temperature and decreased relative humidity and cloud cover, which allow more solar radiation to reach the surface. Under a clearer and drier sky, reductions in atmospheric humidity and soil moisture weaken evaporative cooling via land-atmosphere interactions
23
. While the impact of soil moisture is less pronounced during winter (Supplementary Figs.
8
–
11
), it still plays a role in influencing temperature flips in regions where soil moisture remains unfrozen. Additionally, reduced cloud cover allows more solar radiation to reach the surface during the day, collectively facilitating the transition from cold to warm conditions. A conceptual diagram summarizing the local physical processes associated with typical temperature flips is shown in Fig.
2
.

The diagram summarizes the local physical processes underlying the warm-to-cold (

) events. The blue downward arrow indicates a decrease, and the red upward arrow indicates an increase. Examined variables include shortwave radiation (SWR), longwave radiation (LWR), sensible heat flux (SHF), latent heat flux (LHF), 2-m near-surface air temperature (Ta), total cloud cover (TCC), relative humidity (RH), and soil moisture (SM).

Further, we explore large-scale atmospheric circulation affecting temperature flip events by taking eastern North America (there are 168 warm-to-cold and 157 cold-to-warm flip events in 1961–2023), northern China, central South America, and southeastern Australia as examples (Supplementary Figs.
12
–
15
). These regions are among those where both warm-to-cold and cold-to-warm flips occur most frequently (Fig.
1c–h
). The evolution of temperature flip events in these regions is primarily under the control of a wave-like train pattern with low- and high-pressure centers alternatively appearing in mid-latitudes. For example, before the occurrence of warm-to-cold flip in eastern North America (Supplementary Fig.
12
), this region is dominated by anomalous high pressure and anticyclones, allowing warm conditions to persist. The high pressure over eastern North America coincides with low-pressure anomalies over western United States and western Atlantic, showing a zonal wave-like pattern. This wave pattern moves eastward and intensifies. Later, during the transition period, the low-pressure center dominates eastern North America and produces cold advection, thereby triggering a warm-to-cold flip event there. In comparison, cold-to-warm flips in eastern North America are characterized by opposite atmospheric circulation configurations to warm-to-cold flips. For both flip types in this region, the associated circulation configurations exhibit a generally consistent sign across different seasons (Supplementary Figs.
16
–
17
). Similar patterns are observed in northern China (Supplementary Fig.
13
and ref.
24
), central South America (Supplementary Fig.
14
), and southeastern Australia (Supplementary Fig.
15
), suggesting that such wave-like train patterns play a consistently crucial role in temperature flips across these regions. Considering that temperature flips in other regions may be affected by different atmospheric circulation systems, further analyzes of the large-scale circulation influencing specific regions may still be required.
Historical changes of rapid temperature flips
During 1961–2023 (Fig.
3
), the global mean occurrence frequency and intensity of warm-to-cold and cold-to-warm flip events have significant increasing trends (
p
values < 0.05), while their transition duration has been decreasing (−0. 11 and −0.08 days per century,
p
values < 0.05). These trends suggest that the two types of temperature flips have already become more frequent, more intense, and more rapid. Of the global areas defined by IPCC AR6, over 60% have experienced increasing, intensifying, and accelerating flip events since 1961. An extended examination based on the NOAA-CIRES-DOE 20th Century Reanalysis Version 3 dataset
25
implies that these intensifications of temperature flips have occurred as early as the early 20th century, and may have accelerated since the late 20th century (Supplementary Figs.
18
–
19
).

The global acceleration of warm-to-cold (cold-to-warm) flips over the past six decades is associated with regional transition duration decreases over 78% (65%) of the IPCC AR6 regions, notably for the significant decreases (
p
-values < 0.1) over the tropics and subtropics such as South America, West Europe, Africa, and South and Southeast Asia (Fig.
3e, f
), which typically have stronger increases in the occurrence frequency and intensity for both types of flips (Fig.
3a–d
). This result is generally consistent with earlier findings, which reported significant increases in temperature variability over the tropics
26
. The increased tropical temperature flips are likely related to soil drying
27
, enhanced atmosphere variability
28
, and tropical deforestation
29
, which can decrease the surface roughness, thus elevating near-surface wind, enhancing the advection of warm or cold air masses, and facilitating more intense temperature variability
30
. Densely populated regions (notably in South and Southeast Asia) have become increasingly exposed to more volatile temperatures, reinforcing the urgent need to mitigate the impacts of sudden and intense flips. There are also regions with decreasing frequency of temperature flips, mainly in polar and cold zones (such as parts of the Arctic and northwestern North America). This is likely connected to a reduced meridional temperature gradient and melting sea ice due to the Arctic amplification under global warming
28
,
31
. As the temperature gradient weakens, the differences in temperature of incoming air masses between the north and the south are expected to decrease, causing smaller local temperature variability
28
,
32
.
Projected future changes of rapid temperature flips
We now investigate future temperature flip changes projected by CMIP6 models, which can reproduce flip events both in historical climatology (compare Supplementary Fig.
20
and Fig.
1c–h
) and trend patterns (compare Supplementary Figs.
21
–
23
and Fig.
3
). The projected increases in the frequency and intensity of temperature flips, alongside decreases in their transition duration, tend to continue by the end of the twenty-first century (Fig.
4
). Under a high emission scenario (SSP5-8.5) during the far future period (2071–2100), the multi-model ensemble mean projects that global mean frequency (Fig.
4a, b
) of warm-to-cold events will increase by 8.03% ± 5.15% (“±” denotes the uncertainty of the ensemble mean measured by half of the inter-model standard deviation, following refs.
33
,
34
), and cold-to-warm flips by 6.73% ± 6.44%, relative to historical simulations over the baseline period (1961–1990). The intensity is expected to rise by 7.32% ± 1.47% and 7.16% ± 1.72% for warm-to-cold and cold-to-warm flips, respectively (Fig.
4c, d
). Additionally, the transition duration of these events is anticipated to be shortened by 3.24% ± 0.55% and 2.47% ± 0.68%, respectively (Fig.
4e, f
). Under SSP5-8.5 from 2023 to 2100, future projections show significant shortening trends (
p
value < 0.1) in the transition duration of temperature flips over nearly all IPCC AR6 regions (95.65% and 89.13% for warm-to-cold and cold-to-warm flips, respectively; see Fig.
4g, h
), with dramatic increases in the occurrence frequency and intensity (Supplementary Fig.
24
). Some tropical regions with relatively higher vulnerability and poorer resilience such as Latin American countries are expected to experience even more severe threats from intensifying temperature flips, while there are some weakening temperature flips in high latitudes which may offset the estimated global mean. Our projections of increasing temperature flip risks under SSP5-8.5 may be conservative, as reported by refs.
35
,
36
,
37
that CMIP6 models may underestimate the magnitude of changes in temperature variabilities. In contrast to SSP5-8.5, the increases in frequency and intensity, and decreases in the transition duration of temperature flips under moderate or low scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP1-2.6) would be substantially reduced in most areas (Fig.
4i, j
and Supplementary Fig.
24
). This signifies a substantial difference in the risk of future temperature flips contingent on our efforts to reduce carbon emissions.

Increasing, intensifying, and accelerating temperature flips under climate warming may be facilitated by long-term changes in both large-scale atmospheric circulations and local land-atmosphere interactions. For example, the occurrences of extreme warm and cold events, and their flips as shown in our above analyzes, have been linked to the amplitude and phase of the Rossby waves and jet streams
38
,
39
. In response to global warming, the Rossby wave amplitudes have been projected to intensify, and the jet streams will become wavier
40
, which can intensify temperature variability and potentially facilitate the rapid flips between cold and warm events. By taking eastern North America as an example, here we compare the circulation changes associated with temperature flips between the historical baseline period and the far future period (2071–2100) under the SSP5-8.5 scenario (Supplementary Figs.
25
–
27
). The comparison indicates that the large-scale circulation patterns associated with temperature flips in eastern North America in the future are similar to those in the historical period, suggesting that atmospheric circulation dynamically drives the occurrence of temperature flips in eastern North America. Notably, the positive and negative circulation anomalies are much stronger in the future projections, implying a potentially greater intensity and wider impact of temperature flips. These projected changes in atmospheric circulation patterns, as evidenced by our analyzes in eastern North America, support the physical plausibility of increased temperature flip events under future warming scenarios. Moreover, local land-atmosphere interactions such as changes in soil moisture, snowpack, and vegetation cover may contribute to intensifying temperature flips by modulating mass and energy fluxes to the atmosphere
30
,
41
,
42
. Climate warming is expected to exacerbate soil moisture deficit in some areas
43
,
44
, which can intensify temperature variability via increasing the effects of surface heat fluxes
27
,
38
. As the climate warms, diminishing snow may also cause stronger variations of atmospheric diabatic heating
45
,
46
, thereby favoring rapid temperature changes. Besides, extensive deforestation not only increases greenhouse gas concentrations but also decreases the surface roughness thus elevating near-surface wind
47
,
48
, which can enhance the advection of warm or cold air masses, thus facilitating rapid temperature changes and increasing the likelihood of temperature flips.
Escalating threats of rapid temperature flips
Due to limited time to adapt to rapid temperature shifts, rapid warm-to-cold and cold-to-warm flip events are likely to amplify the negative consequences of independent warm and cold events on societal and natural systems. Projected changes in exposure to future temperature flips are a key component of understanding their potential vulnerability and, therefore, critical to adequate planning and mitigation. Here we provide projections of population exposure to temperature flips under different scenarios (Fig.
5
; see Methods for details). During 2000, the annual global average population exposure to temperature flips was 15.98 billion person-events. By the end of the twenty-first century (2071–2100), the exposure is expected to increase to 34.67 (24.37) billion person-events under SSP3-7.0 (SSP5-8.5), representing a 116.92% ± 14.58% (52.90% ± 10.22%) increase relative to the historical period (Fig.
5a, b
). However, the increase in exposure will be limited to 21.94% ± 5.58% under SSP1-2.6, suggesting that the mitigation pathway of SSP1-2.6 is helpful in ameliorating the increase in temperature flips and their impacts.

There are notable disparities in projected population exposure across different countries and income levels (Fig.
5b, c
). Specifically, low-income countries are expected to experience the greatest increase in exposure (4.08–6.49 times above the global average), followed by lower-middle-income countries (0.85–1.29 times above the global average) under all scenarios. Except for high-income countries, poorer countries will experience the largest increases in population exposure under SSP3-7.0, especially for low-income (SSA-L: 590.39% ± 66.34%) and mid-income sub-Saharan Africa (SSA-M: 505.69% ± 89.74%), and low-income Latin American countries (LAM-L: 387.96% ± 78.09%). In comparison, the changes in population exposure in most high-income countries under SSP3-7.0 are smaller than the global level, except for Saudi Arabia and high-income Middle Eastern countries (MEA-H: 412.24% ± 23.37%, i.e., 3.53 times above the global average).
The comparison between different income levels shows uneven population exposure to the intensification and acceleration of temperature flip risks across developing and developed countries in a warming climate. Developing countries with large populations, especially those in low-income countries, are particularly vulnerable to higher exposure increases, which raises substantial concerns for human health and the human-managed environment. These countries typically with relatively poor infrastructure and resilience, thereby may not have sufficient resources and preparedness to mitigate escalating threats of rapid temperature flips

. Compared with other hazards, rapid temperature flips, by leaving a very short time to respond and adapt, may amplify the resultant impacts on natural and societal systems. If adaptive capacity in these countries does not keep pace with the intensifying abrupt flips between warm and cold conditions, it may exert heavier stress on the human body and even elevate the risks of morbidity and mortality, especially for vulnerable groups such as the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions
50
,
51
. This is particularly severe in low-income or high-poverty regions such as Africa and South Asia, where ecosystems and societies are more susceptible to intense and rapid temperature flips (Fig.
5c
)
28
.
Climate change leads to more frequent and more severe temperature flips, such as warm winter days followed by sudden cold snaps can cause unpredictable energy demands for heating, thereby increasing unevenly across different income-level regions and elevating the risks of energy shortages in some low-income regions
52
. These issues would be exacerbated if no effective measures were taken to tackle the escalating threats of temperature flips. This is particularly severe for low-income regions, which usually have vulnerable infrastructures of insufficient adaptivity and resilience to mitigate increasing threats from temperature flips. We notice that rapid flips from warm to cooler conditions in some regions can alleviate heat stress, thereby mitigating some of the negative impacts associated with prolonged heat waves. However, our study emphasizes the potential risks of abrupt and sudden temperature flips (that is, from extreme warm to extreme cold conditions) rather than general temperature changes. While there may be scenarios where a cooler phase could be beneficial, the emphasis on the rapid transition highlights the danger of not being able to adapt quickly enough to the shifting conditions. For instance, empirical evidence shows that sudden temperature drops in neighboring days are potential modifiable risk factors of asthma exacerbation, especially for patients with higher body mass index
53
. Rapid and intense temperature drops can also cause strain on energy systems due to sudden heating demands, and challenges in agricultural crops that may be damaged by unexpected frost

.
Implications for climate change mitigation
The responses of societal and natural systems to accelerating temperature flips can be variable, which raises new challenges for forecast and prediction. Accurate forecasts of rapid temperature flips require further investigations into location-specific driving factors, underlying mechanisms, and synoptic circulation changes. For seasonal to annual scale of prediction, large-scale signals such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation
55
, North Atlantic Oscillation
56
, and Madden-Julian Oscillation
57
may provide sources of predictability. At a longer time scale, in addition to anthropogenic global climate warming, local urbanization and its associated land use and land cover changes may contribute to long-term trends of temperature variability and flips
58
,
59
, and thus can also be considered as a predictor. Early warning and accurate prediction of temperature flips can be highly beneficial for mitigating their impacts and managing their risks. Our research underscores the urgent need for constraining emissions to alleviate the intensification of these rapid temperature flips and thus to mitigate their resultant impacts. Moreover, our reported increases in the projected risks of increasing, intensifying, and accelerating temperature flips in the future suggest that such events would be unprecedented in the current modern era of mitigating infrastructure and call for a pressing need to construct and fortify effective infrastructure to adapt the communities to sudden hazard flips.
Methods
Observations and reanalysis
Our study utilizes daily mean temperature at 2 m height above the surface over the historical period (1961–2023) from three different global datasets, they are, the fifth-generation product produced by the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) global reanalysis (ERA5)
17
, the Berkeley Earth temperature dataset
18
, and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) reanalysis
19
. Daily temperatures from the ERA5, Berkeley Earth, and NCEP datasets are regridded into a resolution of 2.5 ° × 2.5 ° using bilinear interpolation for comparison. Three different datasets yield highly consistent climatological patterns in terms of both spatial (e.g., latitudinal) and temporal (e.g., seasonal) variations in temperature flip events (Fig.
1
and Supplementary Figs.
1
–
2
). We also identify temperature flips from the GHCN-daily gridded dataset (known as HadGHCND
60
) and find that their climatological patterns and long-term trends are generally consistent with those from the above-mentioned three datasets (compare Supplementary Figs.
28
–
29
and Fig.
1c–h
). Considering that HadGHCND has limited spatial coverage with large number of missing values in tropical regions and the Southern Hemisphere, we thereby present an ensemble analysis by averaging the results from three global full-coverage datasets, i.e., ERA5, Berkeley Earth, and NCEP datasets.
Model simulations
In addition, the projected changes in the characteristics of temperature flips during 1961–2100 are examined using daily temperature outputs from the simulations of 17 climate models participating in the Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) within the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6, see Supplementary Table
1
for details) project
61
. The temperature output over 1961–2014 utilizes the historical simulations, whereas the 2015–2100 period uses the future climate projection under various emission and socioeconomic scenarios represented by four Tier 1 experiments based on SSP-RCP scenarios, which are SSP1-2.6 (sustainability), SSP2-4.5 (middle of the road), SSP3-7.0 (regional rivalry), SSP5-8.5 (fossil-fueled development)
62
. For each model simulation, one realization is used in each experiment, as suggested by previous studies
63
. Daily temperatures in all climate model simulations are interpolated into a horizontal resolution of 2.5 ° × 2.5 ° by bilinear interpolation to match the observational data. For both historical simulation and future climate projections involving multiple models, we first calculate the metrics of the flip events separately for each model and then average these metrics of all participating models to yield a multi-model ensemble mean, with the uncertainty measured by half of the inter-model standard deviation
33
,
34
. This approach effectively mitigates the uncertainties from inter-model differences as it has been shown to outperform a single model in simulating
64
,
65
,
66
.
We evaluate historical climatological occurrences of rapid temperature flips in CMIP6 model simulations (Supplementary Fig.
20
). The evaluation suggests that the climatological patterns in model simulations exhibit a high consistency with those in observations and reanalysis (compare Fig.
1c–h
and Supplementary Fig.
S20
), with some inter-model spread comparable to the spread between multiple observations/reanalysis. Also, the evaluation of historical trends in temperature flip occurrences shows that CMIP6 models can reproduce historical trend patterns with increasing frequency, increasing intensity, and decreasing duration over most IPCC AR6 climate reference regions (Supplementary Figs.
21
–
23
). These evaluations demonstrate a strong robustness of simulating temperature flips by CMIP6 models. The uncertainty of the multi-model ensemble mean is represented by half of the standard deviation
67
.
Identification of rapid temperature flips
A temperature flip event is defined as a short period in which temperature suddenly shifts from extreme warm to extreme cold (warm-to-cold flip) or from cold to warm (cold-to-warm flip) (Fig.
1a, b
). The flip events are identified separately for each grid cell. In particular, extreme warm (cold) events at a grid cell are first identified when the five-day mean temperature is greater (smaller) than the climatological average by one standard deviation (
s
.
d
.) of the data series. Then, a warm-to-cold flip is detected if an extreme warm event is followed by a cold event within five days, and vice versa for a cold-to-warm flip. We also use three and seven days to define the time period and find that different intervals yield similar results (Supplementary Figs.
S1
–
S2
). Similarly, using different thresholds (1.0 s.d., 1.5 s.d., and 2.0 s.d.) to define extreme events also yields robust results (Supplementary Figs.
S3
–
S5
).
To exclude the effects of long-term climate warming on the detection of temperature flip events, we first detrend the original daily temperature time series using a third-degree polynomial fitting method. This detrending process is applied to a 31-day rolling window for each grid cell to separate the inter-seasonal variability, that is, the season-dependent climatological average of temperature can be separated. Based on the detrended temperature data, we calculate the standard deviation (s.d.), which mainly reflects the natural variability of the climate without (or with a little) the influence of long-term trends
68
,
69
,
70
. Moreover, considering that the temperature s.d. may also vary across different seasons, the season-dependent s.d. on each calendar day is individually calculated by applying a 31-day rolling window. The above processing and the identification of the flip events are repetitively applied to all global land grid cells.
In practice, for each grid cell, let
\({T}^{\left(i\right)}\)
be the detrended five-day temperature centered on day
\(i\)
,
\({T}_{m}^{\left(i\right)}\)
be the multi-year (1961–2023) climatological mean of the temperatures on the same calendar day that day
\(i\)
is located in; and
\({T}_{s.d.}^{\left(i\right)}\)
be the corresponding standard deviation. A warm event occurs on day
\(i\)
if
\({T}^{\left(i\right)} \, > \, {T}_{m}^{\left(i\right)}+{T}_{s.d.}^{\left(i\right)}\)
and is marked as “+1”; a cold event occurs on day
\(i\)
if
\({T}^{\left(i\right)} \, < \, \, {T}_{m}^{\left(i\right)}-{T}_{s.d.}^{\left(i\right)}\)
and is marked as “–1”; and other conditions are marked as “0”:
$${E}^{\left(i\right)}=\left\{\begin{array}{l}+1,\hfill {T}^{\left(i\right)} \, > \, {T}_{m}^{\left(i\right)}+{T}_{s.d.}^{\left(i\right)}\\ -1,\hfill {T}^{\left(i\right)} \, < \, {T}_{m}^{\left(i\right)}-{T}_{s.d.}^{\left(i\right)}\\ 0,\quad {{ else}}\hfill\end{array}\right.$$
(1)
Using this screening, the temperature time series at each grid cell is converted into a sequence of “0”, “–1”, and “+1”. A warm-to-cold flip is then identified at the grid between day
\(i\)
and day
\(j\)
if
$$\left({E}^{\left(i\right)}=+ 1\right)\wedge \left({E}^{\left(j\right)}=-1\right);\, \,j=\min \left\{{j}^{{\prime} } | \, {E}^{\left({j}^{{\prime} }\right)}=-1,i \, \, < \, \, {j}^{{\prime} } \, \, < \, \, i+\tau \right\}$$
(2)
and a cold-to-warm flip event is identified if
$$\left({E}^{\left(i\right)}=-1\right)\wedge \left({E}^{\left(j\right)}=+ 1\right);\, \, j=\min \left\{{j}^{{\prime} } | \,{E}^{\left({j}^{{\prime} }\right)}=+ 1,i \, \, < \, \, {j}^{{\prime} } \, \, < \, \, i+\tau \right\}$$
(3)
where
\(\tau\)
denotes the temporal interval (such as 5 days).
We examine the occurrence frequency, intensity, and transition duration of temperature flips (Fig.
1a, b
). The occurrence frequency at a grid cell is defined as the total number of temperature flip events that occur at the same grid in a given period of time (e.g., a calendar year or a season). For each warm-to-cold (cold-to-warm) event, the transition duration is the time interval from the last day of the preceding warm (cold) event to the first day of the following cold (warm) event. The intensity of a warm-to-cold (cold-to-warm) event is defined as the absolute value of the difference in the standardized temperature between the warmest and coldest days of the flip event, and has a unit of s.d. Here, we use the standardized temperature to exclude the influences of regional discrepancies in the temperature variability, which is usually measured by s.d.
Population exposure estimation
For a given year, population exposure to temperature flips is calculated by multiplying the population count in each grid by the number of temperature flip events (the sum of cold-to-warm and warm-to-cold flip occurrences) for each corresponding grid cell during the same year with the following equation, and is thus expressed in the unit of person-events
71
:
$${{Exp}}_{g,y}={P}_{g,y}\times {E}_{g,y}$$
(4)
where
\({P}_{g,y}\)
and
\({E}_{g,y}\)
respectively denote the population count and the number of temperature flip events at grid cell
\(g\)
in year
\(y\)
, and
\({{Exp}}_{g,y}\)
represents the population exposure in flips at the same grid cell
\(g\)
in year
\(y\)
.
We then compare the disparities in population exposure to temperature flips at regional levels, which include 30 different macro-regions (Supplementary Fig.
30
). The region definition is modified from the regions used in the SSPs database (
https://tntcat.iiasa.ac.at/SspDb/dsd
)
72
. These macro-regions can be divided into four income levels (i.e., high-income, upper middle-income, lower middle-income, and low-income)
72
. The population exposures in each macro and income-level region are aggregated by exposures in temperature flips from grid cells located in the corresponding region. Here, the gridded population data are obtained from the SSPs database covering the period from 2000 to 2100 at a 10-year interval, with a spatial resolution of 1/8 °
73
,
74
. The historical population count is replaced by population data from the base year of 2000, and the future population projections are retrieved from the corresponding scenario. To match the temperature flip events data, we aggregate the gridded population counts to 2.5 ° × 2.5 ° spatial resolution.
Composite analysis
The possible processes associated with temperature flips are examined by the composite analysis method, and its statistical significance is estimated based on a two-tailed Student’s
t
-test. The variables used here include 2-m near-surface air temperature, total cloud cover, relative humidity, soil moisture, surface shortwave and longwave radiations, and surface latent and sensible heat fluxes. In the composite analysis, we first obtain the daily anomalies of each variable by removing the climatological seasonal cycle from the original daily series. The seasonal cycle is obtained from the multi-year averaging on individual calendar days over the baseline period of 1961–1990 and then performing a 31-day rolling mean
75
,
76
.
To reveal the mechanisms underlying the temperature flips, we conduct two composite analyzes. The first compares the atmospheric conditions between flip and non-flip events, where non-flip events refer to either warm or cold events that do not flip to the opposite extremes. We examine the composite anomalies of relevant atmospheric variables on the last day of the warm (or cold) event for both warm-to-cold (or cold-to-warm) flip and non-flip events. This comparison highlights the differences in pre-existing atmospheric conditions that may influence whether a temperature flip occurs (Supplementary Fig.
6
). The second analysis focuses on the evolution of atmospheric conditions during flip events by examining anomalies throughout the transition phase of the flips, which is defined as the period from the last day of the preceding warm (or cold) event to the first day of the following cold (or warm) event. This analysis allows identification of the key physical processes governing temperature flips (Supplementary Fig.
7
).
Trend estimation
We utilize the simple linear regression to estimate the long-term trends of the occurrence frequency, intensity, and transition duration of temperature flip events, and the significance of the trend is evaluated by a modified non-parametric Mann–Kendall test
77
. The trend estimation can be applied to the yearly metrics at individual grid cells and to the area-weighted mean metrics of specific regions, such as IPCC AR6 climate reference regions (Supplementary Table
2
)
