Nature is Infrastructure: How to Include Natural Assets  
in Asset Management Plans
Purpose
As natural asset management is a relatively new practice, standard terms and 
approaches for its integration into municipal asset management frameworks 
(which were originally designed exclusively for built assets) are still evolving. 
However, there are key terms that have become widely adopted by natural asset 
practitioners and have been used for this project. The purpose of this guidance 
document is to align natural asset management with approaches and practices 
already in place for built assets while (a) using the most current and widely 
adopted lexicon for natural assets, and (b) recognizing that natural assets have 
some unique attributes and functions (e.g., much longer or indefinite lifecycles) 
that do not always allow them to fit neatly into the same “boxes” as built assets.
1 	Introduction
Local governments across Canada have been using asset management 
processes to manage their built assets for decades. Recently, the importance 
of incorporating natural assets (e.g., wetlands, forests, grasslands, meadows, 
or watercourses) into similar management frameworks has been recognized 
because, like built assets, natural assets represent a critical part of a 
community’s infrastructure and need to be accounted for and managed 
proactively. 
As articulated by the Canadian Standards Association in CSA W218:23 
Specifications for natural asset inventories, natural assets “provide or contribute 
to the delivery of ecosystem services.” In many cases, these ecosystem services 
contribute to the improvement of public services such as through the provision 
of clean drinking water, improved air quality, and flood control, as well as added 
benefits such as recreation and greenspace. Recognizing natural assets and 
the range of services they provide to local governments and their residents 
is essential to ensure these assets are effectively managed and that the vital 
services they provide do not deteriorate. As with built assets, having in place a 
natural asset management plan is essential to ensure a sustainable long-term 
supply of critical ecosystem services. The Ontario government recognizes that 
having a general understanding of the services and the benefits provided by 
natural assets is an important consideration for asset management.1 Ontario 
is the only jurisdiction in Canada that officially requires natural assets to be 
accounted for in asset management plans through its asset management 
regulation, O. Reg. 588/17 (see Section 1.2.1). 
This guidance document provides direction and insight for local governments 
who are seeking to undertake natural asset management. An asset management 
plan is a plan for managing a local government’s assets to deliver an agreed 
standard of service. The purpose of such a plan is to make explicit the costs 
1    CSA (2023) provides additional information on the role of ecosystem services and how they 
can inform natural asset management.

and benefits associated with service delivery and to manage such costs 
appropriately, while also adequately addressing and handling any associated 
risks. An asset management plan is distinct from a conservation management 
plan, which may address some of the same natural areas. Appendix A contains a 
comparison of natural asset management plans and conservation management 
plans. 
Each section of the guidance document outlines a key component of an 
asset management plan, which taken together results in a complete asset 
management plan for natural assets, as follows:
	
 Section 2 provides direction on how to document the state of natural 
assets by undertaking an asset inventory and condition assessment and 
establishing replacement costs for natural assets.
	
 Section 3 identifies and assesses the range of risks that natural assets 
are vulnerable to. 
	
 Section 4 provides guidance on how to establish levels of service for 
natural assets.
	
 Section 5 considers the process for articulating lifecycle management 
strategies.
	
 Section 6 documents financial strategies to support the lifecycle 
management strategies.
	
 Section 7 summarizes common funding sources for natural asset 
management. 
The remainder of this section (Section 1) explores the terminology relevant 
to natural assets, and describes existing regulations and standards. It also 
identifies the unique attributes of natural assets that are important to consider 
while developing a holistic asset management plan.
1.1	 Key Terms and Definitions
As articulated in CSA (2023), “assets exist on a continuum from engineered to 
enhanced to natural. Typically, asset managers focus on engineered assets. 
However, a more comprehensive approach to public sector asset management 
would expand the [application] to include nature for the valuable services 
they provide.” Figure 1 demonstrates the types of assets that may be managed 
by a local government, including green and grey infrastructure, all of which 
interact with each other. Figure 1 also demonstrates relationships between 
terms commonly used when referring to green infrastructure (GI). The figure 
distinguishes between three sub-types of GI (natural assets, enhanced assets, 
and engineered assets) with examples of each. It also shows how these different 
assets align with other commonly used terms such as low impact development 
(LID) and nature-based solutions (NbS).

These terms are defined in more detail below to help distinguish the range 
of possible infrastructure solutions between completely engineered and 
completely natural. The cited text is from the Canadian Council of Ministers of 
the Environment (CCME, 2021, pp. 3-8) unless otherwise noted.
	
 Infrastructure “refers to the managed elements of interrelated systems 
that provide goods and services essential to enabling, sustaining or 
enhancing the living conditions of human communities.”
	
 Grey infrastructure “refers to engineered assets made exclusively of 
materials such as concrete and steel […] including bridges, dams, water 
treatment plants, culverts, ditches, and storm drains”.
	y “Grey infrastructure elements are generally designed for singular 
purposes, and although considerable expertise has accrued over 
time on best practices for their design and management, they 
are not highly adaptable to changing conditions such as extreme 
precipitation events and have a limited lifespan” (Sutton-Grier et al., 
2015, as cited in CCME, 2021).
	y “Further to this, grey infrastructure has a large carbon footprint given 
the emissions associated with manufacturing concrete and steel 
structures” (Bataille, 2019, as cited in CCME, 2021).

provide society with a multitude of economic, environmental, and social 
outcomes… At present, green infrastructure is still strongly associated 
with the planning philosophy of LID and technologies that support the 
ecological and hydrological processes needed to manage rain- and 
stormwater in towns and cities.” Green infrastructure has three sub-
types of assets; from “most” to “least” engineered these are:
	y Engineered (green) assets are built or manufactured structures 
intended to mimic natural functions, particularly hydrologic 
functions, at the site-specific scale. They generally do not have 
a “green”/vegetated component. Examples include rain barrels, 
permeable pavement, and infiltration trenches.
	y Enhanced (green) assets incorporate “land, water and vegetation 
features alongside human-made elements to sustain ecosystem 
functions and services… the enhancement of conventional grey 
infrastructure (e.g., piped, ditch and culvert, dam and reservoir 
systems) with nature-based elements, [often] in order to achieve 
the active and everyday management of the full rainfall-runoff 
spectrum”. Examples include bioswales, green roofs, trees in built-
up areas with engineered rooting environments, and native topsoil 
added to developed areas (with grass and/or other groundcovers) for 
its water infiltration and retention capacity.
	y Natural assets/natural infrastructure “refers to the use of preserved, 
restored, or enhanced elements or combinations of vegetation and 
associated biology, land, water, and naturally occurring ecological 
processes to meet targeted infrastructure outcomes”. 
	
 Nature-based solutions or nature-based climate solutions “are 
measures that protect, restore and sustainably manage natural or 
modified ecosystems, with the aim of maintaining or enhancing the 
services provided to human communities and benefits to biodiversity.”
	y “[C]an be used in place of or in tandem with grey infrastructure to 
create a hybrid approach, to enhance resilience of the infrastructure 
asset, and provide many other co-benefits”. 
	y As illustrated in Figure 1, these include natural assets and enhanced 
assets, but exclude engineered assets that mimic natural functions 
but use grey infrastructure to do so.

1.2	 Existing Regulations and Standards
This subsection summarizes some of the existing regulations and standards that 
maybe helpful for local governments undertaking natural asset management. 
The focus is specifically on Canadian-based standards, with the intention being 
to build on the progressive work that has already been accomplished in Canada. 
1.2.1	 Ontario Regulation 588/17
In Ontario, Ontario Regulation 588/17 (Asset Management Planning for Municipal 
Infrastructure) under the Infrastructure for Jobs and Prosperity Act (2015), 
came into effect January 1, 2018. O. Reg. 588/17 made Ontario the first and 
currently only province in Canada to regulate asset management planning at the 
municipal level and to require consideration of both human-made and natural 
assets as part of this process. 
O. Reg. 588/17 requires all municipalities in Ontario to have a comprehensive 
asset management plan in place for all municipal infrastructure assets by July 
1st of 2024 for current levels of service, and July 1st of 2025 for proposed levels 
of service. 
The definition of what constitutes a municipal infrastructure asset for the 
purpose of O. Reg 588/17 includes green infrastructure, which comprises 
natural assets as well as other green infrastructure assets as per the following 
definition: 
Infrastructure asset consisting of natural or human-made elements that 
provide ecological and hydrological functions and processes and includes 
natural heritage features and systems, parklands, stormwater management 
systems, street trees, urban forests, natural channels, permeable surfaces, 
and green roofs. (O. Reg 588/17, 2021).
The following are the expectations of The Ontario Ministry of 
Infrastructure regarding compliance with O. Reg 588/17 with respect to 
natural assets:
	
 The goal of the Asset Management Planning for Municipal 
Infrastructure Regulation (O. Reg. 588/17) is to promote a 
greater degree of standardization and consistency, while 
providing flexibility for municipalities to create plans unique to 
their circumstances.
	
 Municipalities are to use recognized and generally accepted 
good engineering practices where appropriate and other 
industry best practices where applicable. 
This intent of this guidance document is to demonstrate existing good 
industry practices that can be followed by local governments to meet 
the O. Reg. 588/17 requirements.

1.2.2	 Standards 
In 2023, the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) released a voluntary standard 
for the specifications of natural asset inventories (CSA, 2023). This standard 
focuses on the creation of a natural asset inventory and provides high-level 
guidance on completing a condition assessment. It provides little guidance on 
risk identification or levels of service (both of which are components of an asset 
management plan and hence addressed in this Guidebook). Where appropriate, 
this Guidebook refers the reader to CSA (2023) for more details.
Local governments undertaking natural asset management can draw from a 
range of existing documents such as climate change plans, risk assessments, 
and conservation plans to inform their natural asset management plans. Some 
specific standards that may be helpful include:
	
 Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment:
	y Best Practices and Resources on Climate Resilient Natural 
Infrastructure (2018)
	y Natural Infrastructure Framework (2021) 
	
 International Organization for Standardization (ISO): 
	y 55000:2014 Asset Management – Overview, Principles and 
Terminology 
Appendix B provides a list of resources that can support the incorporation of 
natural assets into asset management plans.
1.3	 Uniqueness of Natural Assets
Natural assets have several unique features that make them an essential and 
important part of a local government’s asset management strategy. Some of 
these features also pose challenges when attempting to integrate natural assets 
into a traditional asset management plan. Below are key characteristics of 
natural assets, and the advantages and challenges they present. The following 
sections address how to deal with these differences when undertaking asset 
management for natural assets.
Irreplaceable: Unlike many built assets, natural assets can be irreplaceable and/
or take decades, if not centuries, to regenerate once depleted. Some features, 
like ancient forests or unique geological formations, are irreplaceable once lost, 
making their long-term preservation critical.
Complex Interactions: Natural assets are embedded within complex ecological 
systems with intricate interdependencies. Altering or mismanaging one 
component can have cascading effects on the entire ecosystem, which can 
disrupt not only the environment but also impact built infrastructure and human 
well-being. These complexities necessitate a holistic approach to natural asset 
management. They also speak to the challenge of defining the boundaries of 
natural assets (i.e., where one asset ‘ends’ and another starts).

GUIDEBOOK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS 
April 2024
Nature is Infrastructure: How to Include Natural Assets  
in Asset Management Plans
Climate Resilience: Many natural features can withstand a certain amount 
of stress and in many cases can “self-repair” when damaged, if the damage 
sustained is not too severe, and if the asset is not subject to a succession of 
stressors or already in poor condition. This is an advantage over built assets, 
which require regular maintenance and eventual replacement. However, 
cumulative effects and/or exposure to multiple stressors can cause even the 
most resilient natural assets to reach tipping points that can cause cascading or 
widespread failure of the asset’s function. 
No End of Useful Life: Most natural assets do not depreciate overtime or have 
an end of useful life. If left alone, undisturbed by human impacts, natural assets 
can exist indefinitely. However, in most contexts, natural assets experience some 
form of human impact. Natural assets in heavily populated regions are likely to 
experience various degrees of degradation. In such situations, their ability to 
provide services can be depreciated. This reinforces the need for natural assets 
to be considered a key part of a community’s asset management plan.
Provision of Multiple Service Benefits: Natural assets provide a wide array 
of ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration, recreation, and flood 
control. Furthermore, individual natural assets are capable of providing this 
array of benefits simultaneously. This is sometimes referred to as co-benefits 
or benefits stacking. The value proposition of leveraging natural assets to 
provide community services at lower costs than built assets is in part driven 
by their ability to simultaneously provide a range of services. While benefits 
stacking makes natural assets a compelling solution for community service 
delivery, it adds to the complexity of incorporating natural assets into an asset 
management plan in a consistent and useful way.
Long-term Benefits and Costs: Managing natural assets requires a long-term 
perspective due to their regenerative nature. While investments may not yield 
immediate returns, the benefits can be substantial in the form of ecosystem 
services, resilience against natural disasters, and enhanced quality of life. In 
fact, the value of some natural assets has been shown to appreciate in the face 
of climate change (MNAI, 2018). For example, wetlands may be able to handle 
extreme rainfall events thereby maintaining water quality and managing flood 
waters, making the assets more valuable in terms of their contribution to water 
management and disaster mitigation services. 
Data Discrepancies: Unlike conventional assets, natural assets are often not 
well-documented or easily quantified. Collecting and maintaining accurate 
data on these assets can be challenging, requiring specialized knowledge and 
methods.
Jurisdictional Boundaries: Natural assets often do not align with political 
boundaries, and the services provided are often provided by natural assets 
outside municipal or governance boundaries (e.g., drinking water provided 
by headwaters located well outside a municipal boundary as is the case with 
Calgary). This can be a challenge for asset management, but also an opportunity 
for collaboration.

Multiple Landowners: Many of the natural assets that provide ecosystem 
services to a community are, at least in part, located on privately-owned 
land and not under a local government’s direct control. Local governments 
must consider non-infrastructure solutions, such as policies, partnerships, 
stewardship programs, conservation easements or joint-management 
arrangements to achieve their desired levels of service for privately owned 
natural assets.
The Complexity of Natural Asset Management 
The service delivery context for natural asset management will be different 
for each local government. It is important for local governments to build an 
understanding of their own service delivery context when starting natural 
asset management. This will support them in identifying the key services they 
deliver that rely on natural assets, and the priority risks to those services. 
For example, the Comox Valley Regional District (CVRD) in British Columbia 
is responsible for delivering water services to the Town of Comox, the City of 
Courtenay, and K’Omoks First Nation. The majority of the drinking water comes 
from Lake Comox and maintaining the health of the watershed is critical to 
protect water quality and manage treatment costs. The Village of Cumberland 
is a neighbouring local government in the same watershed, and the creek 
system that runs through and around Cumberland directly impacts health 
of the watershed; however, the Village has opted to manage its own drinking 
water services and mostly relies on groundwater as opposed to drawing from 
Lake Comox. 
A big challenge for CVRD in providing water services is that it owns virtually 
none of the land in the watershed. A large majority of the land is owned by 
private forest companies; some is also owned by BC Parks. CVRD therefore 
needs to collaborate with all parties to manage water services effectively 
and sustainably. CVRD may need to tap into a whole suite of natural asset 
management activities to manage the costs and risks of water service 
delivery, including: working with all parties to collect and share data related 
to the ecological health of the watershed and ensure risks are managed; 
collaborating with neighbouring jurisdictions; supporting land stewardship 
programs or land securement (acquisition); and developing policies, 
covenants, or conservation easements to protect critical assets. To this end, 
CVRD chairs a watershed advisory group comprised of all relevant parties to 
sustain the health of the watershed.2

Intrinsic Value: Natural assets possess an intrinsic value that goes beyond what 
can be captured economically. This concept recognizes that nature has a right 
to exist and flourish, underscoring a moral and ethical responsibility to protect 
and preserve natural resources for the sake of the environment and all living 
creatures, regardless of their tangible benefits to humanity.
Indigenous Perspectives: Indigenous Peoples have been living in close 
relationship with the natural world for thousands of years. Their knowledge, 
skills, and values about the environment are crucial for effective natural asset 
management. Incorporating natural assets into municipal asset planning can be 
a catalyst for reconciliation if it results in working toward shared stewardship 
and ensuring that the cultural significance of natural assets is recognized, 
respected, and preserved. Not only is this desirable, but also necessary in 
our evolving legal context. Local governments will have to address the reality 
that Indigenous peoples’ inherent right of self-government and right to self-
determination will affect the management of some land and natural assets 
currently under local government jurisdiction. For example, land may fall outside 
of local government control or under shared decision-making arrangements.
2 	Establish the State of Natural 
Assets
This section summarizes the content that should be included in a state of 
natural assets report. The process can be described in five key steps:
1/	 Define the scope
2/	 Inventory natural assets
3/	 Conduct and incorporate a condition assessment
4/	 Establish replacement costs for natural assets
5/	 Summarize the results in a state of natural assets report
Each step is explored in more detail below. 
2.1	 Define the Scope
The first step in documenting the state of natural assets is to clearly define the 
scope of the inventory by specifying:
1/	 The assets to be included in the inventory
2/	 The geographic boundary of the inventory

2.1.1	 Scope the Assets
As articulated in Section 1.1, there is a spectrum of green infrastructure 
assets that may be included in an asset management plan. One of the first 
considerations is to decide what asset types will be included in the management 
plan. 
This Guidebook focuses specifically on natural assets; however, it can be 
advantageous to consider if, how, and when to address other types of green 
infrastructure. Possible components to include in a green infrastructure asset 
management plan include the range of asset classes described in Table 1.
Table 1: Potential Asset Classes for Green Infrastructure Asset Management Planning
ASSET CLASS
DESCRIPTION
Terrestrial Natural Assets This asset class captures the natural feature-based areas (e.g., woodlands, 
grasslands, wetlands, meadows, etc.). Assets can be subdivided into more 
detailed classes that might further support the management of the asset or 
components of the asset (e.g., deciduous forest stand, mixed forest stand, 
coniferous forest stands).
Watercourse Natural 
Assets
This asset class captures linear natural aquatic features (e.g., rivers and 
streams).
Waterbody Natural 
Assets
This asset class captures non-linear aquatic features including lakes and 
ponds.
Groundwater or Aquifer 
Natural Assets
This asset class applies to municipalities that rely on groundwater as their 
source of drinking water supply. 
Street and Park Tree 
Assets 
(Enhanced Green 
Infrastructure)
This asset class captures the individual street trees that are owned and 
managed by a local government. They are considered enhanced assets. 
Manicured Open Space 
Assets 
(Enhanced Green 
Infrastructure)
This asset class captures pervious surfaces owned and managed by a 
local government that typically require a higher degree of management 
and maintenance (e.g., mown turf or other landscape features). They are 
considered enhanced assets and include, for instance: 
•	 Active use and sports field open space
•	 Passive use open space
•	 Other mown turf
•	 Artificial beaches
•	 City owned golf courses
•	 Gardens
Low-impact Development 
(LID) Assets 
(Engineered or Enhanced 
Green Infrastructure)
This asset class captures engineered and enhanced assets related to LID such 
as: rain gardens, bioswales, permeable pavement, infiltration trenches, etc.
11
GUIDEBOOK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS 
April 2024
Nature is Infrastructure: How to Include Natural Assets  
in Asset Management Plans
For the purpose of creating an asset management plan, grouping assets into the 
classes identified above can be useful for two reasons:
1/	 The spatial data in a GIS (geographic information system) database 
varies by class. For instance, street and park trees are commonly 
represented as point features, watercourses are typically represented 
as linear features, and natural areas are typically represented as 
polygons.
2/	 Each grouping has unique ways of dealing with the various aspects of 
asset management (e.g., replacement cost, useful life, operations, and 
maintenance planning, etc.).
Practitioners should also consider if natural assets or green infrastructure assets 
are already included in a local government’s asset management plans. For 
example: 
	
 Naturalized stormwater management ponds may already be captured in 
a stormwater asset management plan; or
	
 Manicured lawns, sports fields, and other turf features may already be 
captured in a parks and recreation asset management plan.
The class distinctions in Table 1 provide a relatively easy way to group most 
assets that might be considered natural or part of a community’s overall green 
infrastructure. However, some natural assets might not clearly fit into these 
classes. For instance, natural stormwater ponds or constructed wetlands could 
fit the natural asset, waterbody asset, or LID asset classes. They may also fit 
more directly into a local government’s stormwater asset management plan, in 
which case they can be left out of the natural asset management plan. Each local 
government will need to decide what the best structure is for their individual 
context. In general, asset management plans should be completed for groups of 
asset classes with the acknowledgment that some classes may be addressed in 
separate asset management plans. The ultimate objective is to ensure that all 
natural assets are captured in one or more relevant asset management plans 
and that no duplication of efforts exist (the same asset should not be captured 
in more than one plan). For instance, stormwater management ponds may be 
included in a stormwater asset management plan, and the naturalized area 
around the pond captured in the natural assets management plan. These assets 
deliver different services (stormwater management versus habitat, recreation, 
and urban cooling) and should thus be managed differently and according 
to the services they provide. For example, in the City of Saskatoon, the parks 
department is responsible for managing the area around naturalized stormwater 
ponds while Saskatoon Water monitors the stormwater services provided by 
the pond itself (e.g., storage capacity). Coordination between managing bodies 
will be required to ensure the full suite of assets are captured across the 
management plan(s).

2.1.2	 Scope the Geographic Boundary
It is necessary to define the geographic boundary within which the natural 
assets are inventoried. This may be the jurisdictional boundary of the local 
government or some other geographic boundary. There are three main options 
for defining the geographic boundary for an asset management plan3, namely:
1/	 Focus on municipally owned natural assets;
2/	 Include all natural assets within the municipal boundary (regardless of 
ownership); or 
3/	 Include the natural assets that provide a service to the community (e.g., 
the watershed boundary that provides drinking water services).
For Ontario municipalities to meet O. Reg 588/17, the geographic scope needs 
to cover all municipally owned natural assets. This represents a good baseline 
target scope for all local governments across Canada. However, there are several 
reasons to consider broadening the scope of the inventory to all natural assets 
within a municipal jurisdiction, including:
	
 Many services provided by natural assets result from a broader system 
of interconnected natural features within a jurisdiction. 
	
 Some condition assessment metrics require information about lands 
that surround municipally owned natural assets (see Section 2.3). 
	
 In many cases, the additional effort required to organize the 
information for all natural assets is minimal. It often requires the same 
GIS processing steps to include all natural assets within a municipal 
boundary as it does to restrict it to only municipally owned assets. 
	
 Ownership of the assets can be an attribute built into the inventory to 
allow asset managers to focus in on the natural assets they have the 
most control over. In addition, when data is organized in this manner, 
a local government’s stewardship and outreach activities can be 
strategically tied to asset management objectives.
For these reasons, a local government may wish to inventory all the natural 
assets within their municipal boundary regardless of ownership. Subsequent 
steps (i.e., establishing replacement costs, conducting the condition and risk 
assessments, and defining life cycle management strategies) can be focused on 
the municipally owned assets.
An alternative approach to scoping natural assets is to define the boundary 
around the natural assets that deliver priority services, especially if those 
assets are high risk. This could mean including natural assets that contribute 
to delivering stormwater management or drinking water provision, for example. 
These services are generally provided by the assets within a watershed or 
subwatershed that may exist well outside a municipality’s jurisdiction.

Authorities.

GUIDEBOOK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS 
April 2024
Nature is Infrastructure: How to Include Natural Assets  
in Asset Management Plans
Taking this approach formally recognizes a community’s dependence on other 
jurisdictions or landowners for sustained service flows over time, which can help 
establish cooperation and bilateral asset management agreements.
When capacity and resources are limited, it is recommended that local 
governments prioritize the assets they own and actively manage along with 
those that provide key services particularly when those assets are at risk of 
deterioration. The scope of the asset management plan can be expanded over 
time to include assets not owned or directly managed by the local government. 
For example, the condition of natural assets that are upstream of the local 
government and under the jurisdiction of another entity may have a profound 
effect on service delivery.
2.2	 Inventory the Natural Assets
Establishing an inventory of natural assets is the second step of an asset 
management plan. The 2023 CSA standard provides excellent guidance on how 
to inventory natural assets. The creation of an inventory is a systematic and 
data-driven process, which is summarized here. There are five key steps to 
establishing an inventory of natural assets:4
1/	 Obtain and review data
2/	 Categorize assets and establish an asset hierarchy
3/	 Construct a natural asset registry
4/	 Identify other key attributes to incorporate into the inventory
5/	 Develop inventory metadata
2.2.1	 Obtain and Review Data
The first step, based on CSA (2023) is to determine the best available source 
of land use and land cover data from which to build the base natural asset 
inventory.5 Available data should be identified and assessed to select that which 
will be most useful. Consider consulting with experts in ecology, environmental 
science, and local rightsholders to ensure the most appropriate data is 
identified and selected.
When choosing the best available data, keep in mind that GIS is necessary to 
delineate the natural assets. While an asset inventory can be completed in 
table (or spreadsheet) form, establishing a spatially based database in GIS 
enables the visualization of assets’ spatial distribution and can be essential 
when exploring relationships with other infrastructure, conditions, and risks. 
Integrating the natural asset inventory into a GIS system can also streamline 
ongoing monitoring, analysis, and inventory revisions. Also consider that the 
4    These steps provide additional information, guidance, and generally expand on sections 5.3 
(data gathering) and 5.4 (delineating natural assets) of the CSA standard (CSA 2023).
5    If data is not available, a local government may choose to collect the data needed to inform 
the asset inventory.

spatial data should be relatively easy to update as the natural assets change 
over time. 
The best available data can vary significantly from community to community. 
Table 2 provides a general checklist of the types of data that might be useful 
when establishing a natural asset inventory. Note that most of the data listed in 
Table 2 is considered optional. These data types are ones that have been found 
to be useful under different circumstances. Furthermore, Table 2 should not 
be considered a definitive list. Local governments might have access to other 
data not listed here that may also be beneficial. The overall goal is to centrally 
organize the relevant information to help improve the management of the 
natural assets.
Table 2: Potentially Relevant Types of Data to Support a Natural Asset Inventory and 
Condition Assessment
DATA TYPES
IMPORTANCE DESCRIPTION AND POTENTIAL USE 
Land Cover Classification
Essential
Land cover data is a pre-requisite for establishing a natural 
asset inventory. Spatial boundaries of the natural land covers 
will form the boundaries of natural assets.
Orthophotography
Optional
While not critical, this information can be a very helpful 
reference for a wide range of tasks associated with creating 
an inventory and condition assessment. It can support 
general refinements to land cover data or verify information 
such as extent of asset boundaries or natural asset types. In 
the absence of a pre-existing land cover data set, one could 
be established through interpretation of orthophotography.
Land ownership
Essential / 
Optional
Geographic boundaries of publicly owned and managed 
lands will be essential for scoping natural assets to only 
those owned or managed by the local government. Other 
ownership data is optional but is a very helpful attribute to 
include if the inventory intends to include all relevant natural 
assets. 
Sub/Watershed 
boundaries
Optional
Can be a useful attribute to assign to individual assets.
Forest canopy
Optional
Canopy cover can be a useful inventory attribute to assign to 
individual assets (e.g., percent of canopy cover within each 
asset). This information might support condition metrics.
Designated land use 
planning areas
Optional
Can be a useful inventory attribute to assign to individual 
assets. For instance, some local governments have certain 
natural areas with special designations that limit or restrict 
development (e.g., natural heritage systems, greenway, 
greenbelts, environmental reserve, etc.).

DATA TYPES
IMPORTANCE DESCRIPTION AND POTENTIAL USE 
Park-level plans, data, 
and studies
Optional, 
Resources for 
reference
If a local community has completed any detailed park or 
natural area plans or completed other research/studies, such 
information can be used as reference or source material. This 
could be particularly useful for developing condition metrics.
Road network
Optional
Can be useful supporting information to help refining land 
cover data. For instance, if road networks have not been 
incorporated in the land cover data it might be advantageous 
to split any natural assets that are separated by the road 
network, as road proximity has direct impacts on a natural 
asset’s condition and performance. Alternatively, it could 
help support a desktop-based condition assessment (if one 
is being completed). 
Trails, recreation sites 
and other built assets 
that intersect with 
natural assets
Optional
Can be a useful attribute to assign to individual assets. In 
some cases, a local government may wish to clip out the 
footprint of any built assets located within a defined natural 
asset boundary to have a more accurate area calculation. It 
could also support a desktop-based condition assessment (if 
one is being completed).
Elevation
Optional
Can be a useful attribute to assign to individual assets, or to 
have as a separate data layer. This information can also help 
define and classify the specific conditions of each asset.
Soil type / erosion sites 
Optional
Can be a useful attribute to assign individual assets, or to 
have as separate data layer. This information can also help 
define and classify the specific conditions of each asset.
Any existing monitoring 
data
Optional
For example, any monitoring data related to invasive species, 
species at risk, or other general condition information. This 
can be helpful in establishing condition metrics for natural 
assets. To the extent relevant, linking any monitoring data 
to the natural asset inventory can help build a more robust 
asset management data infrastructure. 
Depending on the scope of the natural asset inventory (see Section 2.1), different 
data may be available for different components of the inventory. For example, 
if the inventory includes privately owned assets, there may be less data readily 
available to depict such assets and their associated attributes. In cases where 
privately owned assets are included in the inventory, data limitations may 
mean that these assets are excluded from condition, risk, and levels of service 
assessments.

The minimum data required to establish a natural asset inventory is a 
sufficiently current land use and land cover (LULC) dataset that covers the 
municipally owned properties. What qualifies as “sufficiently current” will 
depend on the pace of development within a municipality. Ideally, LULC data is 
less than five years old. In communities with a lower rate of land use change, 
older LULC data may suitable. 
Some communities may not have any LULC data available. In this situation, 
communities can look to national or remote sensing-based data. Examples 
of data sources are noted in Table 3. Practitioners should refer to federal and 
provincial open data portals for additional datasets. In the absence of current 
detailed LULC data a decision may be required to either:
	
 Use lower resolution data;
	
 Use older data; or
	
 Invest in specialized LULC mapping.

In some cases, it may be necessary to use more than one LULC dataset to 
capture all natural assets. In such cases a data hierarchy should be established 
where the best available data takes priority in the creation of the inventory and 
any data gaps are fill by the second and third priority datasets as needed.
2.2.2	 Categorize Natural Assets and Establish an Asset 
Hierarchy
As noted at the outset of this section, the natural asset inventory should seek to 
align with the CSA standard for natural asset inventories. 
Natural assets should be categorized based on their type and function. 
Consider using a standardized classification system most relevant to the local 
government. For instance:
	
 In southern Ontario the Ecological Land Classification System for 
Southern Ontario (Lee et al., 1998) is commonly used. Outside of 
southern Ontario, the broader Provincial Ontario Ecological Land 
Classification System8 may be suitable.
	
 In British Columbia, the Terrestrial Ecosystem Mapping9 is commonly 
used.
	
 In New Brunswick, the Ecological Land Classification10 contains ecosites 
and ecoelements that capture and detail individual landforms.
The asset hierarchy defines the relationship between asset classes, asset types, 
and asset components. The hierarchy should align with the asset classification 
system. Focusing on natural assets, Table 4 provides a sample hierarchy. At 
the top of the hierarchy the asset class is natural assets. The asset class is 
subdivided in different asset types that distinguish unique natural features 
(e.g., forest, wetlands, or grasslands). Asset types can be further differentiated 
by asset components to the degree that existing data and management needs 
require this level of detail. For most asset management applications, the natural 
asset type is likely to be sufficient to support the asset management planning 
process. However, to the extent that more component level details exist, they 
can be useful attributes to build into the data structure of an inventory.

EXAMPLES OF USE OF ASSET COMPONENTS IN A 
NATURAL ASSET INVENTORY
In some cases, including asset components in a natural asset inventory 
may help to track levels of service and inform investment decisions when 
the desired services depend on a specific asset component. For example, 
peatlands (as a component of wetlands) store a significant amount of carbon 
and a local government may wish to prioritize protection of peatlands to 
help meet climate change goals. For forests, some examples are the Coastal 
Douglas-fir or Garry Oak ecosystems on Vancouver Island, which may require 
special protections and management. 
Note that the sample in Table 4 is provided for general reference, not as a 
prescriptive guide. For instance, some local governments might prefer to have 
swamps classified as forest, or perhaps as their own lowland forest asset type. 
Local governments should consider their unique circumstances, available data, 
and overall asset management objectives to determine a classification hierarchy 
that best suits their needs. Finally, the hierarchy structure can be adjusted 
overtime as needs, objectives, and data availability evolve.
Ultimately, the asset categorization and hierarchy should be based on the best 
available land cover data. Establish the hierarchy by considering the range of 
asset types and components needed to support asset management decisions 
and the degree to which those components can be captured with the spatial 
data available. Note that it is not necessary to have three or more levels to the 
asset hierarchy. Each local government should assess and identify the best 
available (i.e., most current and accurate) LULC data and should not be deterred 
by data limitations. There are options to use data from provincial or federal 
19

in Asset Management Plans
sources and to combine data from numerous sources to get the best possible 
depiction of natural assets where local data is limited. The objective is to get 
a complete picture of the location and extent of natural assets present within 
the geographic boundary under consideration. For example, at a minimum the 
inventory needs to define the location and extent of each natural asset type; 
lack of information on the component (e.g., type of wetland or tree species in 
the forest) does not negate the value of the inventory. 
One of the key challenges when building a natural asset inventory is deciding 
what the boundaries of each individual asset should be. There is no one 
correct way to proceed on this. To some degree it will depend on the structure 
of available land cover data. For instance, if using remote sensing data such 
as the Annual Crop Inventory or the Sentinel-2 10-Meter Land Use/Land Cover, 
the options will be more limited. These tend to be raster datasets that do not 
lend themselves well to defining assets at a detailed level. On the other hand, 
if vector-based data like the Ecological Land Classification System for Southern 
Ontario, or British Columbia’s Terrestrial Ecosystem Mapping is available, each 
individual asset can be defined as the continuous area of the same land cover 
type. For instance, using the Table 4 example, adjacent areas of coniferous, 
deciduous, and mix forests can be combined into a single ‘forest’ asset. A similar 
approach can be applied to wetlands and grasslands. This is typically a good 
level of detail to support asset management planning. In some cases, it may 
also be worth considering a higher order aggregation that combines all adjacent 
areas of forest, wetlands, and grasslands into a single ‘natural’ asset boundary. 
Whether assets are defined at the “asset type” level, the “asset class” level, or 
both depends on what data is available and how the data will be used. 
Regardless of the level of detail at which a natural asset is defined (i.e., 
natural area, forest area, area of specific tree species), a well-defined, unique 
identification (ID) for each asset should be used to organize the levels of 
aggregation within a single dataset. Figure 2 provides a possible approach for 
aggregating the spatial data and assigning unique IDs. In the figure the boxes 
represent areas of land. At Level 1, the asset is defined as a continuous area of 
natural land cover (regardless of the landcover type) in this case comprised of a 
combination of water and forest assets. The unique asset ID is Asset A. At Level 
2, the asset is defined as a continuous area of the same landcover type. Here a 
distinction is made between the area that is comprised of water assets (Asset 
A-1) and the area that is comprised for forest assets (Asset A-2). The forest assets 
in Level 2 are further divided in Level 3 where they are defined as continuous 
areas of the same tree species with each area of the same species receiving a 
unique ID (Asset A-2-1, Asset A-2 and Asset A-2-3).

Figure 2: Sample Approach for Aggregating Spatial Data and Assigning Unique IDs
2.2.3	 Construct a Natural Asset Registry
A natural asset registry is simply the IT infrastructure that houses the natural 
asset inventory. Given the nature of natural assets, a GIS environment or a 
geospatial database is typically the most effective way to organize and house 
the inventory. Natural asset registries are generally structured such that each 
individual asset has a unique (ID) and is represented as a row in the registry 
database. A series of columns in the registry house attributes assigned to the 
various assets. 
2.2.4	 Identify Key Attributes to Incorporate into the 
Inventory
The columns in the asset inventory can contain a wide array of attributes which 
categorize and describe the assets. These attributes typically capture important 
components of land use, ownership, or other environmental features that can 
be useful when managing natural assets. At a minimum, the inventory should 
include attributes for the following: 
	
 Type (e.g., forest, wetland, grassland) 
	
 Quantity (area or length) 
	
 Location
Other high priority attributes include condition, risk, and ownership. Ownership 
is particularly important if natural assets have been scoped to include all 
natural assets within a municipal jurisdiction rather than just those owned/
managed by the local government. In such cases it is essential to indicate which 
assets are under municipal control or ownership. Watershed or subwatershed 
boundaries may also be relevant. These boundaries can be used to identify 
which watershed, subwatershed, or stormwater catchment each natural asset 
is located in. If spatial geometries do not align with the boundaries of natural 
assets, consider using summaries or defining assets by the catchment they are 
located it.
21
GUIDEBOOK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS 
April 2024
Nature is Infrastructure: How to Include Natural Assets  
in Asset Management Plans
More advanced attributes can also be incorporated into the natural asset 
inventory. This might include planning designations, park management zones, 
areas for restoration, or locations of archeological sites. Each local government 
can incorporate a range of attributes deemed useful for understanding and 
managing the associated natural assets. 
When incorporating attribute information into a natural asset inventory there 
are a couple ways to proceed. The GIS dataset files may contain a range of 
information of varying degrees of relevance for the natural asset inventory. 
Using the merge function (in GIS) to incorporate this information into a single 
natural asset inventory can result in natural assets being divided (or split) into 
numerous small components. It is best to avoid splitting assets in this manner. 
However, there are cases where doing so can be appropriate. For instance, in 
cases like watershed boundaries where splitting a single forest asset by the 
watershed boundary might be useful from a hydrological function perspective. 
Instead of merging information, using the summarize function (in GIS) can be an 
effective way to pull important information into the inventory. 
2.2.5	 Develop Inventory Metadata
The last step of establishing an inventory is to document key information, 
assumptions, data processing steps, and data definitions related to each 
natural asset and the various attributes captured in the inventory. The goal of 
this documentation should be to ensure that the inventory can be replicated, if 
necessary, and easily updated and refined over time. Documentation can be in 
the form of spreadsheets, GIS databases, or other report based metadata.
2.3	 Assess the Condition of the Natural Assets
The objective of the condition assessment is to conduct a high-level evaluation 
of each natural asset’s ability to provide services. This approach draws on 
the cascade model summarized in CSA (2023) that demonstrates the linkage 
between biophysical structure, process, and function and human well-being (see 
Figure 3). Condition metrics that capture ecological condition can be assumed to 
translate into ecosystem services and values to the community. The underlying 
assumption is that a natural asset that is assessed as being in “good” condition 
from an ecological perspective has a greater likelihood of providing a “good” 
level of ecological services, which are further assumed to be of value to the 
community.

Provided, and the Benefits and Values that Flow to End Users (Source: CSA, 2023) 
Natural assets should be assessed for condition based on in situ 
inspection, which in the case of natural features requires field 
assessments of ecosystem components and their functions (e.g., 
vegetation type and cover, species composition and structure, wildlife 
use).
The implication for natural asset management is that a condition assessment 
can focus on the ecological condition of the natural area under consideration. 
Ultimately, the goal of the condition assessment is to generate information 
that natural asset managers can use (along with risk information) to inform and 
prioritize management and restoration actions. There are a number of different 
ways to approach this, and to date there is no standard approach to doing so. 
How each local government proceeds will largely depend on available data and 
capacity. 
Ideally, natural assets should be assessed for condition based on in situ 
inspection, which in the case of natural features requires field assessments of 
ecosystem components and their functions. While this approach can be detailed 
and resource intensive, it does not have to be. Condition can be assessed 
using field-based inspections that require few field staff. Furthermore, asset 
management plans are typically only updated once every five years, so there is 
no need to assess each natural asset every year. A five-year rotation cycle can be 
established where only a portion of the local government’s assets are assessed 
each year. Summer students with a basic understanding of ecology and some 
on-the-job training can be utilized to collect the necessary information. The key 
to this approach is establishing a suitable assessment protocol. For example, 
Credit Valley Conservation Authority in Ontario has been working on developing 
a Rapid Inventory and Condition Assessment Method (RICAM) that can support 
this type of approach.11 Once a local government has established a suitable 
protocol that has been vetted through local ecological experts, operationalizing

a regular assessment pattern can be feasible, though conducting regular 
condition assessments of assets that have not have been monitored before will 
have some budget implications. 
It should also be noted that this type of condition assessment would primarily 
apply to publicly owned and managed properties. If the natural asset inventory 
includes a broader range of assets, it is completely acceptable to focus condition 
assessments on those assets owned or managed by the local government. 
It may take some time for a local government to determine a useful protocol, 
which can also be further limited by the capacity available to some communities. 
A temporary alternative to field-based condition assessments is to establish a 
series of high-level condition metrics based on landscape ecology principles 
and science; a synthesis of available desktop data; and, an understanding of the 
community’s biophysical context. Such assessments serve as a starting point 
that is consistent with an asset management framework. This approach can 
also be used to fill gaps in the condition data for local governments working on 
tracking all public and privately owned natural assets. 
If using a desktop-based approach, local governments should consider using 
a minimum of three to five condition indicators grounded in established 
landscape ecology. Condition indicators that consider key landscape ecology 
principles can provide an indication on the function and health of natural 
assets. For example, condition indicators can be framed around measures such 
as:
	
 Species richness and diversity 
	
 Patch size and shape 
	
 Interior habitat
	
 Edge-to-area ratio 
	
 Connectivity of assets across the landscape
	
 Presence of riparian areas
	
 Stream/river shading
Annex B in the 2023 CSA standard provides some general guidance and examples 
of condition criteria, indicators, metrics, and measures (see Table 5).

Finally, for some local governments it may not be possible to implement either 
approach. In such situations, the condition of the assets can be addressed 
qualitatively within the natural asset management plan. Relying on local expert 
knowledge, the plan can note specific areas known to have poorer conditions or 
be in need of specific management actions. This can be as simple as noting or 
flagging known problem areas, or it can be more involved where specific assets 
are rated on a simple scale such as: 
	
 Good – no immediate management actions needed 
	
 Fair – should be considered for management actions
	
 Poor – known area that needs management attention

Having objective measures of ecological condition is preferred. However, it is 
recognized that not all local governments have the financial resources or staff 
capacity to do this level of assessment. In such situations, a more qualitative 
approach to condition maybe an acceptable short-term action while local 
governments build their asset management capacity. Table 6 summarizes the 
three general approaches to establishing a condition assessment.

Regardless of the approach taken, outcome of the condition assessment should 
be the establishment of a condition score for natural assets that aligns with 
the condition approach the local government is using as part of their asset 
management program. In Annex B of CSA (2023), a sample rating scale with 
definitions is provided and included here (Table 7) for reference. As noted above, 
a qualitative approach may result in a more simplistic rating scale. However, the 
general objective remains the same.

Very Good
Well-maintained, good condition, no signs of deterioration in ecological

Good
Ecological conditions appear to be sufficient; some minor localized (or 
isolated) impacts noticeable, which might be a warning sign of possible 
decline. Natural asset service provision is acceptable.
Fair
Clear signs of deterioration in ecological function and service-influencing 
factors. Natural asset service provision, while still functional, is at risk of 
failing.
Poor
Condition is below standard with large portion(s) of the system exhibiting 
significant deterioration in ecological function. Natural asset service provision 
is impacted, and some services might be non-functioning.
Very Poor
Widespread signs of advanced deterioration; unlikely that the natural asset is 
providing any functional service.

TIP: Before embarking on developing a specific condition assessment process, 
consider what work is already being done to understand the ecological 
conditions of natural areas. Many local governments are already doing similar 
work that is simply not framed in asset management terms. For instance, 
the City of Barrie in Ontario has undertaken forest health assessments. 
The results provide an indication of condition for woodlots. Their facilities, 
parks, and outdoor recreation asset management plan (2023) noted that 
this program can be adapted to inform condition ratings more directly for 
asset management purposes.13 Local governments can also draw on the 
knowledge of condition documented by local experts in the community, such 
as Indigenous communities, community groups, non-profit organizations, 
local environmental organizations, universities, colleges and Conservation 
Authorities.
How the ratings are established and allocated to specific assets is flexible. 
Regardless of in-field or desktop-based assessments, it will be important to 
engage local ecological experts to help define the specific conditions that 
equate to each rating score to ensure condition ratings are appropriate and the 
scoring acceptably aligns with landscape ecological principles. While the specific 
conditions are likely to vary based on local context, existing guidelines can 
help inform the categorization of the condition indicators such as Environment 
Canada’s How Much Habitat is Enough.14 
2.4	 Establish Replacement Costs for the Natural Assets
In the context of asset management, a replacement cost is intended to measure 
the cost of replacing an asset. For natural assets, this can be more challenging 
since natural assets owned or managed by a local government are not generally 
purchased or constructed. As a result, natural assets are unlikely to have any 
historical or capital construction costs. Furthermore, once lost, many natural 
assets cannot actually be replaced in an ecologically meaningful sense, or 
fully restored in relevant timeframes — their intrinsic values are inherently 
irreplaceable. However, some natural assets can sometimes be restored when 
significantly degraded or lost.15
Therefore, replacement costs for some natural assets can be based on an 
anticipated best estimate of what it would cost to restore the natural asset (e.g., 
forest, wetland, native grassland) if it was in a highly degraded state or create 
the natural asset if it was lost (e.g., cleared for agriculture). In either case, the 
13  See SLBC (2023). Asset Management Plan for Facilities, Parks, and Outdoor Recreation. City of 
Barrie.
14  Bryan, G., & Henshaw, B (2013). See publications.gc.ca/site/eng/9.652667/publication.html
15  Ecological restoration is the process of repairing disturbed or degraded ecosystems. It aims 
to repair an existing natural area’s structure, function, and composition returning it to a more 
undisturbed state. The term naturalization is also sometimes used in an urban context which 
involves planting trees and shrubs to restore cleared land to a natural state.
27
GUIDEBOOK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS 
April 2024
Nature is Infrastructure: How to Include Natural Assets  
in Asset Management Plans
cost of afforestation can be used as a proxy for the replacement cost. However, 
the approximate nature of this estimate, its potential lack of suitability to some 
cases where restoration cannot be achieved (e.g. a contaminated aquifer), 
and the fact that restoration may not restore pre-existing biodiversity and 
connectivity, must be emphasized.
At a basic level, an average restoration cost can be estimated based on the 
natural asset type. For instance, if the average cost to restore 1 hectare (ha) 
of forest is $X, then a 5 ha forest asset can be applied a replacement cost of 
$5X. For this basic level, average replacement costs can be based on high-level 
estimates from credible sources.
At a more advanced level, average replacement costs can be based on credible 
sources such as historical restoration costs from comparable local projects, or 
estimated based on the specific work anticipated to restore the natural asset as 
determined by restoration and naturalization specialists. These costs can also 
be ‘appreciated’ using forest age or basal area. This helps account for the many 
years it will take a newly-planted forest to achieve ‘like for like’ levels of service 
with an older forest. Cost estimates should consider:
	
 Restoration planning 
	
 Site preparation 
	
 Labour
	
 Plant and materials
	
 Equipment
	
 Maintenance and monitoring 
Average restoration costs vary depending on the natural asset type; it can be 
useful to organize restoration cost data around the asset hierarchy. For instance, 
replacement cost at the asset type level should be sufficient for basic estimates 
(e.g., forest, wetlands, grasslands, etc.). More advanced approaches might 
consider specifying unique values to replace the different asset components 
(e.g., coniferous forest, deciduous forest, marsh, bog, etc.).
If restoration costs are not readily available, there are numerous government 
and non-government organizations that specialize in natural feature restoration 
and naturalization that may have data or expertise to help (e.g., Conservation 
Authorities in Ontario, Ducks Unlimited Canada, etc.). See Appendix D for 
guidance from a Conservation Authority perspective. In the absence of locally 
available restoration costs, it may be possible to find average costs in the 
literature (see Kimball et al., 2015 or Zentner et al., 2003).
While approximating replacement costs is useful for informing and prioritizing 
natural asset management, it is imperative to recognize that:
(a)	 Some natural features and functions may be irreplaceable, meaning 
when the natural assets are lost, some ecosystem services will be lost 
forever; therefore, any replacement cost for such assets would be an 
28
GUIDEBOOK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS 
April 2024
Nature is Infrastructure: How to Include Natural Assets  
in Asset Management Plans
underestimate.
(b)	 In cases where natural features and functions can be reasonably 
restored through restoration and naturalization practices, it may take 
many years, or decades, for a restored or constructed natural asset to 
provide the same level of service as the original undisturbed natural 
feature.16
(c)	 Not all natural assets deliver the same type or number of services, so 
a loss of assets in one location is unlikely to be compensated for with 
restoration or protection of natural assets in another location. 
Replacement Cost of the Asset Versus the Service
There is an important distinction to be made between using a replacement 
cost approach to measure a service value (e.g., estimating the cost to replace 
stormwater services provided by a forest) and establishing the replacement of 
a specific asset (e.g., estimating the cost to restore a forest). As noted above, 
for the purpose of establishing a replacement cost for a state of the natural 
assets report, the replacement cost should focus on what it would cost to 
replace the asset itself (e.g., the forest). This is fundamentally different than 
the cost of replacing the service. Estimating the replacement cost of a natural 
assets service (e.g., stormwater service) can be very useful in demonstrating 
the importance of natural assets to a community. It can be a powerful 
message to articulate the financial liability a local government is exposed to if 
natural assets are not properly monitored, protected, and managed. However, 
service values should not be positioned as the replacement cost of the 
natural asset (e.g., the forest) for the purposes of a natural asset management 
plan.
Note that a valuation of a single service provided by natural assets, such as 
stormwater services provided, does not account for the value of all other 
ecosystem services and benefits the assets provide to the community. For 
example, the Grindstone Creek Watershed in Ontario is estimated to provide 
over $2 billion in stormwater services in terms of the value of engineered 
infrastructure replacements, not including operational costs. The watershed 
also provides an annual service value of approximately $34 million in 
co-benefits, including recreation, erosion control, habitat biodiversity, 
atmospheric regulation, and climate mitigation (MNAI, 2022).
In summary, replacement costs should generally be understood as a low-end 
and incomplete estimate.
16    This concern can be somewhat addressed using the basal area method mentioned above.

2.5	 Document the State of Natural Assets
The final step is to summarize the results in a state of natural assets report. 
The level of detail can vary based on each local governments’ natural asset 
management objectives and scope. For local governments that are unsure of 
how and where to start, some examples and ideas of what to summarize in a 
state of natural assets report include:

condition rating

3 	Levels of Service
Natural assets provide a wide array of ecosystem services to a community. As 
noted, ecosystem services help local governments to manage the costs of and 
risks to service delivery. For instance, natural areas have pervious surfaces and 
subsurface soil structures that allow the infiltration of water and hence reduce 
the amount and speed of surface water runoff thereby reducing the overall 
burden on a local government’s stormwater management infrastructure and 
helping to avoid or minimize flooding.
Ecosystem services are aspects of ecosystems that provide benefits to 
people, which may be outcomes of a municipal service that protects 
the environment (i.e., air quality, biodiversity, habitat, pollination, 
carbon storage, cooling, shading, temperature regulation, water 
quality, etc.). Source: Asset Management BC Community of Practice, 
LOS template. 
A key aspect of asset management planning is to assess the levels of service 
(LOS) that assets provide and define expected, or desired LOS that balance the 
LOS provided with risk and lifecycle management costs. O. Reg 588/17 requires 
risks be considered when assessing the costs to maintain current, or achieve 
target, LOS.
This section explores how LOS can be defined for natural assets and provides 
options for local governments to consider risks in the context of managing LOS. 
It can be read in conjunction with the NAI guidance on this topic.17
3.1	 What are Levels of Service?18
LOS are objectives and performance measures that define the expected 
performance of assets and related services. They are an essential pillar of 
asset management. They represent the service delivery commitment of a local 
government, inform asset management and financial plans, and help local 
governments to prioritize capital and operational spending decisions.
Defining LOS enables local governments to link strategic organizational 
objectives with technical and operational requirements of infrastructure 
management, and is a way to steer a local government towards optimal 
investments.
17  See Defining Levels of Service for Natural Assets (2022) at mnai.ca/media/2022/01/MNAI-

in Asset Management Plans
It is the responsibility of a local government’s council to approve and monitor 
progress on LOS. Doing so enables them to be transparent and accountable for 
their decisions regarding service delivery. When LOS are well-documented in 
asset management plans, councils are better able to communicate the social, 
environmental, and financial impacts of improving or reducing services and 
engage the community on their ‘willingness to pay’ for changes in service levels. 
If councils choose not to fully fund their asset management plans, then staff are 
able to communicate the costs and risks of failing to achieve the desired LOS 
documented in the plans. 
3.2	 Types of Level of Service Measures
There are two main types of LOS that, taken together, show how day-to-day 
operational activities for infrastructure will align with and support a local 
government’s strategic objectives. Specifically, there are community19 and 
technical LOS, described below. Figure 4 provides some examples. 
1/	 Community LOS Measures and Indicators: These are performance 
measures that describe the service the community should expect to 
receive, expressed in terms that make sense to them. These measures 
usually refer to specific aspects of the service such as its accessibility to 
the community, its capacity to meet the community’s expectations, its 
reliability, its safety, etc.
2/	 Technical LOS Measures and Indicators: These are performance 
measures that describe the performance of the asset in relation to the 
service, or the operational requirements to manage the assets such that 
they achieve the expected LOS. In the case of natural assets, technical 
LOS related to asset performance focus on the ability of natural assets 
to provide ecosystem services to the community. 
Knowledge about the ecosystem services that natural assets provide is needed 
to determine some technical LOS. For example, local governments may wish to 
assess the degrees of heat reduction contributed by natural assets, tonnes of 
carbon sequestered, or their ability to store water or provide habitat for flora 
and fauna. When local governments build an understanding of the current LOS 
natural assets provide for ecosystem services of interest to them, they will be 
able to define the expected or desired LOS they aim to achieve through natural 
asset management (e.g., how much to grow the urban forest, where to focus 
restoration efforts, what natural areas to conserve or protect, etc.). 
19  Also referred to as customer LOS in standard asset management practices. Some local 
governments prefer not to identify the community as customers of a service, and therefore 
use the term community LOS instead.

3.3	 Why Develop Levels of Service for Natural Assets?
When local governments develop LOS for natural assets, it helps ensure that: 
	
 Natural assets’ role in service delivery is recognized and there is 
accountability for their management. 
	
 Lifecycle management activities (e.g., monitoring, maintenance, 
restoration) are included in budgets and long-term financial plans. 
	
 Progress on natural asset management informs continuous 
improvement objectives to protect and manage natural assets when 
strategic plans and policies, including land use plans, are updated.
	
 The multiple services provided by natural assets are understood, which 
helps build a business case for their protection.

3.4	 Steps to Establishing Levels of Service for Natural 
Assets 
There are four steps to establishing LOS measures for natural assets. They are: 
1) prioritize which natural asset services to manage; 2) define service delivery 
objectives for natural assets [corporate LOS]; 3) scope community and technical 
LOS measures; and 4) define community and technical LOS measures and 
indicators. Each of these steps is described in detail below. The subsequent 
section of this report considers how to incorporate risk into the LOS framework. 
3.4.1	   Step 1   – Prioritize which Natural Asset Services to 
Manage
The first step to establish LOS measures for natural assets is to identify the 
services the assets provide that are relevant to the local government. Different 
natural assets will provide different services and many natural assets will 
provide multiple services.20
The natural asset inventory demonstrates the spatial distribution of the natural 
assets and will help inform which services natural assets are delivering to 
the community. For example, urban forests can reduce urban heat, improve 
air quality, and provide aesthetic benefits for residents. Forest complexes 
will provide opportunities for nearby residents to realize social and cultural 
gains, recreation, and water retention and filtration. The expert opinion of staff 
and local conservation/nature groups can be useful to identify the services 
provided by natural assets; Some commonly identified services relevant to local 
governments are briefly described below (note this list is not exhaustive). 
Stormwater management (core municipal service) — Natural assets can play an 
important role in stormwater management. Wetlands and riparian vegetation, 
for example, can be very effective in storing water, controlling peak flows, 
supporting groundwater recharge, and controlling erosion. 
Drinking water management (core municipal service) — Natural assets play a 
role in the provision of drinking water. They are effective at storing and filtering 
water both in the context of ground or surface water supply. 
Recreation (municipal service/co-benefit) — Recreational opportunities help 
to foster healthy, engaged, and socially cohesive communities and is a primary 
service offered by most local governments. In addition to urban parks, many 
types of green infrastructure such as urban and nearby forests, tree-lined 
streets, and other types of natural assets (e.g., a naturalized stormwater 
management facility), can support nature-based recreation. 
20  There is some variation in how local governments refer to the ecosystem services natural 
assets provide. Some link some ecosystem services (e.g. infiltration, water storage) to a direct 
municipal service (e.g. stormwater management), while other ecosystem services are referred 
to as co-benefits (e.g. carbon sequestration, which is related to climate mitigation and not a 
direct municipal service). For the purpose of this guidance, we refer to all ecosystem services 
generally as “services provided by the natural assets”. 
34
GUIDEBOOK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS 
April 2024
Nature is Infrastructure: How to Include Natural Assets  
in Asset Management Plans
Habitat (co-benefit) – Healthy natural assets support the provision of habitat 
to improve and maintain biodiversity. Biodiversity is essential to support 
functioning ecosystems. Changes in biodiversity can influence the supply of 
ecosystem services, just as changes in the quantity and condition of natural 
assets in an ecosystem can influence biodiversity. 
Climate resilience (co-benefit) — Ecosystems and the natural assets contained in 
them are vital to the climate system through their role in the carbon cycle, the 
water cycle, and the maintenance of biodiversity. Soils, forests, wetlands, and 
grasslands all assist in carbon sequestration and storage. These natural assets 
also play an important buffering role by reducing the severity of climate change 
impacts, including through services such as flood attenuation, urban heat island 
reduction, and storm surge protection. 
Public health (municipal service/co-benefit) — It is increasingly understood 
that proximity and access to greenspace leads to improvements in physical and 
mental health and wellbeing, reduced mortality, and reduced health care costs. 
Culture and heritage (municipal service/co-benefit) — Nature plays an important 
role in maintaining community culture and heritage. A cultural landscape is any 
geographical area that has been modified, influenced, or given special cultural 
meaning by people. 
Local economic development (municipal service/co-benefit) — Natural assets 
are foundational to local economies through their provisioning services for 
agriculture, forestry, fishing, and resource extraction. Natural assets also 
contribute to local economies by providing opportunities for nature-based 
tourism and recreation activities. In addition, studies have shown that trees and 
nature located close to residential and commercial properties increase their 
property value. 
TIP: Local governments starting out in natural asset management will likely 
want to consider a small number of services that are critical for managing 
costs of, and risks to, service delivery. In NAI’s experience, the services of 
interest that tend to rise to the top for local governments relate to stormwater 
management, the provision of drinking water, biodiversity and habitat 
protection, recreation, and climate mitigation and adaptation. Once the 
services of interest are scoped, the local government can define relevant 
service delivery objectives. See Step 2.

3.4.2	   Step 2   – Identify Service Delivery Objectives for 
Natural Assets 
The second step involves the identification of service delivery objectives to help 
prioritize natural asset management activities and budgets. Local governments 
should define these objectives so they are aligned with the content of existing 
strategic documents such as climate action plans, climate change resilience 
strategies, biodiversity strategies, urban forest management plans, official plans, 
master plans, or any other policy documents or plans where objectives for 
natural assets may be defined. Some examples of service delivery objectives are 
shown in Table 8. Local governments generally define a small number of service 
delivery objectives for natural assets.

SERVICE DELIVERY OBJECTIVES 21 
RELEVANT NATURAL ASSETS THAT PROVIDE 
THE SERVICES 22 
Promote the use of naturalized methods to support

Protect source water quality and quantity by 
sustaining hydrological and hydrogeological 
characteristics of watercourses, aquifers, and 
wetlands. 
Forests, watercourses, wetlands, and riparian areas 
support aquifer recharge, filter water, etc. 
Provide access to nature for passive recreation and

Parks and natural areas support trail networks, 
outdoor recreation, social and cultural 
opportunities. 
Protect the community from natural hazards such 
as wildfires, flooding, storm surge and erosion 
through both land use planning and proactive 
management of natural areas, in consideration of 
current and future climate conditions.
Proactive natural asset management to manage 
service delivery risks — applies to all natural asset 
types.

3.4.3	   Step 3   – Scope the Community and Technical Level of 
Service Measures for Natural Assets
There are numerous factors that can and should be considered when 
establishing community and technical LOS for natural assets. Ultimately, the 
number of community and technical LOS measures that local governments track 
needs to be realistic. To scope them effectively, asset managers will want to 
consider: 
Regulatory frameworks – the regulatory requirements of a local government may 
be relevant in establishing and prioritizing LOS measures. It may be appropriate, 
for example, to prioritize LOS measures that allow the local government to track 
progress against a regulatory requirement. Along these same lines, where clear 
performance targets have been established, prioritizing LOS measures that 
track progress against those targets can be helpful. Local governments typically 
describe the policy and regulatory requirements up front in the level of service 
section of their asset management plans, and their technical levels of service 
must meet the minimum requirements. 
Community priorities and expectations for services – select measures that 
align with the services that are of interest to the community. For example, if 
access to green space is a community priority, then establishing LOS measures 
that evaluate access to nature (e.g., approximate walking time to the nearest 
greenspace) by neighbourhood would be appropriate. 
Capacity of the local government — consider the capacity of the local 
government to track these measures over time. Budget and human resource 
limitations will need to be considered. In some cases, data pertaining to LOS 
measures may be readily available. In such cases, tracking the associated 
LOS measures may be immediately feasible. In other cases, the level of effort 
required to track the LOS measures may be minimal and thus justifiable in the 
short-term. LOS measures beyond those that can be tracked with existing data 
or with minimal additional effort will need to be evaluated for their importance 
relative to the cost of obtaining the needed data. Local governments with 
resource constraints can start with readily available data and prioritize future 
data collection to build out a full suite of LOS measures over time.
Priority assets – it may not be feasible to establish LOS measures for all of the 
natural assets within the municipal boundary. When capacity is constrained 
due to data, budget, or human resource limitations, asset managers may 
find it useful to focus initially on a sub-set of high priority assets. That may 
mean focusing on a particular type of asset (e.g., terrestrial, urban forests), 
assets within a particular area (e.g., within a certain proximity of residential 
units), or assets with specific designations (e.g., parks or protected areas). 
When identifying priority assets, practitioners can also think about the degree 
to which some assets may already be captured in other asset management 
plans. The idea here is to establish LOS for the assets that are highest priority 
for management in the short-run and in doing so ensure the number of LOS 
37
GUIDEBOOK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

in Asset Management Plans
measures that are established can realistically be tracked over time. 
Level of service attributes – there are some key service attributes that are 
important to consider when developing technical LOS for natural assets related 
to asset performance. These include the capacity and use, quality and reliability, 
and the function of the natural assets which enables them to provide ecosystem 
services. 
	
 Capacity and Use: Natural assets have enough capacity to deliver 
ecosystem services 
	
 Quality and Reliability: The quality of the natural assets meet 
community needs while limiting impacts to ecosystem health (e.g., their 
condition)
	
 Function: Natural assets perform their intended functions (e.g., peak 
flow attenuation) and are sustainable
The attributes above are the ones most commonly employed in asset 
management. Additional LOS attributes to consider when developing community 
and technical LOS encompass the universal values of service delivery23, 
including:
	
 Safety: Natural asset services are safe and risks are managed (e.g., 
hazard trees are removed)
	
 Regulatory: Natural asset services meet all regulatory requirements 
(e.g., riparian buffers)
	
 Reliability: The service is reliable (e.g., frequency of trail closures) 
	
 Accessibility: The service is accessible (e.g., all residents have access to 
greenspace)
	
 Sustainability: The service is sustainable (e.g., natural assets are 
protected from development)
	
 Cost/Affordability24: The service is affordable (e.g., cost of maintaining 
natural assets in good health to deliver services)
	
 Customer Service: The local government is responsive to questions or 
concerns about the service
In addition to the scoping considerations described above, when establishing 
LOS measures it is useful to consider the general rule-of-thumb for developing 
good performance measures, which is that they adhere to the following 
“SMARTER” principles25: 
S: Specific, meaning they define results to be accomplished for a specific aspect 
of the service objective.

M: Measurable, meaning they define a quantity, cost or quality. 
A: Achievable, meaning the target should be realistic (not a stretch target or easy 
target).
R: Relevant, meaning it supports an organizational goal and provides a clear 
picture of whether the service is being provided. A customer LOS should also be 
relevant and meaningful to the community. 
T: Timebound, meaning the measure specifies the frequency of action or a 
due date. Long-term targets should be stated along with annual or short-term 
targets that measure progress to be achieved over time. 
E: Evaluation, meaning that there will be ongoing evaluation of the 
appropriateness of the measure/target. 
R: Re-assess, meaning that LOS will be reviewed and updated to reflect the 
changing business environment.
Ideally, a local government will include the following when establishing 
community and technical LOS: 
	
 Current (baseline) LOS being provided 
	
 Desired trend (increase or decrease) 
	
 Desired LOS (target, if possible)
Depending on a local government’s data availability and resources to assess 
and track LOS, it may not be feasible to establish current and desired LOS for 
all LOS measures it is interested in tracking. Establishing current community 
and technical LOS in priority areas is a good first step for local governments. 
Expected or desired LOS can be established as part of continuous improvement 
efforts.
3.4.4	   Step 4   — Define Community and Technical Level of 
Service Measures and Indicators
Community LOS measures typically relate to the direct benefits the community 
receives from natural assets, such as passive recreation opportunities, local 
economic development, climate resilience, etc. 
Below (Table 9) are some examples of community LOS measures and indicators 
that local governments across Canada have included in LOS frameworks for 
natural assets.26
26  NAI has worked with the following communities to develop LOS frameworks for natural 
assets: City of Saskatoon, SK, Town of Pelham, ON, the Districts of Saanich and Nanaimo, BC, 
the Resort Municipality of Whistler, BC. Some measures are also being used by the City of 
Markham and York Region, ON.

27  There may be some overlap with community performance indicators and technical 
performance indicators. The indicators reported publicly tend to be part of broader reporting 
on the organization’s key performance indicators. Community level of service measures may 
also be described qualitatively and communicated to the public using maps or visual aids. An 
example is: We will provide access to a network of trails that are safe, accessible, maintained 
year-round, with public washrooms and water stations. Maps of the trail system provided, 
with daily updates on trail closures.
28  Annual trees planted per 100,000 population is a supporting indicator in the ISO 37120 
Standard, World Council on City Data.
29  This is a guiding principle of urban forest management that proposes that everyone should 
be able to see 3 trees from their home, all neighbourhoods where people live should have 
at least 30% canopy cover, and all homes should be within 300m of a park or greenspace to 
ensure urban forest benefits are sufficient and accessible to all. This principle was approved 
by the District of Saanich, BC Council in 2021.
30  The ISO 37120 Standard (World Council on City Data) has specific requirements for tracking 
biodiversity of native species. Many local governments do no have sufficient data to track 
progress on this standard.

The examples of technical LOS below are broken down into the categories of 
asset performance (Table 10), which measures the ability of natural assets 
to deliver ecosystem services, and operational performance (Table 11), which 
measures the performance of the local government in managing natural assets. 
The indicators below reflect that large, intact natural areas in good condition are 
better able to deliver ecosystem services. The extent and condition of natural

4 	Incorporating Risk and 
Criticality 
A key asset management principle is to manage risk while meeting service levels 
and minimizing lifecycle costs. A local government can provide lower service 
levels, which typically results in lower immediate costs. However, this usually 
is associated with higher risk and potentially higher costs in the long term. The 
primary goal of understanding the risk exposure from natural assets is to inform 
a local government on which projects to prioritize across asset classes and 
service areas. 
Before engaging in a formal risk assessment, local governments should 
consider work already undertaken that might inform or provide a foundation 
for a risk assessment. For example, many local governments have completed 
climate change vulnerability assessments; many of which have incorporated 
risk assessments and some of which might be relevant to natural assets. At a 
minimum, these studies can provide an excellent launching pad for a natural 
asset risk assessment. 
The concept of asset criticality can also be useful in helpful for prioritizing 
assets and focusing management efforts. 
Criticality refers to the importance or significance of an asset to a 
local governments’ operations or objectives. It reflects the degree to 
which an asset is essential for achieving desired outcomes and can 
provide a sense of relative importance. 
Generally, assets that have the greater consequences of failure will be the assets 
that are considered the most critical. Another important variable for identifying 
critical natural assets is whether the asset is replaceable. For example, a 
drainage ditch is easily substituted by grey infrastructure, whereas an aquifer 
may not be replaced with grey infrastructure (or may entail costs that are too 
high). Identifying which natural assets are critical helps prioritize which ones 
should be the focus of deeper risk consideration and lifecycle management 
activities. Section 4.4 explores this further. 
There are many ways to approach assessing risk associated with natural assets. 
Below are three approaches to provide direction to local governments as they 
begin asset management for natural assets. It is important to remember that a 
range of options exist; it is not just a choice between the options that follow. Any 
chosen risk approach can and should be tailored to the context of each specific 
local government. The approaches, described further in this section, are:
1/	 Qualitative risk assessment that relies on local knowledge and expertise 
to identify anticipated risks and describe how the asset management 
plan attempts to address or mitigate those risks. 
43
GUIDEBOOK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS 
April 2024
Nature is Infrastructure: How to Include Natural Assets  
in Asset Management Plans
2/	 A threats-based approach that examines the range of potential threats 
to natural assets. In this context, the term threat (i.e., something that 
is dangerous or likely to cause damage) is intended to capture the 
range of issues that could damage natural assets and impact the flow 
of services over time (e.g., overuse, extreme weather events, pollution, 
etc.).34
3/	 A probability and consequence of asset failure approach, more 
commonly used for traditional asset management. This approach has 
the advantage of being more directly comparable with what most local 
governments are doing for their built assets. This approach can also be 
combined with the threats-based approach. 
4.1	 Addressing Risk Qualitatively
At the most general level, the purpose of risk consideration in an asset 
management plan is to help prioritize where to invest limited lifecycle 
management dollars. In this context, consideration of risk can be as simple as a 
qualitive assessment of key risks framed around LOS and required investments 
in lifecycle management costs. For instance, in Ontario, O. Reg 588/17 requires 
local government to consider: 
	
 The cost associated with maintaining the current levels of service 
considering risks associated with lifecycle management activities. 
	
 That risks are considered when assessing options for lifecycle activities 
that could be undertaken to achieve proposed LOS.
	
 An “explanation of how the local government will manage the 
risks associated with not undertaking any of the lifecycle activities 
identified.”
	
 For local governments with a population greater than 25,000, an 
“overview of the risks associated with implementation of the asset 
management plan and any actions that would be proposed in response 
to those risks.”
For communities outside Ontario, the O. Reg 588/17 requirements provide a 
reasonable minimum level of effort for considering risk. The baseline approach 
should be to define the current and target LOS and to ensure risks are 
considered when developing management plans. This consideration of risk can 
be as simple as a qualitative description of the range of risks associated with 
the lifecycle management plan and anticipated consequences for the assets 
should those risks be realized. In other words, the consideration of risk can be 
achieved without completing a formal risk assessment approach. However, some 
local governments may be well-positioned to complete a more sophisticated 
34  It is important to note that the threats-based approach is different from the standard of 
practice commonly applied to built assets. Where the standard asset management approach 
focuses on probability and consequence of an asset failing, the threats based approach 
focuses on the likelihood of a threat occurring and the impact that threat could have on 
natural assets if it did occur.

risk assessment. Those local governments can consider either of the approaches 
presented in sections 4.2 and 4.3 to considering risk. 
4.2	 Threats-based Approach to Considering Risk
One way to consider the risk to LOS provided by natural assets is to assess the 
range of threats35 natural assets are exposed to. Natural assets can withstand 
a certain amount of stress and, in many cases, can “self-repair” when damaged 
over time, as long as the damage is not too severe or sustained, and as long 
as the asset is not subject to a succession of stressors or already in a poor 
condition. Within this context, degradation or damage to one component of a 
natural asset may not have a significant impact on the overall LOS (e.g., loss of 
one tree will likely have a minor impact on overall forest or canopy cover and 
the associated services). This resiliency is one of the many reasons natural 
assets have been identified as a critical part of the solution to deal with certain 
infrastructure and climate change-related challenges. Nonetheless, cumulative 
effects and/or exposure to multiple stressors can cause even the most resilient 
natural assets to reach tipping points, causing cascading or widespread failure 
of the assets. Therefore, one approach to assessing risks to natural assets is 
to consider the range of threats to which natural assets may be exposed. Such 
an assessment examines the exposure of natural assets to a range of threats 
that, taken together, could have the potential of triggering tipping points or 
thresholds beyond which LOS can be significantly impacted.
An assessment using this approach considers the range of threats or issues that 
natural assets might be subject to along with the relative impact and likelihood 
of those threats. Specifically, such an assessment involves the following steps:
1/	 Identify relevant threats 
2/	 Assign impact rating to each threats
3/	 Assign likelihood rating to each threats
4/	 Calculate the risk score
5/	 Allocate the risk scores to the relevant natural assets 
These steps are elaborated on in the sub-sections that follow.
4.2.1	 Identify Relevant Threats 
A threats-based assessment begins with the identification of threats that are 
relevant to the natural assets within the geographic area under consideration. 
These are threats that could negatively impact the natural assets and hence 
their ability to deliver services. Table 12 contains a set of common threats to 
natural assets that can act as a starting place in identifying relevant threats. 
35  This approach could also be referred to as a hazards-based approach however, for this 
Guidance Document a decision was made to refer to threats rather than hazards to avoid 
confusion with hazards in the context of hazard trees or the use of this term in the context 
of the mandate of Conservation Authorities where hazards has a well-defined defined and 
disparate meaning.

To refine the list of relevant threats it is useful to connect with knowledgeable 
stakeholders and subject matter experts. As part of the threat identification 
exercise, the threats can be defined in the local context. For example, 
extreme wind events might be defined as hurricane events in coastal areas or 
downburst/tornado events in other regions of the country. 
Climate change-related threats are identified in Table 12 (marked by an *). These 
climate-related threats are likely to increase in intensity and frequency over 
time. To the extent that a community is prone to significant climate-related 
threats, threats-based assessments should be carried out more frequently. The 
assessment gives practitioners a picture of the risk profile to their natural assets 
at a point in time. Frequent updates are needed to ensure that the increased 
intensity and frequency of climate-related threats are reflected in the results 
and thus taken into consideration when planning and prioritizing management 
activities. 
4.2.2	 Assign Impact Rating 
Once the list of relevant threats is confirmed, the next step is to assign a relative 
impact rating to each threat. The impact rating describes the degree of damage 
to the natural assets from the occurrence of the particular threat. The impact 
rating can be informed by existing data and information, past experience with 
threat events, and subject matter expertise. 
As noted above, impact scores are commonly assigned based on a five-point 
scale. Table 13 contains sample impact rating definitions. These or similar 
definitions can be used to assign impact ratings to the various threats. When 
defining the scale for the relative impact of threats, local governments may find 
it useful to consider the scale used for built assets.

4.2.3	 Assign Likelihood Rating
The next step is to allocate a likelihood rating on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is rare 
and 5 is almost certain. Table 14 demonstrates some likelihood ratings that can 
be considered for the threats to natural assets. As with the impact ratings, local 
governments can use a likelihood rating scale comparable to the one used for 
built assets.

4.2.4	 Calculate the Risk Score
With the impact and likelihood scores established for each threat, the next step 
is to calculate the risk score. The risk score is the product of the impact rating 
and likelihood rating. By multiplying the impact rating by the likelihood rating, 
an overall risk score is derived (Figure 5).

4.2.5	 Allocate the Risk Scores to Relevant Natural Assets 
With the risk scores established for each threat, the next step is to determine 
which natural assets are most likely to be impacted by those risks. This can 
be done by first identifying the type of natural asset that will be subject to 
the particular risk, and then identifying the specific assets (of that type) that 
the risks would apply to. Existing documentation or information, including 
for example, vulnerability assessments and expert knowledge can inform the 
allocation of risks to natural assets. A set of risk allocation criteria can also be 
useful in this regard.
Table 15 provides a sample of allocation criteria by risk. The table links the risks 
with the relevant asset types and then within those asset types, the allocation 
assumptions that will determine the specific assets that will be subject to the 
risks. For example, while a broad range of asset types have the potential to be 
subject to encroachment, those that are located within 20 metres of private 
properties will ultimately be subject to this risk. Where allocation criteria are 
required, distribution assumptions and selection criteria can be established in 
consultation with relevant stakeholders and subject matter experts. The goal is 
to establish the most reasonable and sensible allocation assumptions for each 
risk based on the best available information. Over time, allocation assumptions 
can be updated and refined.

April 2024
Nature is Infrastructure: How to Include Natural Assets  
in Asset Management Plans
Once all the risks have been allocated to the appropriate assets, a total risk 
score can be developed for each asset based on the number of risks that asset 
is prone to.
The results of this assessment can be added into the asset inventory as an 
asset attribute. It will also inform the LOS measures and ultimately lifecycle 
management strategies. In this way, management strategies can be targeted 
towards those assets that provide significant services that are also exposed to 
greater risks. 
4.3	 Probability and Consequence of Failure Approach
For built assets, the common standard of practice is to rank risks to assets based 
on the probability and consequence of the given asset (or asset type) failing. 
These are typically defined as:
	
 Probability of Failure (PoF): The chance, or likelihood that the asset will 
fail.
	
 Consequence of Failure (CoF): The impact to the local government if the 
asset does fail.
An overall risk score for each asset (or asset type) can be generated by 
multiplying the PoF by the CoF score. For example:
Asset a risk score = CoF x PoF
Taking this approach local governments can assess natural asset risk by 
conducting an exercise that follows these steps:
1/	 Establish probability of failure
2/	 Establish consequence of failure
3/	 Calculate the risk score
Currently, there have not been any published approaches, or accepted norms, 
developed on how to apply the CoF and PoF approach to natural assets. Local 
governments who want to use this approach are encouraged to engage internal 
(or if necessary, external) expertise to help identify the best way to apply 
this approach to natural assets in the context of the government’s available 
information on natural assets. 
Given the resilience of most natural assets, the idea of a natural asset “failing” 
may not be overly obvious. A natural asset can certainly become significantly 
degraded, but the point of asset failure may be difficult to determine. For this 
reason, when considering the consequence and probability of failure it may 
be helpful to frame those assessments around different modes of failure. For 
instance, drawing from some recent thinking from the Toronto and Region 
Conservation Authority, three modes of failure can be considered:
50
GUIDEBOOK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS 
April 2024
Nature is Infrastructure: How to Include Natural Assets  
in Asset Management Plans
1/	 Functional failure – occurs when a natural asset physically fails or 
stops performing intended functions (e.g., loss of soil or vegetation, 
excessive sedimentation buildup in a wetland, excessive water pollution 
leading to a dysfunctional aquatic ecosystem, invasive species causing 
widespread tree mortality).
2/	 Capacity failure – occurs when a natural asset is functioning but 
does not have the capacity needed (e.g., precipitation exceeding 
drainage capacity, visitor density exceeds the forest capacity causing 
degradation).
3/	 Service failure – occurs when a natural asset is no longer providing the 
desired service level (e.g., natural asset lacks adequate biodiversity, 
compacted soils preventing infiltration).
4.3.1	 Establish Probability of Failure
The PoF in the context of built assets is often directly linked to the overall 
condition rating of an asset. As outlined in Table 16, establishing a PoF score for 
each asset is a matter of inverting the condition score. 
Table 16: Probability of Failure

The challenge with this approach for natural assets is that a natural asset is 
not likely to degrade over time unless negatively impacted by threats such 
as those described in the previous section. Thus, in the context of natural 
assets, it may be more appropriate to establish a PoF that is based not only 
on the condition of the assets (which may be accomplished through a desktop 
condition assessment or a fields-based assessment as articulated in Appendix D) 
but also the results of a threats-based risk assessment as articulated in the 
previous section. The rationale for using the condition results is based on the 
premise that the resilience of a natural asset is going to be higher for an asset 
in excellent condition, therefore its probability of failure would be lower. Table 
17 provides an example for how a threats-based risk assessment and condition 
ratings can be combined to generate a PoF score. 
51
GUIDEBOOK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS 
April 2024
Nature is Infrastructure: How to Include Natural Assets  
in Asset Management Plans
Note that Table 17 is provided as a guide for local governments to see how this 
approach can be executed and should not be interpreted as direction on how 
the PoF scores should be allocated.

The advantage of this approach is that PoF integrates an asset’s current 
condition and the anticipated exposure of the asset to a series of known threats. 
This means an asset that is in very poor condition with has high risks associated 
with it would have a higher PoF. In contrast, natural assets in excellent condition 
can be anticipated to be more resilient and have a lower or moderate PoF, even 
in the face of high risk from threats.

4.3.2	 Establish Consequence of Failure
The CoF is generally based on a scoring system defined by each local 
government. For instance, CoF scores might be defined as outlined in Table 18 
(adapted from the Municipal Finance Officers Association of Ontaio, 2018). 
Table 18: Consequence of Failure

The example in Table 18 is general enough that it can reasonably apply to 
natural assets. However, many local governments have developed more specific 
criteria and definitions for the asset management process. Local governments 
can refer to their asset management plans for built assets and develop a 
comparable scale for natural assets. To apply the CoF to natural assets, a local 
government should engage subject matter experts to help adapt the criteria 
used for built assets into something comparable and applicable to natural 
assets.

4.3.3	 Calculate the Risk Score
With the CoF and PoF scores established, the next step is to calculate the risk 
score. The risk score is the product of the CoF and PoF rating (Table 19).

Using this approach, the scores would get allocated to each natural asset based 
on a range of factors. The PoF would get assigned to each natural asset based in 
its condition rating, and (if available) an assessment of its exposure to threats. 
The CoF can be assigned to natural assets in a way that best suits the local 
government context. However, when assigning CoF based on the defined scoring 
system (e.g., Table 19), consideration of spatial variation in asset or sub-asset 
type and service provision is recommended. 
4.4	 Natural Asset Criticality 
Further to the specific approaches described above, the concept of asset 
criticality can be used to help narrow or target the focus of risk considerations 
and lifecycle management to assets deemed to be the most critical. Natural 
assets with the largest CoF would be considered to have higher criticality. 
For instance, natural assets are essential for mitigating urban heat impacts. 
Therefore, natural assets near residential or commercial areas could be 
considered more critical from the perspective of mitigating urban heat impacts. 
The challenge with natural assets is that they provide a wide range of beneficial 
services, which means an asset’s criticality will vary depending on the service(s) 
of interest. There are a couple ways this can be addressed: 
	
 Criticality can be based on an aggregation of ecosystem services 
provided, where assets that provide the most services are considered 
more critical.
54
GUIDEBOOK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS 
April 2024
Nature is Infrastructure: How to Include Natural Assets  
in Asset Management Plans
	
 Specific ecosystem services can be considered to have varying degrees 
of criticality, and those natural assets that are providing critical service 
can be prioritized.
	
 A combination of the above.
Criticality might also be considered based on a natural asset’s condition. 
In some highly urbanized communities, natural areas have become highly 
fragmented and isolated with limited potential for improvement. In such cases, 
focusing efforts on the remaining natural assets that are in better condition 
with greater connectivity and likelihood that their condition can be maintained 
or improved may be deemed critical. In other words, those assets in better 
condition would be considered the most critical since they are providing greater 
LOS and would have a greater consequence if damaged or lost. 
Regardless of how criticality is ultimately determined, the concept can be used 
to focus risk mitigation efforts.
4.5	 Risk Mitigation 
With an understanding of the risks facing natural assets, a risk response or 
mitigation strategy can be established. The strategy should include specific 
risk mitigation activities tailored to the natural assets under consideration. 
The City of Edmonton’s Urban Forest Asset Management Plan (2021) defines 
risk responses as planning and implementing actions to mitigate or avoid 
unacceptable risks. Depending on the types of natural assets and associated 
risks, risk mitigation actions can include restoring natural habitats to improve 
resilience against climate changes, implementing sustainable land use practices, 
and engaging in regular monitoring and maintenance of natural resources. In 
Table 20, current and future risk responses as articulated in Edmonton’s Urban 
Forest Asset Management Plan are identified.

4.6	 Residual Risk 
After implementing risk reduction strategies, it is essential to evaluate the 
remaining, or residual, risk. Residual risk is the level of risk that remains after all 
mitigation strategies have been applied. This step is crucial for understanding 
the effectiveness of the risk mitigation measures and for identifying any gaps in 
the management plan. 
56
GUIDEBOOK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS 
April 2024
Nature is Infrastructure: How to Include Natural Assets  
in Asset Management Plans
Monitoring activities are helpful in assessing the level of residual risk and 
ensuring it remains within acceptable bounds. Monitoring activities can consider 
the effectiveness of the management strategies in place. This can be done 
through field surveys, remote sensing technologies, and data collection. Periodic 
risk assessment updates in light of new information and/or changing conditions, 
such as climate change projections or demographic shifts, can also be helpful. 
Recognizing that residual risk exists, it is helpful to articulate a risk response 
plan. This plan should outline specific actions to be taken when encountering 
unavoidable risks to minimize impacts. Table 21 is a partial risk response plan

5 	Lifecycle Management 
Strategies
A key component of a natural asset management plan is the articulation of 
lifecycle management strategies. Lifecycle management strategies ensure the 
delivery of services over time while managing risks and costs. More specifically, 
the objective of lifecycle management is to identify and cost the planning, 
operations, maintenance, and renewal activities needed to maintain required 
LOS in the face of relevant risks. Ultimately, the lifecycle approach balances 
the need to provide continuous and reliable services within budget constraints 
(MFOA, 2018).
This section describes the application of lifecycle management strategies to 
natural assets. It begins with an articulation of the lifecycle stages of natural 
assets. Management actions associated with each stage are then described. 
Guidance is provided on how to cost the activities identified for each stage 
along with an overview of potential funding mechanisms. Examples of lifecycle 
management activities and their costs are provided where possible. 
5.1	 Natural Asset Lifecycle Stages
The lifecycle stages of built assets have been well defined. However, the 
application of such stages to the natural asset context is less established. 
Figure 6 demonstrates the lifecycle structure of natural assets. The main 
difference between the natural assets’ lifecycle and that of built infrastructure is 
that natural assets have no end of useful life.36
Figure 6: Lifecycle Management Stages that are the Focus of this Guidebook
36  To explore how natural assets can be applied to the lifecycle management strategy portion 
of an asset management plan, a number of lifecycle management frameworks were reviewed, 
described in Appendix C. While the stages and specific terminology used in this guidance 
differ slightly from the lifecycle examples described in Appendix C, the cycles largely align 
with respect to the main components of a natural asset’s lifecycle.
58
GUIDEBOOK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS 
April 2024
Nature is Infrastructure: How to Include Natural Assets  
in Asset Management Plans
The activities associated with the lifecycle stages of natural asset management 
are described below, with some examples. The following section shows how to 
estimate the lifecycle costs associated with these activities.
Non-infrastructure Solutions
Non-infrastructure solutions refer to strategies that municipalities can employ 
to meet service needs without relying on the construction or enhancement of 
physical infrastructure (MFOA, 2018). These solutions encompass a variety of 
approaches such as policy changes, demand management, and operational 
improvements. The key advantage of these solutions lies in their ability to 
provide effective service outcomes in a more cost-effective, and often faster, 
manner than traditional infrastructure projects. 
These types of approaches can be particularly beneficial for natural 
assets. Since the levels of service provided by natural assets to a given 
community are generated by the complete integrated system of natural 
features across the landscape (regardless of who owns the assets), 
lifecycle management strategies that focus only on municipally owned 
natural assets ignore the potential implications for the broader system of 
natural assets. Local governments have some influence over those assets 
through non-infrastructure-based approaches, such as establishing land 
use planning rules that protect natural heritage features, or investing in 
strategic stewardship and community outreach programs that foster better 
collective stewardship of the communities’ natural assets. While most local 
governments’ primary focus will be on publicly owned and managed natural 
assets, non-infrastructure solutions can be an important mechanism to 
achieve levels of service provided by natural assets on private land.
Other non-infrastructure solutions can be helpful in offsetting or avoiding 
certain operations and maintenance activities, such as leveraging demand 
management techniques to control access to overused areas, or use of signs 
and other communication tools to build awareness of negative impacts of 
inappropriate uses of natural assets. 
The City of Guelph is pursuing non-infrastructure solutions to incentivize its 
citizens to support stormwater management. Specifically, the City introduced 
a series of incentive programs including a rebate for rain gardens, a subsidy 
for backyard tree planting, a seasonal outdoor rainwater harvesting rebate, 
and subsidies for rain barrels. Such incentives can play a significant role in 
managing and delivering LOS even though they do not directly involve lifecycle 
management activities. For this reason, non-infrastructure solutions such 
as those pursued by Guelph are often incorporated into asset management 
plans.

in Asset Management Plans
5.2	 Plan and Design
As articulated in Figure 6, the lifecycle for natural assets includes four 
main stages, namely plan/design, construct/secure, monitor/manage, and 
rehabilitate/restore. The plan/design stage informs the subsequent stages 
with the specific planning activities varying depending on whether local 
governments are planning for monitor/manage, rehab/restore or construct/
secure. Regardless, a principle objective of the plan/design stage is to set local 
governments up for subsequent life cycle stages. Thus, at a minimum the plan/
design stage should involve data and information collection to understand 
the type, location, and extent of natural assets under the management of the 
local government. It should also take into consideration the service delivery 
objectives for natural assets and key risks to be managed (see Section 4). 
5.3	 Construct / Secure (New Assets)
In the context of constructing or securing new assets, the focus is on either 
securing/acquiring assets that already exist, or creating/constructing assets 
through restoration or naturalization. The first thing to do at this stage is to 
undertake the necessary planning activities. As articulated by the Credit Valley 
Conservation Authority (CVC, 2020), planning activities associated with the 
creation of new natural assets can include:
	
 Planning for the acquisition of existing natural assets:
	y Defining the geographic area to be acquired based on criteria 
established by the local government (e.g., biodiversity hotspots, 
protection from natural hazards, resilience to flooding, expansion of 
trail networks, etc.)
	y Mapping the assets present in the acquisition area
	y Negotiating acquisition terms and conditions
	y Establishing allowable uses of the acquired assets
	
 Planning for the creation of new natural assets on lands already owned 
by the municipality:
	y Developing conceptual and detailed designs
	y Defining planting regimes
	y Defining species composition
	y Order seeds, saplings and materials as needed
	y Contracting
	
 Acquiring necessary permits and approvals
	
 Engaging with Indigenous groups, as well as consulting with other 
agencies, the public, or other rightsholders and stakeholders
60
GUIDEBOOK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS 
April 2024
Nature is Infrastructure: How to Include Natural Assets  
in Asset Management Plans
After planning is complete, constructing/securing new assets may involve a 
range of other activities, including:
	
 Land acquisition
	
 Site preparation
	
 Materials, equipment, and supplies
	
 Planting and vegetation establishment
This stage of the lifecycle could also include some basic maintenance 
activities associated with asset creation to ensure the successful survival and 
establishment of the natural features, such as watering and mulching.
5.4	 Monitor and Manage
An effective maintenance strategy for natural assets can significantly improve 
the assets’ long-term resilience ensuring they continue to provide the desired 
LOS. A well-structured maintenance plan serves as a proactive measure to 
manage resources effectively and ensures their reliability and performance. By 
prioritizing regular and strategic maintenance (i.e., monitoring and management) 
activities, municipalities can minimize service disruptions and avoid the higher 
costs associated with emergency repairs or premature asset replacement. 
To start, local governments will want to undertake plan/design activities related 
to the monitor/manage life cycle stage. Activities that might be undertaken when 
planning for monitor/manage include:
	
 Identifying the types of activities that are to be undertaken
	
 Identifying the frequency and timing of activities
	
 Identifying the level of effort required for the activities
Activities that should be undertaken during this stage in the lifecycle for natural 
assets include:
	
 Maintenance activities that will help the natural assets become (if 
recently established) or stay self-sustaining and resilient.
	
 Monitoring of assets for key indicators of hydrologic and ecological 
functions which can inform condition assessments.
	
 Well-established assets that have not been subject to negative impacts 
or a catastrophic event may not require much maintenance work. 
Activities for such assets should focus on longer-term monitoring 
and pre-emptive management needs (e.g., pruning, invasive species 
management, human use management).
In partnership with NAI, the Town of Gibsons, BC, carried out the Source to Sea 
project, which focused on evaluating and managing the natural assets within 
the Gibsons’ Aquifer 360 Watershed. Part of that project entailed the articulation 
of operations and maintenance needs for the wetland and forest assets within

The City of Edmonton’s Urban Forest Asset Management Plan (2021) also 
demonstrates a range of activities that can be included as a part of monitoring 
and management. The plan organized and summarized the activities into four 
work categories:
1/	 Inspections: these can vary from checking that the asset is functioning 
as expected to measuring and assessing condition or performance. 
2/	 Operations: these are routine activities necessary to maintain natural 
assets’ function and resilience.
3/	 Preventative maintenance: these are regularly scheduled activities to 
maintain condition and avoid deterioration of a natural asset. 
4/	 Corrective maintenance: these are activities or interventions associated 
with a natural asset that has been significantly impacted by an external 
impact (e.g., extreme weather, invasive species, damage caused by 
overuse of people).
Within these categories, Edmonton’s plan identifies specific activities across the 
range of urban forest assets. Some of the operations and maintenance activities 
for grassland naturalization and naturally wooded assets are summarized in 
Table 23.

•	 Restoration of

When identifying monitor/manage activities, it may be necessary to prioritize 
some activities over others. Several factors can help inform the prioritization. 
One such consideration is LOS. A local government may want to prioritize or 
target management actions in locations of greater human traffic where LOS are 
more important. The City of Edmonton (2021) relates maintenance activities 
to technical and customer LOS. For example, their “tree risk assessments are 
completed more frequently in areas close to human activity such as picnic 
tables, playgrounds, and along transportation corridors and pathways.” 
63
GUIDEBOOK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

Nature is Infrastructure: How to Include Natural Assets  
in Asset Management Plans
A prioritization strategy for natural asset operation and maintenance efforts 
might also consider variations in the criticality of natural assets’ contribution to 
core services provided by the municipality, because operation and maintenance 
activities should be strategically allocated to critical assets when resources are 
limited. Priority activities can be communicated in the lifecycle management 
strategy. This can be helpful in allocating resources when facing staff or 
budgetary constraints. The City of Edmonton’s 2021 plan defined operation and 
maintenance activities into three categories: urgent work, essential work, and 
less essential or desirable work (Table 24).

5.5	 Rehabilitate and Restore
To understand activities associated with rehabilitate/restore, it is useful to 
distinguish between monitor/manage and rehab/restore. Monitor/manage 
is focused on preserving the existing condition and functionality of an 
asset, ensuring its continued operation at current levels. Rehab/restore, by 
comparison, involves significant repair to extend the life and enhance the 
performance of existing assets (MFOA, 2018). Substantial rehabilitation and 
restoration can be expected in response to specific impacts or damage due 
to unmitigable risk events or from cumulative long-term degradation causing 
the asset’s functioning to be significantly impaired. This would be the case, for 
instance, when a natural asset has been either impacted by an extreme event 
(e.g., forest fire) or is in a degraded condition that requires intervention more 
significant than typical operation and maintenance activities.
As with the other life cycle stages, there are planning activities that will take 
place as part of rehab/restore; the goal of these activities is to improve asset 
condition, improve an assets resilience to anticipated risks, or to respond to 
certain extreme hazard events that require reactive rehabilitation. Within this 
context, planning activities for rehab/restore could include:
	
 Assessing restoration needs for the targeted site(s)
	
 Developing site plans and designs for the restoration activities
	
 Acquiring necessary permits and approvals
	
 Determining which assets maybe more susceptible to certain risks
	
 Engaging with Indigenous groups, as well as consulting with other 
agencies, the public, or other stakeholders and rightsholders
Table 25 summarizes how rehab/restore was factored into Edmonton’s (2021) 
Urban Forest Asset Management Plan for some of Edmonton’s natural assets.

6 	Financial Strategy
Once the lifecycle management activities have been established for each 
lifecycle stage, the next task in developing an asset management plan is to 
consider the lifecycle costs associated with those activities. The costs can then 
be assessed against the available budget and new funding sources considered 
to the extent necessary. This section focuses on how to estimate lifecycle 
management costs, linking the costs to target levels of service, and establishing 
a long-term funding strategy.
6.1	 Establishing Lifecycle Management Costs
The lifecycle management costs should include the cost of all identified 
activities for each stage of the lifecycle (construct/secure, operate/maintain, 
rehabilitate/restore). This should be done in the context of LOS and risk and 
criticality as per Figure 7. 
Figure 7: Establishing Lifecycle Costs in the Context of Levels of Service and Risk
As is described in Figure 7, lifecycle management costs are driven by the lifecycle 
management activities (across the lifecycle stages) that, when considered in 
the context of risk and criticality, will deliver the established community and 
technical LOS to ensure corporate LOS are achieved. The link between cost, 
lifecycle activities, risk and criticality, and LOS are described in the following 
sub-sections, along with other important lifecycle cost considerations, 
specifically demand forecasting and life cycle management scenarios. In 
addition to these factors, consideration should be given to the following: 
66
GUIDEBOOK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS 
April 2024
Nature is Infrastructure: How to Include Natural Assets  
in Asset Management Plans
	
 The time period over which estimates will be established. The lifecycle 
costs should be estimated over a predefined timeline that is relevant to 
the municipality’s asset management planning horizon. 
	
 Assumptions related to inflation rates and projecting costs into the 
future. Historical data can be helpful in informing expected future costs 
and inflation rates. Variables should be periodically updated to reflect 
the most recent historical data available. 
6.1.1	 Linking Lifecycle Management Costs to Levels of 
Service
As is depicted in Figure 7, when establishing lifecycle management cost, it can 
be helpful to organize the assessment around identified LOS categories. For 
each LOS, local governments should consider the metric as well as the current 
and target performance. They should then assess what the management cost 
would be to maintain the current performance and/or to achieve the target 
performance. More specifically, consideration should be given to:
	
 Capacity and use related LOS that inform the need for expansion 
activities (i.e., the need to construct and secure new natural assets).
	y Table 26 provides examples of capacity LOS related to the amount 
of owned natural assets and the percent of canopy cover. In this 
example, to assess the lifecycle management cost, local governments 
should consider what the associated capital cost would be to achieve 
the desired increase in natural asset ownership or canopy cover. The 
table also contains a capacity and use example related to restoration 
to add natural assets (i.e., restore land that is not currently in a 
natural state). Here, consideration should be given to the capital 
costs associated with the restoration.
	
 Functioning related LOS inform the need for upgrading activities (i.e., 
the need to rehabilitate or restore natural assets).
	y Table 26 provides an example of a function LOS related to restoration 
activities associated with restoring an existing asset that has 
degraded. In this example, to assess the lifecycle management cost, 
local governments should consider what the associated operating 
cost would be to achieve the desired restored area per year. 
	
 Quality and reliability LOS inform the need for operation and 
maintenance activities (i.e., to monitor and maintain natural assets).
	y Table 26 provides examples of quality LOS related to ecological 
condition and biodiversity. In this example, to assess the lifecycle 
management cost, local governments should consider what the 
associated operational cost would be to achieve the desired increase 
in the state of good repair, or the percent of area dominated by 
invasive species.

Estimating the lifecycle management costs to maintain current performance or 
achieve target performance should consider the range of anticipated activities 
noted in Section 5. Cost estimates can be based on historical cost information or 
data on hand related to historical activities. Alternatively, Table 27 (adapted from 
CVC, 2020) contains sample lifecycle costs for a range of natural assets according 
to the lifecycle stages identified in the associated report. These costs should be 
considered illustrative and would need to be vetted for each local government. 
Nonetheless, CVC (2020) provides a framework that municipalities can follow or 
use as a template to help anticipate what typical life cycle management costs 
might be for their own natural assets.

Note that the table above does not show costs associated with implementing 
non-infrastructure solutions. Non-infrastructure solutions do typically 
impact a local government’s operating budget and should also be included 
in the financial strategy. For example, the cost to deliver an educational and 
awareness-building program to enable households to manage source water 
onsite needs to be adequately planned and budgeted for, even though it does 
not involve direct management of natural assets. 
6.1.2	 Accounting for Risk
Lifecycle costing should also consider risk management and include appropriate 
contingencies. Indeed, an important risk treatment is allocating funding for 
contingencies. Lifecycle management strategies and their associated costs can 
be impacted by several factors beyond the control of the asset manager. It can 
therefore be prudent to consider such possibilities and factor in contingencies 
when articulating the lifecycle management costs. Risk factors that can influence 
lifecycle costs include: 
	
 Extreme weather events that divert resources away from planned 
operation and maintenance activities.
	
 Drought and heat stress that impact the survival of newly planted 
natural assets. 
	
 Human resource constraints.
	
 Legislation and regulations (e.g., species at risk) that could restrict 
activities to certain locations or times of the year.

6.1.3	 Lifecycle Management Activities
Driven by established LOS and considering risks, lifecycle management activities 
are then identified and costed. This includes the cost of all identified activities 
for each stage of the lifecycle (construct/secure, monitor/manage, rehabilitate/
restore:
	
 Construction and securing costs should be linked to a local 
government’s planned development or expansion of their natural 
asset portfolio. This should consider estimating costs associated with 
securing new natural assets as part of the development process, or 
other securement mechanism as well as afforestation or any activities 
required to bring the asset up to the local government’s standards and 
LOS.
	
 Monitoring and management costs are regularly scheduled costs 
associated with the inspection and maintenance of assets. To establish 
operate/maintain costs, assumptions can be made about the frequency 
of inspections, and preventative, and corrective maintenance activities. 
Such assumptions can be grounded in the need to maintain the 
condition of the natural assets to ensure the required LOS continues. 
	
 Rehabilitation and restoration costs can be more challenging to 
estimate for natural assets relative to built assets as the lifecycle of 
natural assets is not tied to an end-of-life the in the way built assets 
are. For instance, as noted in Section 5.5 it is not possible to predict 
rehabilitation costs since they are not necessarily correlated with age. 
If a municipality has identified priority areas for restoration activities, 
assumptions related to the timing of those activities can be built into 
the lifecycle management cost forecast. While Edmonton’s Urban 
Forest Asset Management Plan notes possible rehabilitation options 
associated with natural assets, it states that these options are not 
included in the lifecycle cost forecasts due to insufficient data available 
to determine the frequency of their occurrence, or their unit costs. This 
is indeed a challenge for costing the lifecycle management for natural 
assets since the need for rehabilitation or restoration activities are not 
as predictable as with built assets. With natural assets the need for 
rehab/restore arises periodically due to random external events, or as 
a result of many years of neglect, which should be avoidable through 
ongoing preventative and corrective maintenance. Communities that 
have invested in restoration activities can leverage that work to inform 
and cost this stage of the lifecycle management strategy.
6.1.4	 Demand Forecasting
Demand forecasting is an important consideration when assessing lifecycle 
management costs. Demand forecasting in the context of asset management is 
the process of predicting future demand for assets and their associate services. 
It is a crucial step in infrastructure and asset management, as it aids in decision-

in Asset Management Plans
making and planning for future needs, and allocates resources efficiently to 
maintain, replace, or expand their asset base. Lee et al. (2004) highlights the 
importance of demand forecasting in infrastructure asset management, outlining 
its significance in effective planning and resource allocation. 
Demand Forecasting and O. Reg 588/17
In Ontario, O. Reg. 588/17 outlines requirements with respect to LOS 
that every municipality, with a population over 25,000, shall prepare 
an asset management plan and develop demand forecasting for every 
asset class. While the literature on natural asset demand forecasting 
may currently be limited, there exists a valuable opportunity to 
draw upon the well-established methodologies employed for built 
infrastructure demand forecasting and to adapt them to the unique 
context of natural asset by leveraging the transferable aspects of 
these methodologies. 
The process of demand forecasting encompasses various considerations. A 
report from the UK’s National Infrastructure Commission (2017) highlights that 
economic growth significantly influences the demand for infrastructure services. 
The report emphasizes GDP and income as critical factors in demand forecasting. 
As population and wealth increase, there is typically an increase in the demand 
for infrastructure services, including heightened consumption of energy and 
water, and increased waste generation (National Infrastructure Commission, 
2017). In the context of natural assets, expansion of traditional infrastructure, 
increased urban development, and population growth can all put additional 
pressure and demand on natural assets. Therefore, the financial strategy for 
natural assets should also consider anticipated changes in demand for natural 
assets and their associated services. 
Using forest assets as an example, predicting future demand for such an asset 
is vital for sustainable forest management. Economic growth can significantly 
influence the demand for services provided by forest assets. As population 
grows, there may be increased demand for recreational opportunities and higher 
interest in ecosystem services like clean air and water, or urban heat reduction. 
Another aspect of increased demand for natural assets that may need to 
be considered is the potential for increased damage to natural assets. One 
significant concern is the risk of overuse, which can result in heightened 
operations and maintenance costs related to preserving and maintaining 
natural ecosystems. As demand for nature-based recreational activities grows, 
there is potentially a corresponding need to balance conservation objectives 
with the use of natural resources. Moreover, the increasing demand for natural 
assets could expose them to a heightened risk from invasive species. With 
greater human activity and movement between different regions, the likelihood 
of introducing non-native species into natural ecosystem rises. As a result, 
managing invasive species may become a critical component of natural assets 
operations and maintenance efforts as demand increases.

The City of Edmonton’s Urban Forest Asset Management Plan (2021) provides 
an example of how to incorporate demand forecasting into natural asset 
management planning. It provides a comprehensive overview of the demand 
drivers for urban forest assets, focusing on growth and future demand. This 
plan outlines key demand drivers, including population growth, legislative 
changes, climate shifts, public awareness, quality of life, economic factors, and 
technological advancements, and their anticipated impact on urban forest 
services. Understanding the factors that influence the natural assets and 
associated services is crucial for adapting to a dynamic world. An excerpt of the 
demand drivers for urban forest assets and their anticipated impact on services 
are shown in Table 28.

The final step in demand forecasting is to establish a comprehensive and 
adaptive response to the forecasted demand. The City of London, Ontario’s 
Corporate Asset Management Plan (2023) offers dynamic responses to forecasted 
forest demand, encompassing strategic planning, innovative planting solutions, 
efficient resource management, and public awareness initiatives. Given the 
constraints posed by urban growth and the specific impacts on street trees and 
tree canopy cover, the response prioritizes innovative planting strategies that 
extend beyond traditional urban spaces. A notable example is the collaboration 
between the Rapid Transit team and Parks and Forestry, where alternative 
planting sites near main Rapid Transit corridors were identified, both offsetting 
tree loss and improving the urban environment. The initiative to plant 600 – 700 
trees along the Wellington and East Link corridors reflects a proactive effort 
to preserve tree canopy cover. Despite constraints like limited space, London’s 
commitment to a 1:1 tree replacement ratio is key, as shown by its goal to plant 
a minimum of 3,000 trees annually to meet the 2065 tree canopy cover goals. 
The City of Edmonton’s Urban Forest Asset Management Plan (2021) projects 
a significant expansion in its urban forest assets, categorized by maintained 
trees, natural areas, and naturalized areas. Edmonton anticipates an annual net 
increase of approximately 7,500 maintained trees, factoring in both additions 
and losses due to urban development, resulting in an addition of 375,000 
maintained trees over the next 50 years. Regarding natural areas, Edmonton 
established the goal of owning 6,400 ha of natural areas, including 3,200 ha 
of naturally wooded areas. This goal involves acquiring an average of 28 ha of 
naturally wooded areas per year over the next 50 years, while ensuring no loss 
of current natural areas to development. The plan also forecasts a substantial 
increase in naturalized areas, from 745 ha to 3,100 ha, through a combination of 
planting and natural growth.
6.1.5	 Lifecycle Management Strategy Scenarios
Developing and assessing lifecycle management scenarios can help ensure 
balance and weigh the trade-offs between costs and service levels. The specific 
scenarios will likely vary by local government and their individual strategic 
priorities and local context. However, some possible scenarios to consider might 
include:
	
 Variations in anticipated future demand
	
 Differences between maintaining current LOS and meeting desired LOS
	
 Exploring differences between improving the overall state of natural 
assets, versus maintaining the current state of such assets

6.2	 Long-term Financial Needs Assessment
The ultimate objective of lifecycle management strategies and costing is to 
assess the long-term financial needs for natural asset management. Specifically, 
the financial needs assessment should address whether the current level of 
funding is sufficient to meet the current and target LOS. Questions a financial 
needs assessment should attempt to answer include:
	
 What lifecycle activities are required to meet the target LOS?
	
 Does current funding level provide enough resources to achieve target 
LOS?
	
 Is there a funding gap, and if so, how much additional funding is 
needed?
	
 If the funding gap is not able to be addressed, what is the impact on the 
desired LOS?
	
 Does the current funding enable sufficient reserves to account for 
future needs (intergenerational equity)? 
The financial needs assessment should draw on and summarize the information 
and analysis described in Section 6.1. The results of the lifecycle management 
costs needed to meet target LOS should then be compared with current capital 
and operating budget funding to draw attention to any anticipated funding gaps.

7 	Funding Sources 
Once a long-term financial needs assessment has been completed and funding 
needs have been compared against available funding, a local government should 
have a general sense of whether the available funding is suitable to achieve the 
target LOS. When available funding is not sufficient, funding sources will need 
to be considered to help close the funding gap. This section reviews a range of 
potential funding sources local governments might consider in the process of 
closing the funding gap.
Natural asset management funding sources refer to the various approaches 
and mechanisms used to fund the conservation and sustainable management 
of natural assets. Common types of funding sources are identified in Table 29. 
These funding sources can be leveraged to help ensure lifecycle management 
strategies are sufficiently financed. This section provides a general overview 
of potential sources and is not intended to be comprehensive or prescriptive. 
Rather, the purpose is to provide an overview and examples as a starting point 
or source of inspiration for local governments.
Table 29: Funding Sources Available to Support Lifecycle Asset Management Strategies
TYPES OF COMMON 
FINANCING 
STRATEGIES
DESCRIPTION
Direct Financing
This strategy involves covering capital costs through taxation, imposed user 
fees, or issuing debt at the time of acquiring assets or project kickoff. Debt 
repayments including principal and interest become part of the municipality’s 
future operating expenses. 
This method is suitable for assets with shorter lifespans or lower values. 
High interest rate environments significantly affect the attractiveness of this 
method.
 Dedicated Funds
Municipalities can transfer a portion of the operating budgets annually to 
a dedicated capital fund. This practice aims to accumulate funds for future 
capital projects and can earn interest, amplifying the contributions made. 
Self-sustaining (Revolving fund): A dedicated fund that replenishes itself 
through the revenue or savings it generates from its investments. This model 
allows for continuous funding of projects without the need for additional 
external capital, promoting long-term financial sustainability. 
External Grants
Municipalities can obtain grants from other levels of government or 
government bodies. It is essential for municipalities to stay informed about 
these programs, understand the criteria for approving capital projects, and 
have a formal asset management plan in place. Being proactive and prepared 
in meeting the acceptance criteria helps ensure compliance and avoid delays. 
It is crucial to only include grants as funding sources if there is a reasonable 
assurance of approval and receipt, as listing unconfirmed grants can create an 
overly optimistic financial strategy.

TYPES OF COMMON 
FINANCING 
STRATEGIES
DESCRIPTION
Beneficiary 
Contributions
This approach involves financing capital projects by collecting contributions 
from taxpayers who directly benefit from them. Charges can be collected 
over multiple years with favorable interest rates and the municipality should 
evaluate whether the projects primarily benefit specific landowners or have a 
broader community benefit.
Community Fundraising
In some cases, citizen groups may have an interest in fundraising for 
community projects, such as recreation centers, libraries, park equipment, etc. 
Caution should be exercised in projecting anticipated funding from this source. 
Unless firm agreements are in place, with guaranteed amounts of funding 
identified, a conservative approach should be taken to quantifying donations 
as part of the financing strategy. 
Development cost charges (DCC) are frequently cited as potential funding 
sources to support the rehabilitation of natural assets. In British Columbia, 
for example, DCCs are instrumental in facilitating the rehabilitation of natural 
assets, provided the initiative aligns with the criteria of a capital expenditure 
that supports a qualifying service. Additionally, this is contingent upon the 
restoration and enhancement activities directly or indirectly benefiting 
the development on which the charge is levied. Collaborative agreements 
between local governments and First Nations regarding service provision can 
be significant for natural asset protection strategies. These partnerships are 
beneficial in minimizing infrastructure redundancy, sharing both capital and 
operation expenses, and capitalizing on economies of scale.
In the context of acquiring operational funds, a notable example is the 
Environmental Reserve Fund established by the District of West Vancouver, 
BC.38 The fund’s primary application is to support initiatives that preserve and 
safeguard the natural environment. The fund is also used to address climate 
change through dedicated response strategies, mitigation efforts, and adaptive 
measures.
Some funding sources are more amenable to specific lifecycle stages. The 
Municipal Finance Officers’ Association (2018) presents a framework that aligns 
various funding sources with different asset lifecycle stages. An adapted version 
of the MFOA framework is presented in Figure 8. While the MFOA’s framework 
was developed for built assets, it is also suitable for the management of natural 
assets.

Figure 8: Financing Sources and Lifecycle Stages
Faced with the pressures of climate change, aging infrastructure, and significant 
budget constraints, local governments in Canada are pursuing a range of 
funding options to finance natural asset management and ensure the continued 
delivery of LOS. The City of Kitchener, ON, for example, implemented stormwater 
user fees to support natural assets for stormwater management.39 Kitchener 
previously relied on property tax revenues to fund its stormwater services. 
However, this approach places stormwater management in competition for 
funding with other municipal services such as parks, transportation, and social 
services. In response, Kitchener introduced stormwater charges, creating a 
stable and dedicated funding source specifically for maintaining, operating, and 
upgrading its stormwater infrastructure. The stormwater user fee is based on 
how much stormwater runoff a property owner creates. The stormwater runoff 
is determined by how much of the property is covered in impervious surfaces 
(i.e., buildings, driveways, and parking lots). Non-residential properties, which 
typically have larger areas of these impervious surfaces, generally incur higher 
stormwater fees, reflecting their larger contribution to stormwater runoff. The

monthly charges vary according to property type, with rates starting at $11.24 per 
month for small, detached homes with a building footprint of 105 m² or less and 
escalating up to $3,818.29 for non-residential properties with more than 39,035 
m² of impervious area.
The City of Toronto introduced the Green Debenture Program to fund natural 
asset management activities.40 Green or conservation bonds are increasingly 
popular as a financing option for municipalities to fund major projects. The 
program leverages advantageous borrowing rates to finance environmental 
capital projects. The program, which has successfully raised $630 million across 
three investment rounds, demonstrates this strategy in action. The proceeds 
are dedicated to various eco-friendly projects, including the Port Lands Flood 
Protection project41, a critical initiative for rehabilitating natural assets.

Appendix A: Natural Asset 
Management and Conservation 
Management Plans
A natural asset management plan refers to the application of public asset 
management planning to natural assets. This is typically a high-level plan 
intended to guide investments in infrastructure asset management at the 
corporate level over a minimum 10-year time frame, factoring in key information 
related to criticality of the assets and associated risks to the provision of 
services. This should be considered distinct from a detailed conservation, 
natural heritage, or site-specific management plan, which is akin to an 
operations and maintenance plan for built assets. If such detailed management 
plans exist, they can be used to inform the broader natural asset management 
plan. However, it is not the intent of an asset management plan to provide 
prescriptive site-specific plans for natural assets. The table below compares 
asset management plans with conservation management plans. 
ASSET MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR THE 
NATURAL ASSETS’ ASSET CLASS OR GROUP 
(ORGANIZATION-WIDE)
CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT PLAN OR 
NATURAL HERITAGE MANAGEMENT PLAN 
(SITE SPECIFIC) 
A long-term investment plan (10+ years) that 
outlines the current or desired LOS for natural 
assets, organization-wide, the risks to be managed, 
and the estimated costs to implement the lifecycle 
management strategy for the assets.
A management plan for a natural heritage system 
or protected area. May comprise most natural 
assets of significance within the local government 
jurisdiction or may focus on a specific natural area. 
May include non-infrastructure solutions that 
seek to influence stewardship of natural assets on 
private lands. 
Focus is on management of publicly owned assets, 
within the local government`s direct sphere of 
influence. 
May consider core services and co-benefits 
derived from natural assets outside of the local 
government`s jurisdiction (e.g. watershed scale), 
such as stormwater services, source water quality 
and quantity. 
Focus is on conservation to sustain ecosystem 
health. 
May require collaboration with neighbouring 
jurisdictions, provincial or federal governments, 
private landowners, Indigenous Nations, and the 
broader community. 
May require collaboration with stakeholders 
and rightsholders that influence conservation 
outcomes in the plan area.
Represents one over-arching, high level investment 
plan for the whole organization. 
Multiple management plans for natural areas 
throughout the local government`s jurisdiction may 
be needed. May identify restoration priorities in 
specific areas and include a detailed operations 
and maintenance plan for the specific plan area. 
Should align with existing master plans, studies, 
heritage system management plans, Official 
Community Plans, etc. 
Should align with levels of service articulated in 
organization-wide asset management plans and 
policies.

shown in Figure 9. The first stage, land use planning, sets the direction for the 
type and scale of infrastructure that will be needed in a community. Subsequent 
lifecycle stages consider asset design, procurement and construction, operation 
and maintenance, renewal, and finally retirement of assets. 
Figure 9: Asset management lifecycle stages, adopted from Asset Management BC (2019).
The City of Edmonton, through their Urban Forest Asset Management Plan, 
articulates a lifecycle for natural assets as outlined in Figure 10. The lifecycle 
components identified in Edmonton’s Urban Forest Asset Management Plan 
largely align with those articulated by Asset Management BC, although the 
defined stages and specific language employed differ slightly.

Figure 10: Asset Lifecycle, Adopted from Edmonton’s Urban Forest Asset Management 
Plan (2021)
A lifecycle framework for natural assets was developed for the Credit Valley 
Conservation Authority (CVC, 2020). This framework recognizes two lifecycle 
management cycles for the municipalities in Peel region, as depicted in 
Figure 11. As is shown in the figure, the lifecycle of assets that have an end 
of life (e.g., street trees) differs from those that don’t (e.g., forest or wetland 
areas). The CVC lifecycle is similar to that of Asset Management BC (2019) and 
City of Edmonton (2021) in a number of ways. It starts with a ‘plan, inventory, 
and assess’ phase, which encompasses strategizing for existing natural assets or 
planning the development of new assets. This is followed by an ‘establishment’ 
phase, which involves the creation, establishment, or replacement of the asset. 
The subsequent phases focus on monitoring and management, both in the short 
and long term. Finally, for assets with a finite lifespan there is a ‘removal’ phase.

The Role of Conservation Authorities in Natural 
Asset Management 
	
1.0	 Introduction to Conservation Authorities in Ontario 
Conservation Authorities (CAs) are distinctive organizations specific to Ontario, 
responsible for managing water and other natural resources at the watershed 
scale, rather than within political boundaries such as municipalities. The 
mandate of CAs is to undertake watershed-based programs to protect people 
and property from flooding and other natural hazards, and to conserve, 
restore and responsibly manage natural resources for economic, social and 
environmental benefits. There are 36 CAs in Ontario and they collectively oversee 
the watersheds encompassing 95% of the province’s population.
Although CAs are charitable or non-profit organizations, they are legislatively 
mandated by Ontario’s Conservation Authorities Act, 1946. Historically funded 
by the Province, in the 1990s most CAs transitioned to being funded primarily by 
the municipalities within their respective watersheds. Consequently, many of the 
services provided by CAs are intricately linked to the needs and resources of the 
municipalities they serve.1
	
2.0	 The Importance of the Watershed Scale
CAs operate at the scale of entire watersheds, aligning with both ecological and 
hydrological processes, and allowing for more comprehensive environmental 
management. Initially designed to address erosion and sedimentation, 
flooding, drought and degraded water quality, the watershed scale also proves 
instrumental in safeguarding drinking water sources, undertaking effective 
ecosystem restoration, and implementing adaptive management strategies for 
water resources and natural heritage systems. Managing at this scale ensures 
that the entire catchment area is considered together in decision making, 
reducing the downstream impacts of poor upstream conditions, and fostering a 
holistic approach to environmental conservation.

Authorities: Myth and Reality” by B. Mitchell & D. Shrubsole (1992), and “Conservation by the 
People: The Story of the Conservation Authorities in Ontario” by A.H. Richardson (1974).

in Asset Management Plans
Municipalities retain ownership and management responsibilities for many 
natural assets within their jurisdictions. Therefore, to operate at the watershed 
scale, collaboration is essential. Multiple CAs often exist within the boundaries 
of a single municipality and most CAs concurrently serve multiple municipalities. 
This highlights the intricate network of relationships necessary to implement 
effective watershed governance in Ontario.
	
3.0	 The Role of Conservation Authorities in Managing 
Natural Assets
CAs in Ontario play a crucial role in managing and protecting natural resources, 
including water, land, and biodiversity. Their responsibilities are diverse and vary 
across different authorities, but common roles and functions include watershed 
planning, natural hazard management, floodplain management, conservation 
area management, and biodiversity conservation.
CA roles vary due to several factors, including regional differences in population 
density, economic contexts, and land use patterns. CAs adapt their programs 
and initiatives to address the specific challenges and opportunities presented 
by their respective watersheds, ultimately working towards the common goal of 
sustainable natural resource management.
CAs have been at the forefront of managing natural assets for decades. They 
work to prioritize conservation across southern Ontario and help empower 
municipalities to make informed decisions regarding the management of natural 
assets. This occurs through a wide variety of work, but six examples are outlined 
below.
1/	 Natural Heritage System Planning: Mapping and strategic management 
of interconnected natural areas, aiming to improve the conservation 
of biodiversity and ecological integrity within a region. This planning 
process considers habitat connectivity, species protection, and 
landscape-scale conservation to sustain a resilient and functioning 
natural ecosystem.
2/	 Restoration: Rehabilitating ecosystems that have been degraded or 
damaged, aiming to enhance biodiversity, ecosystem functionality, 
and overall environmental health. Restoration activities may include 
reforestation, wetland rehabilitation, and the removal of invasive 
species.
3/	 Environmental Monitoring: Collecting and analyzing data to track 
changes in environmental conditions over time. This process helps 
assess the effectiveness of conservation and management efforts, 
identify emerging issues, and provide a foundation for evidence-based 
decision-making in environmental management.
4/	 Ecosystem Research and Valuation: Researching ecosystems to 
understand their structure, functions, and the services they provide to 
human well-being. Valuation includes assessing the economic and non-
economic benefits of ecosystems. 
88
GUIDEBOOK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS 
April 2024
Nature is Infrastructure: How to Include Natural Assets  
in Asset Management Plans
5/	 Offsetting Guidelines: Some CAs have developed ecosystem offsetting 
guidelines to help determine the amount of offsetting required to 
replace lost or altered ecosystems. Where this has been done, it is 
under the principle that offsetting must be considered only as a last 
resort within a mitigation hierarchy of: Avoid, Minimize, Mitigate, Offset 
(Compensate).
6/	 Water Resource Systems: Integrated management of water-related 
assets, including rivers, lakes, wetlands, and aquifers.
3.1  MANAGING NATURAL ASSETS VS. NATURAL ASSET MANAGEMENT
An important distinction exists between managing natural assets and natural 
asset management. Natural asset management is a prescribed process focused 
on making decisions about the collective set of assets in a municipality. It 
requires strategic planning and prioritizing actions across the entire system. 
Whereas managing natural assets is making decisions about individual asset 
types – for example, how do we maintain our forests. This involves considering 
the most effective and efficient management activities for each individual 
asset type. Both are vital and connected, but it is important to understand the 
difference between them. CAs have a long history of managing natural assets, 
but natural asset management is a relatively new process that is still evolving.
3.2  RELATIONSHIP WITH MUNICIPALITIES
CAs have a distinctive governance model that helps creates a critical and unique 
relationship between CAs and municipalities. CAs operate as corporate bodies 
with a reporting relationship to the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and 
Forestry (MNRF). However, it is the municipalities, located wholly or partially 
within a watershed, that are one of the main financial supporters of the 
associated CA and actively participate in decision making. The Board of each CA 
is formed with council representatives from member municipalities making the 
CA directly accountable to its municipalities. This unique partnership requires 
collaboration and coordination to effectively share responsibility for preserving 
the natural systems of southern Ontario.
Additionally, CAs often act as natural asset experts for a wide variety of 
municipal initiatives. They also support the many experts within municipalities 
with specific applied research needs.
	
4.0	 How Conservation Authorities Support Natural Asset 
Management 
4.1  INTRODUCTION
CAs provide leading-edge science and expertise to support evidence-based 
municipal decision making. This experience makes them well positioned to 
leverage their expertise managing natural assets to help further the field of 
natural asset management. Their role can be broadly defined in the following 
areas, though exact roles will vary between difference CAs:
89
GUIDEBOOK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS 
April 2024
Nature is Infrastructure: How to Include Natural Assets  
in Asset Management Plans
	
 Leadership: CAs can be leaders in natural asset management, leveraging 
their historical role in conservation to guide the integration of natural 
assets into asset management processes.
	
 Subject Matter Experts: Drawing on years of experience, CAs can 
contribute specialized knowledge to shape natural asset management 
initiatives, ensuring a comprehensive and effective approach to natural 
asset management.
	
 Asset Managers: CAs actively manage and protect natural assets within 
their jurisdictions, they can employ natural asset management to 
optimize the ecological, social, and economic benefits of these assets 
aligned with their mandate.
	
 Data Collectors and Managers: As stewards of environmental data, CAs 
play a pivotal role in providing the necessary information for informed 
decision-making in the natural asset management process.
	
 Educators: Leading natural asset management CAs can act as educators, 
providing training and raising awareness among municipalities, CAs, and 
other stakeholders about the importance of natural assets, the benefits 
of natural asset management, and specific details on how to undertake 
natural asset management.
The Conservation Authorities Act establishes three categories of programs 
and services provided by Conservation Authorities: mandatory, municipal, and 
other. The mandatory programs and services (“Category 1”) are established by 
O. Reg. 686/21 under the Conservation Authorities Act. CAs may also agree to 
provide specific programs and services on behalf of municipal partners under 
a Memorandum of Understanding or other such agreement (“Category 2”). 
Through Category 2 services, CAs can provide support for municipal natural asset 
management to one or more municipal partners. Natural asset management 
work could also occur under other programs and services (“Category 3”). This 
would be a situation where a CA seeks funding from other sources and the CA 
board supports the work. This additional funding (outside municipal funding) 
could support monitoring, natural asset inventories etc. 
The following section provides some additional context and guidance on natural 
asset management specific to Ontario’s governance structure. It also provides 
some useful examples of CAs work. It is organized to align with the main 
Guidance Document’s structure. The examples show the breadth of CA expertise 
and may be helpful to communities across Canada.
4.2  ESTABLISH THE STATE OF NATURAL ASSETS
4.2.1 Geographic Scope
Defining the geographic scope of natural assets in southern Ontario includes 
considering some additional complexity. The options from section 2.1.2 of the 
Guidance Document are reiterated below, with additional considerations for 
municipalities in southern Ontario. A more detailed explanation of context-
specific considerations accompanies each option. 
90
GUIDEBOOK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS 
April 2024
Nature is Infrastructure: How to Include Natural Assets  
in Asset Management Plans
1/	 Focus on municipally owned and/or managed natural assets;
Municipalities own and manage natural assets on their lands. Many of these 
assets are open to the public, but some exist on public land that is not 
accessible (e.g., wastewater treatment facilities). All natural assets within a 
municipality should be included in asset management processes. An added 
consideration for municipalities within CA jurisdictions is determining 
whether there are lands managed by a municipality but owned by the CA. 
The reverse circumstance can also occur, though is less common. In these 
situations, it is important to build strong collaborative relationships and 
work together to decide which organization should include the natural assets 
in their asset management plan. There may be situations where a natural 
asset type makes sense to be included in both the municipal and CA plans. 
This is feasible if it is clear who is responsible for which management and/or 
budget activities. Clear and open communication and collaboration is key to 
managing these situations effectively.
2/	 Focus on Conservation Authority owned and managed natural assets;
Conservation Authorities typically own and manage a variety of land, 
often substantial, for the purposes of environmental conservation, public 
recreation, and education. In 2022, CAs reported they collectively own a 
total of 205,739 hectares across Ontario. This land is distributed across the 
watershed(s) in a CA’s jurisdiction and often exists in multiple municipalities. 
CAs should be working to include natural assets in their asset management 
plans. And, by nature of their jurisdiction, natural asset management focused 
on CA lands will occur at the watershed scale.
3/	 Include all natural assets within the municipal boundary (regardless of 
ownership); or 
The jurisdictions of municipalities and CAs include natural assets that 
are privately owned by individuals, corporations, or non-governmental 
organizations. These assets often provide important services, but their 
management is the responsibility of the private owner or organization. 
Private owners may choose to sell or develop the natural areas, therefore 
they are not necessarily protected. Natural asset management can include 
privately-owned natural assets, but it is important to determine clear 
objectives for including private land.
4/	 Include the natural assets that provide a service to the community (e.g., the 
watershed boundary that provides drinking water services).
If there is interest in undertaking a watershed scale natural asset 
management plan, it is important to set clear objectives within the context 
of other watershed scale planning in Ontario. CAs develop and implement 
watershed plans to address issues related to water quality, quantity, and 
overall ecosystem health. These plans typically involve collaboration with 
various stakeholders including municipalities, Indigenous Communities, 
91
GUIDEBOOK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS 
April 2024
Nature is Infrastructure: How to Include Natural Assets  
in Asset Management Plans
businesses, and the public. Ontario also has the Clean Water Act, 2006, which 
has enabled significant source water protection initiatives and planning 
focused on promoting clean, safe, and sustainable drinking water for 
Ontarians. Undertaking a watershed scale asset management plan needs 
to be completed in collaboration with the relevant CA and should ideally by 
linked closely with CA watershed planning. Asset management and watershed 
planning are complementary processes that can benefit each other (See 
page 102 for an example). 
4.2.2 Inventory
The Guidance Document summarizes a variety of potential data sources for a 
natural asset inventory. It mentions Ecological Land Classification (ELC) mapping, 
which is an Ontario provincial standard for classifying and mapping natural 
communities. It was developed by the Ministry of Natural Resources in 1998 
and was intended to support planners and ecologists in organizing ecological 
information into logically integrated units. The structure of ELC mapping makes 
it easily transferable to a natural asset inventory. Many CAs, particularly the 
larger CAs, collect ELC data that is available through their open data portals. 
Typically, the data will cover a large portion of the land in their jurisdiction but 
will generally focus on natural features larger than 0.5ha. This mapping can be 
used to inventory different natural assets on municipal owned land, CA owned 
land, and private land. 
4.2.3 Condition
Natural asset condition assessments will ideally occur in the field because 
direct observation of the actual ecosystem can provide valuable information 
that may not be reflected through remote sensing alone. While remote sensing 
can provide coarse information on asset condition, on-the ground field work 
can provide more details and information on causes of the condition. Field 
assessments allow for the detailed observation of habitat structures and 
complexities, risks (e.g., invasive pests), and noting of specific features that may 
impact the ecological condition of an asset (e.g., garbage dumping, unauthorized 
trails). 
The Guidance Document references a Rapid Inventory and Condition Assessment 
Method (RICAM) for Natural Assets” developed by Credit Valley Conservation 
Authority (CVC) to help guide efficient collection of field data for natural asset 
management. The approach helps natural asset managers quickly inventory 
and assess the conditions of the natural assets in their jurisdiction or area of 
responsibility. RICAM provides a means to evaluate the condition of a natural 
asset through assessing its ecological structure and composition, and the 
intensity and extent of disturbances to the asset. Recently this method was 
used by CVC and Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) to create 
a tree and shrub community (forest) inspection protocol for natural assets 
on municipal properties. The data was collected over one summer season 
with multiple field crews. The crews had strong tree identification skills but

were a mixture of students and recent graduates without official forestry or 
arboriculture designations. They completed a high-level assessment to build the 
asset inventory, including condition information. Each field team was provided a 
GPS unit and a handheld device to collect data directly into a database. The data 
collection forms are provided below as an example of an application of the rapid 
assessment protocol for forests.

4.2.4 Replacement Costs
CAs play a crucial role in planning, implementing, and overseeing ecological 
restoration projects. These projects often focus on ecosystems that have been 
degraded, damaged, or were non-existent. CA staff may have local restoration 
costs for a variety of ecosystems that can be used for calculating current 
replacement cost in asset management. For example, TRCA annually updates 
a report of costs to replace different ecosystem types. Below is an excerpt 
showing reforestation costs for a mixed wood forest ecosystem, including 
project management, site preparation, tree planning, habitat installation, and 
monitoring.

4.3  LEVELS OF SERVICE
As outlined in the Guidance Document, natural assets can provide multiple 
services and co-benefits. When a municipality aims to develop levels of service 
metrics related to biodiversity, habitat, water quantity/quality, or floodplain 
areas, engaging CA staff can be useful because they would bring specific 
scientific expertise. Due to the wide variety and large number of services 
provided by natural assets, defining levels of service necessitates substantial 
collaboration across municipal departments. This collaboration effort should 
extend to inter-organizational cooperation, where CAs and municipalities can 
work closely together to set and prioritize levels of service for natural assets. 
One option that can help address the large number of potential levels of 
services metrics it to divide services into two categories: core and secondary. 
Core services would be the primary reason(s) a natural asset is conserved or 
managed. Secondary services would cover those additional co-benefits that 
97
GUIDEBOOK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS 
April 2024

are important to a municipality. The core services, rather than the secondary 
services, drive implementation or maintenance work and the later stages of 
asset management. Example levels of service for watercourse natural assets 
can be found below, these are an excerpt of a Green Stormwater Infrastructure 
Asset Management Toolkit written by TRCA for the Green Infrastructure Ontario 
Coalition. Please note that the storm return periods in the table are only 
provided as examples and there are different local regulatory events used 
across Ontario. It is also important to note that that climate change could be 
incorporated into this type of metric and this would likely involve using a longer 
return period.
98

It can also be helpful to link levels of services to other planning documents, 
including those completed at the watershed scale. Below is an excerpt table on 
linking (Sub)watershed Management Plans to Asset Management and Master 
Planning. This table provides some additional examples of technical and 
customer levels of service metrics for natural assets and various services that 
can be applicable at different scales in asset management and other planning 
processes by municipalities and CAs.

4.4  INCORPORATING RISK AND CRITICALITY 
CAs implement and promote the use of natural assets to mitigate risks. This 
includes using natural features such as wetlands and forests to provide 
stormwater management, erosion control, and other ecosystem services. Many 
CAs possess substantial expertise in evaluating the risks affecting natural assets. 
In the context of risk assessment discussions, it is wise to involve CA staff, as 
they may possess specialized knowledge pertaining to specific types of natural 
assets.
Examining the distinctive feature of risks for natural assets is also crucial. 
Unlike traditional infrastructure, natural areas are particularly susceptible to 
cumulative risks, wherein adverse effects gradually accumulate over time due 
to persistent stressors. This vulnerability arises from the ecological complexity 
and sensitivity of natural areas to long-term pressures. While conventional 
infrastructure asset management often centres around event-driven risks, 
natural assets must navigate both cumulative and event-driven risks. Examples 
of both types of risks are provided below to underscore the diverse challenges 
associated with managing natural ecosystems.
Cumulative Risks
	
 Climate Change: Long-term shifts in temperature and precipitation 
patterns can impact natural asset health over extended periods. 
Changes in climate can affect tree growth, alter species composition, 
and contribute to the spread of pests and diseases.
	
 Invasive Species: The gradual spread of invasive species over time can 
have cumulative negative effects on natural asset ecosystems. Invasive 
plants, insects, or pathogens can outcompete native species, disrupt 
nutrient cycling, and compromise overall ecosystem health.
	
 Fragmentation and Habitat Loss: The ongoing fragmentation of natural 
areas due to urbanization or land development leads to the gradual 
loss of habitat and sensitive plant species. 
Event-driven Risks
	
 Wildfires: Natural assets are susceptible to sudden and catastrophic 
events such as wildfires. These events, often triggered by lightning 
strikes or human activities, can cause rapid and extensive damage to 
vegetation and soil.
	
 Windstorms and Ice Storms: Sudden weather events, like severe 
windstorms or ice storms, can result in substantial damage to natural 
assets. High winds can uproot trees, break branches, and alter the 
structure of the forest canopy.
	
 Disease Outbreaks: While some diseases may have a cumulative 
impact, certain invasive pests can also spread rapidly, causing sudden 
outbreaks. For example, tree pathogens or fungi can lead to widespread 
mortality in a short period, impacting forest health.
101
GUIDEBOOK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS 
April 2024

in Asset Management Plans
To help assess both types of risk for a municipal natural asset project, CVC 
worked with Green Analytics to adapt the typical Probability and Consequence 
of Failure Approach to risk assessment (as described in Section 4.3 of the 
guidance document) to be more tailored for natural assets. Rather than focus 
on “Consequence of Failure” they assess the “Severity of Impact” and when 
assessing the likelihood, they suggest focusing on “likelihood of occurrence” 
rather than likelihood of failure. They also suggest considering both recurrent 
impacts and single events to address the presence of cumulative risks. The 
tables below show their suggested 5-point rating scales to align with traditional 
asset management ratings.  
4.5  LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES 
As outlined in the Guidance Document, the goal of a Lifecycle Management 
Strategy is to identify the lifecycle phases and activities to help find the optimal 
level of maintenance and rehabilitation for municipal assets. This involves 
weighing the lifecycle costs against the potential improvement in condition, 
mitigation of risk, and movement towards expected service levels. This stage 
102
GUIDEBOOK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS 
April 2024
Nature is Infrastructure: How to Include Natural Assets  
in Asset Management Plans
of asset management is the intersection of natural asset management and 
managing natural assets. It requires strategically planning and prioritizing 
actions across the system (asset management), while also considering the most 
effective management activities for each individual asset type as it proceeds 
through its life (managing assets). As outlined in section 2.0, CAs have decades 
of experience managing natural assets and can bring useful expertise and 
perspectives to help identify key natural asset management strategies. An 
example of CA guidance on this topic is available in section 6.1.1 and Appendix C, 
which outlines CVC’s Life Cycle Costing of Restoration and Environmental 
Management Actions.7.
4.6  WATERSHED SCALE
Collaboration is necessary for natural asset management to extend beyond 
municipal boundaries, and CAs or other watershed-level managers are ideal 
partners for such projects. An example of collaboration between municipalities, 
CAs, and a charity is the Grindstone Creek Watershed Natural Assets 
Management Project. Here, the Cities of Burlington and Hamilton, Conservation 
Halton, and the Royal Botanical Gardens worked together with Natural Assets 
Initiative (NAI) to begin the natural asset management planning process for 
their shared watershed. This project went above and beyond a standard natural 
asset management plan and shows what is possible when different parties’ 
priorities align. Conservation Halton provided expertise in data, condition 
assessments, risk management, and modelling scenarios to support the work of 
the municipalities, nonprofit, and contractors such as NAI.
The purpose of this project was to identify, understand, and quantify the roles of 
natural assets as a component of services such as flood mitigation, stormwater 
management, and water quality control. To do so, the project partners created a 
natural asset inventory, assessed condition, identified risk, and defined levels of 
service. Additionally, they valued the ecosystem services provided by the assets.
The watershed scale was necessary in this study because natural assets 
upstream of the City of Burlington, outside of their political boundaries, for 
example, were still providing services for stormwater management within the 
City. Working together with neighbouring municipalities and CAs can align 
management and provide the resources necessary to maintain and enhance 
these natural assets. Going forward, the project team intends collaboratively 
manage and monitor the watershed. 
4.6  FINANCIAL STRATEGY
Developing a financial strategy is a key stage in natural asset management. As 
with all stages, it is important that natural assets are considered in parallel 
to grey infrastructure assets. A final component of a financial strategy in asset 
management is dedicated to exploring financing approaches to address any 
overall funding gap across the system. This involves looking at existing and 
potential new funding sources. One of the next stages of advancing natural 
asset management in the Grindstone Creek watershed is a Watershed Financing 
Project to explore innovative financing models for ecosystem restoration and 
103
GUIDEBOOK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS 
April 2024
Nature is Infrastructure: How to Include Natural Assets  
in Asset Management Plans
protection. It focuses on developing a conceptual financing model for sustaining 
and enhancing ecosystem services given the regulatory, institutional and 
coordination barriers that exist. This framework includes new economic tools, 
collaboration among multiple entities including Indigenous Communities and 
the private sector and builds on existing or enhanced governance structures. 
The study recognizes that a diverse model is needed because neither private 
nor public financing acting in isolation can address the issues of nature finance 
or the undervaluation of natural assets. The final product aims to include a 
recommended investment model and results of implementation. 
	
5.0	 Conclusion
This appendix underscores the pivotal role played by CAs in Ontario, 
emphasizing their unique position in managing water and natural resources at 
the watershed scale. Collaboration between CAs and municipalities is essential 
for effective watershed governance, recognizing shared responsibilities and 
distinct roles in environmental stewardship. Conservation Authorities, acting 
as natural asset experts, can contribute important expertise and perspectives 
to natural asset management projects at all scales. Good asset management 
incorporates long-term inter-departmental collaboration, and this extends to 
the important relationship between CAs and municipalities; they need to work 
closely together to achieve impactful natural asset management.
While the CA governance system is unique to Ontario, there are watershed 
organizations doing great work across the country. Some examples include: 
i/	
British Columbia: Okanagan Basin Water Board, Fraser Basin Council
ii/	 Alberta: Watershed Planning and Advisory Councils
E.g., North Saskatchewan Watershed Alliance, Bow River Basin Council
iii/	 Saskatchewan: Watershed Security Agency - Watershed Advisory 
Committees, Meewasin Valley Authority
iv/	 Manitoba: Watershed Districts
