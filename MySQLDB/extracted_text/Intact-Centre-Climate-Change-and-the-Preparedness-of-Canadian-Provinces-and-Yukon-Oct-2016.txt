Climate Change and the Preparedness of Canadian Provinces and Yukon to Limit Potential Flood Damage

Executive Summary
This report assesses the preparedness of Canada’s 
provinces and Yukon to limit climate change related 
flood damage, relative to current (2016) and future 
(2030) major precipitation events. The report provides 
direction to the provinces and territory to build upon 
efforts to limit flood risk. Climate change challenges 
specific to the Northwest Territories and Nunavut will 
be assessed in a separate report.
The state of provincial and territorial flood 
preparedness is based on a survey (administered 
between December 2015 and April 2016) of 103 
government representatives - deputy ministers, 
assistant deputy ministers, executive directors and 
senior advisors - across 91 provincial and territorial 
ministries, departments and agencies, including 
conservation authorities. The survey addressed flood 
preparedness relative to 12 categories of assessment:
Relative to each of the 12 categories, and based 
on input provided by survey participants, the 
preparedness of each province and Yukon is graded 
quantitatively from A (high flood preparedness) to 
E (low flood preparedness). If survey participants

in the calculation of the overall flood preparedness 
score of a province or territory. Survey responses were 
confirmed with respondents to ensure accuracy.
The national average flood preparedness scores of 
Canada and of each individual province and Yukon are 
presented in Figure 1. In Figure 2, detailed scores of 
the provinces and Yukon are presented relative to each 
of the 12 categories of assessment.

Executive Summary
The Canadian average flood preparedness score, 
across all Canadian provinces and Yukon, is C-. This 
score suggests that there is a considerable margin for 
Canada to better prepare for, and potentially mitigate, 
future flood risk. The Canadian national average score 
is an amalgam of the individual scores for provinces 
and Yukon, as profiled in Figure 2.
Flood preparedness strengths and areas for 
improvement are highlighted immediately below and 
discussed in detail in Chapter 2. Variance in responses 
across the provinces and Yukon to the majority of 
assessment categories was high, suggesting a lack 
of standardized approach and coordination on flood 
mitigation.

Areas of provincial/Yukon strength regarding 
flood preparedness:
 
1.	 Public Health and Safety: Canadian provinces and 
Yukon are generally active in maintaining the capacity 
of hospitals and local public health units to support the 
continuity of health service delivery during floods. This 
effort includes working closely with regional health 
authorities, ambulance service providers, physicians 
and other health sector partners to identify flood and 
other hazards that may endanger public health.
2.	 Emergency Preparedness and Response: 
Canadian provinces and Yukon work proactively with 
local authorities and community leaders to identify 
flood vulnerabilities, build capacity to respond to 
emergencies, and enhance public safety across their 
jurisdictions. 
Areas of provincial/Yukon challenge regarding 
flood preparedness:
1.	 Commercial Property Adaptation Audit: Nine 
provinces indicated they are not involved in the 
development of a Commercial Property Adaptation 
Audit or related program. A commercial audit entails 
helping commercial property owners to identify and 
alleviate flood risks. Generally, the provinces suggest 
this is not an area of their direct responsibility but is 
rather one for municipalities, as it is local governments 
that regulate new developments and provide 
flood-proofing guidance for existing commercial 
infrastructure. 
2.	 Home Adaptation Audit: Four provinces indicated 
they are not involved in the development of a Home 
Adaptation Audit program; similar to a commercial 
real estate audit, a home audit focuses on efforts to 
alleviate basement flood risk. Some survey participants 
noted, this is an area of municipal responsibility. 
3.	 Land-use Planning: Most survey participants 
agreed current land-use planning does not sufficiently 
restrict development in flood-prone areas. Some 
participants noted, municipal councils have significant 
power to override their own land-use restriction 
bylaws to approve new developments, even if the 
developments are in recognized flood-prone areas.

Next Steps in Flood Preparedness
Survey participants across Canada identified several 
non-negotiable actions that provinces and territories 
should take immediately to limit future flood risk: 
1.	 Chief Adaptation Officer (CAO): Provinces 
and territories should create the position of Chief 
Adaptation Officer. The CAO’s mandate would be to 
identify areas of strength and weakness in reference to 
flood preparedness and actions to mitigate risk.
2.	 Oversight of Flood Mitigation Responsibilities: For 
all 12 categories of flood preparedness, CAOs would 
be charged with ensuring (with direct accountability 
to the premier) flood risk preparedness is deployed, 
independent of whether the category is a direct-line 
responsibility of the province or territory. For example, 
regarding commercial real estate, where provincial 
governments do not have direct responsibility for flood 
mitigation, if a catastrophic flood was to occur (sensu 
the Calgary and Toronto floods of 2013), provincial 
governments should be able to describe how they 
facilitated action to mitigate flood risk.
3.	 Audited Flood Preparedness Reports: Provinces 
and territories should issue, on a multi-year cycle (e.g. 
every five years), audited public reports that document 
the state of flood preparedness relative to the 12 
categories of assessment considered in this report, and 
any material areas of challenge that may evolve. 
4.	 Land-use Planning: Provinces and territories 
should mandate that new development in flood-
prone areas be restricted, or at the very minimum, 
development in such areas be flood-resilient. Where 
development already exists in known flood-prone 
areas, actions should be implemented to limit potential 
flood damage. Municipalities should not be able to 
override the direction of provinces and territories.
5.	 Build Back Better: Where practically and actuarially 
cost-effective, infrastructure should be re-built to meet 
new and future-projected climate realities.
Recognizing that climate change and extreme flood 
potential will continue unabated across Canada, the 
provinces and territories should immediately address 
the above five points to avoid otherwise inevitable and 
irreversible financial and social strife

Purpose of the Report 
The purpose of this report is to profile key findings 
from a survey administered to 10 Canadian provinces 
and Yukon to assess their preparedness to limit 
potential flood damage relative to current (2016) and 
future (2030) major precipitation events. 
Background
As of December 2015, Canada and 194 other countries 
reached the Paris Agreement, which intends to limit 
the rise in the global average temperature to well 
below 2°C (relative to the pre-industrial benchmark), 
with an aspirational goal to limit warming to 1.5°C. 1  
The Paris Agreement also recognizes that all levels of 
society have a role to play in responding to climate 
change, including government, citizenry and business. 
Both climate mitigation and adaptation actions are 
recognized as critical components of the agreement. 
Specifically, the signing parties made a commitment 
Chapter 1: Introduction
to adapt to current and future climate change impacts 
through enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening 
resilience and reducing vulnerability. 2  
As noted by the Office of the Auditor General of 
Canada, climate change scientists expect severe 
weather events to become increasingly more frequent 
and intense in the coming years. This will have 
significant physical, social and economic impacts, 
resulting in long-term costs and disruption of everyday 
life. 3  The federal government spent more on 
recovering from large-scale natural disasters over the 
past six years, than in the previous 39 years combined.4 
The increasing costs of extreme weather to the 
Canadian economy can also be seen in the rise of 
catastrophic insured losses from natural disasters 
(Figure 3). As per the Insurance Bureau of Canada, 
“payouts from extreme weather have more than 
doubled every five to 10 years since the 1980s. For 
each of the past six years, they have been near or 
above $1 billion in Canada.” 5

Chapter 1: Introduction
Floods Threaten Economic Competitiveness 
The cause of the majority of these insured catastrophic 
losses is water-related damage. For example, costs of 
the 2013 flooding in Alberta were estimated at more 
than $6 billion, including $1.9 billion of insurable 
losses.
 
Accordingly, climate-related risks, including flooding, 
have been found to pose a threat to the global 
financial system. These risks have been recognized by 
major global economic organizations, including the 
Financial Stability Board (an international body that 
monitors risk in the global financial system), the G20 
(a group of 20 major economies), the Organization for 
Economic Co-operation and Development, and others.6
The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 
2015-2030 (Sendai Framework) adopted by the United 
Nations Member States (includes Canada) recognizes 
four priorities for action in addressing catastrophic 
events: 1) understand disaster risk; 2) strengthen 
disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk; 3) 
invest in disaster risk reduction for resilience; and 4) 
enhance disaster preparedness for effective response 
and to “Build Back Better” in recovery, rehabilitation 
and reconstruction. Specifically, the need to strengthen 
disaster preparedness for response, take action in 
anticipation of events, and ensure capacities are in 
place for effective response and recovery at all levels is 
emphasized by the Sendai Framework. 7  The extent to 
which Canada is prepared to address climate-related 
risks, including severe floods, will define its long-term 
competitiveness. Failure to address these risks will 
result in continued economic losses (Figure 3) and will 
threaten Canada’s status as a safe country in which to 
invest and do business.
Methodology
The United Nations Secretariat of the International 
Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UN/ISDR) defines 
“preparedness” as, “the capacities and knowledge 
developed by governments, professional response 
organizations, communities and individuals to 
anticipate and respond effectively to the impact 
of likely, imminent or current hazard events or 
conditions.”  8
Within the context of this definition, a literature 
review (UN/ISDR 2008, Hémond & Robert 2012, 
Kundzewicz et al. 2014 and Quarantelli 1998) 
identified key factors against which the flood 
preparedness of Canada’s provinces and Yukon can be 
assessed:
•	
Relevance: flood prevention, protection, 
mitigation and response options should be 
realistic and sensitive to the environment in 
which they are implemented (accordingly, 
12 assessment categories, noted below, are 
further defined into sub-categories, reflecting 
the nuanced nature of flood preparedness 
approaches-based on location, nature of flood 
risk and other differentiating factors);
•	
Practicality: technical-and cost-effectiveness, 
or the ease with which flood prevention, 
protection, mitigation and response options can 
be implemented;
•	
Effectiveness: the degree to which flood 
prevention, protection, mitigation and response 
options being implemented reduce flood risks 
and related damages; and 
•	
Urgency: the degree to which flood prevention, 
protection, mitigation and response options, if 
not implemented, increase the threat to human 
well-being and economic continuity.

Based on a further literature review (Auditor General 
of Canada 2016, Insurance Bureau of Canada 2015, 
Kovacs and Sandink 2013, Simpson 2006, Swiss RE 
2010, U.S. Department of Homeland Security 2007, 
Vlotman et al. 2007, Werritty 2006 and Wilby and 
Keenan 2012), the following 12 evaluative categories 
were established to assess the flood preparedness of 
the Canadian provinces and Yukon: 
Where appropriate, these 12 evaluative categories are 
further defined to reflect the nuanced nature of flood 
management (Figure 4). N/A denotes Not Applicable 
(i.e. no sub-categories were applicable).
The survey was administered over a five-month 
period (December 2015 to April 2016) to subject 
matter experts from various provincial and territorial 
ministries, departments, and agencies. As per the 
survey questionnaire, five response options could be 
selected by survey participants. Options ranged from A 
(highest possible score) to E (lowest possible score) to 
reflect the corresponding levels of flood preparedness 
relative to each of the 12 evaluative categories. If 
none of the pre-defined answers were considered 
appropriate by survey participants, the option N/A 
(Not Applicable) was recorded. For further detail 
pertaining to the survey questionnaire, please refer to 
Appendix A.
Survey Participation
A contact list of government officials with subject 
matter expertise relevant to the 12 categories of 
flood preparedness was initially compiled, based on 
information provided on the official provincial and 
Yukon websites. Following this compilation, an e-mail 
invitation to participate in the survey was sent to 
deputy ministers of provincial and Yukon ministries or 
departments. Deputy ministers then identified subject 
matter experts within their jurisdictions best suited to 
respond to flood preparedness survey questions; or, 
deputy ministers themselves elected to respond. 
In general, survey questions were addressed to 
ministries and departments involved in flood 
prevention, protection, mitigation, and emergency 
response management. Periodically, government 
officials invited the participation of local conservation 
authorities and Crown corporations. In total, 103 
subject-matter experts provided their responses to 
survey questions via e-mail or phone interviews. 
Fourteen of 117 government officials originally 
contacted to participate in the survey declined to 
participate.
Many efforts were undertaken to minimize data 
response errors - through careful questionnaire 
design, testing, and a data validation process (i.e. data 
collected during interviews was reviewed and validated 
for accuracy by survey participants within each 
provincial and territorial ministry or department).

Data Analysis
Both quantitative and qualitative data analysis 
methods were used to interpret the data collected 
during the survey. All comments provided by the 
responders during the review process were analyzed 
qualitatively. Quantitative methods were used to 
assign progressive positive integer values to each 
survey response. The progressive structure of the scale 
was developed in such a way that each successive item 
was treated as indicating a “better” response than the 
preceding value, from E to A. N/A responses were not 
included in the overall score calculation for a particular 
factor, nor in the calculation of the individual score of 
each province or territory.
To ensure data validity, survey responses were sent to 
respondents who validated their responses internally 
with peers/colleagues. No further verification 
pertaining to the validity of responses was undertaken.
The survey results are presented in two ways:
1.	 Graphical representation of flood preparedness 
for each of the 10 Canadian provinces and 
Yukon, juxtaposed to the average (national) flood 
preparedness score relative to the 12 evaluative 
categories (Executive Summary, Figure 2).
2.	 Scores for each of the assessed factors for each of 
the 10 Canadian provinces and Yukon, along with 
selected commentary in Chapter 2.

Chapter 2: Key Findings
The Canadian National Disaster Mitigation Program 
(NDMP) defines flood mapping as “the delineation 
of flood lines and elevations on a base map, which 
typically takes the form of flood lines on a map that 
show the area that will be covered by water, or the 
elevation that water would reach during a flood event. 
The data shown on the maps, for more complex 
scenarios, may also include flow velocities, depth, 
other risk parameters and vulnerabilities.” 9
Floodplain mapping indicates flood-prone areas, where 
risk and hazards associated with flooding are high. 
Accordingly, new development may be restricted in 
areas designated as floodplains by federal, provincial 
and territorial governments through the use of 
municipal zoning regulations. 
In Canada, various design flood criteria standards are 
used for delineating flood-prone areas. The minimum 
standard is the 100-year flood, which is the flood flow 
with a 1-in-100 chance of occurring in any given year. 
In some provinces, the standards are more stringent. 
For example, Saskatchewan uses the 500-year design 
flood; British Columbia, a 200-year design; and Ontario 
uses the 100-year design or regional storm events, 
such as Hurricane Hazel, which exceeded the 100-year 
design flood. 10  Design flood criteria standards are not 
explored as part of this survey.
Questions that follow explore the extent of provincial 
support for floodplain mapping across three types of 
communities: (1) communities located along the shores 
of major lakes and along Canada’s coast, (2) flood-
vulnerable municipalities and remote communities, 
and (3) communities located on aboriginal land. These 
three types of communities were selected for the 
survey analysis, as they tend to exhibit higher flood and 
hazards risks.
Since floodplain maps are an important tool to understand flood risks, they must be 
updated regularly to provide reliable information on flood risk management and 
local development.

Coastal Communities
Note: Alberta, Yukon and Newfoundland and Labrador selected the N/A response for this survey question; accordingly, 
their responses were not included in the scoring above. By way of background, Alberta and Yukon indicated that they 
have no coastal communities. Newfoundland and Labrador indicated that although it does not typically provide such 
funding, it did conduct flood risk mapping studies for coastal areas in Stephenville in 1996 and 2009.

British Columbia indicated that provincial flood 
hazard maps were last updated prior to 2001. 
Through legislative change, this responsibility 
was assigned to local governments in 2002-2003. 
Currently, floodplain mapping effort is coordinated 
by a consortium of agencies led by the Fraser 
Basin Council (which is funded through member 
agencies - typically local governments). One 
explanation for dated flood hazard maps may be 
a belief that the likelihood of receiving disaster 
relief funding from the province is lower, if local 
governments have updated flood hazard maps and 
flooding has occurred in these flood hazard areas. 
In other words, the local governments in British 
Columbia may not have positive incentives to 
update and develop new flood hazard maps.
•	
Manitoba developed a robust LIDAR map of Lake 
Winnipeg, which provides data for floodplain 
modeling, flood risk area identification and 
analytics.
•	
New Brunswick indicated that while there is no 
province-wide set of coastal flood hazard mapping, 
some coastal flood hazard mapping was conducted 
by coastal municipalities. In some cases, these 
efforts were financially supported by the province, 
under the Environmental Trust Fund. Where 
coastal flood hazard mapping was undertaken, it is 
up-to-date (i.e. flood hazard maps were created or 
updated within the last five years).
•	
Nova Scotia administers a Municipal Climate 
Change Adaptation Planning program (MCCAP), 
which provides technical and financial support 
to more than 50 local governments to develop 
climate change action plans. These plans, in most 
cases, include some form of mapping of future sea 
level rises and coastal flood risks.
•	
Quebec indicated that it provides technical 
assistance but not financial support to 
municipalities for the development of floodplain 
maps.

Note: Newfoundland and Labrador, Quebec, and Yukon selected the N/A response for this survey question; accordingly, 
their responses were not included in the scoring above. By way of background, Newfoundland and Labrador indicated 
that several flood risk studies were recently prepared by the province, in some cases, in partnership with the federal 
government. However, new studies are dependent upon budgetary requests put forward by governmental departments. 
Yukon indicated that the territory is in the process of developing its flood hazard mapping ability. Some flood hazard 
maps were developed by Yukon Energy Corporation for the communities located downstream from Yukon Energy 
hydro structures. Quebec indicated its municipalities are responsible for the management of flood risk areas, including 
floodplain mapping.

Alberta indicated the Canada-Alberta Flood 
Damage Reduction Program, initiated in 1989, 
expired in 1999 before flood hazard studies and 
mapping were completed for all of the original 
candidate communities. The province continues to 
produce studies and mapping under the separate 
and independent Flood Hazard Identification 
Program (FHIP).
•	
New Brunswick indicated most flood hazard 
mapping produced over the last 10 to 15 years 
documents historic floods rather than predicts 
future flooding. All of the flood hazard mapping 
produced by the province was solely prepared for 
riverine flooding. 
•	
Nova Scotia indicated the re-negotiation of the 
2010-2015 Gas Tax Agreement between the 
provincial and the federal governments expanded 
the category of eligible gas tax projects (unique 
to Nova Scotia) to include capacity building. The 
capacity building element allows municipalities 
to use gas tax funds for: floodplain and coastal 
flood hazard mapping; data collection and 
analysis; and other studies designed to help 
the local government delineate and understand 
the geographical range of climate and weather 
impacts, based on predicted weather and climate 
trends. Nova Scotia’s Statement of Provincial 
Interest (SPI) states that municipal planning 
documents must delineate flood-prone areas. 
Accordingly, municipalities are required to prepare 
development controls and regulations (by-
laws) that restrict development in these areas. 
As a result, municipalities in Nova Scotia have 
taken proactive steps to prepare stormwater 
management plans which include mapping areas 
that are sensitive to flooding. While municipalities 
are responsible for developing and maintaining 
floodplain maps, provincial planners do meet with 
municipal officials and assist in the development 
of stormwater plans and municipal planning 
documents when asked for technical advice. 
In many cases, municipalities use consulting 
firms and rely on the advice of technical experts 
to provide an appropriate flood-return period 
for their unique circumstances. There is no 
provincially mandated period of time respecting 
how often municipal floodplain maps should 
be updated. In general, they are updated when 
conditions on the ground demonstrate that 
existing mapping no longer reflects the true limit 
of the area flooded.

Ontario defines standards, policy and regulatory 
framework for the development of riverine 
floodplain mapping in Ontario. Conservation 
authorities work with municipalities to develop 
and update floodplain maps and implement 
riverine floodplain management programs. 
Funding for this work is currently provided 
by municipal governments. The frequency of 
occurrence of floodplain mapping work ranges 
by municipality across the province.  According 
to the 2015 inventory of floodplain mapping 
across conservation authorities, 34,275 km 
of riverine area was mapped (excluding the 
Great Lakes’ shorelines and inland water 
bodies). However, it is estimated that almost 
75 percent of current Ontario floodplain maps 
require updating. Most rural areas of the 
province have not been updated in 25 years.

As per the Statements of Provincial Interest, 
Saskatchewan requires all official community plans 
and zoning bylaws to include floodplain mapping 
policies and zoning regulations that prohibit 
development from locating in the flood way of the 
estimated 500-year peak water elevation. When 
a municipality updates its official community plan 
and zoning bylaws, the older floodplain mapping 
is also reviewed for validity and purposeful use, 
to assess whether and how it can be utilized to 
delineate floodway and flood fringe areas.

Aboriginal Communities
Floodplain mapping for Aboriginal Peoples of Canada 
(or Indian, Inuit and Métis peoples of Canada) who 
reside on-reserve falls within federal responsibility. 
Provincial governments have a general responsibility 
for Aboriginal Peoples living off-reserve (in urban 
communities).  To understand the process of floodplain 
mapping for aboriginal communities, this survey 
question was addressed to provincial ministries, 
departments and agencies responsible for indigenous 
affairs.

New Brunswick indicated floodplain mapping 
is developed on an annual basis across its First 
Nations communities. The province financially 
supports establishment of river monitoring 
stations in First Nations communities and actively 
administers erosion hazard policies. There are 
15 First Nations communities located in the

•	
Land-use planning in Canada is carried out under 
various legislations and policies and applied by a 
range of decision makers, including: provincial and 
territorial government departments, boards and 
agencies, and municipal governments. According 
to Natural Resources Canada, local governments 
manage the risks of flooding through a variety of 
practices, including: adoption and enforcement of 
bylaws; operation of transportation, utilities and 
other public infrastructure; and administration of 
an emergency management and response system. 
Land-use planning is one of the most effective 
processes to minimize flood risks to municipalities 
and rural communities. 12  In general, municipal 
governments maintain the responsibility and 
authority for local land-use planning and 
development on all private lands within their 
boundaries.

Nova Scotia indicated municipalities have 
jurisdiction over land-use planning, and in this 
capacity, municipal councils are responsible for 
determining the most appropriate places for 
development. The province noted, municipal 
officials are aware of the impacts of flooding on 
property. The local governments use development 
tools such as subdivision plans, development 
permits and development zones to restrict 
development in flood-prone areas. The Municipal 
Climate Change Adaptation Planning (MCCAP) 
process has elevated awareness at the provincial 
level and the role that land-use planning plays 
in protecting development from flooding. The 
Statement of Provincial Interest provides provincial 
context for municipal development in flood-prone 
areas.
•	
Ontario policies prohibit or restrict new residential, 
commercial, and infrastructure development 
in municipalities and rural communities within 
regulatory floodplains. Local conservation 
authorities and municipalities implement these 
policies through land development applications. 
The province has developed a Special Policy 
Area floodplain management approach that 
is used in limited circumstances, where other 
floodplain management approaches are not 
considered feasible or practical. Generally, the 
approach is applied to existing developed areas 
within communities that have historically existed 
within floodplains. Fundamentally, this approach 
“grandfathers” historic development, such as the 
downtown cores of towns and cities built along 
rivers and well-established prior to any floodplain 
management or land-use planning policies by the 
government. Creating or altering Special Policy

In Alberta, the Flood Recovery and Reconstruction 
Act enables municipalities to control, regulate or 
prohibit any use or development in a floodway. 
There is an exemption for municipalities with 
significant development already in a floodway 
(such as Fort McMurray and Drumheller). The 
act also sets out provisions for municipalities to 
rebuild communities in a manner that limits the 
potential for future flood damage.
•	
British Columbia noted, land-use planning is a 
responsibility of local governments. As per the 
Local Government Act, local governments are 
not obligated to designate floodplains, or to zone 
the land accordingly. The province noted, it only 
reviews risks associated with land proposals for 
rural communities’ unincorporated areas (where 
flooding may be considered a risk) as appropriate.
•	
Manitoba designates flood hazard areas and 
outlines flood-proofing criteria for structures 
located within the Red River Valley. For 
developments outside the Red River Valley, 
local governments are responsible for land-use 
regulations. Currently, a 1-in-100-year flood event 
is used as a design standard. The province is 
expected to evolve this standard to a 1-in-200-year 
flood event.
•	
New Brunswick indicated that development 
approvals are a municipal responsibility, where 
local rules may be applied (e.g. zoning by-laws, 
conditions attached to building permits, and 
others). New Brunswick’s Coastal Areas Protection 
Policy is applied when a development is located 
in the coastal zone (as defined by the policy), 
and development approval is required from the 
province (e.g. Watercourse and Wetland Alteration 
Permit or Environmental Impact Assessment). 
The Coastal Areas Protection Policy requires that 
development be set at a minimum elevation above

•	
Quebec indicated regional municipalities must 
identify zones where land use is subject to specific 
restrictions because of the risks to public health, 
safety and well-being. The municipalities must 
consider protection of fauna and flora within the 
floodplains and within zones with natural hazards: 
(1) zones with flooding beyond the riverbanks 
(during the period of melting snow), following 
ice jams or torrential rains; (2) erosion caused by 
water, ice or wind; (3) landslides consisting of soil 
or rock, simple or composite; and (4) sinking of the 
ground (due to the consolidation or compaction of 
the soil), cave-ins (due to the collapse of the roof 
of subterranean cavities), avalanches, earthquakes 
and other reasons. However, there are no 
requirements to adjust flood zones based on new 
flood events as they emerge.
•	
Saskatchewan indicated the Statements of 
Provincial Interest Regulations require all official 
community plans and zoning bylaws to include 
floodplain policies and zoning regulations that 
prohibit development in the floodway of the 
estimated 500-year peak water elevation. For 
development in the flood fringe, flood-proofing 
measures are required to be 0.5 meters above the 
estimated 500-year peak water elevation. As per 
Bill 27 of the Flood Recovery and Reconstruction 
Act, a floodway is defined as more than one meter 
of flooding, or more than one cubic meter per 
second of flow. A flood fringe is defined as less 
than one meter of flooding and less than one 
cubic meter of flow. The province has an interest 
in ensuring the safety and security of individuals, 
communities and property from natural and 
human-induced threats. To assist in meeting public 
safety interests, the province requires that all 
planning documents and decisions shall:
	
-	
Identify potential hazard lands and address 	
	
	
their management;
	
-	
Limit development on hazard lands 	
	
	
	
to minimize the risk to public or private 		
	
	
infrastructure;

In Canada, approximately 7% of the total land base is used for agriculture development. 13  Many of Canada’s most 
productive agricultural areas are on, or adjacent to, floodplains. Accordingly, the survey focuses on provincial

Agricultural lands adjacent to parts of the New 
Brunswick coastline (particularly the southeast) 
are protected from flooding by coastal wetlands 
backed by a series of dikes. Maintenance of these 
dikes in the face of climate change and sea level 
rise is an important consideration for reducing 
flood damage.
•	
Nova Scotia noted, there are no flood-related land-
use policies that address agricultural land use. In 
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick combined, there 
are 364 km of dikes protecting a total of 32,350 ha 
of agricultural land (excluding dikes constructed by 
private landowners, industries and communities). 
At the present time, the primary mandate of the 
province is to protect agricultural land protected 
by dikes. However, residential and commercial 
development has taken place on adjacent lands - 
which may also be vulnerable to dike overtopping 
or breaching. The province uses the predicted 2055 
sea level rise estimates as a minimum for designing 
dikes that primarily protect agricultural land.
•	
Ontario’s policy prohibits or restricts agricultural 
development, including siting structures such 
as farm dwellings, livestock housing, pesticide 
and agricultural waste storage, in regulatory 
floodplains. These areas are defined by historic 
and potential future flood events. Conservation 
authorities and municipalities implement these 
policies in development applications.
•	
Alberta noted, current legislation focuses on a 
1-in-30-year flood risk for agricultural buildings like 
barns, manure storage, and pens. Outbuildings, 
workshops and dwellings are not subject to 
agricultural regulation but are controlled by 
municipalities. However, the province is in 
the process of drafting new legislation, which 
would use a 1-in-100-year event to prohibit new 
development for agricultural facilities within the 
100-year flood hazard area.
•	
British Columbia indicated there are no provincial 
regulations that specifically pertain to siting of 
agricultural buildings in relation to flood hazard 
areas. This is because local governments are 
responsible for all siting requirements.
•	
Manitoba indicated no development is 
recommended in an area subject to flooding, 
unless it is protected to a level of 0.67 meters 
of freeboard (i.e. additional capacity) above 
a 1-in-100-year flood level, as per its current 
legislation and provincial land-use policies. The 
province is planning to introduce regulations 
that would ensure future developments take into 
consideration the entire watershed.
•	
New Brunswick indicated aspects of agricultural 
land use that are within the purview of the 
province. Specifically, the storage of pesticides 
and building permitting are regulated through 
the Department of Environment and Local 
Government. Siting of the new livestock 
operations is regulated through the Department 
of Agriculture, Aquaculture and Fisheries. While 
the Livestock Operations Act does not specifically 
preclude development on land subject to flooding, 
it does allow the registrar to impose terms and 
conditions regarding environmental protection.

Prince Edward Island indicated its rivers and 
streams are small and tend to have small 
floodplains. Infrastructure issues on river 
floodplains are minimal and are generally left to 
the owner to resolve. During the development 
approval process, developers and planners are 
encouraged to propose development plans that 
address surface drainage issues and are not at risk 
to surface flooding. Where flooding is an issue, 
engineered storm water management plans are 
often required. Coastal flooding due to storm surge 
is a much larger issue for PEI. Mapping of coastal 
flood risk areas has recently been completed by 
the province, but has not yet been incorporated 
into provincial regulations. Currently, the province 
provides coastal flood risk and erosion assessments 
to developers, so that they can incorporate this 
information into new subdivision design. Flood risk 
development stipulations may be included in the 
provincial regulations, subject to subdivision and 
development regulations that will be revised in the 
next few years.

The average operating life of a mine in Canada is relatively short, generally lasting 15-20 years. 14 However, the 
entire process of opening and closing a mine requires activities that might continue significantly longer, including 
remediation of the mine site to avoid environmental contamination once the site is closed. Mine site flooding 
may lead to the release of harmful chemicals into the environment, threatening public safety and the ecological 
integrity of surrounding areas (e.g. soil, water and groundwater contamination).

Mine, Oil and Gas Sites  (continued)
•	
New Brunswick indicated that the document 
“Responsible Environmental Management of Oil and 
Natural Gas Development” includes the following 
requirements for the industry (to be implemented 
as conditions to Approvals and Certificates of 
Determination issued under existing legislation): 
gas conditioning plants and compressor stations 
(including related fill) are not permitted within 
flood-prone areas. Well pads are not permitted in 
flood-prone areas unless: (a) it is demonstrated to the 
regulator that construction can take place without 
significant changes to existing flood levels and flow 
velocities; (b) the surface of the well pad is set at 
an elevation that is above the flood elevation; and 
(c) access to the well pad is designed to be passable 
during a flood event. Pipes and access roads are not 
to be permitted within flood-prone areas, except as 
part of a crossing that has received a permit under 
the Watercourse and Wetland Alteration Regulation - 
Clean Water Act.
•	
Yukon stated that the province does not have flood 
risk maps in reference to mine sites; there is no 
specific territorial legislation that addresses flood risk 
measures at mine sites.

Chapter 2: Key Findings
Mine, Oil and Gas Sites - Commentary Provided (continued)
•	
British Columbia noted, as part of the 
Environmental Assessment Process for new mining 
or quarry development, proponents are required 
to assess all risks, including flood risks. Additionally, 
mine site owners/operators are required to have 
emergency plans in place, which again take all risks 
into account, including flood risks. This would be 
required as part of the permitting process under 
the Mines Act and the Environmental Management 
Act.
•	
Nova Scotia’s provincial regulations stipulate that 
environmental impacts (including hydrological 
impacts) must be included in the recommendation 
for an approval/rejection of a particular 
development. Other provincial regulations require 
local governments to negate new development 
within an area delineated as the 20-year flood 
zone.
•	
Ontario indicated that requirements for upstream 
oil and gas sites do not specifically require flood 
risk evaluation to be a factor in siting. However, 
provincial technical requirements for these sites 
may inherently provide some protection against 
the effects of flooding (e.g. mandatory setbacks, 
storage of fluids in tanks and other measures). 
Provincial technical requirements are set out in the 
“Oil, Gas and Salt Resources Provincial Operating 
Standards” document.
•	
Saskatchewan indicated flood risk is a factor that 
is considered through the Environmental Impact 
Assessment (EIA) process for new developments. 
Each proposed development is evaluated on a site-
specific basis, and approval includes evaluation of 
mitigating factors (such as engineering controls) 
to address flood risks, along with any other 
risks identified. However, EIA does not stipulate 
the frequency of flooding that is allowable, nor 
what level of flooding would specifically prohibit 
a development. The province also enacted 
Hazardous Substances and Waste Dangerous 
Goods Regulations that prohibit the storage of 
hazardous substances and waste dangerous goods 
in areas prone to flooding (using the 1-in-500-year 
storm event as the design criteria).
•	
Some respondents pointed out that lack of funding 
for floodplain mapping and the sparse number 
of meteorological and hydrometric stations in 
Canada limit their ability to evaluate the risks of 
future floods, thus creating uncertainty in flood 
risk modeling - even if such modeling is requested 
through the environmental assessment processes.

Pipelines are the most common method of 
transporting liquids and gases and are the only method 
to transport natural gas. Generally, pipelines that 
cross provincial borders are regulated by the federal 
government, and pipelines that are entirely within one 
province are regulated by their provincial authority. 
Provincially regulated lines include the smaller natural 
gas distribution pipelines that go to every house 
equipped with a natural gas furnace or water heater. 
Alberta, for example, regulates more than 400,000 km 
of pipelines. 15
Survey Question 2D: How does the province co-operate with the owners and operators of new infrastructure 
development in reference to oil and gas pipeline development?
A.	 During the permit application process, a flood risk assessment based on the latest flood risk  information 
provided by provincial authorities is performed by the applicant, and validated by the regulator. The 
application is then certified by a 3rd party flood risk management agency
B.	 During the permit application process, a flood risk assessment based on the latest flood risk information

British Columbia noted, flood risk assessment may 
be part of the permitting process under its Hazard, 
Risk and Vulnerability Analysis (HRVA), which 
provides the basis for local planners to create 
effective emergency response and contingency 
plans to respond to pipeline incidents. In addition, 
the permit application includes a risk assessment 
to determine what level of risks there are and how 
the applicant will apply any needed mitigation 
strategies. Risk assessment includes evaluation of 
flood-prone areas that may impact the pipeline. 
This is in line with the Association of Professional 
Engineers and Geoscientists of BC (APEGBC) 
statement that professional engineers take into 
account rising water levels. If the footprint of a 
proposed pipeline intersects the right of way of 
a regulated dike, then this intersection would 
require an approval through the Dike Maintenance 
Act. British Columbia also noted, for pipeline 
projects, proponents may undertake floodplain 
mapping. The proponents must evaluate flood 
risks and flood elevations related to a flooding, 
high water, or pipeline stream crossing locations. 
The BC Oil & Gas Commission provides support to 
the sector with seasonal readiness information, 
in co-operation with other provincial and national 
agencies.
•	
New Brunswick noted, oil and gas projects typically 
trigger an assessment under the Environmental 
Impact Assessment (EIA) Regulation. Accordingly, 
the proponent may be required to address flood 
risks as part of the EIA. 
•	
Nova Scotia noted, during the permit application 
process, flood risk assessment is performed by the 
applicant and is validated by the regulator. This 
flood risk assessment is based on the latest flood 
risk information provided by provincial authorities. 
Third-party certification for flood risk assessment is 
not always required.
•	
Ontario noted, the development of gas and oil 
pipelines is regulated through the National Energy 
Board established by the federal government. 
Some pipeline developers have, in the past, 
contacted conservation authorities regarding 
potential flooding concerns, but this is not 
a consistent practice. For example, several 
conservation authorities in Eastern Ontario are 
involved in a review of the TransCanada Pipeline.
•	
Quebec is participating in a public hearing {Bureau 
d’audiences publiques sur l’environnement (BAPE)} 
held under a section of its Environment Quality Act 
regarding the Quebec section of the TransCanada 
Energy East Pipeline Project. The hearing seeks to 
secure government action to prevent or attenuate 
the potential effects of hydrocarbon transport on 
public health and safety. 
•	
Saskatchewan noted, when proposing a pipeline 
license application, the pipeline operator must 
identify potential risks (including water stream 
crossings along the pipeline corridor) and must 
also meet the minimum requirements for 
the design, construction, testing, operation, 
maintenance and repair of pipelines, in accordance 
with the most recent version of CSA (Canadian 
Standards Association) Standard Z662, Oil and Gas 
Pipeline Systems, unless otherwise approved by 
the minister.

Most respondents indicated that the primary 
responsibility for maintaining reliable and safe 
pipelines rests on pipeline operators. However, 
current provincial regulations do not specifically 
require companies involved with the design 
and construction of pipelines to perform a 
flood risk assessment based on the latest flood 
risk information provided by provincial or local 
authorities.
•	
Some respondents also shared a concern that 
gathering lines are generally owned by small-to-
medium-sized private companies, which are less 
rigorous in evaluating flood risks during pipeline 
design and construction phases. Moreover, in 
some cases, these smaller companies are unable 
to identify and repair construction faults (which 
can also increase the risk of pipeline rupture during 
flooding).

Across Canada, various federal and provincial 
governments recognize the importance of the 
participation of aboriginal communities in land-use 
planning, environmental assessment and protection 
of wildlife habitat. 16 This question pertains to the role 
that provincial and territorial governments play in 
land-use planning on aboriginal land.
Survey Question 2E: Within your province, in reference to new residential, commercial, or industrial 
development on aboriginal land, to what degree does the potential for flooding factor into siting?
A.	 Our provincial regulations stipulate that any history of flooding in an area would serve as a 
recommendation to the local government to negate new development 
B.	 Our provincial regulations stipulate that flooding in an area over the last 50 years would serve as a 
recommendation to the local government to negate new development, or to establish infrastructure to 
limit the potential for 50-year floods
C.	 Flooding in an area over the period of the past 20-50 years would negate siting structures, or infrastructure 
would be established to limit the potential for 20-50 year floods
D.	 Our provincial regulations stipulate that flooding in an area over the last 10 years would serve as a 
recommendation to the local government to negate new development, or to establish infrastructure to 
limit the potential for 10-year floods
E.	 Our provincial regulations do not stipulate that past flooding in an area should factor into siting

Alberta noted, the provincial government has no 
jurisdiction on reserves; however, Siksika Nation 
LIDAR maps were developed to show which 
homes were located in the flood zone. While these 
maps are not provincially recognized, they were, 
nevertheless, used to determine which houses 
needed to be relocated and to justify to the federal 
government why this relocation was required. 
•	
Nova Scotia noted, although the federal 
government determines siting on aboriginal 
lands, provincial regulations apply if the proposed 
development is anticipated to have downstream/
off-reserve environmental impacts (including 
hydrological impacts). As per the Environmental 
Assessment Act, these impacts must be included 
in the recommendation for an approval/rejection 
of development by provincial and federal 
governments.

Ontario noted, conservation authorities partner 
with many groups to implement floodplain 
management; for example, conservation 
authorities have worked with aboriginal 
communities to support floodplain management. 
The provincial government, through the Ministry 
of Natural Resources and Forestry, is the lead in 
addressing provincial response to flood issues 
within aboriginal communities in the province.

British Columbia expressed a concern that dikes 
on First Nations lands may be of lower standards 
than those regulated under the provincial Dike

Chapter 2: Key Findings
Riparian Zones - Commentary Provided
•	
British Columbia indicated that the Forest and 
Range Practices Act and the Oil and Gas Activities 
Act provide protection of riparian areas located 
on Crown land. On privately managed forest land, 
riparian protection is provided through the Private 
Managed Forest Land Act. Moreover, additional 
protection may be provided to municipal areas 
through the Riparian Areas Regulation, which is a 
regulation under the Fish Protection Act.
•	
Manitoba indicated that the Provincial Planning 
Regulation requires development to be set back 
at least 15 meters upslope from the normal high 
water mark of lower order drains and retention 
ponds, and at least 30 meters from the normal 
high water mark for natural water bodies. 
Planning authorities can apply these requirements 
to protect riparian areas and to provide the 
framework for local development plans, which 
represent agreements between local and provincial 
governments as to how and where development is 
to occur.
•	
Ontario indicated that through the implementation 
of Section 28 of the Conservation Authorities Act 
and the Provincial Policy Statement under the 
Planning Act, the province ensures riparian zones 
are clearly defined. Their protection is enforced 
within these Acts through various provisions 
calling for direct cooperation between local and 
provincial authorities. Accordingly, the protection 
of riparian zones is implemented at the local level 
by conservation authorities and municipalities.
•	
Prince Edward Island indicated that The 
Watercourse and Wetland Protection Regulations 
establish regulated buffer zones (riparian zones) 
that are 15 meters in width along all watercourses 
and wetlands throughout the entire province. 
Municipal authorities must adhere to these 
provincial laws within their boundaries. The 
regulations prohibit development in the buffer 
zones and provide protection for vegetation. 
•	
Saskatchewan indicated that any development that 
occurs in the: water bed (the portion of the water 
body covered by water), bank (the rising ground 
bordering a water body, that serves to confine 
the water to the channel or bed), boundary (the 
end of the riparian zone of a water body), or any 
discharge with adverse effects on the water body, 
is subject to the 2010 Environmental Management 
and Protection Act. Saskatchewan also requires 
that an Aquatic Habitat Protection Permit be 
obtained prior to beginning any development 
work. The Aquatic Habitat Protection Program 
protects habitat from cumulative impacts that 
may arise from development projects or activities 
- large or small, conducted in or near water, within 
the province.
•	
The Territorial Lands (Yukon) Act specifies that “no 
title land grants” shall be given in the 30-metre 
ordinary High Water Mark Reserve Area of all 
water bodies.
•	
Respondents noted, the cumulative effects of 
human activities within riparian areas significantly 
increase the magnitude of flood losses, and 
they expressed an opinion that more stringent 
regulations across all levels of government are 
required to protect existing riparian areas from 
further destruction.

Survey Question 2G: In reference to forest management on Crown lands, what policy does your jurisdiction 
have regarding the effects of forestry activities on riparian forests, wetlands, and stream banks?
A.	 During the license approval process, an environmental assessment investigating the effects of forestry 
activities on riparian forests, wetlands, and stream banks is performed by the applicant, and validated by 
the regulator. The application is then certified by a 3rd party agency
B.	 During the license approval process, an environmental assessment investigating the effects of forestry 
activities on riparian forests, wetlands, and stream banks is mandated by provincial authorities. It is

C.	 During the license approval process, an environmental assessment investigating the effects of forestry 
activities on is then certified by a 3rd party agency
D.	 During the license approval process, an environmental assessment investigating the effects of forestry 
activities on riparian forests, wetlands, and stream banks is conducted by provincial authorities
E.	 An environmental assessment investigating the effects of forestry activities on riparian forests, wetlands, 
and stream banks is not a factor for the license approval process
Figure 2.2G: Land-use Planning, Distribution of Scores for Forest Lands
Excessive logging and conversion of forested areas into other land-use types alters the density of a forest, its 
canopy and its soil. These significant changes to forest lands impact runoff and accelerate the erosion process. 
Fragmentation of forests, caused by development, reduces the stability of water body banks and impacts 
downstream flooding.

New Brunswick indicated that the province is 
moving from an intensive operations monitoring 
approach to a “results-based framework,” where 
standards, objectives and performance indicators 
are clearly outlined for forest operations on Crown 
land, and forest operations must demonstrate 
compliance with the indicators for sustainable 
forest management. Third-party audits by a 
licensed certification body are required, and audit 
performance indicators are jointly decided with the 
regulator. 
•	
In Nova Scotia, over a half-million hectares of 
forest, or roughly 15% of the provincial forest, 
has been clear-cut since the 1990s. In 2011, the 
Nova Scotia government committed to reducing 
the amount of clear-cutting in the province by 
50% in five years and shifted some silviculture (the 
growing and cultivation of trees) funding toward 
more sustainable forestry practices. This was done 
despite strong opposition from big players in the 
forest industry.
•	
Ontario noted, forest management operations on 
Crown lands are not normally subject to individual 
environmental assessments (EAs) but rather 
take place under an exemption to the Ontario EA 
Act (Declaration Order MNR-75) that imposes a 
number of conditions, including the development 
and review of various policies. The policy regarding 
the effects of forestry on riparian forests, wetlands, 
and stream banks is primarily contained in the 
“Forest Management Guide for Conserving 
Biodiversity at the Stand and Site Scales.”
•	
Unlike many other provinces, only about 10% of 
Prince Edward Island’s forest is located on public 
land. Work on this land is done by a combination 
of government crews and private contractors who 
bid on work through public tender. Environmental 
assessments are not done prior to forest 
management activity on public land. Work in 
riparian or otherwise sensitive forests is more 
likely to be done by government crews rather than 
private contractors. In all cases, a pre-intervention 
management plan is required, which takes into 
consideration site-specific issues or implications, 
such as possible impacts on riparian forests or 
associated habitats. The Prince Edward Island’s 
Watercourse and Wetland Protection Regulations 
apply to all watercourses, wetlands and adjacent 
land, regardless of land use or ownership. In terms 
of tree vegetation, the regulations prohibit the 
cutting down of live trees and shrubs within 15 
meters of a watercourse or wetland. The natural 
forest type for the province is termed “Acadian” 
forest. Permits may be obtained to cut trees in 
the 15-metre buffer zone, where the trees are 
diseased, or when the purpose of the cutting 
treatment is to regenerate an “Acadian” forest 
stand. Clear cuts are not permitted, and heavy 
equipment must remain outside the 15-metre 
buffer zone. Permits are generally not given to 
convert a forested buffer zone to a non-forested 
buffer zone.
•	
From a flood preparedness point of view, 
Saskatchewan indicated that there is little concern 
arising from its forestry activities. This is because of 
the relatively flat landscape, the small percentage 
of a watershed that is logged at any time, and the 
small percentage of watersheds that flow onto 
developed land. Accordingly, there is little potential 
for forest management to contribute to flooding 
problems. Riparian forest management is generally 
addressed through buffers, as incorporated into 
Forest Management Planning.

•	
Yukon noted, under Section 23 of the Forest 
Resources Regulation, the Forest Management 
Branch has established management guidelines 
and standards identifying operating procedures for 
forest resource harvesting and related activities, 
as described in timber harvest plans, woodlot 
plans, or site plans. When developing forest plans, 
wetlands will be identified according to one of five 
wetland classes - bog, fen, swamp, marsh, and 
shallow water - in accordance with the Canadian 
Wetland Classification System (CWCS). Bogs, fens 
and swamps shall be identified on all site plan 
maps.
•	
Respondents indicated that conversion of forest 
to agricultural land uses remains the largest 
cause of deforestation in Canada. Deforestation 
in Western Canada due to oil and gas, mining, and 
transportation sectors’ activity was also noted 
to result in severe negative impacts on riparian 
forests and wetlands.
•	
Some respondents indicated that clear-cutting  
affects riparian reserves around streams. Better 
management of riparian ecosystems is needed, as 
current management of riparian forests through 
the use of fixed-width buffers may not be enough 
to limit impacts of clear-cutting on water quality 
and runoff.

Figure 2.3A: Drainage System Maintenance, Distribution of Scores for Natural and Man-Made Watercourses
A natural watercourse is defined generally as a stream of water which flows along a channel with beds and banks, 
for a sufficient time to give it substantial existence (e.g. rivers, creeks and streams). 18  A man-made watercourse is 
entirely engineered (e.g. a canal or a ditch). 19  Inappropriate drainage of natural and man-made watercourses may 
significantly increase flood risk potential.
Survey Question 3A: In reference to the water drainage capacity of natural and man-made watercourses, 
what policy does your jurisdiction have in place?
A.	 A province-wide policy is in place to ensure that water courses (e.g. culverts, weirs, sluices) 
remain free of debris and obstructions, and reviews of the adequacy of clearing efforts are 
conducted annually 
B.	 A province-wide policy is in place to ensure that water courses (e.g. culverts, weirs, sluices)

southern region of the province following the 2013 
flood, included debris removal, erosion damage 
repairs and mitigation efforts against future

Nova Scotia noted, it works closely with 
municipalities on drainage system maintenance 
issues to introduce guidance and best practices 
(as opposed to enforcing regulations). This work 
extends to drainage capacity issues for natural 
and man-made watercourses, where the province 
works with municipalities to implement best 
practices for flood preparedness. In addition, 
municipalities develop their own internal policies 
for effective drainage systems maintenance, and 
many of their plans speak to the importance of 
advanced precautionary procedures prior to a 
predicted event.

Quebec indicated that, according to the municipal 
powers provided in Article 105 of the Municipal 
Powers Act, when informed of the presence of an 
obstruction that threatens the safety of persons 
or property, a regional county must carry out the 
work required to restore the normal flow of water 
from a river.
•	
Saskatchewan noted, funding assistance is 
available to rural municipalities to clear natural 
watercourses of silt and debris.
•	
Respondents indicated that areas upstream and 
downstream of rivers are connected and must 
work together to tackle future flood risks. A shift 
from site-based to watershed-wide solutions in 
flood risk management is needed. Respondents 
noted, flood risk management on a watershed 
scale is more effective in the long term, less 
damaging to the environment, and opens up a 
much wider range of solutions that may also be 
cheaper to implement.

Alberta indicated that railroad drainage 
requirements are specified in the Railway (Alberta) 
Act and in the “Standards for Carrying out a 
Works” from the Code of Practice for Watercourse 
Crossings, under the Water Act and the Water 
(Ministerial) Regulation. Specifically, the Railway 
(Alberta) Act stipulates that “a person carrying out 
the construction, repair, maintenance, or removal 
of any track or structural facility in respect of any 
railway shall ensure that there is constructed and 
maintained proper and adequate ditches and 
drains that are connected with ditches, drains, 
drainage works, and watercourses on the land over 
which the track crosses or on which the structural 
facility is located so as to provide sufficient outlet 
to drain and carry off water in such a manner 
that the existing natural drainage and any existing 
artificial drainage of the land is not obstructed 
or impeded.” The “Standards for Carrying out a 
Works” further stipulates that “debris disposal, 
cleanup, and initial stabilization must be carried

out as part of the works. The capacity of any 
culverts and bridges in a watercourse crossing 
must ensure that enough freeboard is provided to 
pass floating debris and ice without affecting the 
stability of the watercourse crossing or creating a 
potential for a blockage of the flow of the water 
body and the capacity of any culverts and bridges 
in a watercourse crossing must ensure that the 
increase in any back-flooding does not result in 
flood damage to private and public property.”
•	
British Columbia indicated that all provincial 
railways must comply with the safety criteria 
specified in the provincial, and in the provincially-
adopted federal legislative requirements. These 
requirements call for railway companies to operate 
and maintain their railway systems, including 
drainage systems, within an approved set of safety 
standards.

•	
Manitoba indicated that the province does an 
annual inspection of drains, if a portion of the 
railway lies within a provincial waterway. 
•	
New Brunswick indicated that any new or modified 
railway crossing of a watercourse requires a permit 
under the Watercourse and Wetland Alteration 
Regulation - Clean Water Act.
•	
Saskatchewan indicated that the Ministry of 
Highways and Infrastructure administers parts of 
The Railway Act applicable to provincially-regulated 
railways. These include short-line railways that 
begin and end within the province; it excludes 
Canadian National and Canadian Pacific railways. 
Furthermore, the Ministry of Highways and 
Infrastructure developed the Saskatchewan Track 
Safety Standards (revised January 2013) to guide 
safe operation of provincially-regulated railways. 
These standards require: drainage structures 
with the capacity to allow suitable drainage for 
expected maximum water flows, vegetation on 
railway property to not obstruct drainage, and 
railway operators to inspect bridges and culverts at 
least once per year. The Ministry of Highways and 
Infrastructure conducts a track inspection program 
annually, to ensure railways meet these standards.
•	
Several respondents highlighted the importance 
of a railroad drainage systems inspection, pointing 
out some of the negative consequences of 
inadequate drainage system maintenance. For 
example, investigation report R13W0124, released 
by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, 
determined that inadequate water drainage led 
to the collapse of an embankment that caused 
the derailment of a VIA Rail (VIA) train near Togo, 
Saskatchewan on April 28, 2013. It was determined 
that a culvert at the derailment location had been 
blocked by an ice plug for some time. The plugged 
culvert, in combination with a sudden, rapid 
melting of surface snow in the area, led to water 
saturation and destabilization of the embankment. 
The embankment began to fail prior to the passage 
of the train.
•	
On April 28, 2013, a Canadian Pacific Railway 
freight train, proceeding westward from Wilkie, 
Saskatchewan to Hardisty, Alberta, derailed 17 cars 
loaded with potash at Mile 80.7 on the Hardisty 
Subdivision, near Provost, Alberta. Approximately 
350 feet of track was destroyed. The investigation 
report R13E0069, released by the Transportation 
Safety Board of Canada, found that the limited 
capacity of the drainage system beside the tracks 
led to the saturation of the track bed and created 
a void under the tracks. As the heavily loaded train 
crossed that section of the tracks, the weakened 
track structure failed, resulting in a derailment.

Figure 2.3C: Drainage System Maintenance, Distribution of Scores for Highways and Roads
Highways and roads continue to be the dominant mode of transport for the movement of goods in Canada. 
The flooding of highways and roads, and the washouts of bridges, roads and parts of highways all generate 
considerable costs for restoration and repair, and they contribute to thousands of road collisions every year. 21  
Survey Question 3C: In reference to the drainage capacity of provincial highways and roads (excluding 
resource and forest service roads), what level of program does your jurisdiction have in place?
A.	 A province-wide policy is in place to ensure highway and road drainage pipes, culverts, and ditches remain 
free of debris, and the policy is in operation as confirmed by regular audits
B.	 A province-wide policy is in place to ensure highway and road drainage pipes, culverts, and ditches remain 
free of debris
C.	 CA province-wide policy is in place to mandate that highway and road drainage pipes, culverts, and ditches 
are cleared of debris during times of the year when the potential for flooding is high
D.	 A province-wide policy is in place to clear highway and road drainage pipes, culverts, and ditches on an “as 
needed” basis
E.	 No relevant policies are in place to ensure that highway and road drainage pipes, culverts, and ditches 
remain free of debris

Alberta indicated that while the province 
maintains provincial roads, it outsources highway 
maintenance. Accordingly, there may be issues 
with monitoring and auditing of contractors’ 
maintenance activities.
•	
Ontario indicated that transportation routes 
are regularly monitored. Each region in the 
province manages its respective area, including 
contracts for highway maintenance. For local 
roads, municipalities operate their own drainage 
systems using provincial standards and guidelines. 
Conservation authorities use their technical 
capacity to support this work at the municipal 
level.
•	
Prince Edward Island indicated that the province 
experienced major flooding in 2014, and many 
culverts are being reviewed and enlarged following 
this flood event.
•	
Quebec noted, the province has a rigorous 
management program for maintenance and 
audit of drainage assets, including culverts and 
adjacent ditches. The province is in the process 
of developing similar programs for other storm 
drainage facilities.
•	
Saskatchewan ensures highway and road drainage 
systems are effective through the following actions:
	
-	
Cleaning out debris from bridges or culverts;
	
-	
Removing silt deposits that have accumulated 	
	
in ditches in the highway right-of-way, so 	
	
original drainage patterns can be restored;
	
-	
Removing debris in drainage channels to 	
	
permit drainage;
	
-	
In the spring, opening bridges and culverts 	
	
blocked by snow or ice;
	
-	
Removing snow from drainage channels in 	
	
highway right-of-way, to permit  drainage; 
	
-	
Repairing any damaged culverts;
	
-	
Removing beaver dams in drainage channels in 	
	
the right-of-way, with the cooperation of 	
	
Saskatchewan Environment (SE) and the 	
	
Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO); 	
	
and
	
-	
Restricting beavers from plugging culverts by 	
	
placing “beaver guards” over culvert ends.
•	
Yukon indicated the territory inspects drainage 
pipes, culverts, and ditches to ensure proper 
drainage along its roads and highways. The 
territory also makes sure ditches are clear of 
debris, with special emphasis placed on ensuring 
any brush cleared from highway right-of-ways is 
kept clear of the ditches. Most of these efforts are 
not formalized in policy, but are undertaken as 
operational practices. Yukon’s road forepersons 
understand that such measures are necessary to 
ensure both the integrity of the transportation 
network and the safety of the travelling public, and 
these expectations are clearly communicated to 
them by the territory. For culverts that are 150 cm 
in diameter or more, inspections are formalized, 
and they are subject to regular inspection intervals, 
as part of the bridge inspection policy.
•	
Some respondents pointed out that the clogging 
of the drainage pipes, culverts and ditches by 
debris and fine-grade soil is one of the most 
important maintenance issues in the current 
drainage systems. Accordingly, more attention 
must be given to drainage improvements and 
maintenance.
•	
Several participants indicated that municipal 
roads and county roads are the responsibility of 
local authorities; shifting responsibilities to local 
governments without proper funding increases 
the flood vulnerability of transportation systems in 
remote communities and small municipalities.

As agricultural land use in Canada has increased, extensive tile drainage networks (artificial drainage in the form 
of horizontal subsurface drains) and ditch systems have been developed to move water more efficiently off the 
land and into stream channels. However, loss of hydrologic storage on watersheds and in floodplains, and poor 
drainage maintenance, increase the severity of floods.  22  
Survey Question 3D: In reference to the drainage capacity of agricultural systems, what level of policy does 
your jurisdiction have in place?
A.	 A province-wide policy is in place to ensure agricultural drainage systems (surface and subsurface) are 
properly functioning, and the policy is in operation as confirmed by audits
B.	 A province-wide policy is in place to ensure agricultural drainage systems (surface and subsurface) are

•	
Alberta noted, provincial legislation and policy 
require provincial approvals for agricultural 
drainage works. The approval holder is required 
to operate and maintain drainage systems as 
legislated. However, there is no requirement for 
inspection of drainage systems, or other actions, 
during flood events.
•	
British Columbia noted, oversight on dike and 
drainage activities is the local government’s role. 
However, the province acknowledges that water 
quality, which is under provincial regulation, is 
often affected by runoff from agricultural lands.
•	
Manitoba indicated agricultural drainage networks 
are a shared responsibility between provincial and 
local governments. Agricultural land owners are 
responsible for inspecting drains on their own land.
•	
New Brunswick indicated The Agricultural Land 
Protection and Development Act defines a drain 
as “a channel, open ditch, tile drain, grassed 
waterway, or conservation structure to remove 
surface or subsurface water” and prohibits the 
interference of the passage of water without the 
consent of those whose land is served by the drain. 
Responsibility for the monitoring, maintenance 
and repair of the dikes, dams, aboiteaux (gated 
sluices) and common drainage on approximately 
37,000 acres of agricultural land - protected by 
tidal control infrastructure in the southeastern part 
of the province - was recently transferred to the 
Department of Transportation and Infrastructure. 
Inspections are regularly carried out by the 
Department of Transportation and Infrastructure at 
both high and low water conditions.
•	
Newfoundland and Labrador indicated that the 
Environmental Farm Planning Program provides 
guidance to farmers on the importance of 
undertaking annual inspections and maintenance 
of farm drainage systems. In addition, a Farm 
Drainage Specialist works closely with farm 
producers to help with installation of new 
drainage systems and advise on the appropriate 
maintenance and inspection of existing drainage 
systems.
•	
Ontario indicated agricultural drainage systems 
are developed according to the provincial 
standards and guidelines of Food and Rural Affairs 
of the Ministry of Agriculture. Inspection and 
management of these systems is generally based 
on the needs of landowners and road authorities. 
Conservation authorities encourage the inspection 
and maintenance of agricultural drainage, so as to 
avoid flooding issues.
•	
Prince Edward Island indicated factsheets are 
available describing how to conduct regular 
maintenance of agricultural drainage systems. The 
Department of Agriculture and Fisheries offers 
a program under Growing Forward 2 that assists 
farmers with the construction of surface drainage 
structures to control runoff.
•	
Quebec noted, the maintenance of drainage 
systems is at the discretion of farm owners.

As part of forest management, man-made drainage systems, such as ditches and sedimentation ponds, 
are utilized to drain excess water to existing streams or outlet channels during flood events. Regular ditch 
maintenance is required, to ensure that flood water runoff is reduced and the risk of mud flows and landslides 
is minimized. Accordingly, maintenance of forest drainage systems is an important factor in decreasing the 
probability of flooding. 23 
Survey Question 3E: In reference to the capacity of man-made drainage systems of forests under provincial 
jurisdiction, what level of policy does your jurisdiction have in place?
A.	 A province-wide policy is in place to ensure man-made drainage systems are properly maintained, and 
the policy is in operation; as confirmed by regular inspections
B.	 A province-wide policy is in place to ensure man-made drainage systems are properly maintained
C.	 A province-wide policy is in place to ensure man-made drainage systems are properly maintained during

Four provinces and Yukon  selected option E 
for this survey question, indicating they have 
no relevant policies to ensure that man-made 
drainage systems in their forests are properly

•	
Alberta indicated that under Alberta’s Forest 
Planning Standard and Operating Ground Rules, 
forest companies are required to build drains 
where forest roads cross streams within their areas 
of operation. These stream crossings must have 
adequate capacity to convey flow during 1-in-100-
year storm events. Companies are further required 
to regularly inspect these crossings to ensure they 
are functional. To protect public safety, companies 
must also ensure the crossings are in stable 
condition for forestry trucks and other users of 
forestry roads to be able to pass over the crossings 
safely.
•	
New Brunswick indicated that drainage systems 
are installed according to provincial standards. 
The Crown Lands and Forests Act is the legal 
foundation of public (Crown) forest management 
in the province. Regular inspections are performed 
on the designated Crown forest roads. Secondary 
forest road crossings receive fewer inspections and 
are maintained on an “as needed” basis.
•	
Nova Scotia commented the installation of man-
made drainage systems in forests must abide 
by the Forests Act and requires certification of 
the installer. A Certified Installer is a person who 
has completed rigorous training in placement, 
sizing, grade, and site preparation for watercourse 
crossings. Application for watercourse installations 
must be made to the Department of Environment 
and granted approval prior to commencement of 
activity.
•	
Quebec indicated that the Forests Act guides 
forestry standards for Crown land. It requires 
regular users of forest watercourses to ensure they 
are free flowing. Government officials conduct 
inspections, when forest management activities 
are carried out on Crown lands.

Alberta indicated that as per Waste Control 
Regulation (A.R. 192/96), drainage structures must 
be designed to convey and divert both run-on and 
run-off water for 1-in-25-year 24-hour storm events 
(run-on water is water that has not come in contact 
with an active landfill; run-off water is water 
that has come in contact with an active landfill). 
Landfill drainage structures must be inspected by 
the landfill owners after such storm events, and 
the run-off water must be held and tested prior 
to release. Alberta noted, as a recommended best 
management practice, landfill facilities should 
not be developed within floodplains or areas that 
would flood during a 1-in-100-year flood event. 
However, these best management practices are 
not prescribed in legislation, code of practice, or in 
any of the landfill standards. Moreover, a landfill 
application must include topographic information 
of the proposed landfill site and evidence that 
the landfill site is suitable. Although many of the 
existing landfills predate departmental oversight, 
generally there are very few existing landfills that 
are located in low lying areas. Also, as per the 
Municipal Government Act (Section 664), landfill 
development is restricted in areas that are subject 
to flooding.
•	
Ontario indicated the development and operation 
of solid waste landfills is regulated by the Ministry 
of Environment and Climate Change. This Ministry 
ensures drainage issues are addressed in the 
development of solid waste landfills. Should the 
Ministry have concerns regarding flooding in a solid 
waste landfill site, and if that flooding is associated 
with lands regulated by conservation authorities, 
the Ministry will seek input from the relevant 
conservation authority on how to address flood 
risks. 
•	
Quebec indicated that Article 14 of the Regulation 
Respecting the Landfilling and Incineration 
of Residual Materials (REIMR) prohibits the 
installation of an engineered landfill in the flood 
zone of a watercourse or body of water that is 
within the 1-in-100-year flood line delineation. 
Furthermore, Article 30 of the REIMR requires 
that landfills be designed to prevent surface water 
from penetrating into the drop zones where 
residual materials are stored, or into any another 
residue collection system. In summary, landfills 
are located outside 1-in-100-year flood zones, and 
measures to ensure drainage of surface water are 
a provincial requirement.

According to the definition adopted by the Government of Canada, a contaminated site is “one at which 
substances occur at concentrations (1) above background (normally occurring) levels and pose, or are likely to 
pose, an immediate or long term hazard to human health or the environment, or (2) exceeding levels specified in 
policies and regulations.” 25  Of particular concern are the abandoned, neglected or orphaned mine tailings sites 
in flood-prone areas, where neglect of water diversion structures and/or flooding beyond design capacity may 
result in inundation and potential waste spills into the environment. It is estimated that there are 30,000-50,000 
provincial and territorial abandoned and contaminated sites. 26 
Survey Question 3G: In reference to the drainage systems of abandoned contaminated sites, what level of 
program does your jurisdiction have in place?
A.	 A province-wide policy is in place to ensure dikes and other drainage structures maintain sufficient 
capacity, and that the policy is in operation as confirmed by regularly scheduled file audits
B.	 A province-wide policy is in place to ensure dikes and other drainage structures maintain sufficient 
capacity, and the policy is in operation, as confirmed by ad hoc field audits
C.	 A province-wide policy is in place to ensure that dikes and other drainage structures maintain sufficient 
capacity during times of the year when the potential for flooding is high
D.	 A province-wide policy is in place to mandate owners/operators check that drainage structures maintain 
sufficient capacity on an “as needed” basis

Alberta noted, drainage structures depend 
on the nature of the activity, whether it was 
originally approved, or whether there is an 
ongoing risk management plan in place for the 
site. For approved activities or activities that 
require ongoing risk management, surface water 
runoff will be addressed as part of the approval, 
where needed; drainage structures cannot be 
decommissioned without prior approval.
•	
Nova Scotia’s Contaminated Sites Regulations 
and its Environment Act have a polluter pay 
principle. Accordingly, under the regulatory 
process, individual property owners/the person 
responsible are required to retain the services 
of a site professional to manage the risks. The 
Environmental Emergency Regulations allow the 
province to take measures, in the event that the 
person responsible is unknown, unable or unwilling 
to manage the risks under the regulatory process, 
and there is potential for significant adverse 
effects.
•	
Ontario indicated the management of 
contaminated sites is regulated by the Ministry of 
Environment and Climate Change. This ministry 
ensures that management of the contaminated 
sites addresses drainage concerns. Should the 
ministry have concerns regarding flooding, and 
if potential flooding is associated with lands 
regulated by a conservation authority, the ministry 
will seek input from the conservation authority. 
Another area of provincial oversight is ensuring 
the long-term physical stability of tailings dams 
and other containment structures, as per the 
Mine Rehabilitation Code of Ontario. Under this 
code, proponents must follow the requirements 
of the “Dam Safety Guidelines,” published by the 
Canadian Dam Safety Association. Additionally, 
water control infrastructures are regulated by the 
Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, under 
the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act. 
•	
Saskatchewan noted, requirements for abandoned 
contaminated sites are site-specific and depend 
on the nature of the facility and associated 
risks. Typically, dikes and drainage structures 
are required to be inspected regularly, as per 
individual permit conditions. However, each site 
has its unique requirements, depending on the 
specific risks identified through permitting.
•	
Some respondents noted, collaboration between 
different levels of government and private owners 
is needed to remediate contaminated sites as well 
as the watersheds located downstream.

British Columbia provides assistance to Cowichan 
Valley Regional District (CVRD). In partnership 
with Cowichan Tribes, the City of Duncan, and the 
District of North Cowichan (DNC), the province 
retained Northwest Hydraulic Consultants (NHC) to 
update existing floodplain mapping and develop an 
Integrated Flood Management Plan for the Lower 
Cowichan-Koksilah River floodplain, including 
its major tributaries. The province is exploring 
whether it will pay for land acquisition, or provide 
funding to reallocate dike infrastructure to re-
establish marshland.
•	
Newfoundland and Labrador noted, the province 
participates in the Interdepartmental Land Use 
Committee (ILUC) to review and comment on 
any proposal or policy within government for the 
restoration of floodplains.
•	
Ontario noted, limited provincial funding 
is available to address the restoration and 
maintenance of natural capacity in the 
floodplains. Municipalities sometimes fund these 
initiatives through the conservation authorities, 
whereby they work together to promote 
integrated watershed management and develop 
watershed plans that recognize the natural 
capacity of floodplains to attenuate flooding.
•	
Prince Edward Island indicated that it does not 
use floodplain mapping, since coastal flooding 
and storm surge are the predominant flood 
concerns in the province (as opposed to riverine 
flooding). At this point, the province does not 
have a program to encourage flood-resistant 
construction of infrastructure or the re-positioning 
of infrastructure away from flood hazard areas. 
The question of whether to include flood risk 
stipulations in provincial regulations is under 
discussion, as subdivision and development 
regulations are due to be revised.
•	
Quebec indicated that Article 53.13 of the Law 
on Planning and Development (LAU) provides the 
Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment 
and Climate Change (MDDELCC) with the power to 
request an amendment to land-use planning and 
development, if the development:
	
-	
does not respect the policy of the government
	
	
under Article 2.1 of the Environment Quality 	
	
Act regarding bank protection policy, coastal 	
	
areas and floodplains;
	
-	
violates the limits of a floodplain located in the

-	
does not provide adequate protection for
	
	
riverbanks, shorelines, and floodplains, given
	
	
peculiarities of the environment.

 “Transportation in Canada is the joint responsibility 
of all three levels of government, whose efforts are 
coordinated by the Council of Ministers Responsible for 
Transportation and Highway Safety. Generally speaking, 
the federal government oversees international 
and interprovincial transportation, the provincial 
governments are responsible for intra-provincial 
transportation, and the municipal governments 
manage urban transportation.” 28 
Transportation systems cannot be easily 
relocated, redesigned, or reconstructed. In 
order to reduce economic losses and risks 
to public safety, the transportation planning 
process should assess the potential impacts of 
flooding on transportation systems and consider 
adaptation actions based on the new climate 
reality. 29

Respondents noted, some of the privately-
owned railroad owners barely generate enough 
revenue to keep rail lines operating. Flood 
mitigation measures often cost millions of dollars 
to implement and, therefore, may be financially 
prohibitive to these smaller players. Hundreds of 
railroad lines were constructed in pluvial valleys 
(often on lands under federal jurisdiction) to 
take advantage of flat floodplains and avoid 
costly crossings. Accordingly, the implementation 
of flood mitigation measures requires federal 
support.
•	
British Columbia indicated that it does not 
currently have a dedicated provincial program 
aimed at flood reduction for railway lines. 
However, following federal review of the Lac-
Mégantic, Quebec, incident, British Columbia 
indicated the desire to work with railroad owners 
on risk mitigation (including flood risk). To 
date, work with railway owners has resulted in 
some early success; for example, infrastructure 
improvements now allow for longer and faster 
trains have been implemented.
•	
Ontario noted, it engages with rail partners and 
local municipalities in emergency planning and 
preparedness for the transportation of dangerous 
goods. Upon request, conservation authorities 
support railways in flood risk mitigation efforts 
by providing flood forecasting and warning tools, 
infrastructure review, and guidance for flood-
proofing existing infrastructure. This engagement is 
in the form of support to provincial railways and is 
not a requirement of the conservation authorities.
•	
Saskatchewan noted, there is no formalized 
process in place to address flood risks, specifically. 
However, provincially-regulated railways must 
understand and identify flood risks informally, 
to meet the demands of the Saskatchewan 
Track Safety Standards. Accordingly, provincially 
regulated railways are required to develop safety 
management plans. The ministry has developed 
a Provincial Railway Guide PRG 1005, for the 
development of such safety management plans. 
The guide identifies that a safety management plan 
should contain a number of processes, including:
	
-	
develop emergency response plans;
	
-	
conduct risk assessments;
	
-	
implement and evaluate remedial action; and
	
-	
continual improvement in the operation of a
	
	
safety management plan.

•	
Alberta noted, the province has authority over 
provincial highways. However, it also works 
closely with local authorities to inspect bridges 
and structures under their control and to provide 
funding for adaptation measures intended to 
reduce flood risks.
•	
Ontario noted, the Ministry of Transportation 
manages provincial highways and roads for the 
province. It is the ministry that provides risk 
assessment tools, such as Intensity-Duration-
Frequency curves and updated weather 
information. As part of the new project approval 
process, the ministry requires submission of 
hydrology reports, including flood risk mitigation 
options. Conservation authorities provide support 
in the form of floodplain mapping and review of 
applications, when requested by the ministry.
•	
Saskatchewan noted, the Ministry of Highways and 
Infrastructure is the owner and operator of the 
provincial highway network. It regularly works with 
the provincial Water Security Agency to assess 
flood risk to transportation infrastructure in the 
province. 
•	
Yukon does not have any privately owned 
highways, nor any contractual arrangements for 
the operation and/or maintenance of any stretches 
of highway by private entities. The Transportation 
Maintenance Branch of the Department of 
Highways and Public Works is solely responsible for 
highway operation and maintenance.
•	
Emergency Measures Organization and 
Environment Yukon issue an annual detailed 
hydrological report on flood risks just prior to 
spring, as well as weekly flood risk assessment 
reports during periods of high potential flood risk 
(spring/fall). These reports are monitored and used 
to align work priorities, in order to mitigate flood 
risk. If an area is identified as being particularly 
susceptible to flooding, road crews inspect all 
drainage infrastructure (culverts, ditches, etc.) in 
that area to ensure preparedness for any large 
scale hydrological event.
•	
In terms of financial support for adaptive 
initiatives, Yukon undertakes all such measures 
independently, and allocates the requisite 
monies from the Community Services 
departmental budget. Yukon strives to identify 
highway infrastructure needs and undertakes 
improvements to the safety and quality of 
its highways on an ongoing basis. Drainage 
infrastructure improvement was noted, as a 
key facet of an ongoing territorial improvement 
approach to highway operation and maintenance.
•	
Some respondents indicated more funding should 
be provided for infrastructure upgrades that 
consider climate resilience. This is important for 
infrastructure replacement following flood events, 
as the “replacement in kind” does not typically 
consider future flood risks and vulnerabilities 
from the standpoint of redesign. To ensure 
infrastructure is effective to withstand current 
and future climatic conditions, “replacement in 
kind” should require incorporation of future flood 
risks and vulnerabilities during redesign and new 
construction.

The reliability and continuity of electricity supply relies on integrated generation, transmission and distribution 
systems. Flooding is a threat to effective performance of these systems, as stormwater can inundate transmission 
substations, damage power poles and wash out distribution feeders, all of which result in significant restoration 
and damage repair costs. Moreover, power outages may impact the operation of essential life support systems, 
including: water treatment plants and sewage pumping stations, hospitals and health care facilities, emergency 
centres, and transportation and telecommunication systems. This question pertains to the support of flood risk 
mitigation programs for the electricity sector at the provincial level.

British Columbia indicated the province is not 
formally involved in identifying flood risks 
for wastewater facilities, as this is typically a 
responsibility of the local governments. Through 
the Flood Protection Program (FPP), which 
ended in March 2016, the province provided 
opportunities to local governments to improve 
flood mitigation structures and protect drinking 
water and wastewater facilities. This program 
was an application-based program, with local 
governments obliged to identify flood protection 
priorities in order to be eligible for funding. 
Through the new National Disaster Mitigation 
Program, the province will be more involved in 
flood risk assessment to identify significant issues 
regionally and provincially. 
•	
Manitoba noted, within the Designated Flood

Floods can directly impact public health and safety. 
Disruption of “normal” health service activities, or 
delayed access to medical services may pose an 
immediate threat to human health. If flooding leads

Alberta indicated that Alberta Infrastructure 
plans and constructs health facilities, as required 
by the provincial healthcare authority, Alberta 
Health Services. Alberta Infrastructure developed 
the document entitled “Flood Risk Management 
Guidelines for Location of New Facilities Funded 
by Alberta Infrastructure.” This document outlines 
various risk management considerations for all 
types of critical infrastructure funded by the 
Government of Alberta, including new health 
facilities. As per the guidelines, sites for new 
hospitals, medical facilities and extended care 
facilities (including ancillary facilities such as power 
plants, service and maintenance facilities) are 
required to be 0.5 meters above the 1-in-1,000-
year design flood elevation.
•	
British Columbia has a broad range of publicly 
funded health services delivered through five 
regional health authorities, and one provincial 
health authority that delivers specialized provincial 
services and Providence Health Care. These health 
authorities are responsible for: acute care services 
delivered in hospitals, public health, residential 
care, community care, mental health services, pre-
hospital emergency services, and a range of other 
health services. With a few exceptions, British 
Columbia does not have health care facilities that 
are at risk of flooding. Health care facilities are 
typically located on higher ground, or behind a 
primary dike system (e.g. in the Fraser Valley). 
These sites also have emergency plans in place, 
in the event a failure of the primary dike system 
occurs. 
•	
Flooding is a hazard that Manitoba experiences 
on an annual basis, and Manitoba’s regional 
health authorities (RHAs) have been through 
a number of significant flood events that have 
required implementation of various mitigation, 
preparedness, response and recovery measures. 
All RHAs in Manitoba have dedicated disaster 
management programs. The province’s disaster 
management staff works collectively within 
health regions to ensure appropriate systems, 
processes, plans and procedures are in place to 
ensure continuity of all health services. These 
plans pertain to all hazards and focus on common 
consequences, with procedures and protocols 
in place for flood threats. The plans address 
continuity of care for patients and staff and 
all facets of the health sector - from facility to 
community-based services. The plans are tested on 
a regular basis and updated accordingly, as per the 
principles of continuous quality improvement. In 
addition, “Lessons Learned” reviews are conducted 
following flood events. The intention of these 
post-event reviews is to enhance systems and 
processes, and incorporate lessons learned into 
future responses.
•	
New Brunswick noted, the province has health 
clinics in all 15 First Nations communities. During 
crises, there is a provincial protocol between 
First Nations, the province, and the Federal First 
Nations Inuit Health Branch of Halifax to provide 
emergency health services.
•	
The Department of Health collaborates closely 
with regional health authorities, Ambulance New 
Brunswick, physicians, and other health sector 
partners to identify flood and other hazards that 
pose a danger to the health system or to the 
health of the public. The Department of Health 
Emergency Preparedness and Response Branch 
is responsible for the design, implementation 
and maintenance of a comprehensive all-
hazards emergency management program for 
the provincial health system; it is responsible to 
effectively prepare for, respond to, and recover 
from health emergencies, regardless of cause, 
scope or location. The branch is also responsible 
for ensuring that functional areas within the health 
system are able to fulfill their responsibilities under

the New Brunswick Emergency Measures Act, 
and that health system partners have undertaken 
the necessary preparedness planning to respond 
effectively to emergencies (including coordinated 
and integrated actions with other partners).
•	
Ontario noted, over the last five years, and due 
to a variety of climate change conditions, the 
province experienced a number of localized 
flooding events in northwestern, central and 
southwestern Ontario. These events highlighted 
the importance of climate change adaptation and 
flood preparedness, response, and mitigation. 
Accordingly, the province, conservation authorities 
and municipalities are working together to ensure 
flood risk planning is an important component of 
emergency management plans. Generally, flooding 
in Ontario tends to occur in the same locations, 
around the same time of year, and for the same 
reasons. This trend has provided sound lessons, 
learned at all levels of government, to better plan 
and prepare for floods and their associated social, 
health, and economic impacts. It is provincial 
policy in Ontario that new building development 
associated with institutional services is not 
permitted in a floodplain (e.g. hospitals, nursing 
homes and schools), as it would pose a significant 
threat to the safety of the inhabitants (i.e. the 
sick, the elderly, the disabled and the young). 
Where existing health services are located in flood 
vulnerable areas, conservation authorities provide 
support services to address and manage flood risk.

Hazardous materials that are typically transported via pipelines include petroleum (crude oil, condensate, natural 
gas, natural gas liquids and liquefied petroleum gas); petroleum products (products from distilling and processing 
of crude oil and natural gas liquids); anhydrous ammonia; and ethanol. 31  These materials may pose a significant 
threat to public health and safety, if released into the environment. This question explores provincial and territorial 
action to protect the public from risks associated with release of these hazardous materials due to flooding. 
Survey Question 11B: To what level has your jurisdiction considered flood risk factors in ensuring the health 
and safety of communities located in close proximity to pipelines carrying hazardous or potentially hazardous 
materials (i.e. gas, bitumen, oil, produced water)?

British Columbia noted, every oil and gas operator 
must have emergency management plans that 
address all relevant operational risks. Through the 
permitting process, the province examines risk 
assessments submitted by gas operators, including 
risks both to the site and those created by the 
site. These risk assessments form the foundation 
for design, routing and mitigation strategies 
and plans. In British Columbia, water crossing 
regulations do not require that the environmental 
approval process include a flood risk assessment. 
However, the mandatory pipeline standard (CSA 
Z662) requires a risk assessment for all identified 
hazards.
•	
New Brunswick requires that all pipeline 
owners must have their own emergency plans. 
Environmental impact assessment and emergency 
management plans are valid throughout all 
pipeline operations, from the construction to the 
decommissioning phase.
•	
Nova Scotia pointed out that pipelines carrying 
hazardous, or potentially hazardous materials, 
are privately-owned but the province exercises 
general regulatory supervision over pipelines. 
The province has developed a network of critical 
infrastructure partners that enables sharing of 
information, such as business continuity plans 
to address critical issues, including flood risk 
hazards. The location of critical infrastructure, 
including pipelines, determines the extent of 
the interaction. The province operates under a 
graduated response model. If pipelines are located 
within a municipality, the Nova Scotia Emergency 
Management Office’s regional staff coordinates 
with the municipality, critical infrastructure 
partners, and other relevant parties to coordinate 
the most appropriate emergency management 
plan.
•	
Ontario recognizes that private and public 
partners involved in the transportation of 
potentially dangerous goods must collaborate on 
emergency management planning and mitigation 
opportunities. The province works with large 
pipeline companies to ensure their emergency 
management plans are: robust, linked with 
provincial and municipal plans, exercised and 
tested on a regular basis, and considered in broad 
emergency management risk assessment activities. 
This includes pre-emptive action and mitigation of 
flood risks. 
•	
Respondents also noted, there are problems 
associated with corrosion of pipelines abandoned 
in place, including groundwater and soil 
contamination. This may have larger impacts, not 
just on the private landowners of the pipeline 
sites, but also on the communities located along 
the route of the abandoned pipelines. 
•	
Some respondents indicated the responsibility 
associated with public safety rests primarily with 
the municipalities. Thus, more collaboration is 
needed between provinces, municipalities and 
pipeline owners to ensure adequate emergency 
management planning for areas where pipelines 
are laid.

the impact and response action required to 
address a flooding event where contaminated sites 
may be affected, and how to contain contaminated 
areas. The joint provincial and municipal planning 
work is strengthened through continuous dialogue

are managed through: proper land-use planning, 
strict environmental protection provisions, 
significant fines for contravention, comprehensive 
emergency management plans that include 
contaminated site risk assessments, and the 
exercising and testing of plans.

Manitoba noted, during a flood emergency, the 
province employs the following two actions:
	
-	
Utilizes its network to share minute-to-minute
	
	
road information (for both provincial and
	
	
municipal roads) with first-responder dispatch
	
	
organizations to ensure efficient and safe 	
	
routing of responders to calls in the flood

New Brunswick noted, during the Spring Freshet 
(March to April annually), the province conducts 
the annual River Watch program, which is a 
joint undertaking between: the New Brunswick 
Emergency Measures Organization, the hydrology 
section of the Department of Environment 
and Local Government, Environment Canada 
meteorology, and the New Brunswick River 
Forecast Centre. This program involves a network 
of river gauges and cameras, ice observers, as well 
as staff dedicated to monitoring: river flow rates, 
water levels in critical areas, the implications of 
precipitation, and ice jams. Collected information 
is provided to all stakeholders and the public 
(via websites and 1-800 information lines) for 
situational awareness and decision making. In 
this way, threatened areas can be informed, 
forewarned, and take preparatory actions 
to minimize impacts. Where necessary and 
appropriate, public advisories are generated to 
inform on developing or current threats. Daily 
risk assessments are compiled and distributed to 
stakeholder departments and agencies, to assist 
in operational decision making. Flood inundation 
mapping and historical data are also employed to 
inform planning and preparedness activities. 
•	
Ontario works proactively with all municipal 
first-responder services to help develop detailed 
emergency response plans that address a variety 
of natural disasters, including flooding. First-
responder services include tactics, incident 
management, and operational practices in 
response to community flooding. Exercises to 
test emergency plans and first-responder services 
are among the important steps delivered by 
communities to support an effective response. 
•	
The Emergency Management and Fire Safety 
(EMFS) Branch provides communities, fire

Ontario noted, the province works closely with 
the petroleum industry through the Ministry of 
Energy. The provincial Emergency Fuel Plan and 
Emergency Energy Plan apply to flood events, 
where flooding may cut fuel supply and require 
alternate transportation, access and deployment 
of fuel sources. Municipalities are encouraged 
to work with their energy partners in the private 
and public sectors; they are urged to be aware of, 
plan for, and deploy in advance, necessary fuel 
resources based on known risks and associated 
Hazard Identification and Risk Assessments 
(HIRAs). In areas of Ontario where flooding has 
been prevalent, the province continues to be 
diligent in working to integrate emergency plans 
among private and public sector partners, to 
ensure flooding and the impact to fuel sources 
are addressed. Ontario’s Critical Infrastructure 
Assurance Program (OCIAP) focuses on energy 
supply in Ontario and considers the implications of 
flooding and fuel supply requirements during an 
emergency. 
•	
Saskatchewan indicated that the province 
is working with the Critical Infrastructure 
Advisory Network (CIAN), an advisory group 
of about 30 critical infrastructure owners and 
operators, government officials and security 
groups. The goal is to involve representatives 
from 10 different sectors: finance, water, 
government, transportation, food, health, 
manufacturing, energy and utilities, safety, and 
telecommunications. Together, CIAN advisors 
engage in the following:
	
-	
Identify linkages and establish effective lines 	
	
of communication between the Government 	
	
of Saskatchewan and owners of critical 	 	
	
infrastructure, both public and private;
	
-	
Promote education and awareness of issues,

The Nova Scotia Emergency Management Office 
(NS EMO) has developed an extensive network 
of critical infrastructure partners. Developing 
these relationships allows sharing of information, 
including business continuity plans; together, 
the partners address issues, including flood 
risk hazards, in order to coordinate a provincial 
response. Nova Scotia operates under a graduated 
response model. The location of the critical 
infrastructure determines the extent of NS 
EMO interaction. Where critical infrastructure is 
located within a specific municipality, NS EMO 
regional staff consults with the municipality, as 
well as the critical infrastructure partners and any 
other relevant parties, to co-ordinate the most 
appropriate response.

Ontario provides the Hazard Identification and 
Risk Assessment (HIRA) and associated risk 
assessment tools to support community planning 
and resilience with respect to energy management. 
Private sector electrical industry representatives 
are investing in state-of-the-art technology to 
enhance energy delivery and capacity in Ontario. 
Ontario also applies lessons learned from the 1998 
Ice Storm, the 2003 Blackout and the 2013 Ice 
Storm, as well as from a number of other weather 
events that disrupted electricity supply. Lessons 
learned have resulted in the following:
	
-	
Improved energy storage, including mobile 	
	
energy storage facilities 
	
-	
Alternate energy sources (windmills)
 	
-	
Public communication on energy consumption 	
	
during an emergency
	
-	
Forestry and canopy management 
	
-	
Investment in emergency planning and 	 	
	
preparedness
 	
-	
Exercising of local plans and resources.
•	
In addition, flood-related electrical outages have 
raised the need for adequate backup generation, 
alternative power supply, cross jurisdictional 
planning and personal preparedness to support 
public safety. Ontario is working closely with 
the power industry, local municipalities, and 
conservation authorities to assist in coordinating 
efforts to minimize power disruptions during flood 
events.
•	
Responders indicated that the resilience of 
communities to floods is intrinsically linked 
to the capacity of power network owners 
and operators to deal with flood damages 
and disruptions during and after floods. They 
agreed that the vulnerability of power networks 
to flooding causes a domino-effect on other 
critical infrastructure, leading to disruptions 
in the operation of: water treatment plants, 
sewage, water pipelines and pumping stations, 
transportation and other critical systems. The 
continuity of electricity supply, or lack thereof, 
impacts the ability of emergency responders to act 
and to ensure public safety.

Two public utilities, SaskPower and Yukon Energy, 
also provided responses and commentary to this 
survey question:

SaskPower provides guidance to local
	
	
municipalities to ensure local emergenc
	
	
response plans include the risk of sustaine
	
	
power outages due to a variety of potentia
	
	
causes, including flooding. SaskPower work
	
	
with individual municipalities to test their
	
	
respective response plans, although it does
	
	
not approve of adaptation initiatives external
	
	
to its operations.

Climate Change and the Preparedness of Canadian Provinces and Yukon to Limit Potential Flood Damage

The flood preparedness of Canadian provinces and 
Yukon, relative to the 12 categories of assessment 
reviewed in this report (p. iv), varies widely. This 
variance predisposes Canada to financial and 
social instability that will be realized during major 
precipitation events. To bring greater uniformity to 
national flood preparedness, the federal Minister 
of the Environment and Climate Change should 
organize a national forum of provincial and territorial 
counterparts. Business leaders should be invited to 
this forum, as suggested by survey participants to 
this report. Invitees should include, at the very least, 
leaders representing residential and commercial real 
estate, transportation systems, electricity supply and 
telecommunications providers.
Additional recommendations to help reduce provincial 
and territorial flood potential are described below:
Chief Adaptation Officer (CAO): A CAO specific to 
each province and territory would provide guidance to 
premiers, municipal leaders, businesses and others on 
ways and means to limit flood risk. Additionally, the 
CAO would ensure systems are in place to facilitate 
resiliency through proactive mitigation measures 
to reduce flood risks and minimize impacts in the 
aftermath of flooding. Recognizing that flooding 
affects all sectors of society, the dedicated expertise of 
CAOs would be integral to maintaining the continuity 
of operations across provinces and territories in light 
of increasingly challenging extreme weather.
Oversight of Flood Mitigation Responsibilities: 
Jurisdictional restrictions (i.e. strict national, provincial 
and municipal responsibilities) should be held to a 
minimum in reference to flood risk. Recognizing that 
provincial floods do not stop and start relative to pre-
ordained federal, provincial and municipal authority, 
CAOs would facilitate efforts to ensure that parties 
responsible for a particular risk act with prudence 
to limit exposure. For example, a CAO might facilitate 
a meeting of railway transport companies to ensure 
they have comprehensive plans to address flood risk 
exposure.
Audited Flood Preparedness Reports: On a multi-year 
basis (e.g. every five years), provinces and territories 
should issue audited public reports that document 
their state of flood preparedness relative to the 12 
categories of assessment considered in this report, and 
any material areas of challenge that may evolve. 
Land-use Planning: Provinces and territories should 
mandate that development in flood-prone areas 
be restricted, or that such developments be flood-
resilient. It is unconscionable that developments are 
continuing in recognized flood zones, with limited 
flood mitigation controls in cities across Canada. In the 
absence of land-use planning that better addresses 
flood risk, federal Disaster Financial Assistance 
Arrangement (DFAA) assistance to provinces and 
territories should be limited. Similarly, property and 
casualty insurers may limit insurance coverage relative 
to foreseeable high flood risk.
Build Back Better: All levels of government must 
consider changing climate and extreme weather 
projections when financing new, and re-building, 
infrastructure. Participants noted that often there 
are funding restrictions for flood repairs post disaster 
that prohibit incorporation of resiliency measures and 
a higher level of protection than what was present 
historically. This may lead to infrastructure being 
built to inadequate levels of flood preparedness. 
Thus, where practically and actuarially cost-effective, 
infrastructure should be re-built to meet new and 
future-projected climate realities.

3.0 Recommendations and Next Steps
Climate Change and the Preparedness of Canadian Provinces and Yukon to Limit Potential Flood Damage
85
The Canadian provinces and Yukon are on a steep 
learning curve in reference to addressing flood 
preparedness. Historically, concern related to 
debilitating flooding was minimal - however, the 
risks of the past are not the risks of the present, and 
certainly not the risks of the future. Establishing 
Chief Adaptation Officers in provinces and territories 
should be a priority for governments to address the 
growing extreme weather challenges. CAOs should 
have direct line reporting to premiers, and they 
should issue periodic reports on the state of flood 
preparedness. The findings of these reports should be 
well promulgated, and the public, business community, 
and all levels of government should be charged with 
the task of addressing flood risk mitigation deficiencies.
