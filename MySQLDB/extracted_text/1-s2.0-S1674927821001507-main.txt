Abstract
The Intraseasonal Oscillation (ISO) is the cornerstone for 2e8-week subseasonal prediction. Understanding the decadal variation of the ISO
is important for improving subseasonal prediction; however, there is still a gap in our knowledge of ISO dynamics. Here, we presented a method,
an Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis of 11-year-sliding ISO evolution, to objectively detect decadal variation of the ISO originated
from the equatorial Indian Ocean (EIO) during 1979e2016. The results show that the properties of ISO have a notable decadal change since
1998 for both boreal summer and boreal winter seasons, mainly in its evolution rather than in its intensity at origin. During the pre-1998 epoch,
the boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation (BSISO), was conﬁned to the Indian Ocean; since 1998, however, it propagated northeastward across
the Maritime Continent (MC) and the intraseasonal variability over the western North Paciﬁc was signiﬁcant enhanced. On the other hand, the
boreal-winter ISO, usually known as Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) shows minor changes in MC ‘barrier effect’ between the two epochs, and
continuously propagates eastward across the MC. The MJO only shows suppressed activity over the central equatorial Paciﬁc in the post-1998
epoch. These decadal changes are related to the eastern Paciﬁc cooling during the ‘global warming hiatus’ period rather than to the four-decade
global warming. Results here provide a set of potential precursors for foreseeing ISO propagation under different mean states.

1. Introduction
The tropical Intraseasonal Oscillation (ISO) has wide im-
pacts on extreme weathers globally (Zhang, 2013; Wang and
Moon, 2017a,b). After originated from the equatorial Indian
Ocean (EIO), the ISO exhibits distinct propagation charac-
teristics during boreal summer and winter seasons. The boreal-
winter ISO, usually known as Madden-Julian Oscillation
(MJO) (Madden and Julian, 1971, 1972) exhibits dominant
eastward
propagation
characteristic across
the Maritime
Continent (MC) (Zhang, 2005), while the boreal-summer
intraseasonal oscillation (BSISO; Wang and Xie, 1997), is
mainly dominated by northeastward propagation feature
(Yasunari, 1979; Krishnamurti and Subrahmanyam, 1982; Lau
and Chan, 1986; Annamalai and Sperber, 2005; Wang et al.,
2005), although seasonality also exists in BSISO (Liu et al.,
2020). Studying the decadal variation of the ISO is vitally
important for improving our understanding of ISO mechanism
and prediction of projected ISO changes in the future.

variability of the Asian summer monsoon in the decade of
2001e2010 was found to be increasing compared to that of
1979e1988 (Sabeerali et al., 2014). The BSISO activity,
deﬁned by the amplitude of the ﬁrst two principle components
of extended empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of
bandpass-ﬁltered
outgoing
longwave
radiation
(OLR)
(Kikuchi et al., 2011), exhibits signiﬁcant decadal variation
with greater activity for the period of 1999e2008 than for the
periods
of
1984e1998
and
2009e2014
(Yamaura
and
Kajikawa, 2016). This BSISO index, however, is obtained by
the assumption that the leading modes of the extended EOF or
the BSISO evolution do not have decadal change.
The global ISO activity, represented by the power spec-
trum, was found to have a decreasing trend in observation
(Suhas and Goswami, 2009; Raghavendra et al., 2019).
Increased residence times of the ISO over the IndoePaciﬁc
Ocean and the Warm Pool expansion during 1981e2018
(Roxy et al., 2019). The ISO increases in amplitude and fre-
quency in a warmer climate predicted for the end of the
century (Chang et al., 2015). Changes in ISO in the model are
sensitive to the pattern of sea surface temperature (SST)
warming, with signiﬁcant decreases in ISO precipitation and
wind variability for a zonally symmetric warming, and sig-
niﬁcant increases in ISO precipitation amplitude for a globally
uniform warming (Maloney and Xie, 2013). Under the future
anthropogenic forcing-induced global warming, the circula-
tion of the ISO is less changed than the convection in the
models due to enhanced static stability (Bui and Maloney,
2018; Maloney et al., 2019). In observation, however, it is
not clear whether the ISO changes are controlled by the global
warming trend or by the internal variability.
The seasonal-mean SST and the MC are two important
factors affecting ISO changes. Although the global-scale ISO
strength is not controlled by the underlying SST change
(Hendon et al., 1999; Slingo et al., 1999), the local strength of
the ISO is changed by the underlying SST variation, especially
over the western Paciﬁc (Salby and Hendon, 1994; Anyamba
and Weare, 1995; Hendon et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2016b;
Mao and Wang, 2018; Wang et al., 2021). This enhanced ISO
activity associated with the eastern Paciﬁc El Ni~no develop-
ment mostly takes place over the period of 1985e2000
(Gushchina and Dewitte, 2018). These ﬁndings, however, are
mainly for the interannual scale; and it remains unclear
whether the decadal SST variation can induce signiﬁcant
decadal change of the ISO or not.
Teleconnection of the ISO usually becomes the strongest
when its convection center propagates across the MC and
reaches the eastern edge of the MC (Adames and Wallace,
2014). The ISO originated from the EIO, however, some-
times vanishes over the MC (Zhang and Ling, 2017). This
‘barrier effect’ of the MC on the eastward propagation of the
MJO (Wang and Rui, 1990; Zhang and Ling, 2017; Chen and
Wang, 2018) and on the northeastward propagation of the
BSISO (Kajikawa et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2016a,b) usually
leads to the ISO ‘prediction barrier’ (Inness et al., 2003;
Weaver et al., 2011; Fu et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014; Jiang
et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2016). It is not clear whether there is
decadal change of this MC ‘barrier effect.’
In this work, multiple reanalysis data and an EOF analysis
of 11-year-sliding ISO evolution were used to identifying the
decadal variation of ISO evolution in both boreal summer and
boreal winter seasons. This study aimed at investigating the
signiﬁcant
difference
of
ISO
decadal
evolution
during
1979e2016. For example, before and after the ‘global
warming hiatus’ period. The results will help us understanding
the causes of their changes and provide an important hint for
model validating and ISO prediction under different back-
ground states.
2. Data and method
2.1. Data
Due to the wide use of OLR as a primary indicator for the
convection of both boreal-winter ISO (referred to as MJO from
now on) and boreal-summer ISO (referred to as BSISO from
now on) (Wheeler and Hendon, 2004; Kikuchi et al., 2011;
Lee et al., 2013), we used the daily OLR data of the Advanced
Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) from 1979 to
2016. These data are at 2.5 resolution and are based on the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
polar orbiting satellites (Liebmann and Smith, 1996). Daily
zonal and meridional winds at 850 hPa are used to represent
the ISO circulation, which are obtained from two sources, the
European
Centre
for
Medium-Range
Weather
Forecasts
(ECMWF) Reanalysis ERA-interim (Dee et al., 2011) and the
National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)-
Department of Energy (DOE) Reanalysis II (Kanamitsu et al.,
2002). The real-time multivariate indices, based on the multi-
variable EOF of OLR and of 850 hPa and 200 hPa zonal
winds, are often used for the MJO and BSISO (Wheeler and
Hendon, 2004; Lee et al., 2013). Here, we mainly focused
on the ISO convection represented by OLR.
To represent the decadal change of the mean state, we used
monthly mean SST from the Hadley Centre Global Sea Ice
and SST (Rayner et al., 2003), and monthly mean precipitation
from the Global Precipitation Climatology Projection (GPCP)
(Huffman et al., 1997). Two decadal modes of the interdecadal
Paciﬁc oscillation (IPO) and the Atlantic multi-decadal
oscillation (AMO) are calculated for reference purposes. The
IPO is deﬁned as the leading EOF of detrended annual SST
anomaly over the Paciﬁc (120E90W, 60S‒60N) (Power
et al., 1999; Meehl and Hu, 2006). The leading projected
coefﬁcient (PC) is used to represent the variability. The AMO
is calculated from annual SST anomaly averaged over the
North Atlantic (0‒80W, 0‒60N) after removing the global
mean SST (Trenberth and Shea, 2006). The 11-year Lanczos
low-pass ﬁlter is performed to obtain the decadal variability.
The 30‒90-day bandpass ﬁlter is performed on the OLR to
obtain intraseasonal signals. The ISO OLR index is deﬁned by
the EIO (70‒90E, 5S‒5N) averaged 30‒90-day OLR
anomaly. Due to the seasonality of ISO propagation (Kikuchi
773
WU N. et al. / Advances in Climate Change Research 12 (2021) 772e782
et al., 2011), we studied the BSISO and MJO separately. Here,
the boreal summer refers to MayeOctober, and the boreal
winter refers to NovembereApril.
2.2. EOF analysis of 11-year-sliding evolution of the
major modes of variability
Both the BSISO and MJO over the EIO have oscillation
periods of 30e60 d, and the BSISO has shorter periods than
the MJO. The ISO OLR index shows spectral peaks at 41 and
45 d, respectively, for BSISO and MJO during the period of
1979e2016 (Fig. 1a, g). The ISO evolution originated from
the EIO can be represented by the regression map of 30e90-
day OLR anomaly over the Indo-western Paciﬁc region
(40E150W, 20S‒30N) with reference to the EIO ISO
OLR index. The BSISO propagate northeastward (Fig. 1bef).
At day 0, the positive convection anomaly, represented by
negative OLR anomaly, is located in the EIO, coupled by
strong westerly wind anomaly in the EIO (Fig. 1b). The
southeast-northwest tilted rain band, coupled with the cyclonic
wind anomaly, forms since day 10 and reaches the western
North Paciﬁc (WNP) at day 20. The MJO is dominated by

signiﬁcant at the 95% conﬁdence level are shown; (gel) are the same as (aef), except for the boreal winter; an interval of 6 d is used for the lagged regression.
774

eastward propagation (Fig. 1hel). The EIO ISO convective
center is coupled with the westerly wind anomaly in terms of
phase, and with the easterly wind anomaly to the east in the
low troposphere. These divergent evolutions of the ISO during
different seasons were reported previously (Zhang and Dong,
2004; Zhang, 2005; Wang et al., 2009; Kikuchi et al., 2011).
We presented a new method, i.e., EOF analysis of the 11-
year-sliding ISO evolution, for detecting the decadal varia-
tion of the ISO objectively. From 1979 to 2016, we studied the
38 boreal summers and boreal winters. First, we calculated the
lagged regression maps for each 11-sliding years, to obtain 28
sets of 11-year sliding regression maps. We connected day
0 and day 10 to represent the BSISO evolution from phase
zero to phase one quarter, i.e., propagation of ISO convective
center from the EIO to the MC. Day 0 and day 12 were used
for the boreal winter due to a longer period of 45. Then, we
performed the EOF analysis on these 28 11-year-sliding maps
to obtain decadal changes. The PC time series or the projec-
tion coefﬁcients, normalized by their standard deviation, were
used to represent the decadal variation. More phases of the
ISO evolution were also used to perform the EOF analysis, and
similar results were obtained.
For each 11 years, we simply used the lag regression map
of OLR to represent the evolution of the ISO convection that
originates from the EIO during different decades. More
indices of global ISO evolution obtained from complicated
EOF analysis on ISO convection (Matthews, 2000; Kikuchi
et al., 2011), circulation (Knutson and Weickmann, 1987), or
combined convection and circulation (Wheeler and Hendon,
2004; Lee et al., 2013), as reviewed by Straub (2013) and
Kiladis et al. (2014), should be studied in the future. The in-
dividual ISO event identiﬁed by the tracking method (Ling
et al., 2014; Zhang and Ling, 2017) should also be further
studied.
2.3. Signiﬁcant test
Since the 30‒90-day bandpass ﬁlter is used, the effective
degrees of freedom should be used for signiﬁcant test on the
regression map. Following Livezey and Chen (1983), the
effective time (te) between two time series (X and Y ) can be
estimated from their autoregressive properties:
te ¼½1þ2
X
N
i¼1
CXXðiDtÞCYYðiDtÞDt
where N is the number of samples, Dt is the sampling time,
and C is the autocorrelation at lag iDt. The effective degrees of
freedom can then be estimated by t ¼ NDt=te.
To identify whether the change of ISO evolution between
two selected periods, such as 1979e1997 and 1998e2016, is
signiﬁcant or not, the bootstrapped resampling method with
10,000 random draws is used (Adams et al., 2003). Each time
we calculated two sets of lagged regression maps of 19 years,
which are selected from the period of 1979e2016 randomly,
and use their difference as one sample. Conﬁdence intervals
are calculated by using repeated (n ¼ 10,000) draws.
Signiﬁcance is then evaluated by comparing percentile (95%)
from the random draw to the selected difference.
3. Decadal variation of the ISO
3.1. EOF analysis of 11-year-sliding ISO evolution
The decadal variation of ISO evolution in terms of con-
vection can be obtained after performing EOF analysis on
these 11-year-sliding regression maps of OLR for both boreal
summer and winter. We obtained two signiﬁcant modes for
each season, which are statistically distinguishable from each
other and from higher modes according to the rule of North
et al. (1982). The percentage variance accounted for the
leading mode are 55% for the boreal summer and 44% for the
boreal winter, which are much higher than the second mode
that explains 22% and 27% for the boreal summer and boreal
winter, respectively. Next, we focused on the ﬁrst leading
mode (EOF1).
During the boreal summer, the spatial structure of EOF1
displays strong positive OLR anomaly over the WNP and
weak negative anomaly over the western part of the MC at day
0 when the BSISO center is located in the EIO (Fig. 2a). Ten
days later, the northeastward propagating BSISO forms a rain
band spanning the Arabian SeaeSouth IndiaeSouth Bay of
Bengal and the MC, and the EOF1 structure displays negative
anomaly over the Arabian Sea, India, and MC, and strong
positive anomaly over the WNP (Fig. 2b). Although the sec-
ond mode (EOF2) is well distinguishable from other modes,
the anomalies along the path of BSISO northeastward propa-
gation are too weak compared to those of EOF1 (Fig. 3a, b).
During the boreal winter, the structure of EOF1 displays
strong negative OLR anomaly over the central equatorial Pa-
ciﬁc, Philippine Sea, and northern Australia at day 0 when the
MJO has a wet phase in the EIO and a dry phase in the western
equatorial Paciﬁc (Fig. 2c). Twelve days later, the MJO center
reaches the MC, and the EOF1 structure displays positive OLR
anomaly from the eastern Indian Ocean to the western equa-
torial Paciﬁc, and the anomaly over the MC is weak (Fig. 2d).
The anomalies of EOF2 are also much weaker than EOF1
along the path of MJO eastward propagation (Fig. 3c and d).
The dominant mode of BSISO evolution changes its phase
from negative to positive around 1996/1997 (Fig. 2e). The
negative phase peaks during the decade around 1990, and the
positive phase peaks during the decade around 2004. This
decadal change around 1997 was also reported in Yamaura and
Kajikawa (2016). The EOF1 of MJO has similar decadal
change around 1997/1998, and its negative phase and positive
phase peak during the decades around 1992 and 2007,
respectively. The second mode has positive phase peaking
around the late-1990s and negative phases peaking around the
mid-1980s and 2010 for both boreal summer and winter
(Fig. 3e).
Since the ISO is a convection-circulation coupling system,
we further checked whether the same decadal variation exists
in the ISO circulation. The same method as used for making
Fig. 2 is performed on the ISO circulation evolution. Since the
775
WU N. et al. / Advances in Climate Change Research 12 (2021) 772e782
ISO westerly anomaly is in phase with the OLR anomaly in
the EIO at day 0 (Fig. 1b, h), we deﬁned the ISO U index as
the 30‒90-day-ﬁltered 850 hPa zonal-wind anomalies aver-
aged in the EIO for the boreal summer and for the boreal
winter. The ISO evolution can be represented by the regression
map of 30e90-day 850 hPa zonal-wind anomaly over the
IndoePaciﬁc region with reference to the EIO ISO U-index.
The same two dominant decadal changes as in the ISO con-
vection can be obtained in the ISO circulation for both seasons
based on the ERA-Interim dataset (Fig. 4). This result means
that the convection and circulation of the ISO couples well
from 1979 to 2016, and both ﬁelds experience similar decadal
change. These two dominant modes can also be obtained in
the NCEP reanalysis II dataset, while the ﬁrst mode has a
phase transition about three years earlier than that in the ERA-
Interim dataset (not shown).
3.2. Different ISO evolutions before and after 1998
This decadal change of the ISO evolution can be clearly
seen by comparing ISO evolution before and after 1998.
During the boreal summer of 1979e1997 (Fig. 5a), the
BSISO, originates from the EIO and propagates northeastward
from day 0 to day 5; and it forms a southeast-northwest tilted
rain band across the Arabian SeaeSouth IndiaeSouth Bay of
Bengal and the MC regions at day 10, though this tilted rain
band is weak. Since day 10, this rain band decays quickly and
the negative phase of the BSISO appears over the EIO. The
strong ISO center over the WNP at day 20 cannot be found for

776

this period, which means the BSISO originated from the EIO
does not propagate to the WNP around the 1980s and 1990s.
During the boreal summers of 1998e2016 (Fig. 5b), the
BSISO originated from the EIO propagates northeastward.
The strong tilted rain band across the Arabian SeaeSouth
IndiaeSouth Bay of Bengal and the MC regions appears
since day 10, which is much stronger than that in the summers
before 1998. This strong rain band continues to move north-
eastward and lasts until day 20. The strong BSISO reaches the
WNP at day 20.
Decadal changes of the BSISO evolution between these
two periods can be clearly seen in Fig. 5c. Compared to the
early period, the dry phase over the WNP for the EIO
BSISO is much stronger after 1998, and the difference is
signiﬁcant. Along the northeastward propagation of the
BSISO, the enhancement of the tilted rain band is also
signiﬁcant.
During the boreal winters of 1979e1997 (Fig. 6a), the MJO
exhibited dominant eastward propagation path. The MJO
passed over the MC region from day 12 to day 18, while its
major center is located to the south of the MC and over the
Arafura Sea. After passing over the MC, the MJO is enhanced
over the central equatorial Paciﬁc at day 24. For the later
period of 1998e2016 (Fig. 6b), the MJO shows similar east-
ward propagation as in the early period. The MJO activity over
the MC is not changed. The only change happens over the
South Paciﬁc Convection Zone (SPCZ) region; and the nega-
tive phase at day 0 and convective center at day 24 are both
weaker than in the early period, which can be seen in their
difference (Fig. 6c).
These results show that the dominant decadal change
happens for both BSISO and MJO around the end of last
century, mainly in their evolution. This dominant decadal
change of the ISO does not occur over the EIO at day
0 (Fig. 2a, c, Fig. 5a and Fig. 6a). Compared to the early epoch
of 1979e1997, the ISO intensity at origin during 1998e2016,
measured by the standard deviation of EIO ISO OLR index, is
only decreased by 6% for BSISO and by 0.4% for MJO, which
indicates that the intensity of the origination of both BSISO
and MJO is steady over the EIO. The oscillation periods,
however, are shortened during 1998e2016 for both BSISO
and MJO over the EIO, although their peaks do not change
(Fig. 7). Correspondingly, the BSISO and MJO propagate
faster after 1998, which may relate to the warmer SST over the
tropical regions except the central-eastern Paciﬁc (Fig. 8).
In summary, after having originated from the EIO, the
BSISO is much suppressed along its northeastward propaga-
tion path before 1998 and cannot reach the WNP, while it can
reach the WNP after 1998 and affect the ISO there. This
decadal change may contribute to the increased BSISO ac-
tivity since 1998 (Yamaura and Kajikawa, 2016). This change
also explains the increased intraseasonal variability of Asian
summer monsoon during 2001e2010 when compared to that
during 1979e1988 (Sabeerali et al., 2014), and explains why
the ISO over the South China Sea is related to the north-
westward propagating mode over the western Paciﬁc during
1979e1993 (Kajikawa et al., 2009). The MJO, however, only
has a decadal change in strength, which is suppressed over the
central equatorial Paciﬁc after 1998. The MC ‘barrier effect’
does not have a signiﬁcant decadal change. Since the MJO

mainly prevails in the Indian Ocean and has less projection on
the Paciﬁc in the recent years, this explains why the global
ISO activity has a decreasing trend in the observation (Suhas
and Goswami, 2009; Raghavendra et al., 2019).
4. Decadal change of the mean state
To understand the decadal variation of the ISO around
1997/1998, we investigated mean state changes in precipita-
tion and SST (Fig. 8). Since the end of the last century, the
eastern Paciﬁc cooling, which is related to the ‘global warm-
ing hiatus’ (Kosaka and Xie, 2013), appears in both boreal
summer (Fig. 8a) and winter (Fig. 8b). The spatial structure
displays an IPO-like anomaly. The eastern equatorial Paciﬁc
cooling during winter is stronger than that during summer.
This ‘global warming hiatus’ was supposed to be related to the
internal mode of the AMO and IPO (Kosaka and Xie, 2013;
Chen and Tung, 2014; Meehl et al., 2014). The correlations
between the PC1 of Fig. 2 and IPO are 0.73 and 0.85 for the
boreal summer and winter, respectively. The correlations for
this PC1 and AMO are 0.96 and 0.97 for the boreal
summer and winter, respectively.
Associated with this eastern Paciﬁc cooling in the recent
decades, the boreal summer and winter show different pre-
cipitation responses. During the boreal summer (Fig. 8a),
positive precipitation anomalies occur over the Asian monsoon
region including the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, the
WNP, and the MC, while weak negative precipitation anomaly
happens over the central equatorial Paciﬁc. These positive
seasonal-mean precipitation anomalies favor the development

of the ISO along its northeastward propagation path, while the
negative seasonal-mean precipitation anomalies over the cen-
tral equatorial Paciﬁc prohibit the eastward propagation of the
BSISO.
During the boreal winter (Fig. 8b), strong positive precip-
itation anomalies occur over the MC and strong negative
precipitation anomalies appear over the central equatorial
Paciﬁc. The positive precipitation anomalies over the Arafura
Sea between Indonesia and Australia, however, are very weak.
Since the major convection of the ISO is over the sea rather
than over the island when crossing the MC (Zhang and Ling,
2017; Ling et al., 2019), the major center of the MJO can pass
over the Arafura Sea without being enhanced much; then, it
can be suppressed by the strong negative seasonal-mean pre-
cipitation
anomaly
over
the
central
equatorial
Paciﬁc.
Although the decadal change of the seasonal-mean state is
even stronger for the boreal winter than for the boreal summer,
the decadal change of the BSISO is much larger than that of
the MJO over the MC.
5. Conclusion and discussion
We presented EOF analysis on the 11-year-sliding ISO
evolution, to study the decadal variation of the ISO. This
method objectively detects signiﬁcant decadal change in the
ISO evolution in terms of both convection and circulation
around the end of the 20th century for both BSISO and MJO.
This decadal change of the ISO mainly happens in its evolu-
tion rather than in the intensity of its origination in the EIO,
and the oscillation period are shortened in post-1998 epoch for

both seasons. After having originated from the EIO, the
strength of tilted rain band of the BSISO along its northeast-
ward propagation path, especially over the MC and WNP, is
much stronger during 1998e2016 than during 1979e1997.
The signiﬁcant decadal change of the MJO only happens over
the central equatorial Paciﬁc, which is much weaker during
1998e2016 than during 1979e1997.
These decadal variations are found to be related to recent
eastern Paciﬁc cooling in the equatorial region since 1998. The
increased seasonal-mean precipitation over the MC and Asian
monsoon regions will enhance the BSISO along its north-
eastward propagation path. The increased precipitation over
the MC has a weak impact on the MJO since the ISO center
passes by the MC through the Arafura Sea; thus, there is no
decadal change in the ‘MC barrier’ effect for the MJO. The
decreased seasonal-mean precipitation over the central equa-
torial Paciﬁc since 1998 suppresses the ISO there.
ISO is the dominant mode of atmospheric intraseasonal
variability. The ISO strongly modulates the occurrence of
many types of extreme weather and climate events in tropics
and midlatitudes, including ﬂoods, droughts, cold surges, heat
waves, tropical cycles, and many more (Wang and Moon,
2017a,b; Wang et al., 2019; Zhang, 2013). Under the global
warming of the last four decades, the ISO evolution change is
mainly controlled by internal mode rather than by the global
warming, which challenges our decadal prediction of ISO
evolution. Understanding the relative role of this internal-
mode-induced SST pattern change and anthropogenic green-
house gas-induced global mean moisture and static stability
changes on the ISO evolution is important for improving our
understanding in the decadal change of the ISO evolution. It
would be of interest to investigate how the current GCMs
modeling the decadal change od ISO during 1979e2016. The
revealed ISO decadal changing feature in this work offers
clues for validating GCMs and for projecting ISO's future
changes under global warming.
