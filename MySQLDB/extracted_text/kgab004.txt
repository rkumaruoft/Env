ABSTRACT
China’s pledge to reach carbon neutrality before 2060 is an ambitious goal and could provide the world with much-needed
leadership on how to limit warming to þ1.5C warming above preindustrial levels by the end of the century. But the path-
ways that would achieve net zero by 2060 are still unclear, including the role of negative emissions technologies. We use
the Global Change Analysis Model to simulate how negative emissions technologies, in general, and direct air capture (DAC)
in particular, could contribute to China’s meeting this target. Our results show that negative emissions could play a large
role, offsetting on the order of 3 GtCO2 per year from difﬁcult-to-mitigate sectors, such as freight transportation and heavy
industry. This includes up to a 1.6 GtCO2 per year contribution from DAC, constituting up to 60% of total projected negative
emissions in China. But DAC, like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage and afforestation, has not yet been demon-
strated anywhere approaching the scales required to meaningfully contribute to climate mitigation. Deploying NETs at
these scales will have widespread impacts on ﬁnancial systems and natural resources, such as water, land and energy in
China.

INTRODUCTION
On 22 September 2020 China announced that it would pursue a
plan to achieve ‘carbon neutrality’ in its economy by 2060 [1].
China has previously committed to peaking its CO2 emissions
before 2030 [2], and its new carbon neutrality commitment
greatly strengthens its nationally determined contributions un-
der the Paris Climate Agreement. There are a number of studies
that have explored China’s decarbonization pathways [3–8], but

not much attention has been given to the role that negative
emissions technologies (NETs) could play, especially the avail-
ability of direct air capture (DAC). In our recent paper, we
assessed the negative emissions requirement for meeting a
þ1.5C target globally [9]. Our results indicated that DAC could
play a large role with much of that activity concentrated in the
USA and China because of their substantial capacity to carry out
geologic carbon storage [9].
The number of countries, regional governments and corpo-
rations, which have been making carbon neutrality commit-
ments, has been accelerating [10]. While China is distinct from
many of the other countries and institutions making decarbon-
ization pledges because of its size, its announcement was simi-
lar to other national commitments, such as the UK’s and
Japan’s that have provided few details about implementation
and enforcement [11–13]. China today produces approximately
one-third of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but up to
30% of these emissions result from production of goods that are
exported to other regions of the world [14–18]. In addition, en-
ergy consumption in China is currently highly carbon intensive
with most of its primary energy supply coming from coal com-
bustion [19, 20]. Wang et al. [21] examined pathways to decar-
bonize China’s power sector, including the use of bioenergy
with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and the early retire-
ment of coal-fired generation units. But China has recently
invested in 38 GW of new coal capacity in 2020 and has indi-
cated intention to build hundreds of new coal-fired power
plants in its most recent 5-year plan [22–24]. This is at odds with
its stated efforts to decarbonize, as well as those to improve air
quality. As reported by Wang et al., China’s late-stage industrial
sector could rapidly reduce CO2 emissions over the coming dec-
ades under global climate policy with a combination of energy
efficiency improvements, fuel switching and carbon capture
and storage (CCS). However, owing to its size related to other
large economies, such as Western Europe, and the prohibitive
expense of fully decarbonizing some industrial processes (e.g.
iron and steel), China’s industrial sector could have over 1
GtCO2 of residual emissions by 2050 [25]. Transportation in
China and elsewhere is expected to remain recalcitrant to
decarbonization relative to other sectors, owing to continued
dominance of petroleum-derived liquid fuels, especially for
freight [26–28]. Like other large economies, China’s CO2 emis-
sions declined temporarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, emissions in China and elsewhere are rebounding
and are likely resume their historic growth trajectory without
investment in lower carbon technologies and deliberate policy
action to reduce them [29, 30]. In order to achieve its carbon-
neutrality target, China will need to rapidly decarbonize its
power, transportation and industrial sectors in the near term
and will likely have to seek opportunities for negative emissions
in the long term [31, 32].
To achieve carbon neutrality, a country needs to balance
emissions and sinks. For any large and complex economy, there
will be sources of emissions that will be recalcitrant to decar-
bonization, such as aviation, freight transport and high-temper-
ature heat applications in industry. For this reason, there is a
growing interest in approaches for actively removing emissions
from the atmosphere [33]. So-called NETs are a suite of engi-
neered or natural approaches, such as DAC, BECCS and affores-
tation that remove carbon from the atmosphere and could play
an important role in offsetting recalcitrant emissions, and/or
reaching net-negative emissions globally or regionally. China
has attempted afforestation projects to combat desertification
and soil erosion in the past, with mixed success in initial phases
[34–36]. Adapting forest protection and afforestation approaches
based on lessons learned could reduce negative impacts on bio-
diversity and water availability, and some studies indicate that
the expanding forest cover in China may be generating large
carbon sinks from the atmosphere [37]. Preventing further de-
forestation and restoring previously deforested land to its natu-
ral state has potential environmental and human health
cobenefits, in addition to storing carbon from the atmosphere
[38]. However, China’s experience with afforestation highlights
the potential challenges of further expanding this approach for
large-scale climate mitigation due to measurement uncertain-
ties inherent to natural and managed forest systems, competi-
tion with agricultural land demands, opposing goals of carbon
storage and timber harvest, large land and water footprints, and
the potential lack of permanence of forest carbon stocks in a
warming world [39, 40]. As China’s government seeks to in-
crease the standard of living for its citizens, large-scale bioen-
ergy crop cultivation could also compete with food production,
as well as environmental conservation objectives [41–43]. DAC
is an emerging technology with a far lower land footprint than
BECCS or afforestation, but large energy demand due to the
thermodynamic unfavourability of separating atmospheric CO2
at 415 PPM [44, 45]. With recent, more optimistic cost esti-
mates for DAC, several large European and US-based companies
have made investments in commercial DAC technologies, and
still others have committed to using negative emissions includ-
ing DAC to draw down their historical emissions from the atmo-
sphere [46–50]. Given China’s currently large emissions, its
capacity for geologic storage [51], and the large share of its car-
bon-intensive exports in the global economy, DAC could poten-
tially play a large role in deep decarbonization there. Yet there
has not yet been modeling performed to understand the role
and tradeoffs of DAC and other negative emissions in China in
achieving its recently announced climate ambitions.
At a global scale, integrated assessment models (IAMs) have
been used to explore deep decarbonization pathways [52]. IAMs
incorporate economic, geophysical, demographic and climate
modules to study future policy scenarios. The International
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) uses a suite of IAMs to explore
different scenarios and inform international commitments, in-
cluding those laid out in the 2015 Paris Agreement [52]. Over the
past several years, IAMs have been used to explore what it
would take to limit future anthropogenic climate change to
þ1.5C warming relative to preindustrial levels. All the IAMS
used by the IPCC show that, in order to meet these aggressive
decarbonization scenarios, NETs will be needed to help offset
recalcitrant emissions. BECCS and afforestation are the most
widely modeled technologies with median projected global
deployments of respectively, 4 and 2 GtCO2 per year, projected
by 2050 to limit warming to below 2C in 2100. Several recent
modeling studies have also assessed engineered NETs, such as
DAC, with even higher projected deployments to actively draw
down atmospheric CO2 levels [9, 53–55]. Such large deployments
of these NETs will entail enormous transitions for energy and
land, as well as water use patterns, and it is critical to under-
stand how these might unfold at the country level [9].
The goal of this article is to estimate the potential role of
DAC and other forms of negative emissions to help China meet
its carbon neutrality goal, as well as their interactions with miti-
gation efforts. In particular, we examine how the availability of
different NETs might affect the required decarbonization of dif-
ferent sectors and the extent to which each type of NET could
be deployed. We estimate the costs and tradeoffs for land, water
and energy systems of negative emissions deployment in

China. The scale at which they could be needed in order to meet
this target is quite large, so it is crucial to understand the trade-
offs these technologies would represent. These results could
also provide baseline cost estimates to inform where to target
investments in innovation. To perform this analysis, we used
the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) [56], a technology-
rich IAM with embedded simplified versions of global climate
and carbon dynamics. We modeled three main scenarios featur-
ing estimates for DAC cost and energy intensity to assess how
China might achieve its carbon neutrality target in 2060. In ad-
dition, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to understand how
key model assumptions could influence the projected role of
DAC in China. These results provide insight about the techno-
logical transitions, as well as financial, environmental and hu-
man health impacts that could result from NETs deployments
in China.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We used the latest release of GCAM 5.3 [56], enhanced with the
capability to model DAC, to simulate different paths by which
China individually, as well as the rest of the world, collectively
might reach net-zero emissions by 2060 (Table 1). We followed
the near-term to net-zero approach described in Kaufman et al.
[57] We assumed a linearly declining net CO2 emissions trajec-
tory from 2021 until reaching zero net CO2 emissions in 2060 for
both China separately and the rest of the world (ROW) together.
This modeling approach for net-zero CO2 emissions pathways
accommodates
uncertainties
and
measurement
difficulties
while also helping guide near-term policy design. Specifically,
while the prospective future availability of DAC and other NETs
would tend to delay mitigation in modeling scenarios where the
CO2 price rises at an assumed interest rate, this could prove to
be a risky bet for real-world decision-makers if NETs and other
uncertain technologies prove unable to scale up as rapidly as
expected, and/or as impacts from climate change itself worsen
[57–59]. With this CO2 constraint, we evaluated three parametri-
zations for the cost, efficiency and availability of DAC (i.e. high-
cost DAC, low-cost DAC and no DAC available). Population and
gross domestic product (GDP) input assumptions follow the
‘middle of the road’ scenario widely used in integrated model-
ing studies and can be found in the Supplementary data [60].
Prices on land-use change and correspondingly, subsidies for af-
forestation, are specified as an increasing proportion of the fos-
sil and industrial carbon emissions price, reaching 100% of the
fossil carbon price by 2100. This is intended to represent gradu-
ally improving institutions for pricing land-use change emis-
sions, given that agriculture and land-use decisions now largely
occur outside of regulatory frameworks in most countries [9].
We modeled DAC as a process that uses an aqueous reaction
between atmospheric CO2 and a hydroxide solution that has
evaporative water losses at the air contactor [61–63]. The DAC
technology requires energy input in the form of high-tempera-
ture process heat and electricity, and financial inputs for capital
expenditure and nonenergy operations and maintenance, given
in Table 2. For low-cost DAC, financial and energy inputs are as-
sumed to decline linearly between their 2020 and 2050 paramet-
rizations, then remain constant after 2050. In the high-cost DAC
cases, the technology is assumed to remain costly and energy-
intensive over time. We assume that the process heat is high-
temperature heat from natural gas combustion and not lower
temperature waste heat or renewables. While there are other
DAC archetypes that can use renewable electricity and/or waste
heat input and do not consume water [64], we focused our
analysis on this high-temperature process because it appears to
be the most inexpensive and commercially mature at present
[61, 65]. Geological carbon storage costs are treated endoge-
nously by GCAM. Note that DAC is assumed to behave as a
quasi-backstop technology, with no external constraints on its
deployment outside the availability of energy, carbon storage,
and its cost relative to other mitigation and NETs in meeting a
binding cap on CO2 emissions. No constraints were imposed on
the scaling rate of DAC or any other technology. We assumed a
median lifetime for DAC plants of 40 years. No other technologi-
cal, institutional or legal limitations are modeled with respect
to DAC, which we assume can be deployed rapidly at scale in
the model under appropriate conditions. Because of these
assumptions, the simulated rate of DAC deployment at the
costs specified may be considered as an upper bound.
RESULTS
Figure 1 presents the results for (a) global average temperature
anomaly, (b) atmospheric CO2 concentration and (c) CO2 emis-
sions over time for China as well as globally. The CO2 emission
trajectories after 2020 follow directly from the constraints im-
posed. If China and the ROW together reduce their emissions to
net-zero by 2060, this results in approximately þ1.8C of warm-
ing in 2100. Scenarios in which DAC is deployed show slightly
higher warming in 2100 despite meeting the same CO2 emis-
sions cap, owing to fugitive methane emissions from the pro-
duction of natural gas which DAC takes as an input, as well as
higher residual non-CO2 emissions from difficult-to-mitigate
sectors. In all scenarios, criteria air pollutant emissions in China
(e.g. black carbon, VOC, NOx and SO2) are projected to decline
drastically from their current levels due to the phase-down of
coal as an energy source, regardless of the availability of DAC.
In relation to their 2010 levels, black and organic carbon particu-
late emissions each decline by over 80%, NOx emissions decline

China þ ROW net-zero 2060
China, along with the rest of the world, achieves net-zero CO2 by 2060 in a linearly declining emis-
sions trajectory. China’s emissions are individually constrained, but emissions from the
remaining regions in the ROW are allowed to be individually greater than or less than a sepa-
rately imposed emissions constraint, so long as their sum is less than or equal to this
constraint.

tant environmental and public health cobenefits of CO2 emis-

policy.
Detailed
projections
for
non-CO2
emissions for our three main scenarios are provided in the
Supplementary data.
Figure 2 illustrates the extensive transformation China will
need to make to its economy in order to achieve its 2060 net-
zero target. The panel on the left shows the dominant current
emission sectors: transportation, industrial and electric power.
On the right, the panel shows the results of three permutations
of the China þ rest of world net-zero 2060 scenario; one in
which no DAC is available, one in which DAC is available but
continues to be expensive, and one in which DAC is available
and gradually improves in cost and energy efficiency by 2050
(Table 2). In all three cases, China will rely on significant deploy-
ment of negative emissions to achieve its net-zero target.
Our results show that getting China and the ROW to net-
zero by 2060 without DAC, would require China to deploy at
least 1 GtCO2 per year of negative emissions from BECCS and af-
forestation, which is in line with a recent study by Yu et al. [31]
Achieving the net-zero CO2 target without DAC available, that
is, relying only on BECCS and afforestation for negative emis-
sions, would result in a marginal cost of over $800 per tCO2 in
2060 ($2015 price). With DAC available, the world along with
China could achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2060 at much
lower marginal costs, in the range of US$200–400 per tCO2. This
carbon price corresponds to the sum of the capture þ carbon
storage costs for DAC, both of which become gradually more
costly over time as geologic storage reservoirs and energy
resources are consumed. Full carbon emissions price paths are
reported in the Supplementary data.
Under the low-cost DAC deployment, China would require
about 3 GtCO2 per year of negative emissions to reach net-zero
by 2060, much of it coming from DAC, with the remainder com-
ing from BECCS and afforestation. If DAC does not improve in
cost and energy efficiency, it would make-up a smaller percent-
age of the negative emissions portfolio, which would still total 2
GtCO2 per year. Residual, positive CO2 emissions from difficult-
to-mitigate sectors require multiple GtCO2 of negative emis-
sions to offset them in all scenarios. In the no DAC scenario, the
industrial sector becomes a net sink of CO2 largely through hy-
drogen production from biofeedstocks and CCS. Low-cost DAC
availability allows up to 1 GtCO2 emissions from industrial en-
ergy use in China to be offset at lower cost. Transportation is
projected to be recalcitrant to decarbonization across all scenar-
ios. While passenger transportation can decarbonize through
electrification and hydrogen fuel cells, freight trucks using both
liquid and natural gas fuels under the carbon policy result in
large residual emissions. An electrified and/or hydrogen fuel

Notes: For low-cost DAC, we assume that the energy efﬁciency of the technology improves between 2020 and 2050. The energy and nonenergy cost inputs are as-
sumed to decline linearly between year 2020 and 2050 and thereafter remain constant. For the high-cost DAC scenario, we assume that the technology will remain
costly and energy-intensive.
Figure 1: Model results show different trajectories for global temperature anomaly
(a), even though CO2 concentration (b) and net CO2 emissions (c) over time are the
same for the three scenarios simulated here. Globally net-zero emissions could
limit end-of-century warming to below þ2C, but more ambitious near-term miti-
gation and/or future net-negative emissions is required to meet a below þ1.5C
goal. Historical data for emissions [65], CO2 concentrations [66] and temperature
anomaly [67] are indicated by grey lines. Four data sources were used to report
recorded historical temperature anomaly; the darker grey line indicates overlap or
especially high agreement between different observations, which were plotted
with slightly increased transparency for clarity. Projected warming is approxi-
mately 0.1C higher in the low-cost DAC scenario owing to increased fugitive emis-
sions from the natural gas supply chain to power DAC itself, as well as higher
levels of non-CO2 residual emissions from other economic sectors.

substantially reduce the need to deploy NETs to offset their
emissions. Transportation emissions are slightly higher in the
DAC scenarios due to higher service demand because the lower
carbon emissions prices lead to correspondingly lower fuel pri-
ces. There is also less need to switch from vehicles using petro-
leum-derived fuels to electric, natural gas and hydrogen fuel
cell vehicles if DAC is available to offset these distributed emis-
sions. Detailed breakdowns of industrial and transportation CO2
emissions in China, as well as transportation demand are made
available in the Supplementary data.
Figure 3 shows the projected primary energy transitions for
China to reach net-zero CO2 emissions by 2060. At present, China
relies heavily on coal and oil for its primary energy. To achieve
net zero CO2 emissions will require a substantial rollout of
renewable energy over the coming 40 years in addition to very
large deployment of fossil CCS. For the three negative emissions
cases described in Fig. 3 for the China þ rest of world net-zero by
2060 scenario (no DAC available, high cost and low-cost DAC) we
see
important
differences
in
energy
consumption
patterns.
Notably, the deployment of DAC consumes natural gas for process
heat on the same order of magnitude as all of China’s present-day
gas consumption. The primary energy consumption of coal
declines from 67% share in 2020 to 21% in 2060 without DAC. This
includes 2% conventional coal and 19% coal-based CCS. With low-
cost DAC deployment, the share of coal would decline to 22% in
2060 with 4% conventional coal and 18% coal-based CCS.
Figure 4 shows potential water consumption patterns for
China in meeting its net-zero CO2 emissions by 2060 goal.
Figure 2: Pathways for China to reach net-zero CO2 emissions by 2060 all involve deep emissions reductions and CO2 removal. The availability of DAC technology in
China enables less use of BECCS and also offsets emissions from difﬁcult-to-mitigate sectors, such as transportation and industry, allowing higher emissions from
these sectors relative to the no DAC case. Results shown here are for the China þ ROW net-zero 2060 scenario, which results in approximately 1.8C of warming from
preindustrial in 2100.

Process heat for DAC (i.e. the primary energy from natural gas CCS devoted solely to CO2 removal) is reported separately in indigo (dark purple at top of bars) and sub-

Irrigation for agriculture comprises most of the historical and
projected water consumption, and evapotranspiration from
rainfed agriculture is not included in this figure. Agricultural
water consumption is projected to decline slightly by 2060 ow-
ing to technological improvements and exogenous assumptions
of population peaking and then declining by mid-century. In all
cases, irrigation for bioenergy crop cultivation expands from
near-zero level in present day, to substantial fractions of overall
water use in 2060. If no DAC is available, bioenergy crop irriga-
tion grows to 7 km3 per year in 2060, which is nearly 3% of pro-
jected water consumption for that year. If low-cost DAC can be
deployed at scale in China, this could reduce bioenergy irriga-
tion consumption to approximately 5 km3 per year. But, evapo-
rative losses from DAC itself are projected to consume large
amounts of water, over 7 km3 per year in 2060, nearly 80% of
municipal water consumption in China in 2015.
Figure 5 reports historical and projected land use for China if
it and the ROW reach net-zero emissions by 2060, relative to a
2005 base year. The existing historical trend of gradual forest
expansion is greatly accelerated, whereas grasslands see a re-
versal of recent historical growth as bioenergy and afforestation
are scaled up. Land area for food cultivation (i.e. grains and sta-
ple crops) is projected to decline by nearly 100 000 km2 from
2005 levels in China in 2060 in the no DAC scenario, while bio-
energy crop production expands to over 190 000 km2 and for-
ested area gains approximately 430 000 km2. Low-cost DAC can
reduce the decline in food production land slightly, to approxi-
mately 90 000 km2, with 148 000 km2 being used for bioenergy
crop cultivation, and 380 000 km2 net gain in forest area from
2005 level. Without DAC available, weighted prices for major
staple grain crops increase to 300% of their 2010 levels (200% in-
crease) due to land competition from BECCS and afforestation.
Low-cost DAC availability reduces this increase to approxi-
mately 175% of their 2010 levels (75% increase). Figure 5 also
reports how the availability of DAC could reduce biomass crop-
land area required for mitigation and negative emissions in ma-
jor river basins in China. In the most productive agricultural
regions in eastern China, the availability of DAC could reduce
biomass cropland area by 20–25%, freeing up more land for
other
agricultural
activity
or
environmental
conservation.
Fractional land area devoted to biomass cropland in each water
basin is reported in the Supplementary data.
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
To more fully assess the sensitivity of our projections for DAC
deployment in China to input assumptions, we individually var-
ied the cost and energy input parameters for DAC itself, as well
as other model assumptions that are external to DAC but di-
rectly influence its cost and/or requirement for its deployment.

sis. Parametrizations for geologic carbon storage supply curves

High-DAC process heat input
Natural gas process heat requirement for DAC does not improve between 2020
and 2060, remaining at 8.1 GJ per tCO2
High-DAC electricity input
Electricity input requirement for DAC does not improve between 2020 and 2060,
remaining at 1.8 GJ per tCO2
Unconstrained land for BECCS/afforestation/agriculture
Removed 90% protection constraint on noncommercial lands, freeing up more
land for bioenergy, forestry and other agricultural activity.
Low-carbon storage availability
Cost curves for geologic carbon storage follow the ‘highest cost CCS’ assumption
from the GCAM core release. Offshore carbon storage reservoirs are assumed
unavailable.
High-carbon storage availability
Cost curves for geologic carbon storage follow the highest availability of CCS as-
sumed in the GCAM core release.
Low residual emissions
Population growth, technological improvement, and social preferences generally
follow the ‘sustainable development’ scenario. Geologic carbon storage supply
curves and land protection constraints are the same as in the central scenario.
Note: All other input assumptions other than the one described in each scenario are held constant, including the CO2 emissions constraint.

the potential of DAC in China by approximately 40%. The role of
DAC is reduced by over 60% if land available for bioenergy, affor-
estation and agricultural expansion is unconstrained, which
could be at odds with other objectives, such as environmental
conservation. The requirement for DAC could also be reduced
by 45% if lower population growth and improved mitigation
technologies reduce the amount of residual CO2 that needs to
be offset with DAC and other NETs. Increasing the geologic car-
bon storage cost by a factor of 10 reduces DAC deployment by
30%. This substantial but relatively small response to such a
large parametric variation occurs due to the small contribution
of storage to the overall cost of DAC, as well as because it simi-
larly increases costs for abatement using fossil CCS. Process
heat and electrical input efficiencies remaining at the upper
bounds of today’s literature instead of improving over time
could reduce the role of DAC by 20 and 10%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS
In 2018, the IPCC released a report describing what it would take
to limit end-of-century global warming to þ1.5C above prein-
dustrial levels, recognizing this target would require ambition
and coordination far beyond what we have seen to date. The re-
cent pledge from China to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060
provides a major contribution toward limiting climate change
to below þ2C above preindustrial levels. The ROW joining
China’s carbon neutrality pledge would help achieving the com-
mon goal of limiting climate warming to below þ2C, but greater
near-term emissions cuts and/or long-term future net-negative
emissions would be required to meet the below þ1.5C goal. We
modeled these different futures in an effort to understand the
role of NETs in helping to achieve the net-zero by 2060 target.
NETs are being developed to offset recalcitrant emissions from
transportation and industry and potentially draw down atmo-
spheric CO2 levels in the future, even though they are generally
considered to be more expensive than conventional decarbon-
ization activities. We analyzed China’s options to achieve net-
zero CO2 emissions using the Global Change Analysis Model
(GCAM) with three major sources of negative emissions as fol-
lows: BECCS, afforestation and DAC with carbon storage.
Our findings show that DAC can play a large role in China to
achieve its net-zero emissions target. This is particularly true if
the ROW is decarbonizing alongside China. The extent to which
DAC is deployed depends on its cost, which is expected to de-
crease over time as technologies improve with widespread im-
plementation. However, some of the radiative forcing benefit of
CO2 removal with DAC is offset by fugitive methane emissions
from its natural gas process heat requirement, and non-CO2
emissions from increased residual fossil fuel use. Because of
these effects, the global average temperature anomaly in 2100 is
approximately 0.1C higher in the low-cost DAC scenario than
in the no-DAC scenario, despite having the same CO2 emissions
trajectories. If the leakage rate of the natural gas supply chain is
higher, the net radiative forcing benefit of large-scale natural
gas-fired DAC deployment would be correspondingly lower.
Without DAC, China could reach net-zero CO2 emissions by
2060 with 1.5 GtCO2 per year negative emissions, but this would
need to come from BECCS and afforestation at an increasingly
higher marginal cost per tCO2 than if DAC could be deployed
alongside them. With DAC widely available, China’s carbon
neutrality can be supported by more than 2–3 GtCO2 per year
negative emissions to get to the net-zero CO2 emissions by 2060.
Scaling-up DAC to this level would require investment on the
order of US$200–280 billion per year in 2060, which is about 1–
2% of China’s GDP in 2019 and 0.5–0.7% of its projected GDP in
2060.
Our results indicate that up to 30–60% of China’s negative
emissions requirement could be fulfilled by DAC, with the re-
mainder fulfilled by BECCS and afforestation. These results pro-
vide insight into the country-scale changes in water, energy and
land use when different forms of negative emissions are used in
China. We also assessed sensitivity of DAC deployment to key
parameters, such as its cost, energy efficiency, (lack of) con-
straints on land for BECCS and forest expansion, carbon storage
costs, and ability to reduce gross-positive CO2 emissions that
need to be offset with DAC and other NETs. Improvements in
DAC nonenergy costs could increase its deployment in China by
up to 80%. We also find that DAC still plays an important role
even under more pessimistic assumptions regarding its future
cost and energy efficiency improvements, as well as under
more optimistic assumptions for future gross-positive emis-
sions reductions. This is due to high costs of decarbonizing the
industrial and freight transportation sectors. DAC availability
could reduce biomass cropland area in major river basins in
China by up to 25%, freeing up more land for agricultural pro-
duction and environmental conservation. While DAC reduces
the extent of land-use dedicated to climate mitigation (i.e. for
afforestation and bioenergy), they remain large. DAC also
reduces the need for irrigation water consumption for bioenergy
crops, but itself consumes large amounts of water. This results
in little change to overall water consumption in China if DAC is
available, but DAC availability may be able to shift water use
away from agricultural regions with growing water stress. The
large remaining land and water tradeoffs of negative emissions
with DAC availability result from its displacement of emissions
abatement, which offsets the impacts of reducing the need for
other forms of negative emissions. In addition to improvements
that reduce the financial and natural resource intensity of DAC
and other NETs themselves, greater investment in technologies
to enable emissions avoidance, such as transport and industrial
electrification could also reduce the tradeoffs of negative emis-
sions for offsets.
