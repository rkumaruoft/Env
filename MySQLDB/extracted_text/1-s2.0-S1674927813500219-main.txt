Abstract
There is scientiﬁc progress in the evaluation methods of recent Earth system models (ESMs). Methods range from
single variable to multi-variables, multi-processes, multi-phenomena quantitative evaluations in ﬁve layers (spheres) of
the Earth system, from climatic mean assessment to climate change (such as trends, periodicity, interdecadal variability),
extreme values, abnormal characters and quantitative evaluations of phenomena, from qualitative assessment to quanti-
tative calculation of reliability and uncertainty for model simulations. Researchers started considering independence and
similarity between models in multi-model use, as well as the quantitative evaluation of climate prediction and projection
eﬀect and the quantitative uncertainty contribution analysis. In this manuscript, the simulations and projections by
both CMIP5 and CMIP3 that have been published after 2007 are reviewed and summarized.

1 Introduction
In recent years, Earth system models (ESMs) and
their simulations as well as projections have made
progress. The coupled model intercomparison project
by the WCRP has entered phase 5 (CMIP5). Two ma-
jor and key international conferences on climate mod-
eling have been held, i.e., the Open Science Conference
by the WCRP in Denver (USA) in October 2011 and
the Workshop on CMIP5 in Hawaii (USA) in March
2012, respectively. These conferences focused on ex-
hibiting the further developments of the studies of the
Earth system models and their simulations and pro-
jections.
Firstly, the CMIP5 collected more than 50 model
experiments based on 23 model groups. These mod-
els have high resolutions with horizontally 0.5◦×4.0◦
for the atmospheric component and 0.2◦×2.0◦for the
ocean component. The models include more biogeo-
chemical processes than before, design the carbon cy-
cle and the sulfur cycle between the atmosphere and
land and ocean, improve aerosol models and dynamic
vegetation models, consider further dynamic and rhe-
ology in the ice models, and so on. Compared with the
CMIP3, CMIP5 experiments show obvious changes,
such as adding near-term climate projections and pre-
dictability, i.e., decadal predictions and projections for
the future 30 years (2006–2035) based on the global
coupled atmospheric and oceanic models in the Earth
system models with high resolutions; the historical ex-
periments of climate change for 1850–2005; the pro-
jections of climate change by using the new represen-
tative concentration pathways (RCPs) for the next
50–100 years or longer (up to 2300).
CMIP5 re-
quired the model groups to provide simulations and
projections of more variables for the annual, seasonal

and monthly time scales, also daily and hourly values
than CMIP3. Therefore, it is much more useful and
convenient for the users than before to investigate cli-
mate change and impacts [Taylor et al., 2012; Zhao,
2009].
Secondly, the CMIP5 prominently highlights the
quantitative test method, and emphasizes the model
performance metrics (quantitative measures) for the
model simulations and projections of climate change.
The quantitative measures refer to:
1) simula-
tions and projections for the multi-variables at all
spheres, multi-index, multi-process, multi-time scales
and multi-space scales, 2) using the methods of math-
ematical statistics and signiﬁcant tests to determine
the climate model consistent at the high, medium and
low levels, 3) providing evaluation evidence, which be-
longs to the robust, moderate or limited (ambiguity,
question, very little evidence), 4) quantitative assess-
ment of the simulated capabilities not only for climate
mean state, but also for the climate change trends
and periodic variations, as well as decadal and other
variabilities, phenomena and extremes, 5) quantita-
tive analysis of independence and correlation among a
large number of models, 6) quantitative reliability and
uncertainty for climate predictions and projections of
global and various spatial scales [Taylor et al., 2012;
Gleckler et al., 2008].
In the spring of 2011, the CMIP5 data center
started to release the simulation results of the Earth
system models.
Up to the beginning of 2012, most
models’ results had been released by the data center.
In this review, the simulations and projections by both
CMIP5 and CMIP3 (released by 2004) that have been
published after 2007 are reviewed and summarized.
2 Evaluation from single to multi-
variables
Since the IPCC AR4 was published in 2007, more
studies have focused on the evaluation and tests of
multi-variables than single variable. Among them, an
interesting research result was that 24 meteorologi-
cal variables simulated by 22 global climate models of
CMIP3 were evaluated for the climate mean state of
1980–1999 (Fig. 1). The relative mean square errors
in both space and time were calculated.
The refer-
ences were reanalysis data. The relative mean square
error was the percentage of diﬀerence in the mean
square error between each model and the typical model
(i.e., medium of 22 models), respectively. For example,
–0.2 for a model variable indicated a simulation bet-
ter by 20% than the typical model. The number 0.2
expressed a simulation worse by 20% than the typical
model. It means that the negative values indicate bet-
ter simulations [Gleckler et al., 2008]. It is noticed in
Figure 1 that in general, the ensemble and medium of
22 models for 24 meteorological variable simulations
had better levels than each model.
It is also noted
that poor simulations had been found for some mod-
els and variables. It should be emphasized that the
results might be quite diﬀerent by using various re-
analysis data as references.
The above calculation and research methods have
been widely applied in the quantitative evaluation
of model simulation results.
For example, a recent
research focused on 32 extreme variables (such as
cold/warm length, cold/warm days, cold/warm nights,
maximum/minimum temperature, frost/frost damage
days, growth season length, daily temperature range,
continuous drought/wet days, 1-day/5-day maximum
precipitation, intensity of daily precipitation, precipi-
tation in the wet period of a year, extremely/very wet
days, very intensive/intensive rainfall days) simulated
by 8 Earth system models of CMIP5.
The evalua-
tion methods used as the above metrics got similar
conclusions, i.e., the ensemble and medium of 8 mod-
els for 32 extreme variables have better simulations
than each model, as well as the results depend on vari-
ous reanalysis data (Emori, personal communication).
Another new study used 28 Earth system models of
the CMIP5 to evaluate the simulation capability for
the land surface’s monthly cold/warm extremes in the
globe and 21 sub-regions. The conclusions pointed out
similar results, i.e., the ensemble and medium of 28
models of CMIP5 have better simulations than each
model. It is also found that the evaluations for the
ensemble and medium of 28 models of CMIP5 and
24 models of CMIP3 had similar simulations with
the high levels, respectively. It was also found that
CMIP5 did not have better simulations than CMIP3

(Yao, personal communication).
3 Evaluation from climate mean state
to climate change and attributions
In earlier assessments, the climate model eval-
uation focused on simulation capability of climate
mean state compared with the observation or reanal-
ysis data. In the past 10 years, most evaluations con-
centrated on climatic changes, such as climate trends,
periodicity or decadal variabilities, as well as attribu-
tions, besides climate mean state.
In recent years,
climate trends have been investigated by using the
CMIP5 models. Table 1 and Figure 2 present the evo-
lutions of the annual global mean surface air temper-
ature simulated by the Canadian Earth system model
(CanESMs) of CMIP5 with the full forcing (including
both natural and anthropogenic forcings), only natural
forcing, only anthropogenic forcing, and only aerosol
forcing for 1851–2010. Five runs and their ensemble
have been calculated. In the three selected stages, the
simulated climate trends for the full forcing were very
close to the observed trends (Table 1) and the evolu-
tions of the annual mean global average temperature

Black lines show observed global mean annual mean temperatures from HadCRUT3, and the thin col-
ored lines show the global mean temperature from ﬁve-member ensembles of CanESM2 forced with (a) anthropogenic
and natural forcings (ALL), (b) natural forcing only (NAT), (c) greenhouse gases only (GHGs), and (d) aerosols only
(AER). All anomalies are calculated relative to the period 1851–1900, and ensemble means are shown by the thick colored
lines [Gillett et al., 2012]
were similar to the observation (Fig. 2). A study on
some other Earth system models of CMIP5 also con-
ﬁrmed these conclusions [Gillett et al., 2012].
A recent study included 42 simulation experi-
ments by using 6 Earth system models of CMIP5 and
compared these with two reanalysis data sets. It de-
tected warming trends of 0.32◦C per decade by the
models slightly lower than the observation (0.49◦C
per decade).
It is found that the obvious warming
of 0.39, 0.38 and 0.49◦C per decade in the area be-
tween 20◦N and the North Pole occurred in spring,
summer and fall seasons of the Northern Hemisphere,
respectively, but slight warming of 0.07◦C per decade
in winter only. It means that seasonal warming was
asymmetric over the extratropical areas of the North-
ern Hemisphere. In fact, in recent years, the global
warming amplitude was decreasing mainly due to sig-
niﬁcantly reduced warming in boreal winter. Winter
warming reduced or even became cold mainly located
in the northern part of North America and Europe,
as well as Siberia.
The
CMIP5
models were able
to simulate the warming trends in spring, summer
and fall seasons north of 20◦N in the Northern Hemi-
sphere, but they had diﬃculties to simulate the slight
warming or cooling in wintertime in the same regions

4 Analysis of uncertainty contributions
from qualitative assessments to quan-
titative evaluation of projections
Climate models are often selected as instruments
to project climate change for the next 50–100 years un-
der the increasing of anthropogenic GHG and aerosol
emissions. However, the climate projections by mod-
els have signiﬁcant uncertainties, especially on regional
scale. Therefore, the contributions of projection un-
certainties should be calculated quantitatively. In re-
cent years, a study which calculated uncertainty con-
tributions of changes in annual mean global average
surface air temperatures in the 21st century by 15 cli-
mate models of CMIP3 [Pirani et al., 2009] has at-
tracted attention. It shows that considering the un-
certainty contributions of climate models, emission
scenarios and internal variability (unforced variabil-
ity), in the early 21st century, climate models had the
largest contribution to the uncertainty, and later, the
largest uncertainty contribution was from the emis-
sion scenarios.
For instance, in the 2010s, the un-
certainty contributions of the projected global tem-
perature variation from climate models accounted for
about 65%, from the emission scenarios about 2% and
from internal variability about 33%, respectively. In
the 2090s, the main uncertainty contribution was from
the emission scenarios (81%), but from climate mod-
els only 17% and from internal variability about 2%,
respectively. There were a few diﬀerences in the un-
certainty contributions between the projected global
and regional temperatures. Taking China as an exam-
ple, in the 2010s, the uncertainty contributions from
climate models were about 48%, from internal vari-
ability about 42%, from emission scenarios about 10%,
respectively. In the 2090s, they were about 70% from
emission scenarios, 25% from climate models and 5%
from internal variability, respectively.
Diﬀerent re-
gions show slightly diﬀerent results, but they are gen-
erally consistent [Pirani et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2009].
The conclusions are that the uncertainty from climate
models is important, especially for the early decades of
the 21st century. However, the anthropogenic emission
scenarios become the main uncertainty contributor for
Figure 3

tions associated with internal variability, climate models,
and emission scenarios for the global scale from 2000 to
2100 [Pirani et al., 2009]
the late decades of the 21st century.
A new study on the uncertainty contributions pro-
jected the changes of sea surface temperature (SST)
and tropical storm frequency in the North Atlantic
Ocean by using 17 Earth system models of CMIP5
with RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. The
Earth system models contributed to the main uncer-
tainty for the projected SST in the early decades of
the 21st century, but the emission scenarios (RCPs)
are the signiﬁcant contributor in the late decades of
the 21st century. It should be emphasized that the un-
certainty of the Earth system models always played a
leading role for the projected tropical storm frequency,
and the contribution from internal variability was also
obvious, especially in the early decades of the 21st cen-
tury. The uncertainty of emission scenarios (RCPs)
had a small contribution to tropical storm frequency
(Table 2) [Villarini and Vecchi, 2012].
5 Evaluation from climate model agree-
ment to model independence
In the reliability study, the evidence (robust,
medium and limited) and agreement (high, medium
and low) of the conﬁdence level is one standard of
credible degrees for quantitatively assessing the re-
sults.
Among them, the agreement numbers of the
model results are often used to estimate the statistical
conﬁdence levels of the simulations and projections.
The more consistent the models’ results, the greater

the reliability.
In another way, generally speaking,
the multi-model ensembles adopt the ensemble mathe-
matic means. It means that each model has the equal
weight, i.e., one model, one vote. However, many
models have same or similar parameterization schemes
or belong to the same class. It causes relevance and
dependence between the climate models. Therefore,
some recent studies concentrate on the independence
and relevance of the models.
A recent study attempted to provide the model
family tree (classiﬁcation and ascription) for surface
air temperature and precipitation based on the simula-
tions of climate mean states, seasonal cycles, interan-
nual variability and space correlations by the control
runs of 24 climate models of CMIP3. The reanalysis
data (ERA, NCEP and MERRA for temperature, and
GPCP and CMAP for precipitation) were also added
to the model family tree (Fig. 4). It is found in Fig-
ure 4 that some models among the 24 models belonged
to the same or similar classes.
The author pointed
out that the relevance and dependence of the climate
models might provide false evidence when one esti-
mated the model agreement numbers and calculated
the model ensembles. Therefore, model independences
must be considered [Masson and Knutti, 2011]. An-
other study selected diﬀerent classiﬁcation standard,
i.e., the biases from 35 climate variables between ob-
servations and simulations by CMIP3 models. Similar
results have been noticed [Pennell and Reichler, 2011].
Summarizing the above mentioned, as considering the
agreement numbers of simulations and projections by
climate models, one should be careful to think about
model relevance and similarity, which might cause the
distortion of reliability and conﬁdence levels for simu-
lations and projections by climate models.

6 Evaluation from single model for a va-
riable to multi-models for processes,
phenomena and extremes
For recent years, more and more studies evaluated
the reliability of climate processes, phenomena and
extremes simulated and projected by climate models.
A new study evaluated the global monsoon, such as
the global monsoon areas (annual precipitation inten-
sity over 2 mm d−1, and summer precipitation over
55% to the annual total), the global monsoon total
precipitation and the global monsoon intensity (the
global monsoon precipitation per unit area) projected
by 24 models of CMIP3 with SRES A1B scenario and
11 Earth system models of CMIP5 with RCP4.5 for
2075–2099 relative to 1979–2003, respectively. Both
the CMIP3 and CMIP5 project the increasing global
monsoon areas, total precipitation and intensity un-
der global warming (Table 3).
On the other hand,
ﬁve global atmospheric models with high resolutions
(2 German MPI models with a horizontal resolution of
1.125◦; 1 German MPI model with a horizontal resolu-
tion of 40 km; 1 Japanese MRI model with a horizontal
resolution of 20 km, 1 USA GFDL model with a hor-
izontal resolution of 50 km) driven by the projected
SST, projected to enhance three global monsoon in-
dices mentioned above. That is, ﬁve global atmosph-

7 From simple predictions and projec-
tions to quantitative evaluation of
their eﬀects
As known, projections of future climate change
by using global climate models under various emis-
sion scenarios have been conducted for about 20 years.
The IPCC AR4 has evaluated quantitatively the global
temperature changes projected by the climate models
with various emission scenarios.
As an example in
IPCC AR4, Table 4 gives the global mean annual av-
erage temperature anomalies for 2001–2011 relative to
1961–1990 projected by 23 CMIP3 models with four
scenarios (SRES A2, A1B and B1, as well as commit-
ment at year 2000 level) [IPCC, 2007]. It can be seen
from Table 4 that the projected annual mean temper-
ature anomalies under four scenarios were positive in
each year of 2001–2011 relative to 1961–1990. Com-
pared with the observations, the models with the four
emission scenarios succeeded to project the warming
characteristics for the ﬁrst 11 years of the 21st cen-
tury. The problem remains that the models projected
obvious warming trends that were not shown by the
observations, especially for the last six years in which
the projected warming was much larger than observa-
tions. The reason should be investigated in future.

conclusions:
(1) The integrated evaluations for the Earth sys-
tem models should concentrate on the multi-variables
in ﬁve spheres; it is not enough to evaluate only a sin-
gle variable.
(2) Climate change (such as trends, periodicity
and decadal variability) simulated and projected by
the models must be evaluated quantitatively, besides
the climate mean states.
(3) The uncertainty contributions of many factors
on climate changes projected by the models should be
evaluated quantitatively, not only qualitatively.
(4) In considering the agreements of simulations
of the models, we should not focus on the model results
merely, but also notice the similarity and dependence
among the climate models in order to achieve the in-
dependence of the evidence.
(5) There is need not only to quantitatively eval-
uate the simulations of single variables, but also to
evaluate the simulations of the processes, phenomena
and extremes quantitatively in the ﬁve spheres.
(6) The evaluations for predictions and projec-
tions of future climate change must be quantitative.
The best value with a range at certain conﬁdence level
should be provided.
The advances of evaluation methods for the Earth
system models depend on a variety of factors, such
as the quality of observed data, the knowledge of the
physical, chemical and biological processes in the ﬁve
spheres of the Earth system, the development of math-
ematical methods of evaluation and their application,
as well as the computer technique.
Currently, the
IPCC AR5 report is being produced. Many new stud-
ies and evaluation methods are expected, such as those
on quantitatively testing the simulation capability of
climate change in the ﬁve spheres by the Earth system
models and regional climate models, quantitative at-
tribution analysis, decadal and near-term predictions
as well as long-term projections, and uncertainty con-
tribution analysis.
