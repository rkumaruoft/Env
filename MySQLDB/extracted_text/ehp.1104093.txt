Review
Although the risks of global climate change 
have been recognized for some time, interest 
in the specific implications of climate change 
for human health has grown rapidly over 
the past few years, with notable examples 
including a special issue on climate change 
and health published by The Lancet (Costello 
et al. 2009) and a declaration by the World 
Medical Association (2009). In 2008, World 
Health Organization (WHO) Member States 
passed a World Health Assembly (WHA) 
resolution recognizing the importance 
of climate change for human health, and 
calling for stronger commitment by Member 
States to address climate change–related 
health threats (WHA 2008). The Member 
States specified five research priorities that 
should be supported, which was an unusual 
and important recommendation for such a 
resolution to contain. The recommended 
priorities were
Health vulnerability to climate change and 
• 
the scale and nature thereof
Health protection strategies and measures 
• 
relating to climate change and their effective­
ness, including cost-effectiveness
The health impacts of potential adaptation 
• 
and mitigation measures in other sectors, 
such as marine life, water resources, land use, 
and transport in particular, where these could 
have positive benefits for health ­protection
Decision support and other tools, such as 
• 
surveillance and monitoring, for assess­
ing vulnerability and health impacts and 
­targeting measures appropriately
Assessment of the likely financial costs and 
• 
other resources necessary for health protec­
tion from climate change (WHA 2008).
These five priority areas were further 
explored in a 2009 global consultation, which 
resulted in further elaboration of the research 
needed within each priority area (WHO 2009).
Although an increasing number of papers 
are being published on climate change and 
health, the extent to which these papers match 
the global research priorities has not yet been 
assessed (WHO 2009). Moreover, although 
reviews of this relatively new, high-­visibility and 
wide-ranging topic have provided useful com­
prehensive overviews of climate change–related 
health risks and opportunities (Confalonieri 
et al. 2007; Costello et al. 2009), we also need 
original research that improves our understand­
ing of the specific pathways that link climate 
change to health. To assess the extent to which 
recently published research on climate change 
and health corresponds to the research prior­
ity areas identified by the Member States, we 
undertook a systematic review of original quan­
titative research on climate change and human 
health. Our second objective was to assess 
trends in the publication of climate change and 
health research in recent years, and the propor­
tion of these publications that were original 
research rather than reviews, editorials, or other 
papers not based on original data.
Methods
Scope of review. Because our objective was to 
provide an overview of the entire field of cli­
mate change and health rather than an in-depth 
assessment of individual studies, we conducted 
a scoping review. Scoping reviews address topics 
that are too broad for a systematic review and 
commonly aim to identify research gaps in the 
existing literature. (Arksey and O’Malley 2005). 
Although we did not assess the risk of bias for 
individual studies (an approach commonly 
used by other scoping reviews), we used sys­
tematic review methods where possible to mini­
mize bias in our identification and inclusion of 
studies and followed Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
(PRISMA) standards for reporting systematic 
reviews and meta-analyses (Moher et al. 2009) 
[see Supplemental Material, Table 1 (http://
dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1104093)]. We devel­
oped a logic model representing links between 
global climate change, health, and the five 
research priorities, based on the WHA resolu­
tion (WHA 2008) and the report on global 
research priorities (WHO 2009) (Figure 1).

How Well Does Climate Change and Human Health Research Match the 
Demands of Policymakers? A Scoping Review
Jamie Hosking1 and Diarmid Campbell-Lendrum 2
1School of Population Health, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand; 2Department of Public Health and Environment, World 
Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland
Background: In 2008, the World Health Organization (WHO) Member States passed a World 
Health Assembly resolution that identified the following five priority areas for research and pilot 
projects on climate change and human health: health vulnerability, health protection, health 
impacts of mitigation and adaptation policies, decision-support and other tools, and costs of health 
protection from climate change.
Objectives: To assess the extent to which recently published research corresponds to these pri­
orities, we undertook a scoping review of original research on climate change and human health. 
Scoping reviews address topics that are too broad for a systematic review and commonly aim to 
identify research gaps in existing literature. We also assessed recent publication trends for climate 
change and health research.
Methods: We searched for original quantitative research published from 2008 onward. We included 
disease burden studies that were specific to climate change and health and included intervention 
studies that focused on climate change and measured health outcomes. We used MEDLINE, 
Embase, and Web of Science databases and extracted data on research priority areas, geographic 
regions, health fields, and equity (systematic differences between advantaged and disadvantaged 
social groups).
Discussion: We identified 40 eligible studies. Compared with other health topics, the number of 
climate change publications has grown rapidly, with a larger proportion of reviews or editorials. 
Recent original research addressed four of the five priority areas identified by the WHO Member 
States, but we found no eligible studies of health adaptation interventions, and most of the studies 
focused on high-income countries.
Conclusions: Climate change and health is a rapidly growing area of research, but quantitative 
studies remain rare. Among recently published studies, we found gaps in adaptation research and a 
deficit of studies in most developing regions. Funders and researchers should monitor and respond 
to research gaps to help ensure that the needs of policymakers are met.
Key words: climate change, environmental policy, health policy, public health, world health.

Does climate and health research match policy-maker demands?

We used this model to decide which of the five 
research priorities, if any, corresponded to the 
research topic of potentially eligible studies. 
We did not publish a protocol in advance of 
the review.
Eligibility criteria. There was no restric­
tion by language. Databases were searched in 
May and in June 2010. We included origi­
nal quantitative research published in peer-
reviewed journals during or after 2008. This 
range provided a feasible sample of current 
research contemporaneous with the WHA 
resolution. Qualitative research on this topic 
is also valuable, but adding this topic to our 
search strategy would have made it difficult to 
clearly define the scope of our review. Another 
reason we did not include qualitative research 
was because we considered the most active 
areas of policy debate in this field relate to 
the scale and distribution of the impacts of 
climate change and to the impacts of adapta­
tion or mitigation efforts, thereby placing a 
premium on quantitative information.
We categorized studies under priority 1 
(assessing the risks) if they studied the poten­
tial effects either of global climate change 
or of greenhouse gas emissions on human 
health (Figure 1). We included studies of 
global climate change (in which outcomes 
are compared under different global climate 
scenarios), but not studies of climatic events 
alone, because climatic events occur whether 
or not climate change is present. For example, 
we would have included a study that assessed 
mortality from flooding under different global 
climate scenarios but not a study that only 
assessed the effect of flooding on health.
Studies of interventions to protect health 
from climate change were categorized under 
priority 2. This category included studies of 
the health effects of climate change adaptation 
measures. We considered such studies to be 
eligible if the primary goal of the intervention 
was to protect health from climate change.
Studies of the health effects of climate 
change mitigation or adaptation measures were 
categorized under priority 3 if they focused on 
health effects that were not mediated by cli­
mate change. We included studies of climate 
change mitigation measures if they quantified 
changes in greenhouse gas emissions due to 
the intervention. For example, a study of an 
intervention to promote walking would be 
categorized under priority 3 if it assessed both 
effects on greenhouse gas emissions and effects 
on health, but not if it only assessed the effects 
of the intervention on health.
Under priority 4, we categorized studies 
that used new tools or methods that were 
intended to inform decisions on potential 
climate change interventions (including adap­
tation and mitigation interventions). We 
included studies of these tools and methods 
if their objective was to address the health 
risks of climate change. Because the report 
on global research priorities also included 
surveys of knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, 
and behaviors relating to health and climate 
change in this category (WHO 2009), we 
included such studies in this category.
Studies of costs relating to priorities 1, 3, 
or 4 were categorized under priority 5. As the 
WHO (2009) report addressed studies of the 
cost-effectiveness of interventions separately 
under priority 2, we assigned such studies to 
priority 2 for the sake of consistency.
We included studies that quantified human 
health outcomes using recognized health met­
rics, such as mortality, disease incidence or 
composite measures such as disability-adjusted 
life years. We did not include studies that 
only reported risk factors without quantifying 
health outcomes. For example, we would have 
included a study of the effect of global climate 
change on the incidence of water-borne disease, 
but not a study of the effect of global climate 
change on the frequency of heavy precipitation 
events alone. Health-specific outcome measures 
are needed to inform health policy-maker deci­
sions in relation to other health priorities, such 
as resource allocation decisions. This eligibility 
criterion also ensured that the review remained 
focused on health, rather than the nonhealth 
impacts of global climate change.
Similarly, we required greenhouse gas 
outcomes to be quantified using recognized 
units, such as metric tonnes of carbon diox­
ide equivalents. Given the focus of priority 5 
on costs, we also considered studies to have 
measured health or greenhouse gas emissions 
if outcomes were reported in monetary terms.
We based our definition of equity on 
that of Braveman and Gruskin (2003), who 
defined the term as 
Equity in health is the absence of systematic dispari­
ties in health (or in the major social determinants 
of health) between groups with different levels of 
underlying social advantage/disadvantage— that is, 
wealth, power, or prestige. 
We considered a study to have measured 
equity outcomes if it both measured differ­
ences between population groups and also 
assessed whether those differences were ineq­
uitable (i.e., represented systematic differ­
ences between advantaged and disadvantaged 
social groups). For example, we would have 
considered a study describing vulnerability 
to climate change in different countries to 
have addressed equity if it also analyzed which 
international differences, if any, were consid­
ered inequitable.
Search strategy. We searched MEDLINE 
(National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD, 
USA), Embase (Elsevier B.V., Amsterdam, the 
Netherlands), and Web of Science (Thomson 
Reuters, New York, NY, USA) databases in 
May and June 2010, using database limits 
to restrict results to original research articles 
published during or after 2008. Our search 
strategy, in summary, was (climate change 
or synonyms OR greenhouse gas emissions 
or synonyms) AND health [for details, see 
Supplemental Material, “Search Strategies” 
(http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1104093)].
We also reviewed the reference list of a 
prominent review article on climate change 
and health (Costello et al. 2009). Although we 
were aware of other prominent reviews, in par­
ticular the review published by Confalonieri 
et al. (2007) for the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change (IPCC), they did not 
include references published during the ­eligible 
range of dates.
One researcher assessed the eligibility of 
all citations. Where citations could not be 
excluded based on title or abstract, the full-
text paper was retrieved and assessed. A second 
reviewer independently screened a random 
10% sample of citations. Any differences were 
resolved by discussion and led to agreement on 
the interpretation of study eligibility criteria.
Data collection. Data were extracted by 
one reviewer using a standardized data collec­
tion form. A second reviewer independently

extracted data for a random 10% sample 
of included studies. Any differences were 
resolved by discussion and led to agreement 
on the interpretation of data categories.
Data items. We extracted data on the 
research priority area addressed by each study 
(Figure 1), the type of health outcomes, coun­
tries, and whether equity outcomes were mea­
sured by the study. Although health equity 
was not part of the original WHA resolution 
(2008), it emerged as an important theme 
in the subsequent WHO report describing 
global research priorities in this area (2009). 
Countries were categorized as low/middle 
income or high income (World Bank 2010) 
and by WHO region (WHO 2010).
We categorized and grouped health out­
comes into health fields. Where possible, we 
categorized studies according to the pathway 
by which the health outcomes occurred (e.g., 
health outcomes mediated by changes in air 
quality, temperature, or vector-borne dis­
eases). We identified such pathways based on 
previous publications that described pathways 
between climate change or mitigation actions 
and health outcomes (e.g., McMichael et al. 
2006; WHO 2008). However, some studies 
did not focus on specific pathways. If these 
studies measured a specific type of health out­
come, we categorized and grouped the studies 
according to that outcome type. If they mea­
sured multiple unrelated health outcomes, we 
assigned the label “multiple”.
Synthesis of results and risk of bias. As the 
objective of our review was restricted to the 
identification of study characteristics across a 
range of climate change and health topics, we 
made no attempt to synthesize the results of 
individual studies or to assess risk of bias in 
those studies.
Additional analyses. We undertook an 
additional analysis to assess whether, in the 
field of climate change and health, the pro­
portion of publications that were original 
research (rather than papers not based on 
original data) differed from other fields. For 
climate change and three other topic areas 
(air pollution, tobacco smoking, and obesity), 
we analyzed the proportion of MEDLINE 
citations recorded as being a “journal article” 
(excluding review articles and commentaries), 
“review”, “commentary”, “editorial”, “let­
ter”, or “news”. For these three additional 
topic areas, we used MEDLINE search terms 
based on medical subject headings such as “air 
pollution”, “smoking”, and “obesity”. These 
searches differed from the main search strat­
egy (on climate change) because we did not 
develop as complex a search strategy (e.g., did 
not include additional “text word” searches), 
and we did not attempt to restrict results to 
studies of human health. Thus, our search 
strategy was not designed to detect minor 
differences in numbers of citations between 
the four topic areas. However, we considered 
that the searches were sufficiently similar to 
enable broad comparisons of numbers of cita­
tions and of citation trends. [For details, see 
Supplemental Material, “Search Strategies” 
(http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1104093).]
The topic areas of air pollution and tobacco 
smoking were selected because we considered 
these to be well-established areas of epidemio­
logical study. Obesity was selected because, 
like climate change, we considered this to be 
a field in which there has been growing inter­
est in recent years. Aware that the number of 
papers published on climate change and health 
has increased rapidly in recent years (WHO 
2009), we wished to test the extent to which 
this was specific to climate change, or reflected 
a more general increase in health research out­
put. Accordingly, for each topic, we analyzed 
the increase in citation numbers over the past 
10 years compared with a year 2000 baseline.
Results
Study selection. After duplicates were 
removed, a total of 883 citations were identi­
fied from searches of electronic databases and 
review article references (Figure 2). Based on 
the title and the abstract, 699 were excluded, 
with 184 full text articles to be retrieved and 
assessed for eligibility. Of these, 144 were 
excluded for the following reasons: 23 did 
not directly quantify the effects of climate 
change, 53 did not directly quantify effects on 
human health, and 67 were not considered to 
be original quantitative research (e.g., review 
articles, commentaries). We excluded 1 study 
because we were was unable to retrieve it (Jwo 
et al. 2008). The remaining 40 studies were 
considered eligible for this review.
Study characteristics. Study characteris­
tics are summarized in Table  1 and in 
Supplemental Material, Table  2 (http://
dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1104093). All studies 
were able to be classified under at least one 
of the research priority areas. Of the studies 
assessed, seven (Ebi 2008; Hubler et al. 2008; 
Markandya et al. 2009; Morris and Bagby 
2008; Nadal et al. 2009; Selin et al. 2009; Tol 
2008) addressed two research priorities each; 
all other studies addressed only one research 
priority each.
Global research priority areas 1, 3, 4, 
and 5 were each addressed by between 10 and 
15 studies. However, no eligible study addressed 
identifying effective interventions (priority 2).
Of the studies that addressed assessing 
the risks (priority 1), the health fields con­
sidered included malaria (Garg et al. 2009; 
Tol 2008), temperature-related health risks 
(Doyon et al. 2008; Hubler et al. 2008; 
Lindgren et al. 2008), and air quality (Selin 
et al. 2009; Tagaris et al. 2009). Three other 
studies addressed multiple aspects of health 
(Confalonieri et al. 2009; Ebi 2008; Husain 
et al. 2008).
Of the 12 studies that assessed the 
co-benefits and co-harms of adaptation 
and mitigation (priority 3), all addressed 
the potential co-bene­fits of mitigation, and 
none dealt with adaptation strategies. Four 
examined co-bene­fits for air quality (Jacobson 
2008; Markandya et al. 2009; Park et al. 2008;

Saikawa et al. 2009), two examined co-­benefits 
for noncommunicable diseases (Friel et al. 
2009; Nadal et al. 2009), and the remaining 
studies each considered multiple aspects of 
health, including life expectancy (Andrae et al. 
2008; Babbitt and Lindner 2008; Bloomberg 
et  al. 2008; Morris and Bagby 2008; 
Wilkinson et al. 2009; Woodcock et al. 2009). 
Three studies in this category were life-cycle 
assessments that covered topics as diverse as 
electronics adhesives and garden-care practices 
(Andrae et al. 2008; Babbitt and Lindner 
2008; Morris and Bagby 2008). Although not 
specific to climate change and health, these 
studies met the eligibility criteria because they 
quantified effects on greenhouse gas emissions 
or climate change, and also on health. Four 
studies came from a single series of papers 
published in The Lancet (Friel et al. 2009; 
Markandya et al. 2009; Wilkinson et al. 2009; 
Woodcock et al. 2009). This may have inflated 
the number of papers in this category during 
the period covered by our review, compared 
with other recent years.
We also assigned to priority 3 two studies 
that were not mitigation strategies in themselves 
but that were considered directly relevant to 
the health co-benefits of mitigation strategies. 
One presented an analysis showing that 
countries with economies that more intensively 
emitted greenhouse gases [expressed as carbon 
dioxide (CO2) equivalents per unit gross 
domestic product] had higher life expectancies 
(Bloomberg et al. 2008), whereas the other 
analyzed the effects of CO2 on health via effects 
on other air pollutants rather than effects of 
CO2 via climate change (Jacobson 2008).
We identified 10 studies on improving 
decision support (priority 4). Of these, 6 were

surveys of knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, 
or preferences related to climate change and 
health (Bedsworth 2009; Maibach et al. 2008; 
Nakatani et al. 2008; O’Neill et al. 2010; 
Sulda et al. 2010; Sundblad et al. 2009); 
2 reported results of a vulnerability assessment 
tool (Bernier et al. 2009; Hahn et al. 2009); 
1 reported a method for estimating climate 
change and health impacts in life-cycle assess­
ment (De Schryver et al. 2009); and 1 evalu­
ated a surveillance system (Jansen et al. 2008).
A total of 15 studies assessed the mon­
etary costs related to climate change and 
health (priority 5). Of these, 5 assessed costs 
related to vulnerability to climate change 
(Ebi 2008; Hubler et al. 2008; Pattanayak 
et al. 2009; Selin et al. 2009; Tol 2008), and 
10 evaluated the costs of potential climate 
change mitigation strategies and their health 
co-benefits (Chapman et al. 2009; Creutzig 
and He 2009; Gilmore et al. 2010; Hill et al. 
2009; Markandya et al. 2009; Martinez 2009; 
Morris and Bagby 2008; Nadal et al. 2009; 
Smith et al. 2008; Tollefsen et al. 2009), 
although in 1 study, climate change and 
health were not the primary areas of focus 
(Morris and Bagby 2008).
Health fields. Many studies (n = 19) 
measured outcomes across multiple health 
domains. Of those that addressed a specific 
health field, air quality was the most common 
topic (n = 9) (Table 1).
Countries. Most studies assessed health 
effects in high-income countries (n = 22) 
rather than low- and middle-income coun­
tries (n = 6) (Table 1); 12 studies assessed the 
effects in countries from both categories, with 
half of them evaluating global health effects. 
Each of the six WHO regions was addressed 
by at least 1 study. However, among the stud­
ies set in a single country, the African Region, 
the Eastern Mediterranean Region, and the 
South-East Asian Region were the setting for 
only 1 study each, whereas the Region of the 
Americas was the setting for the most studies 
(n = 13; Table 1). The most common country 
setting was the United States (the sole coun­
try setting for 8 studies) (Babbitt and Lindner 
2008; Bedsworth 2009; Gilmore et al. 2010; 
Hill et al. 2009; Maibach et al. 2008; Morris 
and Bagby 2008; O’Neill et al. 2010; Tagaris 
et al. 2009).
Equity. No eligible studies quantitatively 
assessed health equity outcomes. Although sev­
eral studies reported geographical differences 
in health effects, none of these directly assessed 
whether those differences were ­inequitable (i.e., 
represented systematic differences between 
advantaged and disadvantaged social groups).
Additional analyses. Compared with the 
established fields of tobacco and air pollution, 
the number of citations for climate change 
and human health increased much more rap­
idly over the past 10 years (Figure 3). The 
proportion of citations that were identified 
in MEDLINE as being not original research 
(reviews, editorials, comments, letter, or news 
articles) was substantially higher for climate 
change (43%) than for obesity (30%), air pol­
lution (18%), and tobacco (19%) (Figure 4). 
This difference was largely due to the propor­
tion of review articles, which was 29% for 
climate change and 20% for obesity, com­
pared with 10–11% for the other topics. The 
proportion of editorials was also much higher 
for climate change (8%) than for the other 
three topics (2–3%). Note that only a small 
proportion of all news articles are indexed 
in MEDLINE.
Discussion
Research on climate change and health is 
growing rapidly. A large proportion of publi­
cations on this topic consisted of reviews and 
editorials, which may be in part because cli­
mate change and health is a relatively new and 
emerging research field, although other dif­
ferences between fields may also influence the 
proportion of reviews and editorials. Although 
such papers can help raise awareness of links 
between climate change and health, and iden­
tify promising strategies for future evaluation, 
more systematic and quantitative approaches 
are now needed.
Although the field of climate change and 
health is wide, the WHA resolution provides 
a useful structure for organizing this field that 
relates directly to the wishes of countries. We 
identified 40 studies of original quantitative 
research directly related to climate change 
and human health published in 2008 or later, 
covering most but not all of the research 
priorities identified by the WHO Member 
States. Although we did not include stud­
ies published before 2008, the date range of 
our review was appropriate for assessing the 
extent to which current research corresponds 
to global research priorities.
Our review focused on studies reporting 
health-specific outcomes, including mortality 
and morbidity and other measures of disease 
burden. Information on these outcomes is 
required to inform health policy, by indicat­
ing the importance of global climate change 
in relation to other health priorities. Future 
reviews could usefully explore specific path­
ways between global climate change and 
health in more depth, including more atten­
tion to the individual steps in each pathway.
A limitation of our review was that, due 
to its objective, it was restricted to an analysis 
of the characteristics of included studies, and 
did not attempt to assess the risk of bias of 
included studies or synthesize their results. 
However, we followed systematic review 
methods where possible to minimize bias in 
our identification and inclusion of studies and 
to ensure transparent review methods. Other 
systematic reviews on this topic have provided 
little information on the methods used or the 
numbers of studies identified (Swynghedauw 
2009; Zhang et al. 2007).

We identified no studies assessing the effec­
tiveness or cost-effectiveness of inter­ventions to 
protect health from climate change (priority 2), 
and no studies of the health co‑benefits or 
co‑harms of adaptation measures (priority 3a). 
Interventions to adapt to, and protect health 
from, global climate change could have great 
implications for health. For example, relocating 
coastal communities could help protect them 
from grave threats such as storms and inunda­
tion, but also would be likely to have profound 
impacts on many of the social determinants 
of health, such as housing, employment, and 
educational opportunities. This is thus a topic 
of considerable importance.
The lack of studies identified by our review 
in this area may have been because such stud­
ies either did not directly quantify health out­
comes, or because they did not self-identify 
as protecting health specifically from climate 
change. For example, studies of interventions 
to protect health in heat waves are present in 
the literature, but only met our eligibility cri­
teria if protecting health from climate change 
was a specific objective of the study. This rep­
resents a weakness not only in our review but 
also in the link between research and policy, 
as decision makers seeking evidence on health 
adaptation strategies to climate change are 
likely to miss relevant information. It is also 
possible that researchers tend to frame stud­
ies so that they state the primary objective as 
addressing current needs (such as protection 
from heat waves) rather than more distant 
concerns (such as climate change adaptation), 
because research addressing more immediate 
threats may be more likely to receive funding. 
Nevertheless, studies of factors that mediate 
associations between global climate change 
and health, such as heat waves, need to be 
complemented by more analyses that quantify 
the health impacts mediated by these factors 
under different global climate scenarios.
The health effects related to air qual­
ity constituted the topic most commonly 
addressed by the studies in our analysis. In 
contrast, there were few or no studies address­
ing important topics such as water supplies 
and waterborne illness, food and malnutrition, 
and the health risks of extreme weather events 
other than heat effects. This should not be 
interpreted to mean that there is an absence of 
research in these areas, but rather that they are 
not well represented among recent studies that 
specifically link climate change and health.
Although we identified recent studies that 
assessed health effects in all WHO regions 
and in both low/middle-income countries 
(LMICs) and the high-income countries 
(HICs), LMICs were underrepresented, 
even though the burden of disease of climate 
change is expected to be highest in these 
countries (McMichael et al. 2004). Similarly, 
there were few studies in the African, Eastern 
Mediterranean, and South-East Asia WHO 
regions. This lack of research in the most vul­
nerable countries and regions suggests that 
these settings require greater priority within 
research agendas. However, because of lim­
ited resources in many of these countries, it 
is likely that expanding research in these set­
tings will require greater use of international 
research collaborations (Bush et al. 2011), 
as well as increased funding from HICs and 
global agencies. Thus, the research funding 
agencies in the HICs may need to create dedi­
cated funding pools for research in vulner­
able countries and regions to ensure that the 
LMIC climate change and health proposals 
do not struggle to compete against national 
priorities set by the HICs.
Despite calls for climate change to 
be recog­nized as a priority area by health 
researchers, health professionals, and policy 
makers (Costello et al. 2009; World Medical 
Association 2009), the stated priorities, and the 
allocation decisions of those who fund health 
research do not always prioritize climate change 
research (Ebi et al. 2009). As well as directing 
more funding toward closing the gaps in cli­
mate change and health research, funding agen­
cies could obtain better value within existing 
resource constraints by employing innovative 
funding strategies. Funding the development 
of protocols in priority research areas could 
be an economical way to increase the chance 
of researchers attracting funding from existing 
sources. Lessons may also be learned from the 
ability of competitions such as Kaggle to attract 
large amounts of researcher time at a relatively 
low cost. Kaggle (2010) is a Web platform that 
allows organizations to provide data relating 
to a specific problem, and allows international 
data analysis teams to compete to identify the 
best solution and to win cash prizes.
In addition, mechanisms to ensure that 
research funding decisions align with the needs 
of stakeholders are generally weak. This high­
lights the importance of both referring back 
to the stated requests of policymakers and also 
consulting relevant stakeholders to identify 
their needs when designing research studies. 
For example, the International Development 
Research Centre (2011) has a long-standing 
practice of conducting policy-relevant research 
at the community level, by linking scientists 
and affected stakeholders, from project design 
through implementation and evaluation phases, 
thereby enhancing rele­vance and sustainability. 
The same philoso­phy may be equally relevant 
at the national and inter­national levels.
Conclusions
Climate change and health is a rapidly grow­
ing area of research. Although recent reviews 
and editorials on this topic have been valu­
able in raising awareness of its importance, 
more systematic and quantitative approaches 
are now needed. It is also important that 
future research maintains good coverage of 
key topics—particularly the health impacts 
of adaptation measures—and of vulnerable 
geographical regions. Further monitoring and 
direction should help ensure that the expecta­
tions of the WHO Member States are met.
