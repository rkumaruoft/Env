Anthropogenic climate change, with co-factors, threatens civilization, and thus human health. I ﬁrst show
that climate change is an important element of a system of hazards called “Limits to Growth”. I then argue
that the interaction of climate change and other Limits to Growth elements risks civilization “failure” and
possibly its “collapse”. Either consequence, were one to occur, entails profound risks to global population
health, yet appreciation of this is still largely outside the health literature. I then discuss these relationships
(including with civilization’s destiny) with bioethical schools. The oldest of these (also called medical ethics)
is strongly related to health and medicine, but in a later (1970) formulation the preﬁx “bio” is broader than
human biology, though this school also has roots in human health. Van Rensselaer Potter, widely recognized
as the founder of this school, subtitled it “the science of survival”. This subtitle seems to acknowledge an at
least implicit risk to civilization. I also brieﬂy discuss environmental ethics. By calling for greater discussion
of the risk of civilization failure (or its collapse) this paper makes an important and original contribution to
bioethics, however conceptualized. The major scholarly contribution of this paper is its call for the human
health literature to refresh its consideration of Limits to Growth, to reconsider aspects that have become
marginalized in the health literature, and for health workers to deepen their engagement with related litera-
tures, especially of human ecology. We must contemplate the unthinkable if we are to help avert it.

1. Introduction
The paper begins with a review of the literature linking Limits to
Growth, of which anthropogenic climate change is an important
component, with civilization “failure” and the possibility of civiliza-
tion’s collapse. I then argue that these issues are of bioethical and
health relevance.
I argue that civilization could “fail” due to adverse environmen-
tal change (including to its climate), with accompanying and resul-
tant social changes on a planetary scale. That is, civilization risks
substantial impairment without “death”, akin to an organ (e.g.
renal) failure without death of the patient. Civilization may still
function, but with reduced capacity to provide adequate human
well-being [1]. However, civilization’s “collapse” could follow, per-
haps suddenly, akin to the commonly observed clinical experience
when a patient’s single organ failure converts to an irreversible spi-
ral of systemic, multi-organ failure. Although civilization “collapse”
lacks universal deﬁnition [2] it would signify a global health catas-
trophe. Arguably, processes leading to civilization failure are now
well underway.
After rebutting claims that these ideas illustrate “environmental
determinism” I then explore the relationship between these issues
with three ethical ﬁelds of relevance. I conclude that while there is a
growing literature on climate change within bioethics, there is very
limited formal exploration of the links between these ﬁelds and
potential civilization collapse.
In this article, I make one major original contribution to the litera-
ture; namely that the plausible impending failure of civilization, or
even its collapse, is relevant to bioethics, however deﬁned. Civiliza-
tion failure is also relevant to health. This observation is not original
but its possibility is inadequately explored in health journals.
1.1. Civilization collapse, limits to growth, and climate change
Extensive literature discusses the rise and fall of ancient civiliza-
tions, in part from natural climate change [3−6]. Concerns about the
collapse of modern civilization, while long ﬂuctuating [7] reached a
new height in the decade 1965−74. This period roughly coincided
with awareness by much of humanity that we live on a single planet,
ﬁrst photographed from a robotic spacecraft orbiting the moon in
1966 [8]. Of relevance, in the mid-1960s, global population growth
peaked as a percentage (slightly over 2 % per annum), though not as
an absolute number. The sudden increase in population, accelerating
particularly after World War II, was largely caused by a decline in
death rates in the “Third World” (now normally called “the Global
South”). This falling deathrate, accompanied by a lagged decline in

fertility, aggravated fears, also expressed earlier in the 20th century
[9], of a population “bomb” [10,11].
Journalist Laura Spinney [12] describes how, in the period 1965
−74, the challenge of “sustaining civilization” inspired “a shelf-full of
inﬂuential books.” Pre-eminent among these was the 1972 “Limits to
Growth”, subtitled “A Report for the Club of Rome’s Project on the
Predicament of Mankind” [13]. This study was conducted by a team
inspired by the systems scientist Jay Forrester. The resultant book
sold 12 million copies [12] −a record for an environmental book that
probably still stands. Limits to Growth forecast that business-as-usual
practices, if continued long enough, would lead to a major decline in
population and human well-being, perhaps by 2072, a century after
its publication [14,15].
Although unchecked pollution was identiﬁed by Limits to Growth
as central to these risks, the report paid little attention to climate
change [14]. While the accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO2), the
main anthropogenic greenhouse gas, had been described in 1957 as a
“large-scale geophysical experiment” [16] the speed of impending
greenhouse gas accumulation was, in 1972, under-estimated. It may
still be; the recent spike in average global temperature [17,18]
remains poorly understood [19]. Numerous “tipping points” in the
Earth system have been identiﬁed [20], beyond which reinforcing
(positive) feedback loops are ampliﬁed, potentially leading to cata-
strophic effects, such as a breakdown in the ocean conveyor belt that
currently delivers heat to western Europe [21]. Tipping points in the
global social system also exist. While these can be beneﬁcial, includ-
ing action to precipitate effective action on climate change, or to
advance towards the Sustainable Development Goals [22], they can
also be adverse, such as cascades of decisions that lead to war. Heat-
waves impair learning, especially in the global South [23], one of
many ways by which climate change is worsening inequity [24].
Another is the destruction of infrastructure, such as occurred in 2023
to the Mexican city of Acapulco, after Hurricane Otis unexpectedly
intensiﬁed, making adequate preparations for it impossible [25].
Articles recognizing that climate change risks the functioning of
modern civilization (and therefore population health on a massive
scale) emerged slowly, including among the health community, with
only a few exceptions, to be discussed [26]. Even today, it appears dif-
ﬁcult for many health workers to appreciate that writers issuing
warnings and pessimistic forecasts [27] are and were sincere. One
important co-factor for civilization’s risk is the extent of global
inequality. It has been argued that processes sometimes called “state
capture” have excessive inﬂuence on collective decision-making,
leading to choices that repeatedly beneﬁt elites rather than the pub-
lic, who are thus less responsive to underlying risks and challenges
[6,28].
In 1972, in the American Journal of Public Health, Frederick Sar-
gent, a professor of human ecology, warned that man’s (sic) “inter-
ventions in and manipulations of the processes of the planetary life
support-system (ecosystem) have produced a set of complex prob-
lems” [29]. In 1993, the opening sentence in the preface of “Planetary
Overload”, a book written by the epidemiologist Tony McMichael,
states “The most serious potential consequence of global environ-
mental change is the erosion of Earth’s life-support systems” [30]. In
2000 I (also an epidemiologist) warned of civilization failure [31].
Impending Limits to Growth were taken seriously at some of the
highest levels of western civilization, including by US President
Jimmy Carter, who, in 1977, commissioned a related report called
“Global 2000: The Report To The President: Entering The Twenty-
First Century” [32]. This sold over 1.5 million copies. In 1991 Carter
wrote a 3.5 page foreword to a revised edition of this, in which he
explained “I would like to see the Global 2000 process revived. It was
killed when I left Washington because of a political aversion to long-
term planning with an emphasis on the environment”.
As Carter’s foreword suggested, the ﬁndings of both Global 2000
and Limits to Growth were received hostilely in many inﬂuential
quarters [33]. One conservative critic. was William Nordhaus, a future
Nobel Laureate in Economics. Commenting on Nordhaus’s major crit-
icism [34] of the Limits to Growth report, Ugo Bardi (a member of the
Club of Rome) wrote: “nowhere in his paper does Nordhaus demon-
strate that Forrester’s model produces such obviously unrealistic
results. In fact, Nordhaus is simply looking at one of the several equa-
tions of the model without realizing that the output of each equation
will be modiﬁed by the interaction with all the other equations and
that will insure correct returns to scale. This is the essence of systems
thinking: that parts interact” [35].
Ever since, the debate between optimists and pessimists about
Limits to Growth has ﬂickered, mostly outside the health literature.
More general allusions to Limits to Growth in health journals have
been subtle, such as by planetary health workers [36]. With rare
exceptions [15,37−40] Limits to Growth has been overlooked by
recent health writers.
Civilization is at risk from the interaction of environmental
change
and
human
behavior,
not
via
“environmental
determinism”
It is obvious that climate change cannot act alone to create global
civilizational risk. Instead, it will interact with politics, grievances,
military capacity, alliances, chance, and miscalculation [41].
However, accusations of oversimpliﬁcation frequently occur. For
example, international relations scholar Harry Verhoeven in 2024
claimed that “many policymakers and journalists often attribute”
conﬂicts and suffering in Sudan to the underlying cause of climate
change and “the country’s daunting ecology” [42]. Another example
is a widely cited paper called “One effect to rule them all? A comment
on climate and conﬂict” [43]. This paper incorrectly implies that the
literature on climate change and conﬂict is mono-causal [44].
Supporters of such views [45] sometimes accuse academic oppo-
nents of exhibiting “environmental determinism”. Environmental
determinism is an over-simpliﬁed position by which ecological fac-
tors are held to operate outside their social, historic, and political
context. In so doing, writers making such claims overlook, or ignore
(and rarely if ever seek to refute), the competing concept that climate
change (and in some cases other forms of ecological harm) acts as a
risk “multiplier” or threat “ampliﬁer” interacting with a suite of other
social and ecological factors [44]. This interaction can also be called
“socio-ecological”, or, more simply, “eco-social” [27]. An analogy
from human health is that excessive exposure to tobacco and alcohol
increases the risk of cancer. However, co-factors are needed, such as
age or another environmental determinant. Inhaling one cigarette, or
even 100,000, does not guarantee lung cancer. Similarly, severe cli-
mate change does not guarantee violent conﬂict −but it increases
the risk [46,47].
Environmental determinism emerged in the 19th century, com-
plementing “social Darwinism” [48]. At that time, many European
powers ruled empires, including in the tropics, where large popula-
tions were exposed to malaria and other diseases at a far higher rate
than in more temperate climates. Philosopher Herbert Spencer (1820
−1903), described by geographer Richard Peet as the “father of mod-
ern biology and godfather of modern geography” [48] developed the
concept of a “social organism”. Peet argues that, for Spencer, a species
or society changed "under the combined inﬂuences of its intrinsic
nature and the environing actions, inorganic and organic".
Social Darwinism and its close cousin, environmental determin-
ism, plausibly reduced the anxiety, or even guilt, that some popula-
tions may otherwise have experienced as beneﬁciaries of the
exploitation, not only of nature, but of other human beings at that
time. For example, in then newly colonised Australia, aboriginals
were not only deliberately displaced [49], but in some cases hunted,
poisoned, and consciously infected with smallpox [50] in order to
reduce competition, in a legally (though not actually) “empty” conti-
nent, according to the principle of terra nullius [51].

Vestiges of social Darwinism and environmental determinism
remain powerful, even if this must largely be inferred. Many journal-
ists, policy makers and even some national leaders use racist lan-
guage. But such simpliﬁcations, for several decades, are rare among
scholars and are vital to avoid. Climate change will not, by itself,
cause civilization failure. It will interact with other eco-social factors,
implicit or explicit in the Limits to Growth model.
1.2. Civilization collapse in the climate and health literature
In this section I review literature relevant to civilization’s survival
published by health workers. I argue this discussion was less inhib-
ited in the second half of the 20th century than it has since become,
even though the evidence of climate change’s extent and harm is
now unequivocal.
In the 1960s, pioneering microbiologist Rene Dubos became the
ﬁrst “planetary health lobbyist”, for example by calling for the term
“allergy” to be broadened to encompass reactions to a profoundly
altered global environment [52]. In 1972, human ecologist, Stephen
Boyden also warned, in a health journal, of human health risks from
ecosystem damage [53]. With socialist economist Barbara Ward,
Dubos published, in 1973 a book calling for the “care and mainte-
nance of a small planet” [54].
While the linkage of climate with health has been recognized
since, at least, Hippocrates’ treatise “On Airs, Waters, and Places”
(circa 400 BCE) [55] the ﬁrst published recognition of the link connec-
tions between anthropogenic climate change and health may have
been in 1981, in a book chapter [56]. In 1989, articles were published
in three leading health journals, each of which warned of health
effects of climate change. Each of these papers not only discussed
health effects of heat and infectious diseases, but also explored more
diffuse aspects with multifactorial causes. In 1992 these aspects were
ﬁrst termed “tertiary” health consequences [57].
The earliest of these 1989 articles was a one-page anonymous edi-
torial in The Lancet. It warned “at the worst .. world food production
will collapse” [58]. A second paper (in the New England Medical Jour-
nal), by Alexander Leaf from the Harvard Department of Preventive
Medicine, warned of major sea level rise, including in the US state of
Florida. Leaf stated: “Miami has such a porous aquifer that a protec-
tive dyke against rising sea levels would have to start more than
45 m (150 ft) beneath the surface to prevent salt water from welling
up behind it”. Leaf also warned of large-scale migration, especially
from poor nations in the global South, due to the interaction between
climate change and scarce arable land [59]. This is related to Limits to
Growth, though not explicitly stated as such by Leaf.
The third of this pioneering group of papers on climate change
and health was by epidemiologist John Last [60]. His is the only of
these three 1989 articles to cite Limits to Growth. Last also warns of
famine and conﬂict, for example: “history has shown that aggressive
populations with depleted resources wage war to take what they
need from others.” Last also warns, explicitly, of the risk from cata-
strophic nuclear war and that “there might be no surviving humans
by 2050 if nuclear weapons were used”.
In 1990 Maurice King, a pioneer of primary health care [61], pub-
lished a paper [62] proposing that the World Health Organization
(WHO) broaden its thinking about health care to include sustainabil-
ity, including concepts promoted by the Brundtland Report, which
ﬁrst popularized the term “sustainable development” [63]. King also
warned of “demographic entrapment”, a term he credited to the
futurist Lester Brown [64]. By this, Brown and King hypothesized that
the impacts of ongoing population growth, if excessive, could create
reinforcing feedbacks that delay or even reverse societal capacity to
generate long-term improvements, including to health.
King did not warn of global civilization’s demise, but his work
foreshadowed
localised civilization failure, such as soon after
occurred in the 1994 Rwandan genocide. However, the ecological
and demographic co-determinants of this genocide [65] were then
largely ignored in most of the development and economics literature,
with rare exceptions including in health [31,66].
In 1996 WHO co-published the ﬁrst book on climate change and
health [67]. This mostly focused on the health effects from heat and
infectious diseases. But it also had a chapter on food supply, and a
limited discussion of conﬂict and population displacement. It also
cited an update of Limits to Growth [68]. Two years later, WHO
hosted a workshop to discuss global “ecological integrity” and sus-
tainable development. A subsequent report was co-authored by
Canadian epidemiologist Colin Soskolne and WHO’s Roberto Bertol-
lini [69]. Crucially, this group included experts from disciplines
beyond human health, including human ecology, veterinary medicine
and law. One of these, human ecologist Bill Rees, co-originated the
concept of the “ecological footprint” [70]. His presentation at this
workshop focused on Limits to Growth. Rees argued that human “car-
rying capacity” will likely become a central issue in global develop-
ment in the 21st century, and that “there is virtually no possibility
that an industrial society of up to ten billion people can live sustain-
ably on Earth at current “Northern” levels. The report noted that
health outcomes “may more likely be tied to such events as civil
strife, war, and famine, than to any particular measurable index of
health status like life expectancy”.
In 1994, inﬂuenced by repeated contact with King, Last and McMi-
chael, I published a paper noting “we have to accept that there is a
limit to the earth’s resources” [71]. I did not then speculate on civili-
zation’s failure or collapse. However, in 2000, as far as I know for the
ﬁrst time in a health journal, I warned that if human demands exceed
a threshold, then civilization risks ‘not only its failure, but its collapse’
[28].
1.3. Climate change, health, and civilization in the more recent health
literature
Between 2001 and 2009, the climate change and health literature
focused almost entirely on effects such as from heat, extreme
weather events, and infectious diseases [72]. This arguably compla-
cent landscape was then challenged by a paper called “Managing the
health effects of climate change”, that speculated that climate change
“could be the biggest global health threat of the 21st century” [73].
This 37-page article (henceforth Costello et al.) has now been cited
over 3400 times (Google scholar).
Costello et al. warned that climate change and other factors could
lead to an additional 2 billion people who might be water stressed,
while billions more would face hunger or starvation. However, in
terms of water, about 4 billion people each year are already exposed,
for at least one month a year, to extremely high water stress [74]. The
planet already has over 700 million people who are chronically calori-
cally undernourished [75]. At least two billion people ingest adequate
calories but suffer micronutrient deﬁciencies, including of iron, rob-
bing them of vitality and cognitive capacity, if of sufﬁcient severity
and duration [76].
Costello et al. mention the possibility of “armed conﬂict” as a
result of declining economic circumstances and worsening water
scarcity. However, this paper did not discuss nuclear weapons [77],
nor provide any hint of conﬂict on a scale sufﬁcient to seriously harm
civilization. It does not mention or cite Limits to Growth. The paper
does not contain the word “civilization”.
If the small fraction of the global population who are currently
well-off (fewer than 2 billion) can live with data documenting such
human deprivation, might not they adjust to a doubling or even tre-
bling in the number of such disadvantaged? The forecasts provided
by Costello et al., if they evolve, might justify their assertion that cli-
mate change is the biggest global health threat of this century. How-
ever, it is here argued population health could follow a much darker
trajectory, a possibility hardly discussed in the more recent health

literature [72]. It is as if decision makers have decided to skew this lit-
erature to the optimistic, perhaps in the belief that pessimism might
rob health workers of motivation [78].
1.4. Civilization collapse and climate change in the general literature
I have just contended that the possibility of civilization collapse
remains barely known by recent health workers (and their funders).
This taboo is lifting in the wider scientiﬁc literature. In 2003, Martin
Rees (later president of Britain’s Royal Society) speculated that this
century may be civilization’s ﬁnal [79]. The “planetary boundaries”
articles (acknowledged as fundamental to planetary health) [40,80]
hint at civilization’s collapse by its pleas to retain “a safe operating
space” for humanity. An early version of the planetary boundaries
articles acknowledges that its “proposed framework builds on and
extends approaches based on limits-to-growth” [81].
In 2018, David Attenborough, a prominent British broadcaster and
conservationist, warned that inaction on climate change could lead to
“the collapse of our civilizations” [82]. In 2021, three senior environ-
mental scientists, including Robert Watson, a former chair of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, acknowledged that
“humanity has gambled its civilization on no more than promises of
future
solutions”
[83]. UN Secretary-General
Antonio
Guterres
warned, in 2022, of empty climate change pledges “that put us on
track to an unliveable world” [84].
Leading historians, archaeologists and philosophers have also
recently warned of the potential for the collapse of civilization. These
include (respectively) Naomi Oreskes [85], Eric Cline [86] and Tim
Mulgan [87]. Ethicist Daniel Steel with colleagues [2] have inter-
preted scientiﬁc evidence about climate change, such as that synthe-
sized in the “World Scientists’ Warning of a Climate Emergency” [88]
which gave notice that climate change could leave “large areas of
Earth uninhabitable” to mean that civilization could collapse.
Futurist Luke Kemp, with colleagues [89] asked “could climate
change result in worldwide societal collapse or even eventual human
extinction?” Their paper does not mention Limits to Growth, but they
clearly conceptualize climate change as interacting with numerous
Limits to Growth elements. Furthermore, ﬁve contributors to this
paper also contributed to the planetary boundaries paper that cited
Limits to Growth [81].
1.5. Bioethics and climate change
There is an appreciable and growing literature on climate change
and several ﬁelds related to “bioethics”. A limited review is here pro-
vided.
To health workers, the best-known aspect of this ﬁeld is also
called medical ethics. This term dates at least to 1803, and has funda-
mental principles explored in antiquity [90].
“Environmental ethics” is also relevant. Ethicist Andrew Light [91]
dates this ﬁeld to the early 1970s, while recognizing it has much
older roots. Environmental ethicists argue nature has intrinsic (non-
anthropocentric) value. This ﬁeld engages vigorously with climate
change, though not obviously with the possibility of civilization’s fail-
ure.
In 1970, Van Rensselaer Potter (while based in a medical school)
published −in a health journal −a paper called “Bioethics, the sci-
ence of survival”. Potter hoped this would unite biological knowledge
and human values” [92]. Even though Potter’s formulation was pub-
lished prior to Limits to Growth, he was clearly motivated by themes
that also informed Limits to Growth (in the period Spinney referred
to, discussed earlier). Whitehouse later noted that Potter “foresaw
the approaching genetic/ecological disasters caused by the world’s
population explosion” [93].
In 2003 ecologist Paul Ehrlich called for “bioethics” to examine
“the role of the rich in generating climate change”. He argued
“bioethics must be expanded from its focus on medical (sic) issues to
consider such things as the ethics of preserving natural capital for
future generations” [94]. Ehrlich did not cite Potter, and his language
suggested his call was to reform the older medical “stream” of bioeth-
ics, rather than that advanced by Potter. Ehrlich also noted “the
human predicament” “is intensifying”, echoing the subtitle of the
1972 Limits to Growth report.
Co-editor of the journal Global Bioethics, Cheryl MacPherson, in a
2022 paper discussing the past and future of bioethics [95] mentions
Potter’s book “Global Bioethics” (1988) [96] as discussing ‘global
issues of health and human survival such as nuclear war and what he
called “global warming”’. MacPherson also observed that Whitehouse
[93] argued that “global” bioethics should embrace a concern with
“planetary aspects of health and the future”. MacPherson also hints
at civilization failure, for example by writing “human health and
ethics evolved from what began as a small population on an Earth of
vast resources to a population of billions whose essential needs
exceed these resources.”
2. Conclusion
In this article I have provided a summary of issues that threaten
the functioning, and possibly the survival, of civilization. Although lit-
tle of this is completely new in health journals, the major contribu-
tion of this paper is to review aspects that have become marginalized
in the health literature, especially concerning limits to growth and its
interaction with climate change. I also appeal for deeper exploration
and awareness by health workers of these related literatures, espe-
cially of human ecology. In addition, although there are calls for more
convergence between bioethics (as deﬁned by Potter) and medical
ethics [97], each ﬁeld would be strengthened by a deeper engage-
ment with the issue of civilization failure.
Stephen Schneider, a pioneering climate scientist [98], once wrote
that "the end of the world" or "nothing to worry about" are the two
least likely cases, with almost any scenario in between having a
higher probability of occurrence” [99]. If we contemplate the
unthinkable we may help to avert it [100]. Health workers can and
should contribute the numerous actions necessary to ensure that
Schneider’s forecast holds true.
