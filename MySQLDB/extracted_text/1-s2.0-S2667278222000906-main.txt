Introduction: The United States (US) spends a staggering amount on costs secondary to natural disasters, over
$2 trillion between 1980 and 2021, during which time 15,347 disaster related deaths also occurred [1]. We
assess the relationship between CO2, temperature, and the number and economic costs of billion-dollar
disaster events in the US during this period.
Materials & Methods: Data on the annual number of inﬂation-adjusted billion-dollar disasters in the US,
global CO2 levels, average temperature, and fatalities were obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmo-
spheric Administration (NOAA) for the period 1980−2021. Spearman’s correlation (rs) was calculated to ana-
lyze the relationship between these variables.
Results: Over this 41-year period, CO2 levels, temperature, and the number of billion-dollar disasters in the
US all increased and are strongly correlated. The rate of events over this period increased along with
increases in CO2 (Spearman’s correlation (rs)=0.841) and temperature (rs =0.748).
Conclusions: CO2 levels and temperature have increased over the past 4 decades and are strongly positively
correlated with the number of and total cost due to billion-dollar disasters. This strong correlation suggests
that the annual number of events in the US will continue to increase along with their economic burden, so
measures are needed to mitigate those costs. We recommend a focus on Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) as an
immediate cost savings measure, in keeping with United Nations Disaster Risk Reduction and UN Sustainable
Development Goals recommendations. Additional research on the healthcare costs associated with natural
disasters is needed.

TagedH11. IntroductionTagedEnd
TagedPBeginning in the late 1700s, the industrial revolution [2] ushered
in a period of rapid economic expansion powered by fossil fuels, con-
sequently increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. During the
1800s, there emerged concepts of the interrelatedness between
TagedEndTagedPatmospheric CO2 concentrations, changes in global temperature, and
changes in climate [3−5]. Throughout the 1900s, appreciation of
global warming and anthropogenic climate change increased [6,7]. A
major consequence is the increase in the global frequency and sever-
ity of natural disasters such as cyclones, heatwaves, heavy precipita-
tion leading to ﬂoods, and drought [8]. The US has been no exception,
battered by increasingly devastating and expensive disasters, espe-
cially tropical cyclones, storms, and extreme heat/drought events,
sometimes with accompanying wildﬁres [9−11].TagedEnd
TagedPIn order to maintain a historical record of severe weather events
and their economic impacts, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) maintains a database under The National
Center for Environmental Information (NCEI). NCEI has, since 1980,
maintained a record of disasters which exceed a total of $1 billion in
costs, such as hurricanes, drought and heat waves, inland ﬂoods,

Administration, US Army Corps, and state agencies. Costs which are
factored in include physical damage to property; infrastructure such
as roads, bridges, and offshore energy platforms; asset classes such as
vehicles and contents of buildings; agricultural losses; wildﬁre sup-
pression costs and disaster restoration; and time element losses such
as business interruption.TagedEnd
TagedPThese costs therefore represent a combination of immediate, sub-
acute, and longer-term restoration estimates. What they do not
reﬂect, however, are factors such as natural capital, or loss of life, and
therefore signiﬁcantly underestimate the true cost of disasters [12].TagedEnd
TagedPBillion-dollar disasters can serve as a uniquely useful metric, spe-
ciﬁcally identifying large magnitude disasters. Another economic
aspect of disasters that draws little attention is the increased impact
on the already overburdened US healthcare system [13−18]. During
the 19900s there was an important international paradigm shift from
the concept of Disaster Management to Disaster Risk Reduction
(DRR). DRR emphasizes understanding societies’ risks during disas-
ters and taking steps to decrease disasters themselves and reduce the
impact of disasters on society [19−24]. Institution of DRR measures
has been extensively studied in the US, and has shown that investing
in up front disaster research and preventive measures can greatly
reduce the economic impact of natural disasters. The National Insti-
tute of Building Sciences (NIBS), funded by three federal and four pri-
vate sector agencies, released the ﬁrst Natural Hazard Mitigation
Saves study in 2005. It estimated a beneﬁt-cost-ratio (BCR) for miti-
gation measures of 4:1, meaning four dollars saved for every dollar of
mitigation [19]. This report has since been updated and the 2019
NIBS Mitigation Saves report indicates that disaster mitigation meas-
ures can have an overall BCR of 11:1 [24]. This is achieved through
building and infrastructure measures such as adopting the latest
building codes or utilization of above-code designs; private sector
building retroﬁts; retroﬁtting critical disaster infrastructure lifelines
such as telecommunications, roads, power, and water; and increasing
federal grants directed toward mitigation measures. For example,
Greenville Utilities of North Carolina utilized a grant to raise a berm
and ﬂoodwall around its water treatment plant, which therefore was
protected from 3-foot ﬂoodwaters during Hurricane Matthew in
2016 by a simpler, competitively low-cost mitigation measure. Such
measures represent comparatively simple but markedly cost-effec-
tive strategies to save money and lives, and are also in keeping with
the recommendations from the United Nation Disaster Risk Reduc-
tion (UNDRR) goals as well as the United Nations Sustainable Devel-
opment Goals (UNSDG [21,22]. Our study therefore set out to assess
and highlight the trend of costs due to disasters in the US between
1980 and 2021, assess any possible statistical relationship with the
climate change parameters of CO2 and temperature, and make a case
for greater need for DRR to reduce the economic burden of disasters.
We mention the ﬁnancial impact of disasters on healthcare costs to
highlight its importance, but more in-depth discussion of healthcare
speciﬁcally is beyond the scope of this study.TagedEnd

TagedH22.1. Data procurementTagedEnd
TagedPEconomic disaster costs were obtained from publicly available data
from NOAA. Under the NCEI (National Center for Environmental Infor-
mation), data on the number and costs of disasters which crossed the
billion-dollar threshold have been kept since 1980 [25]. NCEI monitors
the cost impacts of hurricanes, drought and heat waves, inland ﬂoods,
severe local storms, wildﬁres, crop freeze events, winter storms, and
TagedEndTagedPcold waves. Importantly, to ensure costs can be compared over the
time mentioned, the Adjusted Consumer Price Index (CPI) [26,27] is
used. The CPI can be deﬁned as the average change over time in prices
paid for a representative market basket of goods and services and is
affected by inﬂation. By using Adjusted CPI ﬁnancial data, decadal costs
can be better compared over the time period in question. Global tem-
perature data were obtained from NOAA. Temperature here is deﬁned
as the average global temperature change, compared to the overall
average of twentieth century levels, in degrees Celsius. CO2 level data
(in parts per million, ppm) were also obtained from NOAA’s Global
monitoring laboratory, Mauna Loa Observatory and ‘Our World in Data’,
a publicly available database, which also collates data from NOAA
[28,29]. Death data is also maintained by NCEI’s Storm Events Database
[30,31], which compiles fatality statistics using media, insurance, law
enforcement, and county, state, and federal reporting.TagedEnd
TagedH22.2. Data analysisTagedEnd
TagedPStatistical analysis was performed using Statistical Analysis Soft-
ware (SAS). Spearman’s Correlations over the period from 1980 to
2021 were performed between the number of billion-dollar disasters
and global temperature and global CO2 concentration changes. The
relationship between CO2 concentrations and temperature also was
assessed. Sub-analysis correlations were also made between the
roughly double decade periods 1980−2020 and 2001−2021. The
choice of Spearman’s correlation (rs) was based on its ability to assess
a monotonic relationship between two variables, even when the rela-
tionship is nonlinear, distribution free and with a small sample size,
as was applicable to our data. The period 1980−2021 was chosen
because this represented the period of reliable data availability. Given
the positive correlations within this period, post hoc sub-analyses
into double decadal and decadal periods were performed to investi-
gate for any change in the strength of the associations between
events, temperature, and CO2 concentrations, over these smaller
time periods. This explored the possibility of not just linear, but non-
linear or exponential correlations.TagedEnd

TagedPTable 1 shows the statistical relationships between numbers of
billion-dollar disasters, and change in temperature over the period
1980−2021, as well as for the roughly two double decade periods
1980−2000 and 2001−2021.Table 1 shows that there is a robust cor-
relation coefﬁcient of 0.78 between temperature and number of bil-
lion-dollar disasters during the period 1980−2021. Furthermore, if
we were to examine how this relationship changes over time, we see
that the strength of the correlation increases as temperature
increases. Between 1980−2000, rs =0.136, but for 2001−2021, rs
increases to 0.576. This increase in correlation suggests that as tem-
perature increases, there is not just a proportional, but exponential
increase in events, within the studied range.TagedEnd

the increase in billion-dollar disasters. Table 2 shows the statistical
relationship between the number of billion-dollar disasters and CO2

cal correlation between CO2 levels and number of billion-dollar dis-
asters is strong, rs = 0.841.TagedEnd
TagedPBreaking this down into roughly double decade periods, we do see
an increasing correlation between CO2 levels and events as CO2 lev-
els increase. Between 1980−2000, rs = 0.505, but between 2001 and
2021, rs increases to 0.871. This again supports an exponential
increase in events with increasing CO2 levels.TagedEnd

TagedPThe graph in Fig. 3 displays the relationship between CO2 levels
on the left y-axis and temperature change on the right y-axis, demon-

between CO2 levels and temperature change over the period 1980
−2021, as well as during the roughly double decade periods 1980
−2000 and 2001−2021. In Table 3 we see that statistically there is a
very
strong correlation between CO2
and temperature,
0.916
between 1980 and 2021. Looking at the two roughly double decade
periods, this correlation increases as CO2 levels increase, with

period 2017−2021. From 1980−1989, there were just 3.1 events per
year and 297 deaths per year, and this was at an annual yearly tem-
perature change of 0.277 and yearly CO2 level of 345.5 ppm. By 2010
−2019, yearly CO2 increased to 400.2, and temperature change
increased to 0.791. This rise was associated with 12.8 annual events,
and annual deaths of 523. This has accelerated within the last 5 years
as events increased to 17.8 per year, with 911 deaths per year, also
associated with an increase of CO2 to 411.4. This shortened observa-
tion period saw events increase to 17.8 per year and deaths increase
to 911 per year. These 5- and 10-year views illustrate the increasing
rate of number of events and also highlight the increasing loss of life
over this time.TagedEnd

heatwaves), from 1980 to 2021TagedEnd
TagedPNatural disasters have become an increasingly prominent occur-
rence within the US, with different disaster categories exerting differ-
ing impacts, shown in Table 5. Tropical cyclones are the costliest in
terms of both ﬁnances and human life, accounting for 52.6% of all
costs (1157.1 / 2199.7), and 43.7% of all deaths (6708 / 15,347). Severe
storms are the most common event at 47% (152 / 323), but with the
lowest average cost per event at $2.3B. The highest death tolls are
due to tropical cyclones with 43.7% (6708 / 15,347) followed next by
drought/heat wave events at 27% (4139 / 15,347) and then severe
storms at 12.8% (1972 / 15,347) [1].TagedEnd
TagedH14. DiscussionTagedEnd
TagedPOver the last four decades, we have seen signiﬁcant increases in
the number of billion-dollar disasters, total attributable cost per year,
TagedEndTagedPand their frequency, severity, and diversity. This increase is closely
correlated with increases in global temperature and CO2 concentra-
tions. Of particular concern, the frequency of billion-dollar events is
increasing on an almost yearly basis. The number of events per year,
and total cost of disasters per year, are strongly correlated with
increases in temperature and CO2. This can be seen by comparing the
two double decade periods including 1980−1999 and 2000−2021, as
described above (Tables 1, 2 and 3).TagedEnd
TagedPOf interest, the CPI-adjusted costs per year have increased over
time. As illustrated in Table 4, annual disaster cost within each of the
last 4 decades increased steadily: $19.5B, $29.8B, $55.8B, $89.2B. Fur-
thermore, the annual average for the last 5 years has been even more
expensive, at $153.0B. This closely supports the idea that as CO2 lev-
els increase, there is an ever-increasing cost associated with each
increment in CO2 level and corresponding temperature change. Not
only is cost per year on average increasing, but cost per event, and
numbers of deaths per year, also have increased steadily. For exam-
ple, if we look at decade 1 (1980−1989), we see a mean yearly CO2
level of 354.54 ppm, which is associated with a mean yearly tempera-
ture change of 0.277°. This was associated with a cost per year of
$19.5 B, and deaths per year of 297. By decade 4, the mean yearly
CO2 increased to 400.23 ppm, which was associated with a mean
yearly temperature of 0.791°, but that increased translated into a
more than fourfold increase in disaster cost of $89.2 B, and almost
double the death rate to 523. However, increases within just the last
ﬁve years 2017−2021 raise the concern for an even steeper environ-
mental change to human cost factor. Within just this 5-year interval,
mean CO2 increased by a seemingly innocuous 11 ppm over decade
4, to 411.48, which translated into a 0.1° temperature increase, to
0.898. However, within just this period, yearly average disaster costs
and deaths both almost doubled, to $153B per year and 911 deaths
per year.TagedEnd

TagedPThese ﬁndings are in keeping with the increased correlation in the
roughly second double decade period over the ﬁrst double decade
period (Tables 1, 2 and 3), suggesting that the relationship is nonlin-
ear and is following a more exponential pattern. This concerning pat-
tern suggests less predictability regarding the consequences of future
disasters. If an ever tightening, exponential relationship between
CO2 levels, temperature, and disasters continues, this could translate
into increased disaster frequency, severity, unpredictability, eco-
nomic and healthcare costs, healthcare utilization and deaths in
America.TagedEnd
TagedPAs an example of the tremendous multistate impact of a billion-
dollar disaster, in June 2021, the historic Paciﬁc Northwest heat
dome struck, during which Portland, Oregon saw a record high of
116° Fahrenheit. This single disaster led to 229 deaths and $8.9B in
damages, and the event is considered virtually impossible in the
absence of anthropogenic climate change [11]. This event led to a
69 times increase in heat related emergency room visits between
June 25−30, 2021 compared to the same period in 2019. However,
despite the astronomic disaster recovery costs, there is still a paucity
of economic data regarding the costs to the healthcare system [13].TagedEnd
TagedPThere is an unseen, intermediate term beneﬁt of disaster risk
reduction, and that is the cost savings from mitigation, as noted in
the Introduction. Additional research is needed to assess the cost
impact speciﬁcally on the healthcare system. The health care eco-
nomic burden due to climate change and fossil fuel use is poorly cal-
culated [13]. The latter is of particular importance as US health care
spending totaled $4.1 trillion in 2020, or 19.7% of US GDP [1,32] so
even a fraction of this is economically signiﬁcant.TagedEnd
TagedPHowever, to mitigate the economic impacts of disasters in a more
comprehensive manner, policies for combating CO2 emissions and
therefore temperature change are required. The UNSDG emphasizes
the need to keep temperature below the target of 1.5 °Celsius above
preindustrial levels, as outlined in the 2015 Paris agreement [23], and
lists this as a metric to combat climate change while highlighting the
need for climate ﬁnance.TagedEnd
TagedPFraming disasters in this economic light can bring more attention
and motivation for change as economic concerns tends to be the
number one priority of US voters [33,34], and potentially can serve to
alter policymakers’ decisions. The idea of disaster risk reduction as a
cost saving opportunity is a strong potential motivator to policy-
makers [35,]. Loss of human life due to disasters is another conse-
quence which is less emphasized but requires focus and attention in
keeping with the UNDRR goals [21]. The 2015 Paris agreement
focuses on climate funding, reducing carbon emissions, and targeting
TagedEndTagedPa temperature target under 1.5° of warming. Keeping with these tar-
gets as outlined by the UNSDG [22,23] also should decrease human
and economic costs.TagedEnd
TagedH15. LimitationsTagedEnd
TagedPClimate science itself has its inherent challenges. Data collection is
typically retrospective. Randomization and control of different
approaches are not possible since there is only one planet. NOAA esti-
mates that billion-dollar disasters account for 80% of total US disaster
costs but using only the cost of billion-dollar disasters as was done in
this paper underestimates cost of disasters related to climate change.
NCEI costs also do not capture losses due to natural capital assets,
loss of life, utilization burden to the healthcare system, or health care
economic costs. Finally, another limitation is that CO2 is the only
greenhouse gas considered in this study because it is well studied,
has a long half-life, historically been attributed to temperature
change, and accounts for 79% of all US greenhouse gas emissions [19].TagedEnd
TagedH16. ConclusionsTagedEnd
TagedPIn conclusion, we report strong and increasing correlations
between temperature and CO2 levels, and with the economic cost of
disasters in the US. Furthermore, the strength of the correlations
seem to be increasing with increases in temperature and CO2 levels
over time. We highlight that the economic impact of natural disasters
in the US is staggering, tallying over $2.1 trillion over the last
42 years.TagedEnd
TagedPPoorly appreciated factors include the economic impact on the
health care system and the number of fatalities attributable to these
disasters. Finally, we also recommend a national focus on DRR as a
cost savings measure.TagedEnd
