Section 1: About this Guide
Purpose
Climate change and its impacts to our environment, societies, economies, and built infrastructure (e.g. 
buildings, roads, housing, etc.) may be this century’s most defining issue. Climate changes are expected 
in terms of both the frequency and intensity of extreme climate events, changes in seasonality, increasing 
temperatures, greater ocean acidification and so forth. The effects of climate changes are already being 
experienced and will only continue to grow in the future, although the extent is uncertain.
Indigenous communities in Canada are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change for a 
number of reasons. This includes peoples’ intrinsic connection with their traditional territories, historically, 
culturally, and for sustenance and transportation purposes, and Aboriginal and treaty rights to hunt and fish. 
In addition, remoteness in relation to essential services and limited human and financial resources increases 
their vulnerability to climate change. Communities that are particularly remote face an increased risk as 
external emergency responders my be too distant to respond to or mitigate dangerous situations. As a result, 
communities face significant impacts as a result of climate change, including healthy and safety impacts (e.g. 
displacement related to flooding) as well as mental and physical health impacts (e.g. anxiety, post-traumatic 
stress disorder related to emergency events). All of this can impact the transfer of Indigenous Knowledge and 
create a disconnect from traditional lands and sacred sites.  
Given that change is inevitable, there is a need to adapt to the impacts of climate change. This involves 
strengthening communities’ internal capacity (tools, resources, best practices, and knowledge) to manage 
climate risks currently being experienced while also preparing for those that are anticipated to take place in 
the future.
This guide has been developed to support Indigenous communities in identifying tools and resources, 
best practices, and key considerations that can be used for climate adaptation and resilient infrastructure 
planning related to the following climate risks or “impact areas”: 
•	 Loss of Winter Roads;
•	 Wildfire1;
•	 Inland Flooding; and
•	 Sea-Level Rise and Coastal Erosion.
How to Use this Guide
There are different ways to effectively use this guide:
•	 If you are new to climate change adaptation and infrastructure planning, we suggest you read through 
the guide from the beginning to better understand the planning process, available resources, and what to 
consider when selecting a resource(s). Please note: the information and resources included in this guide 
can be used in combination with the six Climate Change Adaptation Planning Guidebooks for Indigenous 
Communities, most notably Guidebook 4: Identifying Solutions and Guidebook 5: Taking Adaptive Action. 
If you are interested in developing a climate change adaptation plan related to winter roads, wildfires, 
inland flooding, or sea-level rise and coastal erosion, we recommend working through the six guidebooks in 
combination with this document.
•	 If you are already engaged in climate change adaptation planning, but would like to learn more about 
specific tools that can be used to support infrastructure planning in a changing climate, you can refer to 
Section 3: What to Consider When Choosing a Climate Change Planning Resource followed by Section 
5: Resource Matrix to learn more about existing resources and how to select a resource that meets your 
planning goals.
•	 If you are interested in learning more about a specific impact area - loss of winter roads, wildfire, inland 
flooding or sea-level rise and coastal erosion - you can refer to Section 4: Impact Areas to learn more about 
each impact area, as well as key considerations and best practices for infrastructure planning related to that 
impact area.

Section 2: Climate Change Adaptation Planning
What is Climate Adaptation Planning?
Climate adaptation planning is the process by which communities, businesses, regions and countries assess 
how climate change could impact them, identify and develop strategies and plans for managing risk and 
taking advantage of opportunities, implement planned actions, and then monitor, evaluate and repeat the 
process, as needed.
Section 2 provides an overview of climate adaptation planning, as well as key considerations related to risk 
assessments, Indigenous Knowledge, and the role of Indigenous Knowledge in land-use/comprehensive 
community planning processes. The information outlined in this section is intended to provide general 
information and planning considerations to support your climate adaptation planning process.
The Six Step Climate Change Adaptation Planning Process
The Centre for Indigenous Environmental Resources (CIER) has developed a six-step process designed to 
guide a community through climate change adaptation planning - the Climate Change Adaptation Planning 
Guidebooks for Indigenous Communities. The guidebooks provide a user-friendly framework to help 
communities avoid, minimize or adapt to the impacts of climate change, and outline ideas on how to plan for 
climate change, how to engage your community, and activities for involving members in identifying priorities 
and achieving goals. 
Each guidebook supports the completion of the six steps of the planning process. Each step prepares the user 
for the next phase of the planning process. The six steps are:

The Indigenous Climate Change Adaptation Planning Resources for Winter Roads, Wildfires, Flooding, & 
Coastal Erosion is a companion document to the six-step planning process. The information outlined in 
this guide can be used to support planning efforts related to step 2 (climate change impacts), step 3 (risk 
assessment and community sustainability), step 4 (identifying solutions), and step 5 (taking adaptive action) 
of the six-step planning process. It is important to note, although the Indigenous Climate Change Adaptation 
Guidance document is intended to complement the six-step planning process, the information included 
in this guide can also be helpful for those following a different planning process and/or for those seeking 
guidance on the use of different tools and sources of information.
What is Risk Assessment?
Steps 2 and 3 of the six-step climate change adaptation planning process focus on identifying and 
understanding the community’s vulnerability to climate change impacts. Completing a risk assessment can 
be a helpful method for achieving this. 
If you recall, risk is a measurement of the potential impacts of a hazard over time. It combines the probability 
of an event (hazard) occurring and its potential negative consequences on the community. 
A risk assessment is about understanding climate risks and how capable your community is at responding to 
those risks. 
The goal of risk management is to reduce climate change impacts. Identifying climate-related risks takes 
time and effort, but completing a risk assessment to identify potential climate impacts and understand 
your community’s adaptive capacity to respond to those impacts is an important first step in the planning 
process. There are two components to assessment of risk. The first is the hazard, which is the location and 
extent of the impact (e.g. flooding, wildfire, erosion etc.) and the second is the vulnerability (i.e. the extent to 
which certain community members, infrastructure, and the environments may be vulnerable to the effects 
of these impacts). Together, hazards and vulnerabilities can be used to help determine the extent of a climate 
change impact. The risk information gathered from this approach can inform adaptation planning and the 
prioritization of adaptation actions.

Climate risk assessments are important for allowing communities to adapt and remain healthy.
In order to understand the adaptive capacity of your community, it can be helpful to think about what 
resiliency means for your community. Resilience, or climate resilience, can be thought of as the ability of 
the community to prevent, respond to, or recover from a disturbance, such as a climate change impact 
(US Government, 2020). For example, what would it look like for your community to be climate resilient 
and therefore able to respond or adapt to climate risks/impacts? What factors or actions would need to be 
implemented for the community to be climate resilient? 
To help answer these questions, you can start by gathering information using the prompts below. These 
prompts will help you think about the current context of the community in order to better understand how 
the community may already be resilient to certain climate change impacts, or perhaps identify areas where 
8      Climate Change Adaptation Planning Guidebooks for Indigenous Communities
the community is not as climate resilient as expected.  For example, consider the following:
•	 How do people currently use and live on the land? Consider background information on current and past 
settlements, subsistence, commercial, and traditional uses of land, water, wildlife and plants; and, 
•	 What are the community’s demographics (e.g. number of youth, number of Elders, number of males/
females/non-binary identities, etc.)? What infrastructure, housing, community groups, health, and human 
resources exist within the community? 
Once you have an idea of your community’s context and a better idea of what would make your community 
resilient, as well as a vision of what the future could look like, you can create different possible climate 
scenarios. A climate scenario is a possible picture of what future climate could look like (IPCC, 2001). Climate 
scenarios are possible conditions or environments that could result from climate change impacts (Mearns et 
al., 2001). Climate scenarios are developed and used to investigate and understand the potential impacts of 
human induced climate change (IPCC, 2001) and can be used to examine how resilient the community is.
To develop a climate scenario, you first need to identify the climate risks (e.g. drought, flood, heatwave, 
wildfire, etc.). From there, you can create different scenarios or conditions (i.e. pictures of alternative futures) 
based on different levels of community adaptation. If you want to examine how resilient the community 
is, you can create different future climate scenarios. You could create a scenario that looks at the future of 
the community if the predicted impacts of climate change for your area occur without any community 
adaptation to minimize the impacts, or you can create a climate scenario that looks at the future of the 
community if the predicted impacts of climate change occur, but the community has implemented specific 
measures to minimize or manage those effects. 
For example, you could examine how resilient the community may be to increased wildfire in the future, by 
creating a climate scenario where the community does not implement any adaptation measures to manage 
increased wildfire, compared to a climate scenario in which the community implements a fire prevention 
program and emergency response strategy to better adapt to increased wildfire. Developing different 
scenarios (pictures of alternative futures) is one way of assessing what the impacts of climate change could 
look like in your community. You can use this information to help make decisions to support the community’s 
goals for climate adaptation. 
Incorporating Indigenous Knowledge into the Planning Process
Climate change poses a threat to traditional practices, Indigenous Knowledge, and the cultural identity and 
wellbeing of Indigenous people. Through incremental changes, like a lengthening of the growing season, and 
changes the occurrence of extreme weather events like wildfire, traditional practices and ways of living such 
as hunting, fishing, medicine picking, food gathering, modes and pathways of traveling, and ceremonies 
will be affected by climate change.
Indigenous Knowledge (IK), though, can also provide direction, motivation, and support for the processes, 
assessments, and tools highlighted in this guide. Resources developed by Indigenous peoples for climate 
change adaptation often incorporate IK, so it is important to explain what is meant by IK and how it can be 
used to assess current climate change impacts and help to inform response strategies and plans.
For the purpose of this guide, Indigenous Knowledge is defined as:
“A holistic system of knowledge acquired over time through experience or observation and is tied to the 
cultural, linguistic, spiritual and subsistence ways of Indigenous peoples” (CIER and UBC, 2011).
Within the Indigenous Climate Change Adaptation Guidance document, the term Indigenous Knowledge is 
inclusive of:
•	 Traditional Knowledge;
•	 Indigenous Science;
•	 Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit; and,
•	 Other knowledge systems used by Indigenous communities.
Within the adaptation planning process, Indigenous Knowledge is used as a key risk assessment resource, 
through interviews with Elders to map and record data to illustrate how the community has changed 
over time. Similarly, community mapping activities undertaken as a part of the planning process typically 
document areas used for fishing, hunting, setting traplines, and lands used for ceremonies and the gathering 
of foods and medicines. This information is used to help community members identify where their priority 
areas are and what they want to preserve and protect for future generations.
Guidance Book  |  Resources for Winter Roads, Wildfires, Flooding, & Coastal Erosion      9 
Elders and Knowledge Holders have a wealth of invaluable knowledge and wisdom about our lands, the 
plants, animals, seasons, weather processes, and how the environment has been changing as a whole. It is 
critical to incorporate Elder interviews and/or mapping processes into any climate change assessment and 
adaptation planning process. Their guidance and wisdom will help you implement a respectful, appropriate, 
and sustainable project.
HELPFUL HINT  |  CIER has developed various tools and resources that can be used to 
support Indigenous Knowledge and mapping processes, available at  
http://www.yourcier.org/indigenous-knowledge.html.
Review the Protecting Indigenous Knowledge section below for more information and resources on how to 
collect and store Indigenous Knowledge securely.
Protecting Indigenous Knowledge
The following are suggestions and resources for collecting and storing your Indigenous Knowledge securely 
in order to ensure it is adequately protected. These considerations are particularly important if you are 
collaborating with an external party or organization during the climate change adaptation planning process.
Collecting Indigenous Knowledge: when gathering Indigenous Knowledge, it is important to review 
your band/community’s protocols, processes, and expectations for collecting Indigenous Knowledge and 
for meeting with Elders and Knowledge Holders. Remember, it is good practice to compensate Elders/
Knowledge Holders for their time and knowledge. This may include an offering of tobacco, Honorarium, a gift, 
or your community may have a different process in place for providing compensation. 
Storing Indigenous Knowledge: consider storing your Indigenous Knowledge separately from other data 
types, in a more secure capacity with enhanced privacy settings and confidentiality measures.
Data-Sharing: collecting Indigenous Knowledge may require the development of a data-sharing 
agreement, particularly if you are collaborating with an external party. A data-sharing agreement sets out 
the community’s expectations around if and how Indigenous Knowledge can be shared or interpreted by 
individuals/organizations outside the community. The objective of a data sharing agreement is to provide the 
community with complete control over their knowledge, whether or not it can be shared, and how it can and 
cannot be used. It is important to determine who within the community/organization has authority to make 
decisions about data sharing and to develop a data-sharing agreement that outlines clear guidelines and 
expectations (Indigenous Guardians Toolkit, 2016). The Elders and Knowledge Holders with whom you speak 
may be able to provide guidance on whether or not the knowledge they are sharing can be shared. For more 
information, templates, and resources related to developing a data-sharing agreement, refer to:

Integrating Climate Change into Land-Use Planning, Comprehensive 
Community Planning, and Emergency Management Planning
It is important to ensure that climate change is considered and incorporated into any comprehensive 
community planning, land use planning, and/or emergency management planning process. Adaptation 
planning can and should be integrated into routine planning processes, rather than being undertaken in 
parallel. Land-use planning, comprehensive community planning, and emergency management planning 
provide an opportunity to integrate adaptation planning and considerations. 
A comprehensive community plan (CCP) is a broad-scale planning approach with high-level land use 
information. “Comprehensive Community Planning…engages community members in planning and 
implementing the long-term vision for their community…CCP is a community-based, community-driven 
planning process with meaningful membership involvement throughout. Together, the community 
addresses…economic development, social development, environmental management, culture and language, 
and governance” (First Nations in BC Knowledge Network, 2019).
HELPFUL HINT  |  There are various tools and resources that can be used to support 
Indigenous communities in the development and implementation of a comprehensive 
community plan: 
•	 CIER has developed a suite of tools and resources that can be used for comprehensive community 
planning, available here http://www.yourcier.org/comprehensive-community-planning-
training-program-materials.html.
•	 Indigenous Services Canada and Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada 
in partnership with First Nations developed the CCP Handbook: Comprehensive Community 
Planning for First Nations in British Columbia, available here (https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1
100100021966/1100100021970). For more information about CCP and funding sources, click  
https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100021901/1100100021902.
A land use plan is smaller in scale with more detailed information. Typically, a community plan is developed 
first to establish an overarching vision, which then supports a land use plan. Land use planning includes 
allocating land, community resources, facilities, and services with the goal of maintaining and/or improving 
the environmental, economic, and social conditions of the community (NALMA, 2017).
HELPFUL HINT  |  The National Aboriginal Land Managers Association (NALMA) Land Use 
Planning (LUP) Unit conducts outreach activities, provides direct technical training, 
support services and capacity building opportunities to assist First Nations in the 
development of a Land Use Plan. They have also developed a Community Land Use 
Planning Toolkit as a practical aid for First Nations’ to use in developing a Land Use Plan for their 
community. Visit NALMA (https://nalma.ca/survey-and-land-use-planning) for more information.
An emergency management plan is a plan that outlines a course of action for mitigating the damage caused 
by a potential event or impact that could endanger the community (e.g. forest fire or flood) (Search Disaster 
Recover, 2020). An emergency management plan identifies potential emergency situations as well as an 
appropriate response for each situation (Search Disaster Recover, 2020). Typically, a plan includes measures 
to ensure the safety of individuals/community members, and to the extent possible, measures to protect 
infrastructure/facilities and property (Search Disaster Recover, 2020). An emergency management plan 
should include guidelines to help assess how severe the situation is, as well as steps that can be taken to 
mitigate or address the problem (e.g. contacting the fire department in the event of a fire) (Search Disaster 
Recover, 2020).

Considering future climate conditions in comprehensive community planning, land use planning, and/or 
emergency management planning will help strengthen the adaptive capacity of your community and help 
minimize the impacts of climate change and climate-related risks. Doing so may have added benefits, such 
as realizing the ability to introduce agricultural techniques and certain plants and foods that otherwise would 
not be feasible under current climate conditions (proactive adaptation). 
Community Story:  
Moose Cree First Nation
Who: Moose Cree First Nation
•	 The Moose Cree First Nation Climate Adaptation Plan was developed by a 
multi-disciplinary project team comprised of Moose Cree First Nation staff and 
consultants specializing in climate change adaptation, northern planning, and 
infrastructure resiliency (Stantec, 2019). 
Where: Moose Cree First Nation Traditional Territory, Moose Factory, Ontario
•	 The community of Moose Factory (population of 2,500) is located at the south-west end of Moose 
Factory Island on the Moose River, approximately 20 kilometers from James Bay in the Ontario 
Hudson Bay Lowlands (Stantec, 2019). 
Why: background/context – what issue or challenge initiated the planning 
process?
Northern communities are at the front lines of climate change, they are experiencing the most 
significant warming seen in Canada. For example, seasonal ice cover has decreased across Canada 
due to later ice formation in the fall and earlier spring breakup (Bush and Lemmen, 2019). The 
community of Moose Factory, like many communities across Canada, is observing first- hand the 
effects of climate change (Stantec, 2019). 
Between 1938 and 2010, the average annual temperature in Northern Ontario increased by 1.0°C and 
total annual precipitation decreased by 83 mm (OCCIAR, 2010). By the 2080’s, the Hudson Bay Basin 
is projected to experience the highest rate of warming within Ontario, with temperatures between 
2.6 to 10.3°C higher than 1971-2000 temperatures (McDermid et al., 2015). In addition, the James Bay 
coastal area is projected to experience the greatest increase in precipitation in Ontario (Stantec, 2019).
Increased temperatures and variable precipitation will lead to decreased sea-ice, thawing permafrost, 
changes in water flow, changes in sea-level, and increased storms. This in turn will have impacts on 
the cultural, socioeconomic, natural, and built systems in Moose Factory (Stantec, 2019). 
To increase resiliency to future changes, this Climate Adaptation Plan has identified specific actions 
that the Moose Cree First Nation and the broader community can take to respond to climate-related 
uncertainty, and make the community more resilient and self-sufficient (Stantec, 2019).
What: what adaptation planning process did the community undertake?
Goal: Moose Cree First Nation’s Climate Adaptation Plan supports the community’s goals of 
strengthening capacity and building awareness about climate change amongst community-
members, Band Council, and staff, in order to provide an understanding of the importance of climate 
adaptation (Stantec, 2019).

12      Climate Change Adaptation Planning Guidebooks for Indigenous Communities
The project team worked with the community to document the impacts of climate change, assess 
the current risks, and develop a community-based adaptation plan to help the community adapt 
to future climate change events. This work will inform the development of adaptation measures for 
the community to reduce the impacts of climate change identified to be causing the highest risk 
(Stantec, 2019).
Phase I
During Phase 1 of the project, an Impact and Risk Assessment was completed to understand the 
observed climate change and potential impacts, risk, and opportunities (Stantec, 2019). 
During this phase, surveys and interviews were conducted in the community, and a climate 
change related exercise was completed at the youth centre. The surveys included questions about 
community values, climate change, impacts, risks and opportunities; 130 surveys were completed. 
Informational interviews were conducted with elders, youth and key stakeholders in the community 
(Stantec, 2019).
Surveys, interviews, and outreach occurred over a 2-day community engagement session. Day 1 of 
the engagement session focused on identifying values, impacts, and risks of climate change. On day 
2, community members were asked to confirm and prioritize the values, impacts, and risks gathered 
the previous day (Stantec, 2019).
Through this process, Moose Cree First Nation community members shared observations about 
both direct and indirect changes to the weather in Moose Factory and in their homelands. Many 
community members noticed a warming trend, with warmer longer summers and shorter warmer 
winters, later falls and earlier springs. Community members also noted more variability and more 
intense storms (Stantec, 2019). 
Using this approach, Moose Cree First Nation was able to incorporate Indigenous Knowledge (IK) 
into the planning process, as a result of the survey and interview processes outlined above. Moose 
Cree First Nation was able to capture and incorporate important insights into the planning process 
by distributing a survey to its membership and by conducting interviews with several demographic 
groups, including both youth and Elders. Interviews were conducted at various focus group sessions 
and meetings, as well as at the Annual General Assembly. Additional one on one interviews were also 
conducted with senior staff at Moose Cree.
Phase II
During phase 2 of the project, the information that was collected during phase 1 of the project was 
shared back with the community to confirm the accuracy of the information and identify potential 
actions needed to help the community adapt to climate change. Input for phase 2 was received 
through in-person conversations (by setting up a booth at a community event) and using a survey, 
which was completed by 50 community members (Stantec, 2019).
Key Outputs from the Adaptation Planning Process
Based on the input from Moose Cree First Nation staff and community members, and best practices 
identified from other similar communities, the project team developed 19 climate adaptation actions 
for the community. These actions were reviewed by Moose Cree First Nation staff from various 
departments and focused on helping prepare the community for the impacts associated with a 
changing climate (Stantec, 2019).

Next Steps in the Adaptation Planning Process
Moose Cree First Nation’s Climate Adaptation Plan is only the first step towards preparing for climate 
change. A project champion and Climate Action Committee are needed to implement the plan. The 
Committee will need to begin work on the highest priority actions and determine what is feasible, 
identify potential partners, set out budgets and secure funding (Stantec, 2019).

Key Considerations
•	 What are key considerations that made developing the plan (phase 1 and 2) a success?
	‐ Being adaptable in the approach you use to engage, share information with, and solicit feedback 
from community members. MCFN accomplished this by taking their climate adaptation 
planning efforts to the people! They set-up a table, provided information, talked to members, and 
asked for input and ideas at the Community Complex Building. The Complex is the hub of the 
MCFN community and includes many of the services people use daily, such as the post office, 
restaurant, main grocery store, pharmacy, and main administration building for MCFN. Using 
this approach provided an opportunity for community members to participate in the project 
by sharing their stories and knowledge. This approach and the information and ideas that were 
shared helped to shape the majority of the MCFN Climate Adaptation Plan.
•	 What would be helpful for other communities to know and remember?
	‐ Consider offering incentives to encourage community members to participate in the climate 
adaptation planning process. For example, MCFN provided gift cards, a BBQ, and a chainsaw 
as prizes, to encourage community members to participate in their surveys and to talk to the 
project team about the project. 
	‐ To engage with the youth, the project team brought pizza to the Youth Centre, where they asked 
youth to share what they felt is most important for climate change and climate adaptation.
	‐ Prizes and food can often help bring people in!
In order to ensure that the next steps in Moose Cree First Nation’s adaptation planning process are 
successful, the following next steps have been identified:
	‐ The community and leadership must remain engaged;  
	‐ Partnerships must be formed between other local and regional governments and organizations; 
and  
	‐ Moose Cree First Nation’s Climate Adaptation Plan should be reviewed and updated to reflect 
work completed and changing community needs (Stantec, 2019).

Section 3: What to Consider When Choosing  
a Climate Change Planning Resource
There are several factors to consider when choosing the best resource to help you with climate change 
adaptation planning. Taking a systematic approach to selecting a resource, such as the six Climate Change 
Adaptation Planning Guidebooks for Indigenous Communities, can make the decision-making process more 
effective and more straightforward.  We suggest that project teams within Indigenous communities work 
through the process described below when selecting resources and/or an adaptation approach most relevant 
to their needs. There are no right or wrong answers to the questions posed below. At the end of this process, 
you will end up with a list of considerations and suggestions that could be helpful to your climate change 
adaptation planning process and outcomes. 
Decision-Making Framework
Before choosing specific tools/resources to assist with your planning process, have your project team answer 
the following questions, presented in figure 3, related to each of the six planning steps described in the 
Guidebooks for Climate Change Adaptation Planning for First Nations.  The considerations, and answers, to 
these five questions can be general in nature. However, the more specific and measurable they are, the easier 
it is to identify resources to meet your climate adaptation planning goals. 
FIGURE 3 (below) summarizes five categories of factors to consider when choosing a climate change planning 
resource.

16      Climate Change Adaptation Planning Guidebooks for Indigenous Communities
1. Characterize Your Planning Questions
When deciding which resource(s) to use, you should begin by considering the goals of the planning process in 
which you are engaged.  Consider the primary climate-related issues facing your community (i.e. emergency 
response, health concerns, protection of critical habitat) and make a detailed list with explanations as to why 
they are a concern. If possible, prioritize the seriousness of each issue.
Considerations:
1.	
What geographic scale(s) are you concerned with (e.g. regional, community, reserve, traditional 
territory, riverbank, etc.)?
2.	
What issues does my community want to address? At what scale?
3.	
What temporal scales are you concerned with (e.g. do you need to assess immediate or long-
term impacts, or both)?
4.	
Do you need to understand the interactions of multiple stressors (e.g. climate change and food 
security, laws, policies, etc.)?
2. Identify the Required Resource Function or Output 
Once you have defined the climate-related risks you want to address through your adaptation planning 
process, it is then useful to consider what you want to achieve through the use of a resource or tool. You 
should think about the general function or final output you want the resource to produce, and where in the 
planning process you will use the tool. Recall Section 2 provides a general overview, and the six Guidebooks 
for Climate Change Adaptation Planning for First Nations guide you through the six-step climate change 
adaptation planning process.  The same resource may be useful at different stages in a planning process (i.e. 
GIS for risk assessment and identifying solutions), while some parts of the planning process may benefit from 
multiple resource and tools.  Refer to Section 5 for an overview of resources and the planning stage(s) they 
correspond to.
Considerations:
What function or output (e.g. a detailed map) do we need to accomplish and which resource will 
allow me to do so? For example, do you need resources to help with any of the following functions: 
•	 Community engagement 
•	 Decision-making support 
•	 Scoping 
•	 Scenario Planning 
•	 Risk assessment 
3. Research Available Tools and Resources 
Read about the available resources and use an online database(s)  (refer to Section 5 for more detailed 
information) to see if any resources/tools seem to provide the functionality your process requires as well as the 
outputs/results that will address your planning questions.  Projects will often need to compare the costs and 
benefits of using existing tools that are not an exact match with the costs and benefits of not using any tools 
or developing their own custom tools. 
Note: some tools may require a certain level of technical experience and/or external support to use 
the tools and/or analyze the data. Specific support might be required to gather extremely coarse data, 
interpret spreadsheets, use hydraulic modeling software, or engineering and operations knowledge of the 
infrastructure system.
Guidance Book  |  Resources for Winter Roads, Wildfires, Flooding, & Coastal Erosion      17 
Considerations:
•	 Does the tool work for your specific issues/desired steps of the planning process? 
•	 Does this tool/resource already work for your location? 
•	 Does this tool work at the needed geographic (e.g. regional v. local) and temporal (immediate v. 
long-term) scales?
•	 Can the tool be customized to fit your project needs if it does not already?
4. Assess the Data and Expertise Required 
Once you have identified resources/tools that may suit your needs, figure out the data inputs, information 
and specific expertise needed to use it.  The adaptation planning process may benefit from additional 
information, but make sure you explore the benefits of beginning your planning process with data you know 
already exists and have access to. Planning processes are continuous and ongoing by nature, and plans can 
(and should) be revised multiple times as new information becomes available.
Considerations:
•	 What data will I need? What expertise will I need? 
•	 Are the resources and any required data accessible and in a usable format (e.g. spreadsheets, GIS 
files, etc.)? 
•	 Are topical knowledge and local experts available to provide information for and advice on use of 
the tool(s)? 
•	 How reliable are the available datasets and information? Are they accurate enough? Do they 
include relevant space and time scales? 
•	 How feasible is it to obtain datasets and information that are not currently available? If collecting 
new data and information is being considered, what are the costs and how much time is needed? 
Consider whether Provincial data already exists for the type of data you require. 
5. Assess Available Capacity
In addition to considering the availability of the resource(s) and any required data, consider the availability 
of human and technical resources for using the identified tools/resources and implementing the planning 
approach.  In some cases, there may be accomplished resource/tool users in other Indigenous Nations, 
Canadian government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and/or academia that may be able to 
operate the resource/tool for you and provide you with the results. 
Considerations:
•	 Who is available to support implementation of the planning process and use of the tool/resource? 
What time and financial commitment might be required?
•	 Are there training resources available? Are you able to access them?
•	 Is there adequate time for project staff to obtain specific training to learn how to use the resource/
tool(s) effectively?
18      Climate Change Adaptation Planning Guidebooks for Indigenous Communities
Section 4: Strategies by Impact Areas
Section 4 provides an overview of four climate change impact areas that have been identified as both 
disruptive and costly to communities. In order to help alleviate some of these impacts, adaptation efforts 
are often coordinated through joint efforts between local, provincial, Indigenous and federal government 
agencies, non-government organizations, and academic institutions. This section provides a brief background 
and detailed climate change adaptation planning resources related to each of the impact areas:
1.	
Loss of Winter Roads;
2.	
Wildfire;
3.	
Inland Flooding; and, 
4.	
Coastal Erosion and Sea-Level Rise.
IMPORTANT  |  People experience climate change impacts differently depending on their 
Social Economic Status (SES), age, parental status, home ownership status, and prior 
health. For some climate impacts, victims may experience anxiety, stress, depression, and 
Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) due to the loss or damage of property, from 
evacuating their homes and communities, or as a result of experiencing the stress and uncertainty of 
the situation.

WINTER ROADS
4.1 Shorter & Unpredictable Winter Road Seasons
Winter roads are often described as “lifelines” because they provide access to isolated regions where 
permanent, all-weather roads are rare or do not exist. In these regions, people rely heavily on winter roads and 
plane transportation for food, supplies and travel. Rising temperatures, caused by climate change, particularly 
rising winter air temperatures, are a growing concern as they cause ice thickness to decrease and winter 
roads to become less safe and reliable. It has been reported that seasonal ice cover has decreased across 
Canada over the last five decades, resulting from later ice formation in the fall and earlier spring breakup 
(Bush and Lemmen, 2019); Elders, hunters, and community members have already begun to observe these 
changes (CIER, 2018). 
Shorter and more unpredictable winter road seasons have had, and are expected to increasingly have, major 
impacts on communities who depend on winter roads to meet their basic needs, to support their economies, 
and for travel.
“…the roads are “lifelines” for regions that depend on use of the roads for 
shipments of supplies including food, fuel and building materials.”
—Sheila North Wilson, Grand Chief of Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak 
CBC News, February 19, 2017
Winter road season ends when ice begins to thaw; however, warmer temperatures compromise their safety 
and condition, causing temporary closures and shipment delays throughout the season (Government of 
Manitoba, 2017). The timeframe during which shipments can be made over winter roads is shortened by 
climate change and forces communities to prioritize the shipments of goods which cannot be flown in, such 
as heavy machinery (CBC News, 2017). Goods that cannot be brought into communities during the winter 
road season must be flown in at greater expense, which drives up the costs of these goods and materials.
Dangerous ice conditions produced by climate change limit the accessibility of certain hunting and fishing 
locations, the availability of valued resources such as plants and medicines, and the ability to travel freely. As 
winter roads become more dangerous to navigate, they become a critical threat to human life and Indigenous 
cultures by disrupting the sharing and practice of Indigenous Knowledge, language, and land-based 
education.
HELPFUL HINT
•	 Sea ice and winter road-monitoring programs can be established within communities, and 
conditions may be broadcast on local radio stations, shared on social media, or posted near 
hazardous areas.
•	 Many measures of ice and winter road conditions can be collected using community-based 
monitoring (CBM) programs. CBM programs are an affordable way to collect important 
environmental data, while promoting environmental awareness and education in the community.
•	 Communities may access a variety of online resources to obtain helpful monitoring information, 
including interactive maps, a permafrost databank, Indigenous knowledge sites and satellite 
imagery.
•	 Communities may hire contractors, scientists, or consultants to collect data and monitor the 
condition of sea ice and winter roads.
Guidance Book  |  Resources for Winter Roads, Wildfires, Flooding, & Coastal Erosion      21 
Key Considerations & Planning Resources
The following are key considerations that may be helpful for winter road adaptation planning:
•	 Consider what changes might be needed to the type(s) of goods being shipped, if the winter road season 
becomes shorter;
•	 Consider what actions can be taken to reduce the risk of people and goods traveling on winter roads;
•	 Make use of relevant climate information and data (e.g. local ice conditions, ice thickness), as well as maps 
to help inform planning efforts;
•	 Consider the importance of incorporating Indigenous Knowledge into winter road adaptation planning;
•	 Connect with, and learn from, other communities that have undertaken similar planning efforts; and,
•	 Consider winter road usage, jurisdiction, construction, operation, maintenance, and safety when 
undertaking winter road adaptation planning.
A detailed list of winter road planning resources, which account for the above planning considerations, can be 
found in Appendix 2, including: 
•	 Nunavut Climate Change Centre2
•	 Climate Change Adaptation Resource Guide: Nunavut Emergency Planning and Extreme Weather3
•	 SmartICE: Sea-ice Monitoring and Real-Time Information for Coastal Environments
•	 Winter Roads Draft Technical Binder (Ontario Ministry of Transportation and Ministry of Northern 
Development and Mines)
•	 Guidelines for Safe Ice Construction (Northwest Territories Department of Transportation)

Community Story:  
Tłı ̨icho All Season Road
Who: Tłı ̨chǫ Government in partnership with the Government of the Northwest 
Territories (GNWT)
Where: Tłı ̨chǫ Lands, Northwest Territories
Why: background/context – what issue or challenge 
initiated the planning process?
As with most northern communities, Tłı ̨chǫ communities are experiencing significant impacts as a 
result of climate change. Currently, the communities of Whatì, Gamètì, and Wekweètì rely on winter 
road access for transportation and access to supplies and services. However, climate change has had 
a significant impact on the amount of time that the winter roads remain operable each year, in turn, 
affecting the communities that rely on these roads.
What: what adaptation planning process did the communities 
undertake?
Goal: the goal of the project is to replace the southern section of the existing winter road to the 
community of Whatì with an all-season road (GNWT, 2020). The all-season road will be 97km in 
length and consist of a two-lane gravel highway that runs west of Yellowknife to Whatì (GNWT, 2020 
and Tłı ̨chǫ Government, 2020). As a result of the project, the all-season road will provide increased, 
year-round access to the community of Whatì, in addition to increasing winter road access to the 
communities of Gamètì and Wekweètì (GNWT, 2020 and Tłı ̨chǫ Government, 2020). The construction 
of an all-season road will help the communities better adapt to the impacts of climate change in the 
region, as well as decrease the cost of living in the communities and create a number of social and 
economic opportunities (e.g. increased mobility and access to services and increased employment/
training opportunities resulting from construction and maintenance of the road) (GNWT, 2020 and 
Tłı ̨chǫ Government, 2020). 
Phase I:
The Tłı ̨chǫ Government and the GNWT have been studying the idea of developing an all-season 
road since the 1980s (Tłı ̨chǫ Government, 2020) and have developed a detailed report outlining 
how the road will be constructed, as well as the impact that the road will have on the environment 
and the communities (Tłı ̨chǫ Government, 2020). Following the project report, an environmental 
assessment was conducted to better understand the impacts from the construction of the all-
season road, as well as possible measures to mitigate those impacts (Tłı ̨chǫ Government, 2020).  In 
addition to the necessary planning and assessments, the Tłı ̨chǫ Government has also conducted 
community engagement with members of the communities and developed a number of reports 
(e.g. Socio-Economic Report, Mitigation Commitments, Traditional Knowledge Report) to ensure that 
the communities, community knowledge, priorities, and concerns are taken into account with the 
construction of the all-season road (Tłı ̨chǫ Government, 2020).

WILDFIRE
4.2 Wildfire
Each year an average of 20 communities and 70,000 people 
are affected by wildfires in Canada (Natural Resources Canada, 
2017) and 80% of Indigenous Nations are located in forested 
regions that are at risk to wildland fire (FireSmart, 2018). The 
number of people affected by wildfires is expected to grow as 
climate change progresses (Natural Resources Canada, 2017). 
Climate change may increase the temperature and intensity of 
wildfires, and forest fire management may become increasingly 
challenging as the climate changes (Wotton et al, 2017). 
Forest fire-impacted communities face threats to human health, 
wildlife habitat, infrastructure, and culture. Even if a forest fire 
poses no direct threat to community lands and infrastructure, 
drifting smoke from distant fires may threaten the health 
of vulnerable community members, making community 
evacuation necessary. Wildfires may also compromise cultural 
practices and the wellbeing of Indigenous community 
members. For example, loss of plants and wildlife can limit 
traditional practices such as hunting, trapping, gathering, use 
of traditional medicines, and performance of ceremonies. In 
the most severe situations, when lives are lost due to wildfires, 
valuable teachings, knowledge, and wisdom may be lost too. 
Throughout the past century, greater fire prevention efforts have been made to protect wildlife, people, and 
infrastructure. For example, controlled fires were a common practice among Indigenous people, typically in 
the springtime to allow for new plant growth, or for herding or hunting (Partners in Protection, 2003). Today, 
prescribed burns are increasingly being used as an adaptation strategy to better mitigate the impacts of 
natural wildfires. See the “Community Story: First Nations Emergency Services Society of British Columbia” at 
the end of this section for more information and examples of communities that are developing community-
based burn management plans.
Similarly, over the last two decades, there has been growing support for inclusion of Indigenous people, 
Indigenous Knowledge, and traditional practices in forest management. Presently, there are greater efforts 
being made to record and preserve Indigenous Knowledge, both within Indigenous and non-Indigenous 
communities. When this trend first emerged, the term “Aboriginal forestry” was used to describe the 
participation of Indigenous people as stakeholders, environmentalists, or decision-makers in forest 
management. The term has also been used to refer to the integration of Indigenous Knowledge, practices 
and techniques, and Indigenous rights and values.
HELPFUL HINT
•	 Installing or improving fire prevention programs, emergency response strategies, and 
adaptation plans is a critical safety measure for communities, and potential long-term savings can 
offset the costs of implementing them.
•	 A community can greatly increase its capacity to respond to a forest fire emergency by 
understanding local topography and fire behaviour, evaluating infrastructure-related risks, 
implementing best fire prevention practices, and developing an emergency response plan.
•	 A well-prepared community will regularly consult information sources and available data (e.g. 
Canadian Wildland Fire Information System), and ensure its members are familiar with emergency 
protocols.
Interface Fires: A fire within an 
area that has the potential to 
ignite buildings, homes, wildlands, 
or vegetation, simultaneously, is 
called an interface fire (Partners in 
Protection, 2003, p.2). An interface 
fire can ignite within a building or 
residence and spread to nearby 
forests, or spread from burning 
vegetation to ignite nearby 
infrastructure. The financial costs 
of interface fires arise from the 
loss of, or damage to, homes, 
buildings and infrastructure, 
business interruptions, 
environmental recovery, fire 
suppression, and evacuation.

Key Considerations & Planning Resources
The following are key considerations that may be helpful for forest fire adaptation planning:
•	 Develop a wildfire checklist, fire prevention checklist, fire suppression checklist, and community outreach 
materials to support fire-related preventative planning;
•	 Consider completing a wildfire hazard assessment to identify high risk fire sites; and,
•	 If possible, consider using an updated wildfire situation map to identify active fires in and around your 
region, to help inform your planning efforts.
Refer to Appendix 3 for a detailed overview of relevant forest fire planning resources and videos, which take 
into account the above planning considerations, including:

Community Story:  
First Nations Emergency Services Society of British Columbia
Who: First Nations Emergency Services Society (FNESS)
First Nations Emergency Services Society (FNESS) is a First Nation-directed 
non-profit organization established in 1986 (Eustache, 2019). FNESS serves First 
Nations in developing and sustaining safer and healthier communities through 
(FNESS, 2019):
•	 Emergency planning, training, response and recovery;
•	 Fire training, education and prevention;
•	 Forest fuel and wildfire management; 
•	 Leadership and collaborative relationships; and
•	 Critical incidence stress management.
FNESS worked with three First Nation communities to co-develop customized community-based 
burn management plans:
1.	
Xwisten (Bridge River) Indian Band
2.	
Shackan Indian Band
3.	
Yunesit’in Government (one of six communities that comprise the Tsilhqot’in Nation)
Where: 
•	 FNESS has offices in Kamloops and Vancouver, BC
•	 Xwisten (Bridge River) Indian Band: is 1 of 11 bands that are within the St’at’imc Traditional Territory, 
near Lillooet, BC. Includes 4,023 hectares distributed over 3 reserves (Eustache, 2019). Xwisten 
(Bridge River) Indian Band has 464 members, 200 of whom live on-reserve (Eustache, 2019)
•	 Shackan Indian Band: is 1 of 5 bands in the Nicola Valley that comprise the Scw’exmx within the 
Nlaka’pamux Traditional Territory, 40 km west of Merritt, BC. Includes 3,875 hectares distributed 
over 3 reserves (Eustache, 2019). Shackan Indian Band has 133 members, 69 of whom live on-reserve 
(Eustache, 2019).
•	 Yunesit’in Government: is 1 of 6 bands within the Tsilhqot’in National Government’s Traditional 
Territory, 105km west of Williams Lake, BC. Yunesit’in includes 486 members, 232 of whom live on-
reserve (Eustache, 2019).
Why: background/context – what issue or challenge initiated the planning 
process?
Uncertainty with climate change has led to an increased risk of wildfire and associated threats to 
nearby communities (Eustache, 2019). As such, there is a growing need to identify and implement 
wildfire management practices that can achieve management objectives across various potential 
climate futures (Eustache, 2019).
One of the key forest fuel management strategies for mitigating climate change related extreme 
weather events, such as wildfires, is the development of a coordinated community-based burn plan 
(Eustache, 2019). A community-based burn plan helps to decrease the risk of fire hazard and increase 
available habitat for desirable plants and animals (Eustache, 2019).
What: what adaptation planning process did FNESS and the communities 
undertake?
Goal: FNESS worked with Xwisten (Bridge River) Indian Band, Shackan Indian Band, and the 
Yunesit’in Government to explore and mitigate climate change concerns, including wildfires and 
drought (FNESS, 2019).

The objectives of the project were to (FNESS, 2019): 
1.	
Conduct and analyze qualitative interviews with community members; and
2.	
Co-develop a community-based burn management plan customized for the community. 
The intention is for the work to revitalize traditional burning practices. In the past, community 
members burned areas in order to enhance berry-production and foraging for deer, medicine plants, 
etc., however, the majority of the burning carried out today is for hazard reduction, a practice that has 
reduced significantly over the past 60 years (FNESS, 2019).
Phase I - Conduct Qualitative Interviews with Community Members
FNESS met with each community’s Band Council and designated staff to review the project 
concept, objectives, and timeline (Eustache, 2019). An interview guide was developed and qualitative 
interviews were conducted with community members who have cultural burning knowledge and 
experience (FNESS, 2019). The interviews were semi-structured and open-ended (Eustache, 2019). The 
interview transcripts/responses were then analyzed (thematic analysis) to look for similarities and 
patterns in locations where communities burned in the past and/or present, and when and how they 
conducted the burn, as well as for what reason(s) (FNESS, 2019).
Phase II - Co-develop a Community-Based Burn Management Plan
Using information from the interviews and analysis, custom community-based burn plans were 
developed for each community (FNESS, 2019). The burn plans aim to combine Western science with 
Indigenous cultural knowledge and values, as well as any concerns identified during the interview 
process (e.g. berry producing areas, deer range, and community protection) (Eustache, 2019). 
Culturally relevant values are a key component of the final burn plans developed for each community 
(FNESS, 2019).
The community-based burn plans are designed as a template that can be used yearly and include 
plans for burning areas on reserve as well as on adjacent crown land (FNESS, 2019). The burn plans 
outline specific goals, objectives, and climate change considerations, and include information on 
regulatory processes, area selection, partnerships, resource requirements, and current burning 
practices, including methods used by industry and government (Eustache, 2019).
Key Outputs from the Adaptation Planning Process:
•	 Increased capacity and resources to plan for and adapt to the effects of climate change (Eustache, 
2019)
•	 Development of strategies that maintain or enhance the cultural attributes of First Nation 
communities (Eustache, 2019)
•	 Ability to inform policy-makers, wildfire management specialists, crew leaders, land planners, and 
program managers (Eustache, 2019)
Implementation of the Community-Based Burn Management Plans
The following process was used to implement the community-based burn management plans in 
Xwisten (Bridge River) Indian Band and Shackan Indian Band:
•	 Community interviews, transcription, and analysis completed (Eustache, 2019)
•	 Culturally relevant values were identified for each community (Eustache, 2019)
•	 Project and findings were presented to community members (Eustache, 2019) 
•	 Engaged with BC Wildfire Service for review, support, and for coordination assistance with 
controlled burns (Eustache, 2019)
•	 Conducted spring burns for Xwisten (Bridge River) and Shackan Indian Bands (Eustache, 2019)
•	 Photo and video documentation of cultural burning revitalization narratives and community burns 
at Xwisten (Bridge River) and Shackan Indian Bands was completed (Eustache, 2019) – see ‘Learn 
More’ below to view the videos.

Key Considerations
•	 Local Knowledge – it is important to listen to the community and learn about their objectives and
priorities. For example, conducting community engagement with Elders and Knowledge Keepers,
particularly those who have experience with prescribed burns, is helpful for incorporating local
knowledge on previous burning practices (e.g. where, when, and how burns have been conducted
in the past) when developing a burn management plan.
•	 Technical Knowledge/Expertise – it is critical to work closely with someone who has a strong
background in fire behaviour and has participated in prescribed burning, in order to ensure that
the site, conditions, and timeline are appropriate and that the correct technical data is identified
and collected.
•	 Engage Appropriate Departments and Agencies in the Process – it is important to consider,
identify, and engage with all relevant agencies and departments when conducting a prescribed
burn to ensure that all necessary parties are involved in the process, and safety considerations and
regulations are adhered to.
•	 Community Champion – a champion that is invested and interested in the process is invaluable for
helping to support the work and development of the community-based burn management plan.

4.3
INLAND FLOODING
4.3 Inland Flooding
Climate change has increased hazards like inland flooding, which occurs near rivers and/or results from 
poor drainage and heavy rains. Indigenous communities are often located in remote or rural areas and/or on 
floodplains, resulting in decreased access to health services, including emergency and counseling services. 
Furthermore, emergency response can be compromised or challenges when roads are affected by flooding 
(i.e. it may not be possible for emergency responders to get into the community if the roads are flooded). 
Climate change is expected to exacerbate the severity of flooding, which in turn will worsen the impact of 
floods on buildings and housing (Khaliq and Attar, 2017). In these ways, floods can have considerable tolls on 
Indigenous peoples, cultures, and ways of living.
There are two types of inland floods – fluvial and pluvial flooding. Fluvial floods occur in areas along rivers 
(riverine floods), lakes, and other bodies of water; the areas with a higher risk of flooding are often referred to 
as “flood plains.” Fluvial floods tend to be more frequent in the spring season as they may result from rainfall, 
snow and ice melt, ice jams, breached dams (or intentional release), and primarily present a risk in areas with 
human settlement (Maddox, 2014). Fortunately, most fluvial floods are characterized by slow water-level rise 
which allows more time for effective warning and evacuations. Pluvial floods can be caused by heavy rainfall, 
slow drainage systems, and run-off water that was not absorbed fully on higher ground levels (Tamsin Lyle, 
personal communication, 2018).  Less predictable, faster-flowing floods are called flash floods and can fit 
within both categories of inland floods. Climate change is expected to increase flooding events and extreme 
weather variability, which can also increase the likelihood of flash flooding. 
Understanding both flood hazards (location, extent of flooding, and how often) as well as flood vulnerability 
of community members and infrastructure, is essential for creating and implementing an effective flood risk 
management plan in order to reduce flooding impacts.
Please note: Changes in precipitation frequency and intensity, along with snow cover, snowmelt, and soil 
moisture, will all be relevant for future changes in flood risks. Unfortunately, the ability of climate change 
models to project future changes in one of these components may not be sufficient to confidently project 
changes in flood occurrence.
HELPFUL HINT
  
•	 Community should develop an emergency response plan and identify a location for community 
members to go in a flood emergency.  Hosting a community meeting is an effective way to discuss 
emergency preparation and planning. You can also find out how community members can feel 
safe and if they know what to do in the event of a flood or evacuation through community surveys. 
•	 Community members should have access to information and services in the event of a flood (e.g. 
where to seek medical services, prescription medicines, food hampers, etc.). 
•	 Community members should be encouraged to prepare emergency evacuation kits and prepare 
for lengthy house confinement. Emergency kits should include items such as cash, bottled 
water, non-perishable food, a can opener, first aid supplies, a radio, clothing, blankets, toiletries, 
medications, a flashlight and batteries, keys, and toys for children (FLASH, 2018).
•	 Important documents, such as insurance papers, medical records, financial documents, and 
identification cards, as well as sentimental items such as photos, should be kept in water and 
fireproof containers (FLASH, 2018).
•	 A community flood response plan should include contact information for emergency responders, 
community leadership, and perhaps a link to a common community web resource such as a social 
media check-in page that can be used to connect community members during a flood event. 
•	 Communities can use multiple tools and measures to strengthen their response to flood risks. 
For example, a community strategy may include flood mapping, installing flood defense measures 
(barriers, dykes, floodways, etc.), spatial planning, emergency preparedness and response plans, 
community infrastructure mitigation and other smaller-scale (household) measures.
Guidance Book  |  Resources for Winter Roads, Wildfires, Flooding, & Coastal Erosion      31 
Key Considerations & Planning Resources
The following are key considerations that may be helpful for inland flooding adaptation planning:
•	 Become familiar with floods, flood hazards, and relevant information, including major water systems, in your 
region. Develop a flood map to help identify the boundaries of a potential flood event and better inform 
decision-making and preventative planning efforts;
•	 Identify flood hazard areas to help inform the development of your flood adaptation plan, as well as any 
planned/future infrastructure development. For example, ensure that any new developments and critical 
infrastructure (e.g. water/wastewater systems) are built a safe distance from any projected flood zone and 
consider diking and diversion strategies to aid with flood impact protection;
•	 Consider the fact that floodplains may change in both size and location; maintaining updated information 
can ensure the community is better equipped to deal with a flood hazard;
•	 Drainage assessments, hydrologic modeling (i.e. quantity of water), and/or hydraulic modeling (i.e. physical 
properties of water, such as flow of water from one point to another) provides information that may be 
helpful for developing and maintaining your flood adaptation plan4; and,
•	 Consider what types of support may be required to assist the community in the aftermath of a flood event. 
This should include both physical damage and social/mental impacts.
Refer to Appendix 4 for a detailed overview of inland flooding planning resources, which account for the 
above planning considerations, including:
•	 CANWET – Canadian Watershed Evaluation Tool 
•	 Flood Hazard Map Application 
•	 Federal Flood Mapping Guidelines Series
•	 Tools for Climate Change Vulnerability Assessments for Watersheds 
•	 FloodSmart Canada

Community Story:  
Reducing Flood Risk in Yellow Quill First Nation
Who: Yellow Quill First Nation
Where: Yellow Quill First Nation, a Saulteaux community located on Treaty 4 
Territory, Saskatchewan
Why: background/context – what issue or challenge 
initiated the planning process?
Yellow Quill First Nation has experienced many climate change impacts over the years, including 
flooding, forest fires, and extreme weather events (Indigenous Climate Hub, 2020). In order to 
mitigate some of these impacts, the community, in partnership with the University of Saskatchewan, 
decided to create a plan to better prepare for increased flood risks in the future (Indigenous Climate 
Hub, 2020).
4	 Note: river floodplain mapping and storm drainage assessments require detailed modeling with extensive map and data inputs and water resources 
engineering expertise (Khaliq and Attar, 2017). Historical streamflow and precipitation data are commonly used for flood hazard mapping since future 
scenarios for precipitation are highly uncertain and not yet suitable for watershed modeling scales; Research is ongoing in this area (Khaliq and Attar, 
2017).

What: what adaptation planning process did the community undertake?
Goal: The goal of the project was to understand how the community may be susceptible to the 
impact of flooding and to use this information to inform decision-making and prepare for climate-
related challenges in a manner that respects community-held knowledge/experiences while also 
making use of hydrological modeling science (Indigenous Climate Hub, 2020).
Phase I
To begin, the community examined where/how they are vulnerable to increased flood events 
resulting from climate change (Indigenous Climate Hub, 2020). They conducted LiDAR (Light 
Detection and Ranging) sensing for the watershed in order to capture detailed information about the 
land surrounding the reserve (Indigenous Climate Hub, 2020). Using this information, University of 
Saskatchewan computer modelers were able to create risk maps and use modeling to predict future 
flooding (Indigenous Climate Hub, 2020). The maps that were created help illustrate where the water 
is likely to go if a flooding event were to occur (Indigenous Climate Hub, 2020).
Phase II
Next, community members – from youth to Elders - came together to discuss flooding. A variety of 
techniques were used to share information about flooding and collect feedback from the community, 
including meetings, interviews, sharing circles, drawings, photos, community tours, and poster 
sessions (Indigenous Climate Hub, 2020). Using the data that was collected, the project coordinators 
and university researchers analyzed the data that was provided during the community sessions and 
created posters and presentations that could be shared back to community members (and other 
researchers) (Indigenous Climate Hub, 2020).
Phase III
Following the community outreach, three summer students from the community were hired to 
review the community’s emergency management planning documents and speak with emergency 
personnel (e.g. firefighters, healthcare workers, etc.). From this, they compiled everyone’s ideas on 
how best to improve the community’s emergency plan in the event of a flood (Indigenous Climate 
Hub, 2020). 
Lastly, engineers were invited to the community to conduct an infrastructure assessment to identify 
important infrastructure that is at risk from ongoing flooding (Indigenous Climate Hub, 2020).
Through this project, the community has been able to build their capacity and learn more about 
climate change, flooding, and emergency management (Indigenous Climate Hub, 2020).

COASTAL EROSION
4.4 Sea Level Rise and Coastal Erosion
Over the last century, the oceans surrounding Canada 
(Pacific, Atlantic, and Arctic oceans) have, and will continue to, 
experience an increase in ocean temperature, ocean acidity, and 
sea-level rise (Bush and Lemmen, 2019). It is anticipated that sea-
level rise along some of Canada’s coastlines will be higher than 
the predicted global average, resulting in more frequent and 
severe flooding events and coastal erosion (Bush and Lemmen, 
2019). Storm surges (storm floods), which occur when large, 
intense storms approach landfall, are also expected to increase 
with the loss of sea ice (Bush and Lemmen, 2019). Storm surges 
have contributed to more frequent flooding on all of Canada’s 
coasts. Coastal flooding occurs when areas that are not typically 
wet are inundated (flooded) as a result of meteorological 
conditions that cause coastal water levels to rise (e.g. storm 
surge, wind and wave set-up) (Maddox, 2014). This can cause 
significant damage to infrastructure and ecosystems, prompt 
emergency evacuations5, and contribute to coastal erosion and 
the permanent loss of land.
Coastal erosion occurs when natural environmental processes 
(e.g. waves, winds, and currents) and human activities (e.g. 
construction of coastal structures and mining) cause a loss of 
coastal land (Stocker et al., 2013). Coastal erosion may be rapid 
or gradual, and its rate is affected by both natural and human-
induced climate change (Stocker et al., 2013). Coastal erosion 
becomes hazardous when society fails to adapt to its effects on 
people and infrastructure (Stocker et al., 2013). 
While flood events resulting from sea level rise and/or coastal erosion are not always successfully avoided, 
understanding both coastal flood hazards (location, extent of flooding and how often) and erosion hazards 
(location of unstable shorelines and changes over time) as well as the vulnerability of community members 
and infrastructure to these hazards is essential for developing and implementing an effective coastal risk 
management plan.
Communities can use several tools to predict, prepare for, and increase their ability to respond to flood events.  
For example, some communities are exploring the idea of managed retreat – a process where communities, 
buildings, and infrastructure are moved landward and away from a flood zone (Centre for Coastal Resources 
Management, 2019) – as a part of their adaptation planning.
Adaptation planning should account for projected changes in sea level, sea ice, storminess, and any other 
factor that could impact coastal flooding (Bush and Lemmen, 2019). Several tools have been developed to 
address the problem of sea level rise and coastal erosion. Many sea level-monitoring stations have been 
established, a list of which can be found on www.ioc-sealevelmonitoring.org. Regular consultation of 
monitoring databases, or local collection of sea level data, will help coastal communities prepare for flood 
events. The progression of coastal erosion can also be monitored through techniques such as shoreline 
mapping, analysis of historical maps, aerial photographs, beach profiling surveys, remote sensing technology, 
and video analysis (Environmental Technology, 2015). 
Communities can predict the extent of potential flood events and identify vulnerabilities using flood hazard 
maps6 and flood simulations (FLOODSite, 2009; Lemmen et al., 2016). A flood hazard map contains the 
predicted extent of flooding in an area and may include information on flood probability (FLOODSite, 2009). 
Flood hazard maps may also contain information on predicted water depth, velocity, and potential flooding 
consequences (FLOODSite, 2009). Flood simulations can help communities predict vulnerabilities and 
hazards, and measure the potential extent of coastal flooding impacts. 
Developing a greater understanding of flooding impacts and their environmental, social, and economic 
effects can help communities take action to prevent loss of life, manage resources, adapt infrastructure, 
and modify behaviours. While many preventative measures described in the previous section may be used 
as flood mitigation strategies, a well-adapted community also ensures its community members are well-
5	 In 2014, storm surges and flooding prompted evacuations on Canada’s west coast, notably from Vancouver Island. This was one of the worst 
combinations of storm surge and king tide (exceptionally high tides) that the province has seen (CBC, 2014).
6	 Recall: Detailed coastal hazard mapping requires extensive modeling with numerous map and data inputs and ocean modeling and coastal engineering 
expertise. Current and future predicted sea-level rise data, storm-surge data as well as tsunami model data are used with various tools to generate flood 
scenarios, and analyze past coastal flood impacts to help identify and evaluate adaptation options (Robin Bourke, personal communication, 2020).
Coastal Defense Structures 
While coastal defense structures  
(seawalls, bulkheads, and groins), 
are often used to address coastal 
flooding, they may also disrupt 
natural coastal processes, 
speeding erosion and degrading 
valuable coastal habitats. 
Alternative methods, such as sand 
nourishment (the addition of sand 
to beaches) or beach retreat (the 
relocation of infrastructure further 
from the shoreline) represent 
possible alternatives (Lemmen et 
al., 2016).
Guidance Book  |  Resources for Winter Roads, Wildfires, Flooding, & Coastal Erosion      35 
prepared when faced with a flood event. Remember, communities can use multiple tools and measures to 
strengthen their response to flood risks. For example, a community strategy may include flood mapping, 
installing flood defense measures (barriers, dykes, floodways, etc.), spatial planning, emergency preparedness 
and response plans, community infrastructure mitigation and other smaller-scale (household) measures.
Key Considerations & Planning Resources
The following are key considerations that may be helpful for sea-level rise and coastal erosion adaptation 
planning:
•	 Learn about different flood level profiles for your region; this information can be used as a planning tool to 
help minimize the impacts of sea-level rise and coastal flooding;
•	 Make use of existing coastal data and consider conducting a coastal vulnerability assessment to identify 
areas that may be at-risk for flooding or erosion. This information can be used to help mitigate the impacts 
of flooding;
•	 Develop and implement an emergency plan to manage the risk and impact of flooding caused by storm 
surges, high tides, or other weather-related events;
•	 Familiarize yourself with structural recommendations, legislation, and policies to support flood protection 
planning;
•	 Use the information available to you to ensure that new infrastructure is built outside of high risk flood 
zones, and consider relocating existing infrastructure and communities away from areas that may be lost to 
flooding or erosion, to the extent possible; and,
•	 Make use of case studies to learn more about useful, cost effective strategies that other communities are 
using to plan for, and minimize the impacts of, sea-level rise and coastal erosion.

Using Plants to Limit Coastal Erosion in Ekuanitshit
Who: The Ekuanitshit Innu community in partnership with the First Nations of 
Quebec and Labrador Sustainable Development Institute (FNQLSDI) 
Where: Ekuanitshit Innu community (eastern Quebec and Labrador)
Why: background/context – what issue or challenge initiated 
the planning process?
The impacts of climate change, such as increased storm frequency resulting from increased 
temperatures, along with human impacts are contributing to shoreline recession and coastal erosion, 
which in turn has impacts on wildlife, plants, gathering and activity sites, as well as community 
infrastructure (FNQLSDI, 2020). In order to combat shoreline recession and coastal erosion, 
Ekuanitshit and FNQLSDI are implementing a coastal restoration project (Indigenous Climate Hub, 
2020).
What: what adaptation planning process did the community undertake?
Goal: The project is aimed at restoring coastal habitats and erosion along the banks of the St 
Lawrence river in the traditional territory of Nitassinan (Indigenous Climate Hub, 2020).
The coastal restoration project is part of the community’s broader climate change adaptation plan 
and includes several adaptation solutions to limit the impacts of coastal erosion (FNQLSDI, 2020). The 
community has identified the following two adaptation measures for implementation over the short-
term (FNQLSDI, 2020):
1.	
Rehabilitation of natural sites in the coastal environment
2.	
Outreach activities and events to share best practices that can be adopted in coastal areas
Phase I: Rehabilitation of Natural Sites in the Coastal Environment
To implement the first adaptation measure, the community selected priority sites for rehabilitation. 
Updated data, along with the knowledge of the Ekuanitshinnuat - shared through workshops and 
mapping exercises - were used to determine which site to prioritize for rehabilitation (FNQLSDI, 
2020). Once selected, the site was restored using two techniques, revegetation and sand catchers 
(Indigenous Climate Hub, 2020).  Revegetation includes planting native plants so that the roots help 
retain sand and stabilize the riverbank (FNQLSDI, 2020 & Indigenous Climate Hub, 2020). Plants 
with long roots to help with soil stabilization were prioritized. The Innu-Natukuna (meaning Innu 
pharmacy) helped to identify and select native species as well as secondary species to plant along 
the banks with sea limegrass and ammophilia for stabilization. A total of 4,100 square meters was 
revegetated by planting 50,000 sea limegrass and ammophilia plants, as well as culturally significant 
species such as raspberry and juniper which are used in traditional practices (Indigenous Climate 
Hub, 2020).
The second restoration technique, using sand catchers, involves installing snow fences in a zig zag 
pattern which results in an accumulation of sand at the base of a dune that can be used to rebuild 
damaged sand dunes (Indigenous Climate Hub, 2020). Using this approach, 80-meter sand catchers 
were installed to further contribute to the rehabilitation of the selected sites (Indigenous Climate 
Hub, 2020).
Phase II: Community Outreach
To achieve the second adaptation measure, which was to share best practices, an awareness 
campaign was developed in collaboration with youth (FNQLSDI, 2020). The campaign focused 
on climate change and coastal erosion, in order to share and reinforce the knowledge of the 
Ekuanitshinnuat, with regard to coastal erosion and best practices in the coastal environment 
(FNQLSDI, 2020). As part of this outreach and community mobilization, a best practices guide was 
developed (Indigenous Climate Hub, 2020).
Monitoring of the newly restored sites began in the fall of 2019 and community outreach and 
mobilization efforts will continue (Indigenous Climate Hub, 2020).
