Chapter 4. It’s Easy Being Green!
This chapter explores energy and the green options available to consumers. It then explores the
difference between needs and wants, as well as rights and responsibilities so that students
understand and can act on the dire need to explore alternative energy options in their lifetime.
The chapter concludes with students exploring and identifying careers that are greener to
broaden their knowledge and understanding from those traditional professions many aspire to.

Before You Begin: Background Information for Educators
The Future of Careers in Climate Change: The Green Economy & Climate Opportunities
The environmental impacts of climate change have a direct effect on the working world.
Many jobs that rely on ecosystem services, and therefore also on sustainable environmental
management (e.g. farming, fishing, forestry, air and water purification, soil fertilization etc.)
are immediately threatened by climate change as it deteriorates these natural ecosystems
2
and processes. As well, the rising temperatures are increasing the risks and hazards
associated with labour-intensive work. These risks being felt in many sectors of work can be
contrasted with a progressive shift to a green economy in many other sectors around the
world. Green industries have grown exponentially over the past decades, and according to
an InfoDev report in 2014, green industries have evolved from “a niche 1970s
environmental aspiration into a competitive force motivating many of the world’s most
progressive business planners and boardroom strategists”.
According to National Geographic, the top eleven growing green jobs include: urban
growers, water quality technicians, clean car engineers, recyclers, natural scientists
(measuring and monitoring our impacts on the world around us), green builders (including
those using ecologically friendly materials), solar cell technicians, green design
professionals, wave energy production workers, wind energy workers, and biofuel jobs
(increasing, constructing, and producing renewable fuel). In many ways, it is productive and
beneficial for students to conceptualize economic changes in the context of the many
emerging careers and climate opportunities that accompany these changes. Throughout the
upcoming years, there will be an increasing demand for skilled professionals in not only the
green jobs mentioned by National Geographic, but also in sectors like urban planning,
health care, architecture and information technology just to name a few. By educating and
informing students on the subject of green careers, green energy and the green economy,
possibly sparking interest in these fields students will enter the workforce more prepared
and more capable of being successful in an economy and workforce that will likely look very
different from how it does now.
Climate change is a current reality, but the future remains to be determined by the actions
that we take now to stop the impacts from intensifying. The current economic impacts exist
and are a part of a much larger interconnected story involving the environment, health,
cultural dimensions, infrastructure etc. There is an inevitable level of uncertainty that
accompanies any climate forecasting; however, there are concrete adaptation measures
that can help prevent job losses and negative effects on workers and income.
Governments and citizens can contribute to economic protection measures against climate
change by investing in infrastructure, the conservation of treatment water, reforestation,
moving to a new energy future (renewables) and skills development to help displaced
workers transition to relevant, growing professions.
General Introduction To The Inquiries In This Chapter:
This chapter offers 3 different structured and scaffolded inquiries to support It’s Easy Being
Green! Numerous strategies are included in each of the inquiries.  These explorations can be
completed in their entirety as stated, however, because we know inquiry is an organic and fluid
3
process based on student input, educators may wish to take parts of each of the 3 ideas
presented and even adapt, modify or replace what’s suggested to create their own inquiry with
their class.  It is therefore suggested that teachers review the whole chapter first in order to
determine and plan what works best with their particular group of learners.
The following 3 inquiries are connected to curricular concepts as shown in this chart. These
curricular concepts are applicable across Canada.

Tool: Journaling
Encourage students to record their thinking and learning throughout the learning process. The
main reason for developing a journal is for students to then be able to look back and track their
growth and progression with their connection to climate change. Students scaffold their thinking
throughout their learning journey. The entries can be a combination of personal reflections and
assigned reflections. This can be done as illustrations, concept maps or written reflections.
Inquiry 1: Understanding Green Energies - Alternative Energies
Students will explore innovations in alternative energy production by exploring a true story of a
small Danish island that transformed into a model of sustainability. This book will inspire and
motivate readers to learn about renewable energy systems.

Inquiry 2: Green Economy - Needs, Wants, Rights and
Responsibilities
What do children need to survive and live a healthy, happy life? The activities in this inquiry help
students distinguish the difference between the things they want and the things
they need. Students will come to understand that needs such as clean water, education and
protection from abuse are things that all children have a right to. These rights are enshrined in
the United Nations Convention for the Rights of the Child.
As citizens of their classroom, school and community, students will also learn that each right that
protects them comes with an individual responsibility to act. (Global Education Activity Resource

Take Action
A. Provocation
To hook student interest, introduce the provocation to initiate student thinking.
Book
Using literature is a powerful tool to connect learners to an issue or idea. The book(s)
identified here are suggested titles to introduce the concept and spark discussion on
alternative energies.
Book: Energy Island: How One Community Harnessed the Wind
and Changed their World by Allan Drummond is a great place to
begin.
“Hold onto your hats! It's windy on the Danish island of Samsø.
Meet the environmentally friendly people who now proudly call their
home Energy Island. At a time when most countries are producing
ever-increasing amounts of CO2, the rather ordinary citizens of
Samsø have accomplished something extraordinary—in just ten
years they have reduced their carbon emissions by 140% and
become almost completely energy independent. A narrative tale and a science book in one,
this inspiring true story proves that with a little hard work and a big idea, anyone can make a
huge step toward energy conservation” (Allan Drummand, Energy Island, 2015).
Here is a link to a reading of the story.
Check Allan Drummond’s website for many other great selections such as:
1
B. Question Generation
At this point in the inquiry, we want to harness students’ curiosity and build off of
the provocations that have captured their interest by generating meaningful questions to
continue to drive the learning process. This section will outline pathways for question
generation depending on the provocation(s) that your class engaged with.
Use the Think, Puzzle, Explore strategy to aid students in generating ideas and continuing
their inquiry journey.
Example Activity:
There are many new terms introduced in this story. Begin with a word wall to ensure that all
students have access to the new vocabulary.
Create a graffiti board (large butcher block paper on a wall) where students can post their
questions and ideas. Divide the board into 3 sections and label them:
Energy Island:
What do you think you know
about this topic?
What puzzles you about this
topic?
How might you explore what
puzzles you (how might you
find answers)?
C. Knowledge Building
At this stage, students may be ready to engage in a group knowledge building activity. It will
encourage students to open their minds to many alternative ways of thinking about the
provocations and ideas that have been generated thus far in the inquiry process.
Have students complete an Energy Audit either at home or at the school in each of the
classrooms (or both), such as the one provided by Eco Schools Canada. This energy audit
called Switch Off Lights & Devices is a fillable tracking sheet that identifies 3 areas to focus
on: lights, computers & monitors and printers & photocopiers as well as a final column to add
anything else students would like to monitor over a period of time (e.g., blinds closed when
possible, no obstructions over vents). From the information collected, students can move to
action to help promote and increase energy conservation personally and at the school.
Other alternative energies can be explored during this phase of the inquiry.
The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind by William Kamkwamba and Bryan Mealer
The story focuses on a Malawian boy named William (Maxwell Simba), who saves his town
2
from famine by constructing a windmill to provide water and electricity. The Boy Who
Harnessed the Wind is actually based on a remarkable true story, bringing a wider
audience into William Kamkwamba's incredible journey of innovation.
This story is available as a picture book (in a .pdf version), a Young  Adult novel and a film
on Netflix.
Iqbal and His Ingenious Idea: How a Science Project Helps One Family and the Planet
by Elizabeth Suneby, illustrated by Rebecca Green.
It's monsoon season in Bangladesh, which means Iqbal's mother must cook the family's
meals indoors, over an open fire. The smoke from the fire makes breathing difficult for his
mother and baby sister, and it's even making them sick. Hearing them coughing at night
worries Iqbal. So when he learns that his school's upcoming science fair has the theme of
sustainability, Iqbal comes up with the perfect idea for his entry: he'll design a stove that
doesn't produce smoke! With help from his teacher, Iqbal learns all about solar energy
cooking, which uses heat from the sun to cook --- ingenious!
D. Determining Understanding
Use responses to inform and guide the learning process. They can provide insight into which
concepts need clarity, what many students are already well informed about, and a general
direction that many students want to pursue.
At this point in the inquiry you may decide to use a tool such as the Plus Minus Interesting
(PMI) Tool. Students are instructed to write down the positives, negatives and interesting
features of a topic, question or situation, in this case green energy or climate change. Decide
whether to do it in groups, individually or as a whole class approach.
For more information on the PMI strategy, check the strategy bank or check here.
E. Pursuing Learning: Impacts and Green Opportunities
At this stage, students may begin research to pursue some of their questions, or some of the
following activities could be integrated into the process to ensure that students have an
understanding of foundational climate science. The activities listed below will enrich the
understanding of alternative energies.
Have students explore this website individually or in pairs: NASA Climate Kids. On the main
page of this site there are 5 topics: weather & climate, atmosphere, water, energy and plants
& animals so you could choose to assign partners to one of these areas.
3
Using an app such as Notepad on their electronic device, or collectively using an electronic
tool such as Jamboard, record facts they find in their virtual travels that they learned,
intrigued them or found interesting, in preparation for further exploration or in the
consolidation phase of this inquiry when they generate questions for other students.
F. Consolidation
This step is designed to encourage students to integrate and synthesize key ideas. When
students make connections and see relationships within and across lessons, it helps them to
solidify knowledge and deepen their understanding.
Student Created Questions
For this consolidation exercise, students will work in pairs. Each person will generate several
thought-provoking summary questions for their partner. The questions should be based on
the learning from this inquiry and could address their own personal gaps in understanding or
aim to deepen understanding. Each partner will have an opportunity to write full responses to
their questions, and then share their thinking with their partner.
Assessment Idea
Teachers will assess learning at different points throughout the inquiry using multiple
methods. The following assessment provides an alternative evaluation method to standard
quizzes and tests, that can be used after consolidation or at any point in the lesson to check
for understanding.
Use the 5-3-1 technique to assess their level of understanding to this point.
Example Activity:
Pose a question about alternative energies that arose from this inquiry. Students work
individually to generate 5 facts they’ve learned about the topic. Then, in pairs students work
together to choose the best 3 answers from the 10 facts their combined list has generated.
Finally, students join with another pair and collectively choose the best answer to the
question from their combined lists.
Take Action
Allowing time for students to take action is an essential part of the learning
process on climate change, as it empowers students and eases their eco
anxiety.  You might introduce the idea of students taking action by sharing the
following YouTube “Climate Change Song”:
If they need some ideas of simple and immediate measures they can implement you can
share this document from Direct Energy.  While it is written for parents, students can get the
4
idea of something that would be attainable for themselves - or to share with their families!
Ideas to Think Green
Ideas for Taking Action:
●
Model green behaviour - use a reusable water bottle, actively recycle, compost, bring
your bags to the grocer, bring your mug to the coffee shop, repair things that need
mending, buy second-hand when applicable, pack a litterless lunch, use cloth
napkins, use toxic-free cleaners (or make your own), walk or bike instead of driving
when possible - these are just some basic ideas. Check out Ideas to Think Green for
more suggestions.
●
Collect rainwater for the garden
●
Compost your kitchen waste
●
Try more plant-based foods
●
Conduct a clothing drive
●
Collect food donations for the local food bank
●
Enrol in the EcoSchools program and complete as many initiatives as the class
decides. “The core of the EcoSchools program is the EcoSchools Certification
Application (ECA), a bilingual, online application platform that enables schools across
the country to create and implement a customized environmental action plan that
meets the needs of their community. At the end of each year, school plans are
submitted and assessed by EcoSchools staff, and schools are awarded a certification
level ranging from Bronze to Platinum.”
●
Develop a plan to conserve energy at home and/or at school and communicate this
to this to the rest of the student body. Take part in one of Green Learning’s
Challenges like the “Energy Revealed Challenge” here.
●
Enter one of the Little Inventors Climate Champions invention challenges offered by
the Child Rights International Network. At Little Inventors Events you can find current,
past and upcoming events such as Climate Champion Inventions and Protect Our
Oceans Mission.  It’s worth exploring prior contests so students can see what other
students across the globe have designed.
●
The Little Inventors site (https://www.littleinventors.org/) also provides a variety of
mini challenges under the heading “Challenges” with many related to the
environment and climate change.  Students can upload their creation to the site and
hope it gets published and/or complete to share with the class or upload to a class’
shared Google document.  Here are some relevant mini challenges:
○
Challenge to Protect Nature
○
Invention to Protect Trees & Wildlife
○
Make Sustainable Energy Through Exercise
○

National GOOS Paper Day
GOOS stands for Good On One Side. GOOS paper is paper that has been used on one
side, but is still blank and usable on the other side. Using GOOS paper means ensuring both
sides of a piece of paper are used before it is recycled.
A GOOS paper bin collects and stores your GOOS paper in a convenient and accessible
place to help ensure it can be used easily. Get creative and decorate your GOOS bins with a
“goose” theme or other eye-catching styles.
Join students, teachers, workplaces, and families across the country on the first Thursday
in April to celebrate National GOOS Paper Day.
On this day of action, get creative as you learn about responsible paper use and promote
effective ways to reduce, reuse, and recycle paper.
The [Roberta] Bondar Challenge
Dr. Roberta Bondar is unique, not just for being the world’s first neurologist in space, the first
Canadian woman in space, or for her pioneering space medicine research. Academically
one of the most distinguished astronauts to have flown in space, Dr. Bondar is also the only
astronaut to use fine art photography to explore and reveal Earth’s natural environment from
the surface.
The Bondar Challenge is an opportunity for students to learn about the art of photography
and to discover new perspectives on nature through a camera lens. The challenge is
designed for students aged 6-18. Student entries will be judged in one of three age
categories: 6-10; 11-14; or 15-18.
Bullfrog Power Community Projects
Activists and organizers across the country are working to transition their communities away
from fossil fuels. We created our community-based green energy project grants to provide
critical funding for these local efforts.
6
All bullfrogpowered customers help fund these small-scale, community-led projects,
including solar panels on schools and in Indigenous communities, education and training
programs, and a cleantech accelerator.
Some examples of education-related initiatives, including Canadian Rockies Public School
solar project can be found at the link above.
Young Reporters for the Environment (For Grade 6 only):
YRE Canada is a national environmental education program that gives youth the opportunity
to be part of the solution by producing creative and engaging environmental journalism.
Participants (ages 11-14 and 15-18) investigate and report on environmental issues, and
propose solutions, by using video, photography or writing.
YRE Canada is part of Young Reporters for the Environment – an international program by
the Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE).
Each year there is a contest available to students with an April deadline.  This Canadian
National Competition is open to entrants in two categories: ages 11-14, and ages 15-18.
Article, photo, or video submissions must meet a few criteria. Pieces should:
●
Investigate solutions to a local environmental issue/problem based on this year’s
themes of pollution, loss of biodiversity, or climate change that have to be linked
to a chosen Sustainable Development Goal (SDG).
●
Report on the chosen issue through writing, photos, or video.
Students may submit more than one piece and can work individually or in groups of up to
three people. Please note, winners in each category and age group will be publicly displayed
and promoted on EcoSchools Canada’s social media and website.

Take Action
A. Provocation
To hook student interest, introduce the provocation to initiate student thinking.
Journey to a New Planet Game (refer to pages 27-29)
The following activity is adapted from “GEAR, (Global Education Activity Resource) for grades 2 to 8,
developed by World Vision Canada, (adapted from Defining Peace and Conflict, UNICEF, 1995).
In this game students will be told they are taking a journey to a new planet with their partner.
There are many collaborative decisions that need to be made so students will have to work
together.
Objectives:
Students will differentiate between wants and needs, generate, gather and exchange ideas,
use critical thinking skills and demonstrate understanding of basic human rights.
Preparation:
●
Prepare a simple drawing of the solar system and a spaceship (optional).
●
Collect and have available a stack of magazines that students can cut up for pictures
of items to take on their journey.
Instructions:
1.
Explain that Mission Control (which you represent) has discovered a new planet and
each pair will go there to start up a new community. Set the mood by naming the
planet and the reasons for going there.
2.
Ask the students to close their eyes and imagine the new planet. How long will it take
to get there? What does it look like? Do other people live there? Where will they set
up the new community? Tell them to form a picture of this community in their minds.
3.
With their eyes still closed, ask students to think about the things they will want and
need in their new community. Have students open their eyes and discuss their ideas
with their partners.
4.
Students, working in pairs, have a designated amount of time (30 minutes) to find
and cut out 20-30 pictures from magazines of items that they would take with them
on their journey to a new planet.
1
5.
Next, explain that Mission Control will provide each pair of students with the number
of items they could bring with them to set up their new community. Ask them to
spread out their images. Using a T chart, divide the images into two categories,
Wants and Needs.
6.
Announce that Mission Control says space on the journey is limited. The students
can now take only 16 items on the spaceship. Partners negotiate to eliminate some
items and set them aside. As they are completing the task, announce that Mission
Control has changed their mind, now allowing only 12 items. Again, students
negotiate with each other to decide which items to set aside.
7.
Finally, inform the students that Mission Control has issued an emergency
announcement and there is even less space available. Students may now take only 8
items with them. Partners negotiate to eliminate four more items, leaving only the
eight most essential for their survival.
Post Activity Discussion:
Questions taken from (GEAR, p. 27)
●
What was difficult about doing this activity? What was easy?
●
Which items were easy to discard first? Why?
●
Were some items harder to eliminate than others? Which ones? Why?
●
What is the difference between a want and a need?
●
What do we need for survival?
●
What do different people, communities, contexts need to survive?
B. Question Generation
At this point in the inquiry, we want to harness students’ curiosity and build off of
the provocations that have captured their interest by generating meaningful
questions to continue to drive the learning process. This section will outline pathways for
question generation depending on the provocation(s) that your class engaged with.
Students will use the Does It Fit? strategy to make decisions from a variety of options
available to them.
Example Activity:
You and a partner are planning your Journey to a New Planet trip. Each pair has a copy of
the 21 Needs and Wants cards (p. 28-29). There are also 3 blank cards if you feel you want
to include something that isn’t in the cards.
Consider these 3 perspectives when asking if the item is appropriate:
●
Ideal: - How well does each item fit with what you think would make life on the new
planet ideal? Discuss why this item would make life ideal;
●
Criteria - How well does each item fit the criteria of what you need or want for a good
life on this new planet? What is your criteria for a good life (older students)
●
Personally - How well does each item fit with your personal understanding of needs
and wants?
2
Once you have made a decision of which items are “wants” and which items are “needs”,
you must narrow down your choices to the most important items to take to the new planet.
How do you and your partner decide?
Are there any other items you would add or take away? The following videos may create
some ideas that promote discussion and generate more questions on the difference between
needs and wants.
Videos:
●
Needs and Wants for Kids: A basic description of the differences between needs
and wants.
●
Needs vs Wants: Learn the difference, when it comes to economics, between your
needs and your wants.
●
Need vs Want: Understand how paying attention to your needs helps you work
towards your wants.
C. Knowledge Building
At this stage, students may be ready to engage in a group knowledge building
activity. It will encourage students to open their minds to many alternative ways
of thinking about the provocations and ideas that have been generated thus far
in the inquiry process.
Following the exercises on understanding the differences between “needs” and “wants”,
engage students in a knowledge building circle to explore the differences between “rights”
and “responsibilities”.
D. Determining Understanding
Use responses to inform and guide the learning process. They can provide
insight into which concepts need clarity, what many students are already well
informed about, and a general direction that many students want to pursue.
After the knowledge building circle play a second game from GEAR, called The Rights
Balloon (p. 30-31). This game is played individually.
The following is an excerpt from GEAR, (Global Education Activity Resource) for grades 2 to 8, The
Rights Balloon is adapted from Children Changing the World by SOPAR, 2002. 1, chemin des
Érables, Gatineau, PQ J8V 1C1. (www.sopar.ca) Conflict, UNICEF, 1995).
Objectives:
Students will understand the difference between rights and wants, and prioritize various
rights in their lives; brainstorm and communicate ideas in collaboration with others and apply
critical thinking skills.
3
Preparation: Photocopy a class set of The Rights Balloon (page 31).
Instructions:
1.
Ask students to brainstorm things they need or enjoy having in their lives. Write their
responses on the board or chart paper.
2.
Hand out The Rights Balloon activity sheet to each student and explain that a right is
something every person is entitled to for survival and a good life.
3.
Ask students to close their eyes and imagine they are alone in a hot-air balloon
floating high above the ground. Describe what they might see and ask them to
choose a destination (e.g. another country or visiting a friend) Tell them they each
have 10 rights on board and each one weighs 2 kilograms.
4.
Suddenly the balloon begins to drop. To stop descending they must throw one right
overboard. Ask students to open their eyes and, without discussion, select one item
from the list they are willing to give up. Instruct them to write number 1 in the “Me”
column beside their choice.
5.
Tell students to close their eyes again. They can continue imagining their journey
now that the balloon has safely levelled out. After a few seconds tell them the balloon
is descending again and they must select another item to throw overboard. Write
number 2 in the “Me” column beside the second right they surrender.
6.
Continue in this way, with students choosing rights to throw overboard each time the
balloon descends and numbering their choices until only one item remains in the
balloon. The last right—the one most important to them—is numbered 10.
7.
Ask students to share responses with a partner. Discuss each other’s decisions. If
necessary, agree on a new ordering of the rights, and record this new order in the
“Us” column. Reassure them that the way they prioritize their choices may differ from
their classmates.
Post Activity Discussion (Global Education Activity Resource, p. 30)
●
Which rights were easiest to give up? Which were the most difficult?
●
What is the difference between the things you need (rights) and the things you want?
●
Are there any rights so basic you would never give them up? Which ones and why?
●
How would you define a basic or universal human right?
The concept of human rights is based on the belief that we have rights simply because we
are human beings. A right is something you are entitled to in order to survive and have a
meaningful, healthy, satisfying life.
●
What responsibilities come with the rights on the Rights Balloon list? (e.g. the right to
to go to school and the right to learn about your own culture, comes with the
responsibilities to getting to school on time, doing your homework, supporting
practices that promote your culture)
4
●
Debate this statement: “Those who have rights should speak out for those whose
rights are denied.”
E. Pursuing Learning: Understanding Rights and
Responsibilities
At this stage, students may begin research to pursue some of their questions,
or some of the following activities could be integrated into the process to ensure that
students have an understanding of foundational climate science. The activities listed below
will enrich the understanding of rights and responsibilities of citizens.
Explore the 12 Rights of a Canadian Child from Children First Canada.
“What if we taught our children, not that they have rights to land, but that they have
responsibilities to the land? You would have children who would know how joyful having a
purpose would be. Children would know their purpose in the world which would be to find
their gifts and give them back! That’s reciprocity and that’s an empowering stance!”
Robin Wall Kimmerer, 2021.
Based on this quote from Robin Wall Kimmerer, have children explore their strengths/”gifts”
and how these strengths can provide direction for how they can understand their role in
responding to climate change and deciding on actions to take that will make a difference.
What Are My Strengths:
“To help kids thrive, recognizing their strengths is just as important as working on their
challenges”. (Amanda Morin, 2018)  Have students identify kids’ strengths by creating a
paper chain, called a strengths chain”.
Along with the understanding of the differences between “needs” and “wants”, extend this
idea by exploring “rights and responsibilities”.
F. Consolidation
This step is designed to encourage students to integrate and synthesize key
ideas. When students make connections and see relationships within and across lessons, it
helps them to solidify knowledge and deepen their understanding.
Write a persuasive letter that demonstrates your understanding of the responsibilities that
go with rights.
Example Activity:
Students write a letter to a parent or caregiver explaining that they understand the
responsibilities that go along with having a right. For example:  I understand that the right to
5
own a pet goes along with certain responsibilities. I believe that I would make a great owner
of a _______________ because I would be responsible for its health and well-being. I would
take these responsibilities seriously because I would…(list all of the responsibilities that
would go with maintaining the health and well-being of an animal.
Assessment Idea
Teachers will assess learning at different points throughout the inquiry using multiple
methods. The following assessment provides an alternative evaluation method to standard
quizzes and tests, that can be used after consolidation or at any point in the lesson to check
for understanding.
Use the I Used to Think…Now I Think… strategy as an Exit Ticket for students.
Example Activity:
Students write one sentence explaining how their thinking about needs and wants has
changed (with a personal example) and one sentence about how their understanding of
rights and responsibilities has changed (with a personal example) as a result of this inquiry.
Take Action
Allowing time for students to take action is an essential part of the learning
process on climate change, as it empowers students and eases their eco
anxiety.  You might introduce the idea of students taking action by sharing the

If they need some ideas of simple and immediate measures they can implement you can
share this document from Direct Energy.  While it is written for parents, students can get the
idea of something that would be attainable for themselves - or to share with their families!
Ideas to Think Green
Ideas for Taking Action:
●
Model green behaviour - use a reusable water bottle, actively recycle, compost, bring
your bags to the grocer, bring your mug to the coffee shop, repair things that need
mending, buy second-hand when applicable, pack a litterless lunch, use cloth
napkins, use toxic-free cleaners (or make your own), walk or bike instead of driving
when possible - these are just some basic ideas. Check out Ideas to Think Green for
more suggestions.

National GOOS Paper Day
GOOS stands for Good On One Side. GOOS paper is paper that has been used on one
side, but is still blank and usable on the other side. Using GOOS paper means ensuring both
sides of a piece of paper are used before it is recycled.
A GOOS paper bin collects and stores your GOOS paper in a convenient and accessible
place to help ensure it can be used easily. Get creative and decorate your GOOS bins with a
“goose” theme or other eye-catching styles.
Join students, teachers, workplaces, and families across the country on the first Thursday
in April to celebrate National GOOS Paper Day.
On this day of action, get creative as you learn about responsible paper use and promote
effective ways to reduce, reuse, and recycle paper.
The [Roberta] Bondar Challenge
Dr. Roberta Bondar is unique, not just for being the world’s first neurologist in space, the first
Canadian woman in space, or for her pioneering space medicine research. Academically
one of the most distinguished astronauts to have flown in space, Dr. Bondar is also the only
astronaut to use fine art photography to explore and reveal Earth’s natural environment from
the surface.
7
The Bondar Challenge is an opportunity for students to learn about the art of photography
and to discover new perspectives on nature through a camera lens. The challenge is
designed for students aged 6-18. Student entries will be judged in one of three age
categories: 6-10; 11-14; or 15-18.
Bullfrog Power Community Projects
Activists and organizers across the country are working to transition their communities away
from fossil fuels. We created our community-based green energy project grants to provide
critical funding for these local efforts.
All bullfrogpowered customers help fund these small-scale, community-led projects,
including solar panels on schools and in Indigenous communities, education and training
programs, and a cleantech accelerator.
Some examples of education-related initiatives, including Canadian Rockies Public School
solar project can be found at the link above.
Young Reporters for the Environment (For Grade 6 only):
YRE Canada is a national environmental education program that gives youth the opportunity
to be part of the solution by producing creative and engaging environmental journalism.

A. Provocation
To hook student interest, introduce the provocation to initiate student thinking.
Videos
As an introduction to green career opportunities, begin by having students watch this video
Forest Manager & Water Technician by TVO Kids which introduces them to two careers, a
forest manager and water treatment technician.
Other Supportive Videos
Written Interviews by Nasa (Climate Kids)
These links can also be shared with students either as a whole group perhaps projected on
a screen or that they read individually.

●
Ocean Scientists Studying Coral Reefs: A Conversation with Eric Hochberg
●
Earth Scientist Studying Glaciers: A Conversation with Kimbely Casey
Students can also activate prior knowledge and engage in discussion around career choices
by playing the game “When I Grow Up!” either by themselves or with a partner.

B. Question Generation
At this point in the inquiry, we want to harness students’ curiosity and build off of the
provocations that have captured their interest by generating meaningful questions to
continue to drive the learning process. This section will outline pathways for question
generation depending on the provocation(s) that your class engaged with.
Using the Inside/Outside Circles routine will help students generate ideas and assist in
furthering their inquiry as they focus on potential future careers that are of interest to them,
emphasizing ones that are “green”.
1
Example Activity:
For the first few rounds, have students share any job that currently they think interests them.
They can share some of the qualities of the position that interests them (e.g., it’s hands on;
indoors/outdoors; can work from home; works alone/with others; allows for creativity; etc.).
After a couple of passes, change the question to specifically discuss a career that is
“green” that they would consider exploring further.
C. Knowledge Building
At this stage, students may be ready to engage in a group knowledge building
activity. It will encourage students to open their minds to many alternative ways of thinking
about the provocations and ideas that have been generated thus far in the inquiry process.
Working in pairs or triads, have students complete this template adapted from
careercruising.com called Exploring Career Choices (or modify it for your use).  An
interesting link that could be explored prior to filling this chart discusses what it means to be
nature smart and identifies 10 occupations that are suitable to those that are nature smart.
This 2-page document can be found at: Nature Smart Guide.
Example Activity:
In the Exploring Career Choices chart the first column identifies some examples of jobs that
might appear obvious as to how they can be “green” by supporting the environment and
helping reduce climate change effects, while others are not so apparent.  Beside each, is an
example of how the career is green or could be modified in order to make it so.  There are
several empty boxes at the bottom of this chart so that you and a peer can think of and
record some other examples.
Review the dozen examples that are listed along with how that career directly is a green
choice or how it can be adapted to be green.  Then in their groups they should brainstorm
several more jobs that come to their minds or that interest them and fill in the second column
as to how it would need to be modified to be greener.
Additional information, questions and ideas are available at the Career Cruising website at
careercruising.com should you wish to explore this further.
D. Determining Understanding
Use responses to inform and guide the learning process. They can provide
insight into which concepts need clarity, what many students are already well
informed about, and a general direction that many students want to pursue.
2
Have students work in small groups different from any other they have so far, and use the
strategy “I Used to Think & Now I Think”.
Example Activity:
Each student should take a turn sharing a job/career and what they initially thought of its role
and then how they think it could be modified to make it “greener”.  This will give students an
opportunity to listen to others to gain even more information and ideas as well as succinctly
share their thoughts orally.
E. Pursuing Learning: Impacts and Green Opportunities
At this stage, students may begin research to pursue some of their questions,
or some of the following activities could be integrated into the process to
ensure that students have an understanding of foundational climate science. The activities
listed below will enrich the understanding of green jobs and careers.
Have students write an ad for a green career of their choice.  The ad should include:
●
a description of the role and its responsibilities,
●
what qualities candidates require,
●
the hours involved,
●
the experience required
●
the salary, and
●
several sentences as to why this is an appealing opportunity.
Prior to writing their own ad, students may wish to explore current opportunities that are
posted online such as the environmental, sustainability and nature jobs found by using key
words to search positions on sites such as Indeed Job Search Canada | Indeed.
F. Consolidation
This step is designed to encourage students to integrate and synthesize key
ideas. When students make connections and see relationships within and across lessons, it
helps them to solidify knowledge and deepen their understanding.
Example Activity:
For this consolidation exercise, students will work in pairs. Each person will generate several
thought-provoking consolidation questions for their partner. The questions should be based
on the learning from this inquiry and could address their own personal gaps in understanding
or aim to deepen understanding. Each partner will have an opportunity to write full
responses to their questions, and then share their thinking with their partner.
3
Assessment Idea
Teachers will assess learning at different points throughout the inquiry using multiple
methods. The following assessment provides an alternative evaluation method to standard
quizzes and tests, that can be used after consolidation or at any point in the lesson to check
for understanding.
The One-minute paper is a classroom assessment technique that uses a focused question
generated by the teacher that can be answered within a minute or two. The activity asks
students to reflect on their understanding of a lesson or concept and provides the teacher
with rapid feedback on students’ perceptions on key learnings. Check here for more
information on this strategy.
Example Activity:
In one minute have students record their career choice and rationale based on their
exploration and new learning.
Take Action:
Allowing time for students to take action is an essential part of the learning
process on climate change, as it empowers students and eases their eco anxiety.  You might
introduce the idea of students taking action by sharing the following YouTube “Climate
Change Song”
