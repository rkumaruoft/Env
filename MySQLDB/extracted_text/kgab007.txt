ABSTRACT
Projections of future global mean surface warming for a given forcing scenario remain uncertain, largely due to uncertainty
in the climate sensitivity. The ensemble of Earth system models from the Climate Model Intercomparison Project phase 6
(CMIP6) represents the dominant tools for projecting future global warming. However, the distribution of climate sensitivi-
ties within the CMIP6 ensemble is not representative of recent independent probabilistic estimates, and the ensemble con-
tains signiﬁcant variation in simulated historic surface warming outside agreement with observational datasets. Here, a
Bayesian approach is used to infer joint probabilistic projections of future surface warming and climate sensitivity for
shared socio-economic pathway (SSP) scenarios. The projections use an efﬁcient climate model ensemble ﬁltered and
weighted to encapsulate observational uncertainty in historic warming and ocean heat content anomalies. The probabilistic
projection of climate sensitivity produces a best estimate of 2.9C, and 5th–95th percentile range of 1.5–4.6C, in line with
previous estimates using multiple lines of evidence. The joint projection of surface warming over the period 2030–40 has a
50% or greater probability of exceeding 1.5C above preindustrial for all SSPs considered: 119, 126, 245, 370 and 585. Average
warming by the period 2050–60 has a >50% chance of exceeding 2C for SSPs 245, 370 and 585. These results imply that
global warming is no longer likely to remain under 1.5C, even with drastic and immediate mitigation, and highlight the im-
portance of urgent action to avoid exceeding 2C warming.
Key words: climate sensitivity; global warming; climate projection; climate feedback; climate change; climate models.
PROJECTING FUTURE WARMING AND CLIMATE
FEEDBACK TRAJECTORIES
Projecting global mean surface warming (DT in K) and either cli-
mate feedback (k in W m2 K1) or climate sensitivity (S in K)
responses to anthropogenic forcing scenarios remain key priori-
ties for climate science [1, 2]. Surface warming since the prein-
dustrial average at time t, DT tð Þ is related to the time evolutions
of radiative forcing, R in W m2, the net energy uptake of the
Earth system, N in W m2, and either k or S via

that k tð ÞDT tð Þ is the additional energy emitted to space due to
surface warming in W m2; and most (around 93%) of N leads to
the ocean heat content (OHC) anomaly [1]. This study uses
warming above the 1850–1900 average to represent warming
above preindustrial, DT tð Þ [1].
Some of the terms in the energy (im)balance equation, (1),
are historically constrained by observational datasets. Historic
surface warming, DTðthistÞ, is well constrained from observa-
tional datasets (Fig. 1, black) [3–5] while there is relatively more
observational uncertainty in historic OHC anomaly, DOHChist
[6, 7], giving greater uncertainty in the time average of Earth’s
historic global energy imbalance, NðtÞ [8, 9]. To constrain future
surface warming for a specified atmospheric composition sce-
nario, we need to also constrain the radiative forcing from at-
mospheric composition changes, RðtÞ, and the climate feedback,
kðtÞ (or equivalently climate sensitivity, S) response and predict
their future evolution, equation (1).
However, the historic evolutions of k, S and R have proven
difficult to constrain from observational datasets [10–14], in
part, because there is large uncertainty in the magnitude of his-
toric radiative forcing, R, principally from aerosols [1, 15, 16].
Any climate model ensemble chosen to generate future DT pro-
jections must also simulate (explicitly or implicitly) historic and
future time evolutions of k, S, R and N, equation (1), and historic
warming and OHC anomalies. Moreover, equation (1) reveals
that there are multiple historic trajectories that k and R (or S
and R) can take to reproduce the historic trajectories of DT and
N consistent with observations.
The aim here is to produce joint probabilistic projections of
the future trajectory of global mean warming above preindus-
trial average, DTfutureðtÞ in K,

for shared socio-economic pathway (SSP) scenarios [17] given
information
from observational
reconstructions of historic
surface warming, DTðthistÞ [3], historic OHC, DOHCðthistÞ [6], and
other background information, i. This background information,
i, will include prior uncertainty distributions for radiative forc-
ing from a range of sources including aerosols [1, 15, 16] prior
distributions for a range of climate model parameters and the
functional form of a range of parameterizations within an effi-
cient climate model with a box-model representation of heat
and carbon fluxes in the atmosphere-ocean system [18–20]. To
then assess whether the posterior efficient model ensemble is
able to capture the qualitative response of the Earth system to
forcing, it will be compared with the normalized responses of
state-of-the-art Climate Model Intercomparison Project phase 6
(CMIP6) models to idealized forcing scenarios.
The primary tools for projecting future DT are process-based
numerical climate models [21], whose performance can be in
some way assessed against historic observational datasets
[3–7]. The dominant climate model variants used to project DT
by the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC)
Assessment Reports [1] are the CMIP ensemble of complex and
high-resolution global climate and Earth system models [21],
forced by a range of specified future scenarios [17].
Climate processes relevant to 21st century surface warm-
ing and climate feedback projections act over at least 14
orders of magnitude in their spatial and temporal scales [22];
e.g. from cloud droplet collisions up to global mean surface
warming on decadal to century timescales. When projecting
global mean surface warming to year 2100, computational
resources limit state-of-the-art CMIP6 Earth system models,
e.g. [23], to represent a maximum of 6 orders of magnitude
in time, from a single time-step to a century, and 3 orders of
magnitude in horizontal space, from grid-scale to global. The

‘high-resolution’ Earth system models must therefore contain
a great many parameterizations of processes acting on unre-
solved spatial and temporal scales. These parameterizations
include specifying the functional form of equations and their
coefficient values.
Parameterizations of unresolved processes significantly af-
fect the historic and future trajectories of simulated warming
and climate feedback, demonstrated by the large variation in
historic simulations of surface warming from different CMIP
models (Fig. 1 for CMIP6; see e.g. Ref. [1] for CMIP5), each contain-
ing a different set of parameterizations. In their relatively high
spatial and temporal resolution, these state-of-the-art models
can only run between one and several-tens of simulations each
due to their high computational cost, resulting in a total ensem-
ble size for all CMIP6 models of up to a few hundreds of simula-
tions for a given scenario. Thus, the CMIP climate models are
unable to perform enough simulations with varied parameter-
izations to identify all possible combinations of historic path-
ways of kðtÞ
and RðtÞ that produce observation-consistent
historic pathways of DTðtÞ and NðtÞ (equation (1); Fig. 1a).
Computationally efficient climate models [24] are able to uti-
lize computational resources to resolve their own plausible
combinations of parameterizations, through the construction of
very large model ensembles. However, this parameterization
resolution occurs at the expense of a much-reduced resolution
of relevant climate processes. As the relative simplicity of effi-
cient model representations may not capture the required com-
plexity of the climate system, the ‘qualitative’ nature of their
simulated projections may be too simplistic. For example, an ef-
ficient climate model may use a single climate feedback value
for all time and for all sources of radiative forcing, when in com-
plex models (and the real climate system) climate feedbacks
may vary over time and may respond differently to, say, local-
ized aerosol forcing than to well-mixed greenhouse gases.
Efficient climate models are therefore able to perform a quanti-
tative assessment of uncertainties within their own model
framework, but the qualitative form of their responses may not
accurately reflect reality.
Since no model can resolve all relevant processes, computa-
tional resources introduce an inherent trade-off between resolv-
ing relevant climate processes and resolving parameterization
uncertainty. The greater the complexity and resolution of a cli-
mate
model
the
less
possible
parameterizations
can
be
simulated.
This study produces joint probabilistic projections of the fu-
ture trajectories of global mean warming and climate feedback

INFERRING PROBABILISTIC PROJECTIONS
FROM COMPLEX MODEL ENSEMBLES
By far the dominant quantitative projections of global mean
surface warming in the scientific literature, as used in the
Intergovernmental
Panel
on
Climate
Change
Assessment
Reports [1], are derived from relatively small ensembles of com-
plex climate model output. The simplest method to develop
probabilistic projections of global mean warming and climate
sensitivity is to use the raw unadjusted CMIP ensemble simula-
tions. This generation of probabilistic projections of surface
warming and climate sensitivity, given the (considerable) back-
ground information that goes into the design and integration of
the CMIP models, iCMIP, is expressed as follows:
p DTðtfutureÞjiCMIP

p SðtfutureÞjiCMIP

(6)
However, such unadjusted model output (e.g. Fig. 1a, grey
lines for a sample of CMIP6 simulations) may give spurious
probabilistic inferences, equations (5) and (6). For example, us-
ing the frequency distribution of climate sensitivity values in
the CMIP6 ensemble [25] to infer a probabilistic assessment of S
would give results quite different from independent assess-
ments using other lines of evidence [1, 2]: over 20% of CMIP6
models analysed by Zelinka et al. [25] have climate sensitivity
values >4.7 K, while Sherwood et al. [2] evaluate only a 5% prob-
ability that climate sensitivity is >4.7 K.
Also, consider the range of simulated CMP6 values of global
temperature anomaly above preindustrial for the immediate fu-
ture when following SSP585. The simulated 11-year running av-
erage surface warming >1850–1900 in the year 2025 ranges
from DT ¼ 0.9 to 2.4C in the sample of CMIP6 models in Fig. 1a
(grey lines). To get to the lower end of these simulated near-
future warming levels (Fig. 1a, grey) from our observed warming
to the present day (Fig. 1a, black) would require the recent ob-
served decadal rate of warming to reverse, just as radiative forc-
ing is increasing. Meanwhile, to reach the upper end of these
simulated near-future warming levels would require the recent
decadal rate of warming (Fig. 1a, black) to suddenly increase by
a factor of 6. As both of these extremes seem highly improbable,
generating plausible future projection appears to require more
information than just the (considerable) information put into
the CMIP6 ensemble, iCMIP (equations 5 and 6).
To account for any error in simulated historic warming, or
bias in climate sensitivity, in CMIP ensemble members (Fig. 1a,
grey and black), a method often applied in the literature is to
use observations of historic surface warming to inform how the
raw CMIP output should be interpreted in a probabilistic sense
[1,
26–31]:
For
temperature
projections,
this
observation
adjustment is expressed as a probability of future temperature
anomaly given both historic observed temperature anomaly
and the background information that goes into the CMIP
ensemble.

For climate sensitivity, one may use an emergent constraint
based on the historic temperature record to produce a probabil-
ity estimate for climate sensitivity given historic temperature
records and background information in the CMIP ensemble [27].

The technique for projecting future warming above prein-
dustrial, DTðtfutureÞ, adopted in IPCC AR5 [1] was simply to add
historic observed warming up to the present time t0, DTobsðt0Þ,
to the additional simulated warming in the future relative to

semble in Fig. 1a, one ensemble member that simulates mean
warming during 2020–30 of 2.32C above preindustrial would be
used to support the probability of warming being only 1.56C
over that period. Meanwhile, another ensemble member that
simulates warming of 1.05C during 2020–30 (Fig. 1a, grey)
would be used to support the probability that warming will be
1.38C above preindustrial.
Other, more sophisticated, statistical techniques have been
proposed for making quantitative projections of observable
properties such as warming and/or climate feedback (or climate
sensitivity) using the CMIP model output and observational
records (equations (7) and (8)), such as the application of emer-
gent constraints [26–29, 32] and observational adjustments and
weightings [30, 31]. Emergent constraints are used to analyse an
ensemble of numerical climate simulations, where some func-
tional relationship is thought or known to exist within the
model ensemble between one observable property of the cli-
mate system and the observable property for which projection
is desired [26, 28].
INFERRING PROBABILISTIC FUTURE
PROJECTIONS FROM AN EFFICIENT MODEL
ENSEMBLE
Efficient climate models are specifically designed to allow the
generation of large ensemble simulations, through reduced res-
olution of relevant climate processes in space and time.
Examples of models designed and configured in this way are
found
in the Reduced
Complexity Model Intercomparison
Project (RCMIP, [24]).
For the complex model ensembles, the prior expectation for
different quantities (such as climate feedback or climate sensi-
tivity) is hidden within the background information put into the
development of each of the models, iCMIP in equations (5)–(8).
However, the individual model teams do not systematically
vary the information put into each model such that the ensem-
ble produces a distribution of each property (e.g. climate sensi-
tivity) equal to some agreed prior belief. Instead, each model is
developed independently according to the best estimates of the
different model teams. As such, the complex model ensemble
may under-sample the less likely values of climate system
properties, since no model-team’s best estimate is to build a
model with those properties.
This study uses the Warming Acidification and Sea level
Projector (WASP) [18, 19]: a box-model representation of heat and
carbon fluxes across the atmosphere-ocean system and carbon
fluxes between the atmosphere and terrestrial systems. Here, only
the atmosphere-ocean components of the WASP model [18–20]
are used. This consists of a well-mixed atmosphere box connected
to a well-mixed surface ocean box, itself connected to four sub-
surface ocean boxes representing the upper ventilated region of
the ocean, the intermediate water region, the deep ocean water re-
gion and the bottom water ocean region.
WASP version 3 [19], with time-evolving climate feedbacks,
is adopted and configured after Goodwin and Cael [20] with cli-
mate feedback split into three components: the instantaneous
(Planck) feedback, kP, fast feedbacks (operating on the timescale
of water vapour residence in the atmosphere), kf, and multide-
cadal feedbacks (operating on timescales representing the sea-
surface
temperature
warming
pattern
adjustment),
kmd
(Appendix B).
Here, the WASP model is utilized to generate a Monte Carlo
prior ensemble of 2:4  107 efficient model simulations, with 25
model parameters varied independently between ensemble
members (e.g. Fig. 2) and each ensemble member having a
unique randomly imposed energy imbalance using autoregres-
sion AR1 noise to approximate the monthly and yearly observed
noise from Ref. [8]. The computational efficiency of WASP
allows all of these 2:4  107 to be integrated from preindustrial
to the present day in 100 h on a single Linux cluster node using
dual 2.0 GHz Intel Skylake processors. The prior simulations are
assessed against historical observations (Table 1) and a poste-
rior ensemble of 13 340 simulations is extracted and weighted.
It then takes 5 min on a standard desktop or laptop computer
to integrate the 13 340 members of the posterior ensemble from
preindustrial to year 2300 for a given SSP scenario. When histor-
ical output from a complex model ensemble (CMIP5) was used
to extract the posterior ensemble in WASP [18, 35], the posterior
future projection ranges agreed with the complex model en-
semble for mitigated and unmitigated scenarios, both for future
surface warming [18, 35] and future ocean heat uptake [35]. This
provides confidence in the future WASP projections when
observations are used to extract the posterior ensemble.
The 25 varied parameters include climate feedback magni-
tudes and timescales for the instantaneous Planck, fast and
multidecadal climate feedbacks (Fig. 2), the radiative forcing
sensitivity to atmospheric composition for different forcing
agents including aerosols (Fig. 2b), and ocean ventilation time-
scales for different ocean regions. A full list of parameters var-
ied is found in Goodwin and Cael [20]. The prior distributions for
the magnitude of climate feedback terms are updated here,
with prior distributions for all other terms as described in
Goodwin and Cael [20].
New prior distributions of climate feedback parameters
The prior model ensemble must contain some prior distribu-
tions for climate feedback parameters. The prior distributions
for climate feedback and climate sensitivity considered by a re-
cent review by Sherwood et al. [2] assumed either uniform cli-
mate feedback (k, W m2 K1) or uniform climate sensitivity (S,
K). The difference between these two prior distributions makes
a significant difference to the upper percentiles of the posterior
distribution of climate sensitivity: the 95th percentile of climate
sensitivity, S, is 1 K higher for a uniform-S prior than for a uni-
form-k prior [2]. Both uniform-S and uniform-k priors imply
regions with infinite prior probability: a uniform-S prior implies
that the probability of k goes to infinity as k goes to 0, while a
uniform-k prior implies that the probability of S goes to infinity
as S goes to 0. To avoid these infinities, the priors are made dis-
continuous [2].
Here, new prior distributions for climate feedback parame-
ters are presented and adopted, based on five conditions to pre-
vent both infinities and discontinuities in prior probability. The

following conditions on the prior distributions of climate feed-

• Condition 1: The climate feedback and climate sensitivity each

Uniform-S and uniform-k priors (e.g. considered in Ref. [2])
each break at least three of the five conditions imposed here.
Goodwin and Cael [20] defined three priors in terms of climate
feedback terms acting on instantaneous (Planck), multiday
(fast) and multidecadal timescales. They adopted a normal dis-
tribution for the instantaneous Planck climate feedback, and
uniform distributions for fast and multidecadal climate feed-
backs. Again, these prior distributions employed in the WASP
model in Ref. [20] break at least three of the five conditions
adopted here.
Here, lognormal-based distributions (Appendix C; Fig. 2) for
Planck feedback, kP (Fig. 2a), fast feedback, kf (Fig. 2b and e), and
multidecadal climate feedback, kmd (Appendix C: Fig. 2d and f),
are chosen as being able to satisfy the above conditions 1–5; be-
ing defined only for positive values of total climate feedback
and with probability distributions tending to zero as the total
climate feedback value tends to both zero and infinity on all
timescales.
The resulting prior distribution for equilibrium climate feed-
back, kequil ¼ kP þ kf þ kmd, has a median value of 3.3 W m2 K1,
a 66% (17th–83rd percentile) range of 1 to 9.4 W m2 K1 and a 95%
(2.5th–97.5 percentile) range of 0.38–42 W m2 K1 (Fig. 2g). The
equilibrium climate sensitivity, Sequil ¼ aCO2ln2=kequil, then has a
prior distribution with median 1.1 K, 66% range 0.37–3.6 K and 95%
range 0.07–9.6 K (Fig. 2h). The prior distributions used here are less
heavily weighted to high climate sensitivity values than a uniform
S prior, and less heavily weighted to low climate sensitivity values
than a uniform k prior, and so represent a compromise between
the uniform-S and uniform-k priors considered by Ref. [2].
The distributions of all other model parameters in the WASP
model are set to the distributions used in Ref. [20]. For example,
the prior distribution of radiative forcing from aerosols in 2011
varies with a skew-normal distribution, with a 95% range from
–1.7 to –0.1 W m2 (Fig. 2b) reflecting uncertainty in direct and
indirect aerosol forcing [1].
Selecting and weighting the posterior ensemble
Each of the prior ensemble members is integrated from prein-
dustrial to the present day. A cost function is calculated by com-
paring
a
set
of
11
simulated
observable
quantities
to
reconstructions from historical observations (Table 1). For each
historical constraint, the probability of the simulated value be-
ing consistent with the observations, pðobsÞ, is calculated as-
suming Gaussian uncertainty: pðobsÞ / e lx
ð
Þ2=2r2, where l is
the observational best estimate; r is the observational standard
deviation; and x is the simulated value of the observable. Note
that Table 1 gives the median and 95% ranges for the 11 histori-
cal constraints, corresponding to l, l þ 2r and l  2r. The over-
all cost function for the ensemble member is then the product
of each simulation’s probability of being consistent with the 11
historical constraints,
costfunction ¼

Note that all 11 historical constraints are applied simulta-
neously in the cost function (9) so that the filter does not find
parameter value combinations corresponding to a local opti-
mum for one historical constraint if that produces very low
probability for other constraints [36].
Here, a new method used to extract and weight a posterior
ensemble, replacing the method used in Ref. [20]. This new
method requires fewer prior ensemble members to be gener-
ated, and so improves computational efficiency.
Each prior ensemble member’s cost function is calculated
(equation (9)). If the cost function is larger than a chosen auto-
matic acceptance limit, then the ensemble member is accepted
into the posterior ensemble and weighted by the ratio of the
cost function to the automatic acceptance limit. If the cost func-
tion is lower than the automatic acceptance limit, then the en-
semble member is accepted or rejected into the posterior
ensemble as follows. First, the value of the cost function is com-
pared to a number drawn from a random distribution between 0
and the automatic acceptance limit. If the cost function is
greater than the random number, the simulation is accepted
with a weighting of 1. If the cost function is less than the ran-
dom number, the simulation is rejected.
Using this method, all simulations whose cost functions
(equation (9)) are x times larger than the automatic acceptance
limit are accepted into the posterior ensemble, and assigned a
relative probabilistic weighting of x. Simulations whose cost
functions are y times smaller than the automatic acceptance
limit are ‘not’ all accepted into the posterior with a probabilistic
weighting of 1/y. Instead, they are represented in the posterior
by every yth simulation (randomly chosen from those whose
cost function is y times smaller than the automatic acceptance
limit), with a relative weighting of 1.
The automatic acceptance limit is set to give a balance be-
tween computational load and data storage requirements:
larger values require more prior simulations to be conducted to
generate a sufficient number of posterior ensemble members,
while smaller values require more data storage for annual out-
puts of simulations that have very low relative weighting. Here,
an automatic acceptance limit of 1  106 is set for the cost
function, giving 13 340 posterior simulations from a prior en-
semble size of 2:4  107. This leads to manageably sized data-
sets (order 30 MB for annual output per scenario per simulated
property, e.g. DT, k, S) being produced from a manageable com-
putational load (100 CPU h for the prior ensemble, and 5 CPU
min for subsequent scenarios with the posterior).
The method of posterior ensemble extraction and weighting,
from a prior ensemble using a cost function (equation 9;
Table 1), has similarities to climate model tuning [36], especially
Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification methods. However, here
the climate model parameters are not being ‘tuned’ to extract
some optimum parameter combination that is to be used for fu-
ture numerical experiments. Instead, a large probabilistic poste-
rior distribution of parameter value combinations (Fig. 2) are all
integrated to generate joint probabilistic projections of future
observables (Figs 1–4).
Comparison of the posterior ensemble against complex
models
For idealized forcing scenarios, the qualitative responses of
global surface temperature anomaly, DT, and heat imbalance, N,
are now explored in complex models and the efficient model
ensemble, equation (1). We are not considering the magnitude
of the warming and heating responses, but the qualitative form

GISS-E2-1-G) shows qualitative behaviour significantly outside
the variation found within the efficient model ensemble for sur-
face warming: the warming gradient is significantly larger in
the first half of the simulation than the second half; behaviour
that is not reproduced within the efficient model ensemble.
The responses of the efficient model ensemble are qualita-
tively similar to complex climate models for idealized CO2-only
forcing scenarios (Fig. 5), and quantitatively similar to observa-
tions in the historic period (Fig. 1a, compare blue to black:
Table 1), providing confidence in using the efficient model en-
semble for making quantitative projections of future global
mean surface warming (Fig. 1) and climate feedback (Fig. 3).
INFERRED PROBABILISTIC PROJECTIONS OF
TEMPERATURE AND CLIMATE SENSITIVITY
The joint probabilistic projections of climate sensitivity (equa-
tion (3)), climate feedback (equation 4) and surface warming
above preindustrial (equation (2)) from the observation-filtered
posterior model ensemble are now presented. The probabilistic
projections are inferred from the weighted frequency distribu-
tions within the posterior ensemble, and represent the probabil-
ities given prior information, i and observational constraints
(Table 1: DTðthistÞ; DOHCðthistÞ).
Projections of climate feedback and climate sensitivity
The posterior distribution of Planck feedback is similar to the
assumed prior (Fig. 2a). The radiative forcing from aerosols has
a narrower posterior distribution than the prior (Fig. 2b), with
the observational filter rejecting prior ensemble members with
the most strongly negative aerosol forcing.
The prior distributions of kf
and kmd both contain equal
amounts of amplifying (k < 0) and damping (k > 0) ensemble
members (Fig. 2c–f), equations (C1)–(C4). However, the posterior
distributions show amplifying fast feedback (Fig. 2c and e, red),
with a large peak of weaker amplifying values and a smaller peak
of strongly amplifying values. These two peaks correspond to a
larger peak of amplifying multidecadal feedback (Fig. 2d and f, red,
k < 0) and a smaller peak of damping multidecadal feedback
(Fig. 2d and f, red, k > 0). This gives rise to a posterior distribution
of equilibrium climate feedback, kequil ¼ kP þ kf þ kmd, with a large
peak at 0.9 W m2 K1 (weaker amplifying fast feedback and am-
plifying multidecadal feedback) and a smaller peak at 2.1 W m2
K1 (stronger amplifying fast feedback and damping multidecadal
feedback).
These posterior climate feedback distributions produce a
posterior equilibrium climate sensitivity distribution with best
estimate (median) value of Sequil ¼ 2:9 K; a 66% range of 1.7 to
4.1 K and a 95% range of 1.4–5.0 K (Fig. 2h). Equilibrium climate
sensitivity is often quoted at 90% confidence [1], for which the
range is 1.5–4.6 K (5th–95th percentile). Note that both kequil and
Sequil probability distributions here allow feedbacks on multide-
cadal and shorter timescales to equilibrate fully to an imposed
forcing, but ignore the impact of feedbacks that occur on time-
scales longer than multidecadal [12, 37, 38].
Now consider how future climate feedback and sensitivity
are projected to evolve over time in response to the two extreme
Figure 5: The normalized warming and heating responses in complex and efﬁcient model simulations for the 1pctCO2 and abrupt 4  CO2 idealized forcing scenarios.
For both scenarios the normalized global mean surface warming (DT) and net downward top of atmosphere heating (N) responses show that the qualitative behaviour
of the majority of complex model simulations (solid grey lines) are encapsulated within the efﬁcient model ensemble (blue line is ensemble median, dark and light
blue shaded areas cover 17th–83rd and 2.5th–97.5th percentile ranges, respectively). For the 1pctCO2 scenario, a single complex model is shown as a grey dotted line
(panels a and b: NASA GISS-E2-1-G). The normalized heating is the net downward heat ﬂux at the top of the atmosphere (N in W m2) and the normalized warming is
the global mean surface temperature (DT in K). All values of warming and heating in (a–c) are normalized relative to the average values during years 95–105 of the simu-
lations. In (d) the net downward heating is normalized relative to the heating in year 1 following CO2 increase

SSP scenarios used: SSP585 and SSP119 (Fig. 3). For SSP585,
where the system is continually warming in response to in-
creasing radiative forcing (Fig. 1a), future climate feedback and
climate sensitivity are projected to stay close to their present-
day uncertainty ranges (Fig. 3, blue), as the radiative forcing
increases too quickly for the multidecadal feedbacks to equili-
brate. For SSP119, where the rate of warming ceases as radiative
forcing is strongly mitigated (Fig. 1c, red) the uncertainty in cli-
mate feedback and climate sensitivity increases going into the
future as multidecadal feedbacks begin to equilibrate, with the
median and uncertainty ranges approaching their equilibrium
values towards year 2150 (Fig. 3, red, compare to Fig. 2g and h,
red).
By mid-21st century (2040–50 average) surface warming
above preindustrial is projected to reach: 1.9 (1.7–2.2) K under
SSP585 [median (2.5th–97.5th percentiles)]; 1.8 (1.7–2.1) K under
SSP370; 1.8 (1.6–2.1) K under SSP245; 1.7 (1.4–2.0) K under
SSP126; and 1.7 (1.3 to 2.0) K under SSP119. Towards the end of
the 21st century (2090–2100 average) surface warming reaches:
4.0 (3.3–4.8) K under SSP585; 3.5 (2.9–4.1) K under SSP370; 2.7
(2.0–3.5) K under SSP245; 2.0 (1.3–2.7) K under SSP126; and 1.7
(1.0–2.3) K under SSP119 (Figs 1 and 4).
The median projections of average surface warming above
preindustrial (1850–1900 average) reach or exceed 1.5 K average
warming during the period 2030–40 (Figs 1 and 4) for all SSP sce-
narios considered (Figs 1 and 4), and remain above 1.5 K for the
rest of the 21st century. Only the SSP119 and SSP126 scenarios,
each containing significant and rapid mitigation, have median
projections that remain at or below the Paris Accord’s 2.0 K tar-
get [39] over the 21st century (Figs 1 and 4).
DISCUSSION
Consider how the probabilistic projections presented here,
equations (2)–(4), compare to projections inferred from raw
complex model ensemble output, equations (5) and (6), and
complex model ensemble output that has been adjusted or
weighted by comparison to historical data, equations (7) and (8).
There is (considerably) more background information about
the climate and Earth system put into the CMIP6 models, iCMIP
(equations (5)–(8)), than into the efficient WASP box model, i
(equations (2)–(4)). A key question is then: Does the relative lack
of climate information in the efficient WASP model ensemble
impair the projections from capturing the qualitative global
warming and heating responses of the climate system to radia-
tive forcing, (equation 1), relative to the more complex CMIP6
models? Previous studies have found that when the WASP
model is trained against historic simulated warming and heat
uptake ranges from a complex model ensemble, the future
projection-ranges from WASP are in good agreement with those
from the complex model ensemble [18, 35]. Here, this question
is explored by comparing the normalized warming and heating
responses of the posterior model ensemble to a sample of
CMIP6 models for two idealized forcing scenarios (Fig. 5).
The posterior weighted WASP model ensemble is able to rea-
sonably capture the qualitative global mean surface warming,
DT, and heating, N, responses of the much more complex CMIP6
models for idealized scenarios with 1% per year CO2 increase
and instantaneous 4  CO2 forcing (Fig. 5, compare blue shading
to grey lines; equation (1)). This ability to reasonably capture the
qualitative global average responses of complex climate models
to idealized forcing scenarios provides confidence in using the
efficient WASP model posterior ensemble for future projections.
Future
work
will
explore
how
to
further
improve
a
computationally efficient model ensemble’s ability to capture
the qualitative global warming and heating responses of com-
plex models to forcing (Fig. 5). It should be noted that the WASP
model framework [19] cannot currently simulate non-linear
transitions in the climate system, and so the future projections
(Figs 1–4) assume that no such transitions occur. It may be that
complex models also underestimate the likelihood of future
instabilities [40].
Now, consider the ability of the posterior WASP ensemble
and complex CMIP6 models to quantitatively capture the histori-
cally observed trajectories of DT and N (equation 1; e.g. Table 1).
The posterior model ensemble is more quantitatively represen-
tative of the observed historic global warming (Fig. 1, compare
blue to black; Table 1) than the complex CMIP6 ensemble (Fig. 1,
compare grey to black). The posterior WASP ensemble is also
representative of the historic trajectory of N, as assessed by com-
parison of OHC anomaly (Table 1). Individual CMIP6 models may
agree well with historic surface warming (Fig. 1a). However, the
CMIP6 ensemble does not contain enough simulations that agree
well to sample all the possible ways that R and k could have
evolved to reproduce the observed trajectories of DT and N,
equation (1). Also, each CMIP model represents the best estimate
of the model developers, and there is not a coordinated effort to
sample parameter space across the different models.
In contrast, the prior ensemble generated here samples tens
of millions of possible historic R and k trajectory combinations
(Fig. 2, black dashed lines) using a Monte Carlo approach with
some assumed prior information (e.g. equations (C1)–(C4)).
From these prior ensemble members, those that lead to historic
DT and N representative of observed warming and heat content
anomalies are extracted and weighted to form the posterior
(Figs 1a and 2, red; Fig. 3; Table 1).
The 90% range in equilibrium climate sensitivity in the joint
probability distribution generated here (1.5–4.6 K) is similar to
the ‘likely’ range in Ref. [1] of 1.5–4.5 K. The 50th, 83rd and 95th
percentiles obtained here for Sequil, of 2.9, 4.1 and 4.6 K, are simi-
lar to the baseline calculations in the recent Sherwood et al.’s re-
view [2], of 3.1, 3.9 and 4.7 K, respectively. However, the 5th and
17th percentiles obtained here for Sequil, of 1.5 and 1.7 K, are less
than the Sherwood et al. [2] values, of 2.3 and 2.6 K, respectively,
and more in keeping with the earlier IPCC assessment [1]. This
agreement with the posterior probabilistic projection of equilib-
rium climate sensitivity (Fig. 2h) to previous analyses [1, 2] pro-
vides confidence with the joint probabilistic projections of
surface warming and climate feedback presented here (Figs 1, 3
and 4).
The agreement with observational estimates of warming
and independent estimates of climate sensitivity support that
the probabilistic projections presented here (Figs 1–4; equations
(2)–(4)) should be preferred to any projections inferred directly
from the raw CMIP6 output, without making any correction for
CMIP6 ensemble’s bias in historical simulation relative to obser-
vational reconstructions, equations (5) and (6) (Fig. 1a, grey), or
bias in climate sensitivity distribution relative to independent
assessments [2, 25].
The projections of climate sensitivity and surface warming
produced here should be considered complementary to projec-
tions made by weighting or adjusting the raw CMIP6 output us-
ing real world data (equations (7) and (8); [27, 30]), because the
approaches contain different sources of error. CMIP6 contains
more process-based constraints within background informa-
tion, whereas the projections presented here contain explicit in-
formation
from
observational
reconstructions
of
global
temperature and heat content anomalies (Table 1).

A key difference is that here, observational reconstructions of
surface warming and OHC anomaly are used in the extraction of
the posterior model ensemble. This means that an ensemble mem-
ber is always and only used to support the probability of surface
warming above preindustrial, or climate sensitivity, being equal to
the value the ensemble member simulates. In contrast, observa-
tional information is used to infer probabilistic projections from the
CMIP ensembles [1, 27, 30] after they has been generated. This
means that the CMIP models are used to infer projections of surface
warming above preindustrial and/or climate sensitivity that are dif-
ferent from the values simulated by those models [1, 27].
Now consider the wider implications of the projections pro-
duced here (Figs 1–4). The posterior distributions find double-
peaks in fast and multidecadal climate feedback strengths
(Fig. 2). The question arises, how can we distinguish between
these double-peaks to further constrain the system and reduce
uncertainty in future projections? The larger of the two peaks
have total feedback strength that becomes more amplifying
from timescales of days to timescales of decades, with weaker
amplifying fast feedbacks (Fig. 2c) and amplifying multidecadal
feedbacks (Fig. 2d). These larger peaks are consistent with two
previous findings from the literature. First, it has been found
that the short-timescale cooling from volcanic aerosols may be
smaller than expected relative to the decadal trend in warming
from greenhouse emissions [41]. Secondly, a majority of com-
plex models tested show increasing amplifying feedbacks on
multidecadal timescales from the sea surface temperature pat-
tern effect [42]. Future work will consider how to rigorously
combine the distributions identified here (Fig. 2) with other lines
of evidence from the literature [41, 42] to help reduce uncer-
tainty in future warming and climate sensitivity.
The globally agreed Paris Climate Accord aims to restrict
global mean surface warming to <2.0 K warning above prein-
dustrial, and preferably <1.5 K above preindustrial [39]. The
results of this study indicate that the current decade may be the
last
with
average
temperature
anomaly
below
the
Paris
Accord’s 1.5 K target [39], even with rapid and significant miti-
gation implemented as in scenarios SSP119 or SSP126. The pri-
ority now is mitigating enough to remain under the 2.0 K target,
with an almost 50% chance of 11-year average warming exceed-
ing 2.0 K this century under SSP126 and a very high likelihood
(>95%) of exceeding 2.0 K under SSP245.

APPENDICES
APPENDIX A: CHOICE OF CMIP6 MODELS IN
THE SAMPLE
This study uses the sub-sample of CMIP6 models considered by
Nijsse et al. [29] for the speciﬁc scenario and property relevant
to each ﬁgure. Table A1 contains the list of models included
within each ﬁgure panel.
APPENDIX B: CLIMATE FEEDBACK FOR
UNIFORM AND SPATIALLY VARYING FORCING
The global average outgoing radiation (both shortwave and
longwave) at the top of the atmosphere, Rout in W m2, is
expressed using the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, rSB in W m2
K4, the global average surface temperature, T in K, the local
greenhouse fraction, f (the global average longwave radiation
escaping into space divided by the longwave radiation emitted
from the surface), the average solar radiation incident per unit
area across the Earth’s surface, Isolar in W m2, and the local al-
bedo a, via,
Rout ¼ 4rSBfT4 þ Isolara
(B1)
The total climate feedback ktotal (for the sign convention used
here) is deﬁned as the change in global outgoing radiation per
unit global mean surface warming. Therefore, to express k we
differentiate Rout with respect to T, noting that rSB and Isolar are
unaffected by surface temperatures,
ktotal ¼ @out
@T
¼ 4rSBfT3 þ rT4 @f
@T þ Isolar
@a
@T
(B2)
where we note that the terms f, T, IS and a refer to global
averages.
It takes some ﬁnite amount of time for the greenhouse frac-
tion, f, and the surface albedo, a, to change in response to a sur-
face temperature, T. Thus, the instantaneous climate feedback
response,
known
as
the
Planck
feedback,
is
given
by
kP ¼ 4rSBfT3, equation (B2). Using an estimate of f ¼ 0:62 6 0:02
(from the mean and standard deviation of ﬁve observational
reconstructions in Ref. [9]), and global mean T ¼ 287 6 0:15 K
(from Ref. [43]), gives kP ¼ 3:3 6 0:2 W m2 K1. The contribution
of rT4 @f
@T þ Isolar @a
@T then evolves over different timescales as fast
and multidecadal feedback processes respond. Here, we con-
sider the impact of the instantaneous Planck feedback, kP, the
fast climate feedback, kf , and the multidecadal feedback, kmd,
such that on long timescales, ktotal ¼ kP þ kf þ kmd.
APPENDIX C
This study adopts the notation for a lognormal distribution of
Lognormal l; r2


, where l and r are the mean and standard de-
viation of the underlying normal distribution such that el is the
median of the lognormal distribution and r2 ¼ ln 1 þ r2
LN=l2
LN


,
where rLN and lLN are the standard deviation and mean of the
lognormal distribution respectively.
Since the conditions 1–5 (sub-section ‘New prior distributions
of climate feedback parameters’) apply over all timescales, the
conditions must apply separately to the each of the prior distri-
butions for kP, kP þ kf and kequil ¼ kP þ kf þ kmd. For each climate
feedback term, kP, kf and kmd; a translated lognormal distribu-
tion is adopted with three choices to set: the distribution’s mini-
mum value, median value and uncertainty. For the jth climate
feedback term this translated lognormal distribution is written,
kj  Lognormal
ln lj  kj:min

; ln

r2
j
lj  kj:min

2
0
@
1
A
0
@

A þ kj:min
(C1)
where kj:min is the minimum value that the jth climate feedback
can take to satisfy the ﬁve conditions on climate feedback and
sensitivity priors, lj  kj:min is the difference between the distri-
bution’s median and the minimum values, and r2
j is the vari-
ance of the distribution.
First, consider the Planck feedback term, kP. The instanta-
neous climate feedback must satisfy condition 1, kP 2 ð0; þ1Þ,
so the minimum possible value is kP:min ¼ 0. From observational
constraints on kP (Appendix B), we have a best estimate

(median) of lP ¼ 3:3, and a standard deviation of rP ¼ 0:1 [2, 20].
Substituting these values for kP:min, lP and rP into equation (9)
gives the prior probability distribution (Fig. 2a),

(C2)
For the fast and multidecadal feedback terms a position of ig-
norance is adopted to produce uninformed distributions. Now
consider the fast feedback distribution, kf. First, the total cli-
mate feedback on multiday timescales, the sum of the instanta-
neous
plus
fast
feedback
terms,
must
be
positive:
kPlanck þ kf 2 ð0; þ1Þ. Thus, the minimum value that the fast cli-
mate feedback term can take depends on the value has been
assigned to the Planck feedback, and is equal to minus the
Planck feedback, kf:min ¼ kP.
Secondly, to adopt a prior position of ignorance about
whether the fast feedback term will amplify or damp surface
warming, the uninformed median of fast climate feedback dis-
tribution must be lf ¼ 0. This produces a distribution such that
fast feedbacks have an equal prior likelihood of amplifying
(kf < 0) and damping (kf > 0) surface warming. Thus, the differ-
ence between the median and minimum values of fast climate
feedback distribution is also dependent on the value of the
Planck feedback, lf  kf:min ¼ kP.
Lastly, the uncertainty in the fast feedback distribution
must be set. Too small an uncertainty would put too much
prior likelihood to small magnitude fast climate feedback
values, kf, while too large uncertainty would place too much
prior likelihood on large magnitude climate feedback values
leading to extreme amplifying or damping of warming. To
strike an uninformed balance it is assumed that the prior
uncertainty in fast feedback scales with the difference be-
tween
the
median
and
minimum,
r2
f ¼ lf  kf:min
ð
Þ2 ¼ k2
P.
Thus, the standard deviation of the distribution is set to be
equal to the magnitude of the maximum possible amplifying
feedback, rf ¼ kP.
Substituting these values for kf:min, lf and rf into equation
(C1) gives the prior fast climate feedback distribution (Fig. 2c),
kf  Lognormal lnkP; ln2
ð
Þ  kP
(C3)
These same arguments are now applied for the multideca-
dal climate feedback distribution. The total climate feedback
on multidecadal timescales, the sum of instantaneous, fast
and
multidecadal
feedback
terms,
must
be
positive:
kP þ kf þ kmd 2 ð0; þ1Þ, so kmd:min ¼  kP þ kf
ð
Þ. A position of ig-
norance is assumed about whether multidecadal feedback
will amplify or damp surface warming. Therefore, a best esti-
mate (median) of lmd ¼ 0 is chosen, such that fast feedbacks
have an equal prior likelihood of amplifying warming and
damping warming, and the difference between the median
and minimum values is lmd  kmd:min ¼ kP þ kf.
The uncertainty in multidecadal feedback scales with the dif-
ference between the median and minimum distribution values,
r2
md ¼ lmd  kmd:min
ð
Þ2 ¼ kP þ kf
ð
Þ2. Again, this gives a standard
deviation of multidecadal climate feedback distribution equal to
the
maximum
amplifying
multidecadal
feedback
value,
rmd ¼ kP  kf. Substituting these values for kmd:min, lmd and
rmd into eq. (9) gives the prior fast climate feedback distribution
(Fig. 2d),
kmd  Lognormal ln kP þ kf
ð
Þ; ln2



kP þ kf
ð
Þ
(C4)
For each simulation in the prior WASP model ensemble, the
Planck feedback is selected ﬁrst from a Lognormal distribu-
tion using equation (C2). Then, the value of the Planck feed-
back is used to generate a fast climate feedback value from a
Lognormal distribution using equation (C3). Lastly, the Planck
and fast climate feedback values are used to generate a value
for the multidecadal feedback from a Lognormal distribution
using equation (C4). This method produces prior distributions
that satisfy the ﬁve conditions adopted here for climate sensi-
tivity and climate feedback values over all timescales (Fig. 2).
