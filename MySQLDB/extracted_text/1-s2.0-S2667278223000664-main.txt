Limiting global temperatures in line with the Paris Agreement requires deep and urgent cuts to emissions this
decade from across all sectors, including healthcare. Yet, it can often take many years, even decades, for evi-
dence from health research to be translated into practice. This article explores how researchers in the climate
change and health ﬁeld can and perhaps should operate in such an environment. Should they shift towards
‘action-oriented’ research? Should they pursue alternative pathways, such as advocacy? Should they take to
the streets? First, I describe how value judgements can shape scientiﬁc research and discourse, and, in turn,
policy and practice; I then discuss the recent history of advocacy amongst climate scientists and draw parallels
with the experience of health researchers. Finally, I consider some possible ways to navigate the tensions
between research and advocacy inherent to climate change and health research. I conclude that greater reﬂex-
ivity upon the values underpinning our work on can help researchers navigate the challenges we face.

Main text
“Are you a researcher or an activist?”, I was asked at a recent evalu-
ation of my PhD progress. It was an unusual question in the circum-
stances; not the least given what had been discussed so far:
publications, work in progress, teaching, timelines −the usual. The
question caught me off-guard. ‘I am foremost a doctor, committed to
evidence based public health, aiming to produce quality research on cli-
mate change and net zero healthcare’, I replied. Adding for clariﬁcation,
‘I do not believe activism would jeopardise either’. The examiner brieﬂy
paused, then moved on. The moment passed but the question has
dogged me since.
I have been to a handful of protests, but not taken part in direct
action. I have engaged in public debate but strive to take a balanced
view. I do not consider myself an activist. The examiner was, how-
ever, picking up on the kinds of issues I am exploring and how I am
exploring them, in particular, a project closely aligned to my research
area, in which we explored how to make the Norwegian healthcare
sector climate neutral. Our project was funded by a university
research initiative supporting ‘actionable knowledge to sustainably
transform society’ and the work was undertaken as part of my
employment.
We
brought
together
relevant
stakeholders
and
published a report. When the Norwegian government signed up to
the COP26 health programme,1 this was a success; in a way, partly
our success. The examiner’s question seemed to being prodding at
whether I, as founder and leader of the project, had an agenda? Was
this activism [1] behind a veneer of research?
There are clearly tensions between scientiﬁc research and activ-
ism. Whereas scientiﬁc research involves systematic study of phe-
nomena
through
observation,
documentation
and
the
use
of
evidence, activism seeks to advance a speciﬁc cause.2 Our project
was, I believe, a transparent and fair overview of what is known;
however, the question raises several important issues relevant to my
PhD research project −which explores different perspectives on fair
pathways to low-carbon healthcare −as well as the broader shift in
academia towards policy impact and actionable research [2]. A key
starting point for my work is understanding how our value judge-
ments can shape scientiﬁc research and, in turn, inﬂuence policy and
practice.

Weber and the value-free ideal
There is a long-standing tradition within philosophy of science of
analysing objectivity, including how researchers’ own values can
impact scientiﬁc results and outputs. In his inﬂuential essay on objec-
tivity in the social sciences, published over a century ago, sociologist
Max Weber [3] set out four stages in which this can occur:
(a) the choice of a scientiﬁc research problem
(b) the gathering of evidence in relation to the problem
(c) the acceptance of a scientiﬁc hypothesis or theory as an adequate
answer to the problem on the basis of the evidence
(d) the proliferation and application of scientiﬁc research results
Today, the rigour of scientiﬁc review and ethical approval pro-
cesses focus on the generation of evidence, namely (b), but values
exert their inﬂuence throughout the research process, from the selec-
tion of a problem (a) to the application of theory (c) and communica-
tion of results (d). Weber’s work has stimulated wide-ranging debate
ever since on the ideal of ‘value-free science’ −the view that scien-
tiﬁc ﬁndings informing democratic political decision making should
not be inﬂuenced by scientists’ value judgements −as well as the
extent to which this is achievable or even desirable [3−6].
Support for the value-free ideal is characterised by Roger Pielke’s
‘Honest Broker’ [7]. Pielke describes four idealised roles for scientists
in the policy process: the ‘pure scientist’ consumed with their own
research; ‘the science arbiter’ solely concerned with answering scien-
tiﬁc, rather than normative, questions; the ‘issue advocate’ using sci-
ence to advance speciﬁc policy alternatives; and the ‘honest broker’
(his favoured position) who presents decision makers with a broad
range of alternatives which they can narrow according to their pref-
erences and values (pg. 31). A central concern for Pielke is ‘stealth
issue advocacy’, in which scientists present their role as ‘pure scien-
tist’ or ‘science arbiter’ while advancing a political agenda under the
guise of scientiﬁc authority. This not only limits the policy alterna-
tives open to decision makers but undermines the legitimacy of sci-
entiﬁc advice in the long run.
Critics, such as Nelson and Vucetich [8] argue that the purpose of
science is not simply to generate facts but to interpret information
and synthesise it into knowledge; scientists should be impartial (i.e.
open to changing their position on the basis of sound analysis) but
not neutral to the ﬁndings nor to their responsibility, as citizens and
scientists, to advocate. In their view, the forces driving climate
change are so favoured by the dominant institutions and policies that
abstaining from advocacy is “a de facto support for these processes”;
thus, far less time should be spent pondering whether to advocate
and far more time spent on how to do so appropriately. Simon Don-
ner [9] conceptualises the role of the scientists as a science-advocacy
continuum moving from purely objective judgements to normative
ethical judgments, steadily increasing the inﬂuence of world view,
scientiﬁc uncertainty and risk to their professional credibility. He
advises scientists to spend time ﬁnding their own place on the spec-
trum. Heather Draper [10] has developed a taxonomy of activities
speciﬁcally undertaken by bioethics researchers, ranging from ‘pure
philosophy’ to ‘extreme vested interest activism’. She argues, simi-
larly to Donner, that given the risks and rewards at stake, the decision
whether to undertake advocacy is a personal decision and dependant
on their research area.
More generally, Capstick and colleagues [11] are amongst the
growing number of climate scientists explicitly calling upon col-
leagues to critically reﬂect upon their positionality as ‘neutral’
observers, and question how well “these inherited norms are serving
us in a time of existential environmental crisis?”. This view reﬂects
some of the longstanding concerns of Science and Technologies (STS)
scholars, namely Sheila Jasanoff [12], regarding the entanglement of
ethical, legal and political dimensions of science, the evolving social
contract between science and society, and what to do in practice.
The central criticisms of the ‘value-free ideal’ are thus two-fold:
ﬁrstly, that it is unattainable −the act of developing and communi-
cating policy relevant ﬁndings inherently involves value judgements;
and secondly, that the value-free ideal is not, in fact, the ideal −sci-
entists should rely on value judgements to both better incorporate
ethical aspects when communicating policy-relevant results, includ-
ing to correct for the historically systematic and ongoing exclusion of
groups or ideas [4]. For those who believe the value-free ideal is
desirable, if not fully attainable, a key question is how to achieve it?
‘Value-free’ climate science in practice
A pragmatic approach commonly used in climate science is objec-
tivity through measurement and quantiﬁcation (i.e. ‘mechanical
objectivity’) [3]. Although quantiﬁcation does not avoid value judge-
ments in the research process described by Weber −and certainly
has its critics [13,14] −the argument follows that it minimises the
inﬂuence of a researcher’s value judgements; trust in numbers
replacing trust in individual scientists [3]. A prominent example from
climate policy is the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), often described as
the most important metric in climate economics [15].
The SCC integrates different aspects of the climate system and the
global economy, including human mortality impacts, to calculate the
economic damage of a tonne of carbon emissions. The metric is
highly sensitive to social values, including the relative value placed
upon early and delayed costs, national and international impacts, and
future and present beneﬁts [15]. As such, estimates vary consider-
ably, making it difﬁcult to agree upon the correct starting point. For
example, in the USA, a recent re-assessment reached a central esti-
mate 3.6 times the ﬁgure used by the current government [16], which
is itself 10 −17 times higher than the ﬁgure used by the previous
Administration [17].
The ability to reach different conclusions from the same data
highlights a challenge at the heart of science-policy discourse which
both supporters and opponents of the ‘value-free ideal’ seek to
address. Within the climate literature, this is vitally important to
wide-ranging efforts to calculate non-market damages −such as bio-
diversity loss, ecosystem degradation and human health impacts −
inequality of impacts, challenges to adaptation, and low-likelihood
but potentially catastrophic ‘tail risks’ [18]. Philosopher Stephen
Gardiner [19] captures this set of conceptual challenges in his
description of climate change as a “perfect moral storm” of interna-
tional and intergenerational challenges compounded by the lack of
theoretical tools to navigate the problems we face.
Within academia, different disciplinary perspectives lead to major
differences in the perceived urgency and scope of action [18]. As
stated by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), responses
to climate change are contingent on value judgements and ultimately
“a matter of ethics” [20]. However, perplexing as these issues may be,
paralysis is not a solution. Climate change is characterised by a nar-
row window of opportunity to cut emissions and avoid widespread,
irreversible climate impacts [21]. A longstanding and increasingly
pressing question is, therefore, by what methods are scientists justi-
ﬁed in drawing attention to climate change?
Climate scientists raising the alarm
Climate scientists have long bridged the divide between science
and advocacy. Perhaps most famously illustrated by the 1988 Con-
gressional hearing of then NASA Director, James Hansen, in which he
stated: “it is time to stop wafﬂing” [22]. Yet, he faced dissent from fel-
low scientists at the time. While agreeing with his message and

appreciating the attention it drew to the issue, they spurned Hansen’s
“unscientiﬁc method” of communicating evidence, which “fails to
hedge his conclusions with the appropriate qualiﬁers that reﬂect the
imprecise science of climate modelling” [23]. Although the bar has
shifted from speeches in congress to the relative merits of civil dis-
obedience, the complaint is still levelled at climate scientists today.
This concern, closest to Pielke’s ‘Honest Broker’, holds that the
central tenet of trust in scientiﬁc authority should not risk being jeop-
ardised through perceived bias or unqualiﬁed statements, even if it is
effective in shaping climate policy. A growing body of empirical evi-
dence suggests a somewhat more nuanced picture. Climate scientist
advocacy is not only effective [11], it can actually increase the credi-
bility of scientists [24], especially when the opinion being advocated
is shared by the majority of the public [25,26]. By engaging in acts of
protest, scientists seem to help break negative stereotypes of protes-
tors which can enhance acceptability of activism amongst the general
public [27], and may strengthen the wider social movement for
timely and effective climate action [28,29]. This emerging research
refutes the view that scientiﬁc advocacy inevitably involves an effec-
tiveness/credibility trade-off [30].
A growing number of climate scientists are questioning whether
the traditional scientiﬁc approach (i.e. generating evidence which
informs policy) can seriously contribute to addressing the climate
challenge at all. In a widely read article published in 2021, “The Trag-
edy of Climate Change Science” [31], International Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) lead author Bruce Glavovic, and colleagues, argued
that scientists have been misled, “gaslighted” into thinking the politi-
cal failure to act on climate change is a scientiﬁc failure to generate
the right evidence. Climate science has reached a dead end, they
argue, “the science-society contract is irrevocably broken” and a “mora-
torium” on climate research is needed “until governments are willing
to fulﬁl their responsibilities in good faith”. For a growing number of
climate scientists, the currency of academic success can no longer be
publications, but action; real, tangible evidence that the policy land-
scape is shifting fast enough to avoid catastrophic climate change.
Today, thousands of climate scientists are engaging in direct
action, facing arrest, potential jail time and a criminal record [32].
The younger generation of climate scientists are increasingly, and
deliberately, visible in their climate advocacy. Writing in Science
about her combination of climate research and activism, Leehi Yona
states that “caring about justice doesn’t undermine my ability to con-
duct rigorous research or cloud my conclusions.”, going on to commend
junior colleagues who rather than “tiptoe around the edges of wicked
problems, step right into the ﬁre” [33]. The loss of trust in science will
not stem from us taking to the streets, this argument goes, but from
the failure to avert catastrophe.
Health advocacy
It is now clear that climate change presents a major challenge to
health and health systems, described by WHO as the “the single big-
gest health threat facing humanity” [34]. A movement for climate
action is now well underway in the health sector, as reﬂected in the
growth of national and international climate and health organisations
and special interest groups within professional organisations. These
grassroots networks of educated and organised climate-health advo-
cates are speaking out in the media, contacting legislators and lobby-
ing for pro-climate policies, emboldened by the knowledge that the
health arguments for climate action resonate with policy makers and
the wider public alike [35−37]. From the local level to the global pol-
icy arena, there are many ways health professionals can take action
[38,39] while elevating the voices of non-expert citizens and commu-
nity groups often sidelined from these debates [40].
In keeping with the long tradition of medical activism [41], some
healthcare professionals are also engaging in non-violent direct-
action (or civil disobedience), with the support of prominent voices
in the ﬁeld [42,43]; donning scrubs emblazoned “Doctor” and stetho-
scopes while staging ‘die-ins’3 in city centres and ‘glue-ons’4 at the
banks funding new fossil fuel projects, making the professional iden-
tify integral to the protest movement itself. Direct action, has long
been considered risky for professional standing and career progres-
sion [44] and critics continue to question whether the infusion of
medicine and climate activism undermines professional credibility
and threatens the sacred trust between society and the medical pro-
fession [45−47]. By contrast, for the activist group Doctors for Extinc-
tion Rebellion, non-violent civil disobedience is not only squarely
within the duties set out by the UK’s General Medical Council [48], it
is “an evidence based, public health intervention that works” [49]. This
claim is supported by the IPCC which states with ‘high conﬁdence’
that social movements, of which direct action is a part, have played
an important role in inﬂuencing more ambitious climate policy [11].
In practice there is a catch: since civil disobedience, by design, often
disrupts people’s lives, there is a perceived risk that this can under-
mine popular support −a bind Feinberg et al. term “the activist’s
dilemma” [50]. This tension between awareness raising and building
an inclusive, popular mass movement is one reason Extinction Rebel-
lion, an organisation previously renowned for non-violent public dis-
ruption, announced a temporary shift in tactics in 2023, prioritising
“relationships over roadblocks” [51].
As trusted voices in communities across the globe, the health sec-
tor has an inﬂuential role in forging such relationships for stronger,
more inclusive and equitable climate action [52]. Given health profes-
sionals often express concern about climate change and recognise
their role in bringing attention to the health impacts, a broader ques-
tion is why more don’t more get involved? A global study exploring
the views of almost 5000 healthcare professionals found the primary
barriers were time constraints (54%) and a lack of knowledge (41%)
[53]. Other reasons included believing it would make no difference
(31%), little support from peers (22%) and feeling the topic is too con-
troversial (16%). Interestingly, only a small minority mentioned the
perceived personal or professional risk (14%). This mirrors the ﬁnd-
ings of the wider communication research which indicates scientiﬁc
researchers are more concerned with whether their advocacy will
work than what their colleagues will think [54].
Clinician scientists drawn towards climate change and health
research are often driven by concerns about climate change and global
justice. Strong personal interests are, at times, recognised to be valuable
for medical researchers −such as by allowing insights informed by per-
sonal experience, or facilitating trusting engagement with otherwise
difﬁcult to access groups. However, they are then also more open to
the critique of being closed-minded when interpreting the results or
disclosing interests. While the worry of being branded untrustworthy
may be enough to make some researchers avoid any form of activism
at all costs, what about the others that do? What about those who hold
a deep conviction that something is wrong −that climate change is a
truly exceptional, civilisational threat and traditional academia is too
slow for the rapid societal transformation this demands? That the
online petitions aren’t working; the political process is more interested
in mid-terms than mid-century; that we are sleep walking into disaster
and the only option left is to ‘disobey’?
Navigating tensions
For Weber, scientiﬁc objectivity is not about a “statesman-like”
balancing of various evaluations, settling for the middle ground −
that is for the political apparatus; the role of the scientist is to present
the extreme positions with clarity on the relevant facts [55]. Scien-
tists have, in the form of the IPCC, a common reference point on the

current scientiﬁc knowledge, albeit at a challenging science-policy
interface [56]. The question is no longer if climate change is happen-
ing, or if it is a threat to health, but how to compensate those who are
harmed, the appropriate balance between costs and beneﬁts, and the
political priority of effective action.
One option open to researchers is to hold resolutely to presenting
what is known: the world has already experienced 1.2 °C of warming
above pre-industrial temperatures; to have even a 50% chance to stay-
ing within the Paris Agreement global emissions must reach net zero
by 2050; a failure to act will have widespread human and societal con-
sequences, worsening with each fraction of a degree of warming; and
further research will reﬁne projections of the magnitude, location, and
time when these impacts will occur. Another extreme is to engage in
the policy process more fully and, in the vein of Glavovic et al., lobby
governments to “fulﬁl their responsibilities in good faith” [31].
With the health argument for climate action ﬁnding its place on
the international stage, we as climate and health researchers are
increasingly faced with the same tensions which climate scientists
have been navigating for decades. We must recognise that as
researchers we operate within a set of constraints, borne out of
employment requirements and professional obligations, which are
distinct from our wider civic responsibilities. It is here, as researchers,
where Weber’s analysis remains most poignant. The type of research
questions we ask (a), how we answer them (b), which theories we
accept (c) and how we disseminate our work (d) are both fundamen-
tal to the research process and inherently embedded in our social,
cultural and political context.
Ultimately, researchers operate within the maelstrom of social
values −not apart from it. Science has always been political and med-
icine no less so. As Mary Bassett, former Health Commissioner of New
York, wrote in Nature at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, “when
we decide that issues such as structural racism, climate change or
income inequality are ‘outside our lane’, we betray both the professional
reputation of our ﬁeld and the health of the people we serve.” [57]. Sci-
entist advocacy should be undertaken with care. It is up to each of us
to ﬁnd our place at the science-policy interface; however, refraining
from engaging in the policy process is not a neutral act. Greater
reﬂexivity and transparency on the normative assumptions under-
pinning our work will increase our public accountability and help
navigate the tensions we face [2].
Conclusion
I began this article by considering the relationship between sci-
ence and advocacy in climate and health research, drawing upon my
own experience as a PhD candidate. High-quality research will
remain vital to informing good climate policy; however, it will not
necessarily lead to action at the pace required to stay within interna-
tional climate agreements and protect human health. As researchers,
we must decide how to respond. To gather more evidence; to engage
policy makers; to take to the streets? While the fear of jeopardising
public trust is a valid concern, inaction can also lead to a lack of trust.
In this decisive decade for climate action, ‘staying in our lane’ is not a
neutral act, it must be justiﬁed. Despite his clear stance against
‘stealth issue advocacy’, Pielke [7] recognised the huge societal value
of engagement between science and policy, stating: “if scientists ever
had the choice to remain above the fray, they no longer have this lux-
ury”. This work started with a simple question: ‘are you a researcher
or an activist?’. It ends with another: must I choose?
