Climate change interacts with social and biological factors to exacerbate the vulnerabilities and health
inequities of people in displacement, with particularly severe implications for women and girls. In 2022, over
100 million people −1 in every 78 people in the world −were forced to ﬂee their homes to a location within
or beyond their country’s borders, due to climatic or other man-made catastrophes. Most displaced people
are housed in communities already experiencing climatic stress, exacerbating the risk of water insecurity,
food insecurity, disease, struggles over resources, marginalization, and conﬂict between host and displaced
populations. Amid the social upheaval caused by displacement, we call for a gendered approach to fostering
resilience, with a particular emphasis on women. In this perspective piece, we advocate for policy and pro-
gram changes that respond to the unique challenges and circumstances of displaced women and locally
derived solutions that promote resilience. We start by providing an overview of health inequities during dis-
placement, exacerbated by climate change, and then examine how gender interacts with displacement to
shape women’s health and wellbeing. We close with an illustrative example of Rohingya women displaced
in Bangladesh who have adapted technology to combat climate change and mitigate social and health inequi-
ties to build resilience, even under severe restrictions. Gender-informed research on health, climate change,
and resilience in contexts of humanitarian disasters and mass population displacement can elucidate the
effectiveness of culturally- and contextually- speciﬁc interventions over the short- and long-term.

Displacement, climate change, and global trends
Identiﬁed as the two greatest threats to human development dec-
ades ago [1], climate change and health inequities interact with social
and biological factors, exacerbating vulnerabilities of already margin-
alized groups. These synergetic crises seriously affect many vulnera-
ble groups across the world, including those who have been forcibly
displaced due to natural disasters, armed conﬂict, and threat of per-
secution. Forced migration is the involuntary mass movement of pop-
ulations for whom remaining in their location of origin is no longer
safe or tenable [2]. Climate change is a salient driver of forced dis-
placement around the world [3], and mass population displacement
also exacerbates climate change [4]. Long-term displacement causes
signiﬁcant strain on the local and environmental resources of host
communities, which themselves are typically under-resourced and
experiencing the effects of climate change. For example, 80 % of dis-
placed people globally ﬂed to areas already experiencing acute food
insecurity and malnutrition [5] and high exposure to climatic events
such as extreme temperatures and storms [6], with many of these
areas simultaneously at risk for acute climate-related disasters such
as ﬂooding or storms. Independent of each other, climate change and
displacement heighten risk for a variety of infectious diseases, non-
infectious respiratory distress, and vector-borne diseases; risk that is
exacerbated when they co-occur [7−9].
In 2022, the number of displaced people exceeded the sobering
milestone of 100 million [10]. Climate-induced environmental disas-
ters (e.g., ﬂoods, storms, droughts) were responsible for nearly two-
thirds (62 %) of people internally displaced for the ﬁrst time in 2021
[11] and are the primary driver of internal displacement in East Asia
and Paciﬁc regions [10,12]. While those displaced by environmental
disasters may return to their homes more quickly than those

displaced by conﬂict [13], some environmental disasters (e.g., river-
bank erosion and sea level rise) unequivocally remove the option to
return [14,15]. In contrast to internally displaced populations, more
than three-quarters (77 %) of the world’s refugee population face
long-term displacement (10−26 years on average) outside their
country of origin [16].
Some countries bear the dual burden of mass internal displace-
ments triggered by natural disasters exacerbated by climate change,
in addition to hosting long-term refugees. This article focuses on Ban-
gladesh, a nation that experiences increasingly severe calamities such
as riverbank erosions, extreme ﬂooding, increased freshwater salin-
ity, rising temperatures, sea-level rise, and hurricanes due to climate
change [17]. Between 2008 and 2022, over 100 unique extreme cli-
mate events in Bangladesh caused 17 million internal displacements
of people [18], creating myriad health risks for displaced and host
communities, alike [17]. The 2017 arrival of Rohingya refugees ﬂee-
ing persecution in Burma/Myanmar to Bangladesh has culminated in
the world’s largest refugee camp (Cox’s Bazaar), exacerbating health
and environmental concerns due to the ﬁerce competition for natural
resources (e.g., water, ﬁrewood), accelerating deforestation, and an
over-stretched health system [19,20].
The distinct phases of displacement shape health priorities and
needs. During the chaos of initial displacement, people are forced to
forsake physical property and assets; they leave behind critical medi-
cations, physical aides, and medical records; and, those with chronic
illness abandon intensive treatment programs [21]. In search of
safety, people relocate to places typically ill-prepared to shelter and
provide healthcare to large groups. The widespread lack of disaster
preparedness holds true across high-income countries, as was seen
in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in the United States [22], and
particularly so in low-resource contexts such as Bangladesh, where
seasonal monsoons cause deadly ﬂoods, landslides, and displacement
within and beyond refugee camps [6,23,24]. Daily life persists but
under circumstances fraught with uncertainty [25]. The loss of ﬁnan-
cial assets, sources of income, and material goods severely limit their
ability to provide for themselves and their children. Formal education
processes stall, affecting learning, psychosocial well-being, and socio-
economic outcomes, particularly for women and girls [26,27].
Who is displaced depends on the disaster context spurring the cri-
sis and mass migration. Across all displacements, the proportions of
displaced men and women across age categories are similar [10]. In
2021, 41 % of all forcibly displaced people were children, often unac-
companied minors [10]. However, Rohingya children comprised as
many as 68 % of those who ﬂed to Bangladesh [19]. Only 6 % of dis-
placed people are aged 60 and above [11,28].
Drivers of mass displacement intersect with social constructions
of gender, affecting rates of survival and morbidity. Natural disasters
kill and injure more women than men, with surviving women
experiencing higher rates of disability [29]. This disparity is due less
to biological factors (i.e. strength) and more to gendered social
norms, such as girls and women not learning to swim or climb trees,
wearing restrictive clothing, and shouldering caregiving responsibili-
ties [29,30]. Higher rates of displacement following natural disasters
are experienced by women-headed households and those living with
disabilities [9,31]. Further disaggregation is needed to identify pat-
terns among intersecting social locations and identities.
Gender dynamics and health inequities in displacement
Pre-existing and emergent disparities shape lived experiences and
health outcomes at every phase of displacement, with particularly
severe consequences for women and girls [26,27]. Indeed, the inter-
section of socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and caste shape expe-
riences of displacement by underscoring privileges and exacerbating
disparities. At the same time, displacement destabilizes and chal-
lenges established ideas, values, and beliefs that regulate gender roles
and social status [32]. In displacement, people no longer have access
to their usual means for fulﬁlling their roles vis-a-vis their families,
households, and community [25]. As every aspect of life destabilizes,
displacement pushes the boundaries of prescribed gender roles,
oftentimes out of sheer necessity, which can serve to exacerbate and/
or transform inequities to varying degrees.
Displacement-induced shifts in roles intertwine with socioeco-
nomic status and capacities to generate income and provide for one’s
family [33]. Women who are accustomed to earning income in infor-
mal markets may readily ﬁgure out ways to generate a modicum of
earnings in displacement that propel them into the position of the
main breadwinner for the family. Separated from supportive net-
works, women may turn to male spouses (if present) for help with
household and childrearing responsibilities, not expected in the past.
Shouldering the burden of providing and caring for one’s family can
come at a cost, with short- and long-term effects. The scenario of
“women getting the job done,” albeit under dire circumstances, is
juxtaposed with characterizations of men’s experiences focused on
their loss of status and productivity, and diminished masculinities
[34]. Tensions between new and old roles can arise [35] and trigger
interpersonal conﬂict [32]. Climate change exacerbates gendered
health inequities in displacement with regard to food and nutrition;
water, sanitation, and hygiene; health; and violence and exploitation.
Food and nutrition insecurity
Globally, women and girls experience hunger and food insecurity
at greater rates than their male counterparts [36]; a trend exacer-
bated by displacement [37]. Women and girls consume smaller por-
tions, skip meals, or share food to ensure that the males in the family
have more food to eat [38]; this was reported by 82 % of women
(non-Rohingya) surveyed in a disaster-affected region of Bangladesh
[39]. Seeking solutions to food insecurity often falls to women; these
gendered expectations persist in displacement [40] while women
also mitigate emergent issues, e.g., camps running out of food rations
due to overcrowding and insufﬁcient disaster relief [41,42]. To sup-
plement insufﬁcient rations and poor dietary diversity, displaced
women attempt to grow food in camps [42], though this is limited by
insufﬁcient resources such as uncontaminated water and soil. Collec-
tively these challenges place women - whose nutritional needs vary
with unique phases of their life course −physically at risk. For exam-
ple, pre-menopausal women have 66 % higher iron requirements
compared to men due to menstruation [43], and 1 in 3 women in
emergency situations suffer from anemia when this gap is not ﬁlled
[36]. Women have increased caloric, protein, and micronutrient
needs during pregnancy and lactation [43], yet in displacement are
often considered the ones to “eat last and least” [36]. Pregnant and
lactating women have been identiﬁed as two of the highest-need
subgroups of Rohingya, with a large proportion requiring prevention
and in-patient treatment of malnutrition [44].
Water insecurity, sanitation, and hygiene
The majority of displaced settings −up to 77 % of transitional set-
tings [45] and 42−47 % of refugee camps [46] −do not meet the
UNHCR standard of 20 L/person/day of water necessary to sustain
basic cooking and hygiene needs, placing women and girls whose life
stages dictate higher water requirements at increased risk of health
disparities [47]. Menstruating women and adolescents in displace-
ment may lack sufﬁcient water and privacy to wash and dry men-
strual rags properly, leading to urinary tract infections and perineal
rashes [48]. Women’s water requirements increase by 11 % during
pregnancy to support fetal circulation, amniotic ﬂuids, and expansion
of blood volume and by 44 % during lactation to support milk synthe-
sis [49]; failing to meet these requirements is associated with dehy-
dration in hot and humid climates [50]. Water insecurity and poor

sanitation and hygiene threaten key predictors of infant and child
health such as breastfeeding [51,52], dietary diversity [53], growth
[54], and development [55]. Globally, women and girls tend to be
responsible for collecting and managing household water, which can
contribute to injury and other adverse health outcomes [56].
Sexual and reproductive health
Women’s sexual and reproductive health needs are often over-
looked in displacement. Destroyed supply chains and reduced
options for contraception increase the number of unplanned preg-
nancies in tenuous conditions [30,57]. Even when services are avail-
able, barriers to accessing healthcare place displaced women and
girls at high risk for unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortions, and
their sequelae [58]. Furthermore, restrictive gender norms governing
sexual activity can stigmatize the uptake of sexual and reproductive
health services. Among displaced Rohingya women and girls in Ban-
gladesh, for instance, low uptake of contraceptives is attributed to
misinformation linking contraception to infertility and death, reli-
gious prohibition, and sociocultural pressure to maintain “Rohingya
identity” following decades of persecution and domination [59].
Obstetric and perinatal outcomes
As many as sixty percent of global maternal deaths occur in
humanitarian emergencies [60]. Drivers of displacement affect the
availability of antenatal and obstetric services, as well as access and
uptake [61]. For example, the 2005 tsunami destroyed or closed half
of maternity clinics on the eastern coast of Sri Lanka and in Indonesia
killed 1650 midwives and destroyed infrastructure and roadways
[30]. In Bangladesh, experiencing multiple climate-related displace-
ments was associated with receiving no antenatal care [62]. Less than
half of displaced Rohingya in Bangladesh have given birth at a health
facility [63], increasing risk of infection, hemorrhage, and other poor
perinatal outcomes. Preterm birth and underweight babies have
been associated with severe heat and tsunamis [30,64]. Furthermore,
stress and uncertainty, limited access to food and water, and lack of
adequate pre- and post-natal care in displacement contribute to fetal
loss, reduced maternal fertility, and maternal mortality [65].
Mental health
Globally, women are at nearly twice the risk of men for depres-
sion, anxiety, and somatic symptoms from negative and stressful life
events [66]; these mental health concerns are exacerbated by the
type and severity of crises that led to displacement and during subse-
quent phases [67]. As many as 50−90 % of displaced people experi-
ence post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to natural disasters
[68,69] and conﬂict [70]. Gender disparities exacerbate the effects of
displacement stressors on women, including ﬁnancial strain, lan-
guage barriers, discrimination, resource insecurity, and loneliness,
with implications for mental health [71]. Maternal mental health fol-
lowing a disaster is a stronger predictor for child development than
prenatal biological exposures and stress [67], affecting subsequent
generations. Coping and resilience vary by context, availability of
resources, and personal characteristics, including age and gender
[72]. Yet, mental health needs in displacement often remain invisible
or unaddressed due to stigma, competing priorities, and overbur-
dened health systems.
Violence and exploitation
Violence and exploitation before, during, and after displacement
pose signiﬁcant health concerns for women and girls, in particular
[73,74]. One-third of all women experience domestic violence in their
lifetime [75], and the risk of experiencing all forms of gender-based
violence,
including
sexual
violence
and
early/forced
marriage,
increases following humanitarian disasters and forced displacement
[76]. Food insecurity in displacement has been directly linked to the
risk of sexual violence and exploitation, as well as women and girls
traveling long distances to collect water and ﬁrewood [77]. Rohingya
women, for example, were targeted for sexual violence prior to and
during their exodus from Myanmar [44]; more than half experienced
physical and sexual violence by intimate partners while in displace-
ment [78]; and they remain without adequate access to crisis services
[44].
Addressing gendered health inequities in climate-affected
displacement
Strengthening public health systems, both generally and speciﬁ-
cally in terms of resilience to climate change and disaster prepared-
ness, is one strategy to address the gendered health disparities
women and girls face [69,79]. For example, meeting women’s contra-
ception needs and providing the WHO standards for antenatal and
neonatal care is estimated to decrease rates of unintended pregnan-
cies, unsafe abortions, and maternal deaths by 68 %, 72 %, and 62 %,
respectively, across low- and middle-income countries [80], with
similar or higher rates expected in displacement. However, health
systems across the world are often ill-equipped to address the
diverse and complex health needs of displaced populations [79]. In
middle- and high-income country contexts where health systems are
considered strong, displaced people still face restrictive barriers to
care [81−83]. In low- and middle-income countries, which house the
majority of the world’s displaced peoples [10], climate change has
led to an increased burden of disease and severe weather that dis-
rupts supply chains, destroys physical and telecommunications infra-
structure, and restricts delivery of emergency and routine services
[8]. Task-shifting of medical care to community-based providers [84]
and international humanitarian organizations, particularly in refugee
camps [85], can help bridge these gaps; though the latter may have
neutral to harmful effects on the health system.
International agencies involved in providing humanitarian assis-
tance have generated substantive guidelines, standards, and resour-
ces that seek to amplify women’s sexual, reproductive, and maternal
health needs in displacement, including a minimum initial service
package for reproductive and sexual health [86]; clinical guidance for
rape and intimate partner violence [87]; mental health & psychoso-
cial support programming [72]; and minimum standards for water,
sanitation, and hygiene; food security and nutrition; and health [88],
among others. In addition to setting clear standards of care, guide-
lines highlight the importance of addressing barriers to uptake of
services, fostering women’s leadership in decision-making processes
[72], intersectoral and local-international coordination of services
[89], and activating and strengthening community resources to foster
resilience [72]. As such, they serve as an important reminder of com-
plex power dynamics and inequities at play in displacement and in
humanitarian responses, and the imperative to ensure the inclusion
of the most marginalized based on a spectrum of gender identities
and expressions, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, religion, class, dis-
ability, and caste [31,72]. Interventions for displaced populations
should preserve pre-crisis gains hard won by women and other mar-
ginalized groups, strengthen resilience, and seek to reverse long-
standing inequities [72].
Despite many advances, the global humanitarian infrastructure
still fails women in displacement when existing guidelines are not
translated into practice [90]. Insufﬁcient resources and political will
to engage diverse groups of women can result in gender-neutral
interventions that inadvertently reinforce inequities and exclude
marginalized groups. Steps to address these gaps include standardiz-
ing monitoring and evaluation indicators and making health out-
comes publicly available [91], as well as conducting research that

centers equitable engagement of marginalized groups from concep-
tualization to dissemination [91,92], drawing from critical feminist
and decolonial approaches [74,92]. Few transformative policies and
programs have been successful on a large scale in addressing gender
inequities [90,93]. Policies that integrate a critical gender perspective
are vital to surfacing economic, political, and societal dynamics that
render people vulnerable to the effects of displacement [94]. Inter-
ventions must holistically reﬂect what resilience means for displaced
women in context [94].
Displaced Rohingya women foster resilience through technology
The Rohingya are a stateless Muslim ethnic group considered one
of the most persecuted groups in the world, having suffered decades
of oppression and violence in Buddhist-majority Myanmar [19]. In
2017, widespread violence led to mass displacement of Rohingya as
they ﬂed across the border into Bangladesh, with more than 700,000
arriving in Cox’s Bazar region within one month [19]. Bangladesh
denied Rohingyas formal legal status and associated rights as refu-
gees and instead designated them as Forcibly Displaced Myanmar
Nationals (FDMNs), or temporary guests, signaling the expectation
that they would quickly repatriate to Myanmar [20]. Until recently,
displaced Rohingya in Bangladesh were subjected to state-sponsored
internet blackouts and prohibited from owning SIM cards for mobile
phones; they continue to be denied access to formal education [20].
One year after reaching Cox’s Bazar, the vast majority of Rohingya
still had no access to latrines or safe water [44]. As repatriation to
Myanmar is not viable, the environmental, social, and economic
stress of hosting a large population of forcibly displaced Rohingya
has fostered growing resentment in the host community [95].
Against this backdrop, the wellbeing of Rohingya women and girls
is disproportionately affected due to pre- and post-displacement
restrictions.1 Male family members mediate women’s access to most
resources and movement. Women perform the majority of the daily -
and at times risky - domestic chores, such as the collection of dwin-
dling ﬁrewood and drinking water from distant host community
sources, often without proper authorization. These strenuous daily
activities expose Rohingya women to disease, harassment, and
human trafﬁcking. Within the camp areas, Rohingya women and girls
also face discrimination and domestic violence. Girls attend the
makeshift education centers only until the onset of menstruation,
leading to even lower rates of schooling. Healthcare and counseling
services are limited and difﬁcult to access due to distance, and “safe
centers” where children and women can seek help are ill-equipped
with water, food, and acute health services. These services were con-
sidered non-essential and were closed during the height of the
COVID-19 pandemic, leading to increased cases of child abuse, child
marriage, and missing children [20]. While traditionally it has not
been acceptable for Rohingya women to venture outside the home
without a male relative; these norms are shifting with the encourage-
ment of the host government and humanitarian agencies. This article
will share three progressive examples.
In the years leading up to 2020, Rohingya women embraced digi-
tal technologies to reduce health inequities by improving education,
providing access to health information, and increasing agency. While
telecommunications service quality remains poor, and the male head
of household often controls women’s access to phones, contacts, and
services, women can and do access phones through individual or col-
lective family ownership, neighbors, or shared community access
points [96,97]. Rohingya women in the workforce are primarily
employed by NGOs and may have their own non-smartphones to
share work-related images and videos. For women not in the work-
force, mobile phones are one of the very few connectors to the
broader world as they listen to music, watch videos, and communi-
cate with relatives. Through these avenues, Rohingya women
accessed short instructional and educational videos created by pre-
dominantly expatriate Rohingya through the sharing of SIM cards or
mobile-to-mobile exchanges. These videos covered issues of English
literacy, ﬁrst aid, menstrual hygiene, pregnancy, and birth control,
including where and how to access resources such as sanitary pads
and contraceptives. These videos provided localized and contextual-
ized information on topics important to Rohingya women, whose
mobility (online and ofﬂine) may be controlled and compromised.
With the support of NGOs, women initiated classes to gain hands-on
training to repair mobile phones, generating possibilities to ensure
ﬁnancial stability as some eventually ﬁnd employment as mobile
repair specialists inside the camp. Furthermore, these digital technol-
ogies helped Rohingya women to organize informally against bully-
ing, harassment, and human trafﬁcking inside the camps.
Using digital technologies as capacity strengthening and liberat-
ing innovations in health promotion helped prepare Rohingya
women to respond to future crises and combat gendered misinforma-
tion. During the ﬁrst wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, younger
Rohingya women joined men in serving as community health volun-
teers to contextualize COVID-19 prevention health messages (e.g.,
hand washing, social distancing) to reﬂect local concerns. These com-
munity health volunteers used their phones to verify message
authenticity by crosschecking with local authorities, translating into
Rohingya dialects, recording audio/video ﬁles, and disseminating the
ﬁles. Rohingya health volunteers also used technology to combat
misinformation that sought to further marginalize and restrict Rohin-
gya women. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, a rumor circulated that
women were the source of COVID-19 and that curtailing their move-
ment - preventing women from working and visiting friends - would
stop the spread. In response, volunteers gathered short video clips
from trusted sources on how COVID-19 spreads, dubbed them in the
Rohingya language, and shared them alongside locally created videos
depicting Rohingya elders showing their support and rejecting dis-
criminatory
misinformation
targeting
women.
Here,
Rohingya
women used low-tech innovations to engender resilience and make
substantive contributions to combatting misinformation and mitigat-
ing the transmission of COVID-19 in the world’s largest refugee
camp.
Rohingya women have also been at the forefront of community-
based efforts to mitigate risks to wellbeing and survival in the face of
disaster using technology. Rohingya in closely packed temporary set-
tlement housing - along with all residents of Bangladesh - are
exposed to one of the most disaster-prone calendars. The dry season
poses a ﬁre risk, followed by risks of ﬂooding and landslides during
the cyclone and monsoon seasons. In 2021, over 150 ﬁres were
reported, with the largest one killing 15 people, injuring 560, and
destroying over 9,500 shelters leaving 45,000 people without
homes [98]. During the monsoon season that same year, 6 Rohingya
refugees were killed and 2,500 shelters were damaged or destroyed,
affecting more than 21,000 refugees [23]. This catastrophic cycle
repeats without reprieve; in 2023 a devastating ﬁre destroyed more
than 2,600 shelters and displaced over 850,000 refugees [99] and
two months later in May 2023, a cyclone accompanied by heavy rains
triggered landslides, causing damage to over 40,000 homes plus facil-
ities across all 33 Rohingya refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar [100].
Instead of relying on the traditional, slow, and top-down early warn-
ing systems, Rohingya and their host community have collaborated
to develop a participatory, camp-wide disaster risk and assessment
and warning system called Voice of Palong (VoP) [101]. VoP is a digi-
tal communications broadcasting initiative managed by a local NGO,
Young Power in Social Action. VoP volunteers co-design, co-develop,
and co-distribute their content catering to both Rohingya and host
communities. Their collaborative efforts have the potential to work
as deterrents against exclusion and marginalization of vulnerable

populations in the face of climate change-related disasters. Impor-
tantly, almost all the refugee members of VoP are young Rohingya
women. Rohingya women are leading the initiative by using localized
digital storytelling to construct peacebuilding narratives, strengthen-
ing inter-community relationships, and building a human interac-
tion-based, low-tech early warning system to ﬁght against climate
change-related disasters in Cox’s Bazar.
Conclusions
Climate change and mass population displacement independently
and synergistically generate conditions for increased morbidity and
mortality, heightened vulnerability to shocks, and progressive health
crises. Local initiatives that speak directly to the unique context of
displacement −sociocultural, environmental, and biological −are
necessary to mitigate health disparities, including those caused by
climate change. Rohingya women displaced in Bangladesh demon-
strate tremendous resilience in the face of severe gender restrictions
and risks to personal safety exacerbated by climate change. They
have employed information and communication technologies to
share health information and resources, resist restrictions on their
mobility, and forge new opportunities for themselves; efforts that
contributed to controlling the risk of COVID-19 transmission within
the camp in early 2020 and generating an innovative early-warning
system to combat disasters exacerbated by climate change. Still,
structural approaches that center gender and intersecting identities
in policies, programs, and monitoring and evaluation are desperately
needed to mitigate health disparities and prevent future crises in dis-
placement. Broader and sustained engagement of displaced women
is needed to identify understandings of resilience and to shape disas-
ter preparedness and response at local, national, and international
levels. Including and empowering women in decision-making roles
can improve the health and wellbeing of displaced populations by
creating better-attenuated policies and programs, and building the
resilience of individuals, families, and communities in preparation for
life after displacement. Structural changes to improve equity in gov-
ernmental, institutional, and international policies must accompany
efforts to engender resilience among displaced populations [94]. Gen-
der-informed research on health, climate change, and resilience in
contexts of humanitarian disasters and mass population displace-
ment can elucidate the effectiveness of interventions over the short-
and long-term.
