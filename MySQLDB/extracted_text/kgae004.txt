Abstract 
We propose to explore the sustainability of climate policies based on a novel commitment metric. This metric allows to quantify 
how future generations’ scope of action is affected by short-term climate policy. In an example application, we show that following a 
moderate emission scenario like SSP2-4.5 will commit future generations to heavily rely on carbon dioxide removal or/and solar radi­
ation modification to avoid unmanageable sea level rise.

Introduction
Climate policy in the coming decades will have profound long- 
term impacts on global climate, ecosystems and human societies 
[1, 2]. In this context, sustainability is a critical consideration: It 
pertains 
to meeting 
humanities’ present needs without 
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their 
own. Thus, taking sustainability into account in policy assess­
ments is essential to address climate change while also ensuring 
intergenerational fairness.
Given the long residence time of CO2 in the atmosphere and 
its long-term impacts, taking fair decisions in the upcoming dec­
ades requires considering possible scenarios of anthropogenic 
forcing over timescales of centuries to millennia.
However, in climate policy assessments based on integrated 
assessment models, longer timescales are often absent, or the 
long-term impacts of current decisions are heavily discounted 
relative to short-term impacts [3]. Given that it is challenging to 
consider longer timescales for multiple reasons, this is under­
standable, but nevertheless unsatisfactory (or even ethically 
problematic [4, 5]).
We therefore propose an approach to improving sustainability 
considerations in climate policy assessments.
Lost options commitment
Our suggestion is to explore the sustainability of short-term cli­
mate policies based on a metric, which we call “lost options 
commitment”, that quantifies future generations’ scope of action 
to avoid harmful long-term futures. More particularly, we ask 
“Given a climate state that can be reached under realistic 
short-time emission scenarios, which long-term climate miti­
gation options are left to future generations to meet a specified 
climate target?”
Our method is related to several well-established notions [6] 
from climate science literature: climate change commitment [7], 
storylines [8], vulnerability [9, 10] and mitigation delay sensitivity [11].
Classical 
commitment 
assessments 
seek 
to 
quantify 
“unavoidable” climate impacts due to inertia in the climate sys­
tem: a state of the climate system (typically the current one) may 
be called committed to some future impact (like the amount of 
global warming or sea-level rise) under a given scenario [7, 12– 
14]. Lost options commitment focuses on the scope of action 
rather than the impacts: in a given state, humanity is committed 
by the lost options to a narrower scope of action for meeting an 
intended climate target.
Commitment studies typically rely on few and simplified 
long-term scenarios, such as zero emissions, constant composition 
and constant emissions [1, 7, 12–15]. Such simplistic scenarios 
poorly capture human agency in reacting to climate change, 
which is one of the key aspects our metric attempts to capture. 
We adopt Shepherd et al.’s storyline approach [8] to compose rep­
resentative sets of scenarios by combining a small number of 
building blocks. This modular approach enables the generation 
of a rich set of long-term scenarios.
For each individual long-term scenario, we may assess the 
commitment of a climate state with respect to a particular cli­
mate variable (e.g. sea-level rise). However, as opposed to tradi­
tional commitment studies, we do not stop there. Instead, for a

given state, we assess the compatibility of each long-term sce­
nario with a chosen climate target within a specified time horizon. 
The climate target makes explicit a goal of decision making, e.g. 
the 1.5
C target of the Paris agreement. The time horizon can be 
thought of as the “ethical time horizon” of [16].
Scenarios that are compatible with the climate target are con­
sidered as available options in this state, the others as lost options. 
We may say that in a given state, the loss of options commits hu­
manity to a narrower scope of action to meet the desired target. 
Therefore, we call this metric lost options commitment and define 
the state’s commitment level as the fraction of the number of 
options that violate the target to the total number of options con­
sidered. Commitment level is reported in units of percentage.
Lost options commitment is a generic metric in the sense that it 
can be instantiated with different combinations of long-term sce­
narios, climate targets and timescales. However, it is also itself an 
instance of the general scheme for vulnerability metrics [9, 10].
We now propose that the sustainability of short-term policies 
(e.g. given in terms of SSP or RCP emission scenarios) can be ana­
lysed by measuring the commitment level of the states encoun­
tered when evolving an underlying climate model according to 
these policies. We argue that by having more climate mitigation 
options at hand to avoid harmful outcomes (e.g. transgressing 
specified targets) humanity is in a better position for meeting its 
needs. Therefore, short-term policies that lead to loss of options, 
i.e. an increase in the commitment level, should be considered as 
unsustainable. On the other hand, if along the evolution corre­
sponding to a short-term policy the commitment level decreases, 
this policy increases future generations’ scope of action and can be 
considered as sustainable. This approach is well-aligned with the 
IPCC’s ’Window of opportunity to enable climate resilient develop­
ment’ illustrated in Figure 4.2 of the IPCC AR6 Synthesis Report [2] 
and related to the concept of robustness of decisions [17].
The sustainability of short-term policies as suggested above 
necessarily involves the consideration of multiple targets on 
multiple timescales. Temperature targets on the year 2100 are 
normally associated to short-term emission scenarios. The lost 
options commitment assessment investigates the effect of con­
sidering an additional target on a possibly longer timescale. The 
result of a sustainability assessment relying on lost options com­
mitment, informs us the level of compatibility of a specific short- 
term scenario (which is compatible with a first target), with the 
second target. Multiple target considerations have been shown to 
lead to more stringent policy constraints [18].
Results
We demonstrate our approach with a simple yet instructive ex­
ample. Our study uses as climate target avoiding sea level rise 
above 3 m within a time horizon of 2000 years and a set of 45 long- 
term scenarios as possible options. The horizon is of the same 
magnitude as the ethical horizon suggested in [16]. The long- 
term scenarios are generated as combinations of 3 technologies 
together with usage variants:

Dec—Decarbonisation with rates slow, medium, fast 

CDR—Carbon 
Dioxide 
Removal 
with 
intensities 
no, 
weak, strong 

SRM—Solar Radiation Modification with possible intensities/ 
durations no, weak short, strong short, weak long, strong long 
Figure A1 provides a visual representation of all the options con­
sidered. For the concrete semantics of the scenario building 
blocks, see Appendix B, where we put in context the different 
options with respect to the SSP scenarios used in the IPCC WGI 
AR6 report [19] and motivate their technical feasibility. Given 
these ingredients, and an appropriate climate model, the lost 
options commitment can be computed for Earth system states 
containing a climate state and a current CO2 emission rate. Here 
we focus on states that are reached along the SSP scenarios SSP1- 
2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 from 2020 until 2100, every 
10 years, see Fig. A2. Computing the commitment levels requires 
evolving each of these states along the 45 long-term scenarios for 
2000 years, and checking which long-term scenarios comply with 
the climate target of avoiding sea-level rise above 3 m. For this 
aim we use the reduced complexity model SURFER [20]. This 
model has been designed for policy assessments with a long-term 
perspective, and links CO2 emissions and solar radiation modifi­
cation to climate change, ocean acidification and sea level rise. 
Other greenhouse gasses are absent in the presented example.
Figure 1 shows that following SSP5-8.5 until 2050 leaves the 
Earth in a state in which more than half of the considered long- 
term scenarios fail to comply with the chosen climate target. 
Conversely, following SSP1-2.6 until 2050 results in a state with 
many available options. Note that sea level simulations up to 
2100 do not capture the large differences expected for different 
states and long-term scenarios, hence the importance (for the 
chosen target) of looking further in time. States with similar tem­
perature may have different commitment levels, e.g. SSP1-2.6 at 
2040 and SSP5-8.5 at 2030 or SSP1-2.6 at 2050 and 2090. One rea­
son for this are the different emission rates associated with these 
states. This highlights why climate policy negotiations and agree­
ments should look beyond temperature targets.
Figure 2 shows that, as expected, higher emission scenarios 
lead to fewer available options. The space of options plots for 
states along SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 in Fig. 2, show that in 2020, 
the slow Dec options with no CDR and with no SRM or with short 
SRM do not meet the chosen climate target. By 2030, this is also 
the case for options with medium Dec and no CDR with no SRM or 
with short SRM. This means that, starting a green transition by 
2030, at a rate in line with the SSP scenarios (as the medium Dec), 
will commit future generations to the use of CDR or long SRM to 
avoid long-term high sea level rise. By 2050 the use of CDR or long 
SRM is inescapable for states reached through SSP2-4.5 and SSP5- 
8.5 if the climate target is to be respected. Even if most options 
remain available for SSP2-4.5 at 2050, following this path until 
2050 commits future generations to using CDR or long SRM. 
Notice that along scenario SSP1-2.6 (top plot in Fig. 2), the com­
mitment level decreases towards the end of the century, with all 
options becoming available by 2090. This happens because SSP1- 
2.6 includes CDR from 2075, see Fig. A2.
Discussion and conclusions
We have exemplified the utility of the lost options commitment 
metric through a specific case, and accompanying sensitivity 
experiments (detailed in Appendix C) offer insights into its re­
sponsiveness to variations in defined parameters. The appendix 
encompasses a thorough examination of how the metric reacts 
to changes in critical criteria shaping the problem (e.g. time hori­
zon, target, long-term scenarios) and model parameters like equi­
librium climate sensitivity. Furthermore, a dedicated subsection 
explores the metric’s behaviour in the presence of tipping points.
The lost options commitment metric currently treats all long- 
term scenarios with equal weight. Future users, seeking to incor­
porate cost, feasibility, or risk considerations, may find value in

devising a nuanced metric that assigns distinct weights to each 
long-term scenario.
In the specific example illustrating the framework’s potential 
application, the constant target implies an equal severity in 
reaching a 3 m sea level rise by 2200 or 3900. However, the 
proposed metric’s flexibility allows for the consideration of time- 
varying targets.
Despite the simplicity of the presented example, we think that 
our study provides valuable insights into the sustainability of the 
considered SSP scenarios. Thanks to its systematic construction

based on an explicit climate target, time horizon and set of sce­
narios, the lost option commitment metric is transparent and 
modular. It also has the advantage of informing policymakers 
about available options without being prescriptive. In a forth­
coming paper we use the commitment level as one of the ingre­
dients of the damage functions of climate policy decision 
problems, enabling an exploration of trade-offs between long- 
term and short-term effects. While we do not advocate for priori­
tizing the first ones over the later, we hope that our metric can 
contribute to better informed and more sustainable cli­
mate decisions.

To perform the lost options commitment assessment we have re­
lied on the SURFER model [20]. This model has two forcing sour­
ces, one corresponding to CO2 emissions (E), and another one 
corresponding to SRM SO2 injections (I). The different long-term 
scenarios present in the lost options commitment assessment 
correspond to different definitions of these emissions and injec­
tions over the assessment period.
The 45 long-term scenarios are constructed as a Cartesian 
product of three sets of options corresponding to different decar­
bonisation rates, solar radiation modification intensities and 
durations, and carbon dioxide removal rates.
Three constant decarbonisation rates are considered: –0.08, 
–0.25 and –0.75 PgC/year2. The medium decarbonisation rate 
(–0.25 PgC/year2) approximately aligns with the decarbonisation 
rates present in SSP1-2.6 and SSP4-3.4 while the fast one (–0.75 
PgC/year2) is a limit case that aligns with the decarbonisation 
rate present in the overshoot scenario SSP5-3.4-OS. We model 
the decarbonisation options by reducing emissions linearly de­
crease at the specified rate until zero emissions are reached. 
When applied to a state with zero or negative emissions the three 
decarbonisation options are degenerate and have no effect.
Five solar radiation modification options are considered: none, 
weak short, strong short, weak long, strong long. SRM is used to 
counter-act all possible global warming and it is achieved 
through stratospheric aerosol injections. The weak and strong in­
tensities correspond to maximum injection rates of 20 and 40 
MtS/yr. The weak intensity corresponds roughly to the injection 
rates required to reduce the radiative forcing of a high emission 
scenario like SSP5-8.5 to that of SSP2-4.5 by year 2100 [21, 22], the 
strong intensity is twice the weak rate. These rates, while high, 
fall within the SRM scenarios covered by the SRM literature refer­
enced in the IPCC WGIII AR6 report, see Cross-Working Group 
Box 4—Solar Radiation Modification in [23]. SRM options are ap­
plied “smartly” such that just the necessary amount of aerosols 
is injected to return to pre-industrial temperatures. In SURFER, 
the precise injection rate needed to flow towards a dTtarget is

where SRMlimit is 20 or 40 MtS/yr depending on the long-term sce­
nario. We consider two durations for injection deployment, short and 
long. We define short as the time it takes to achieve full decarbonisa­
tion and long to the whole commitment assessment timescale. In 
the sensitivity analysis presented in Sec. C we consider other defini­
tions of short which are longer than the decarbonisation period.
Three constant atmospheric carbon dioxide removal rates are 
considered: 0, −1, −2 PgC/year. The strong carbon dioxide re­
moval rate approximately coincides with the one in the SSP1-2.6. 
There are other SSP scenarios with higher CDR rates, up to more 
than twice as large for the overshoot scenario SSP5-3.4-OS. We 
model CDR options by starting since the beginning of the assess­
ment. If decarbonisation has not finished for the particular state 
there is an immediate reduction in net emissions. CDR continues 
at the specified constant rate after decarbonisation has ended 
and until pre-industrial atmospheric CO2 concentration is 
reached. The CDR rate is then reduced so that it just removes the 
carbon that flows into the atmosphere from land and ocean, 
keeping atmospheric concentrations constant at pre-industrial 
levels until all reservoirs return to pre-industrial conditions. The 
reduced removal rate is obtained by setting MA ¼ MAðtPIÞ in Eq.

For details on all the terms in equations (1) and (5), 
parameter values and pre-industrial conditions we refer the 
reader to [20].
We consider all the defined decarbonisation and carbon diox­
ide removal options to be technically feasible, since our strongest 
Dec and CDR rates align with those of strongly mitigating 
SSP scenarios, which are themselves deemed technically feasible 
[23, page 435]. The short SRM options seem to be both technically 
[24] and physically [22] feasible even if the rates considered 
are high.
For any given state, the assessment is done by considering 45 
different evolutions. Each evolution obtained by evolving the par­
ticular state forced by a different long-term scenario, which 
specifies the emission and injection forcings, for 2000 years. This 
results in 45 trajectories, each corresponding to a different long- 
term scenario. Each trajectory is then inspected against the cho­
sen target, in the presented example, whether sea level rise is 
higher than 3 meters above pre-industrial values within those 
2000 years. We integrate SURFER’s differential equations in Julia 
using the package DifferentialEquations.jl with the inte­
gration 
method

C. Sensitivity experiments                                             
The lost options commitment assessment needs the specification 
of three ingredients:

time horizon 

target 

long-term scenarios (space of options) 
The results of the assessment will then, by construction, depend 
on these ingredients, which define the nature of the assessment 
itself. Model parameters, e.g. equilibrium climate sensitivity, tip­
ping point thresholds and ocean circulation timescale, will also 
impact the results. However, for the assessment to be useful and 
reasonable, robustness to small changes in criteria or parameters 
is required. In what follows, we perform four sensitivity analyses 
for the example discussed in the main text and discuss how the 
presence of tipping points in the climate system might impact 
our metric.
C.1 Sensitivity to time horizon
First we explore the sensitivity of the commitment level to the 
time horizon. We repeat the main text example for 30 equally 
spaced time horizons from 500 to 4000 years, see Fig. C1. There 
we see several things:
1. Longer horizons result in higher commitment levels. This is 
because sea level rise is a slow process. If the horizon is too 
short, a given option might respect the specified target, 
while when extending the horizon that same option might 
lead to target transgression. 
2. However, for horizons of 2500 to 4000 years, the metric con­
verges because: 
a) Only some of the long-term scenarios exhibit tempera­
tures that correspond to committed sea level rise higher 
than the target. Long-term scenarios that do not exhibit 
high temperatures for long enough do not lead to high 
sea level rise, no matter how long the time horizon. 
SSP1-2.6

transgress the target are crossed out.

b) A large fraction of the committed sea level rise happens 
within the next 3000 years, after that time, all options 
that would eventually transgress the target of 3m have 
already done so. 
3. The presence of ice sheet tipping points in SURFER is not ap­
parent in these particular results. This is reasonable since 
the target of 3m is lower than the sea level rise potential of 
Greenland ice sheet, which is around 7m, and hence does 
not differentiate between tipping and non-tipping options. 
C.2 Sensitivity to targets
Second, we analyse the sensitivity to the target, specifically, to 
the threshold chosen for sea level rise. We repeat the example in 
the main text, but with varying thresholds from 1 to 5 meters, 
see Fig. C2. There we see that:
1. Lower SLR thresholds lead to higher commitment levels. 
2. Gradual changes in SLR threshold lead to gradual changes 
in commitment levels. States along SSP1-2.6 after 2070 are 
an exception to this. 
3. For states after 2070 along of SSP1-2.6 certain ranges of tar­
gets exhibit degenerate commitment levels. In particular, by 
2100, all considered thresholds (400) collapse into 4 groups 
with commitment levels: 
0%, 20%, 40% and 60%. 
This can be understood due the big degeneracy in the long- 
term scenarios due to the fact that decarbonisation 
has finished: 
a) The three decarbonisation speeds are degenerate in 
this case. 
b) The short SRM options (defined to happen during decar­
bonisation) are degenerate with the no SRM option. 
The available options corresponding to these four groups can be 
found in Fig. C3. Focusing on the 60% commitment level group, 
which corresponds to relatively low sea level rise thresholds, we 
see that CDR rates considered in the long-term scenarios are not 
large enough to stop a sea level rise of 1 meter in the next 
2000 years without relying on SRM for the state corresponding to 
SSP1-2.6 at 2100.
SSP2-4.5

C.3 Sensitivity to long-term scenarios
In Figs. A3–A6 we see an almost absolute degeneracy between 
the long-term scenarios that have no SRM and those that have 
short SRM. This suggests that SRM until the end of decarbonisa­
tion is too short to have a significant impact—especially in the 
absence of CDR, as was already shown by [25]. In such scenarios, 
SRM stops shortly after the peak in CO2 concentration. For this 
reason, we consider different definitions of short SRM, and assess 
the sensitivity of the lost options commitment assessment to these 
definitions. Specifically, we set the duration of short SRM to be that 
of decarbonisation plus an extension which ranges from 0 to 
300 years. This corresponds to a policy of buying enough time for 
natural feedbacks to kick in. Fig. C4 shows that overall, extending 
the duration of short SRM deployement decreases the commitment 
level, as expected. The effect is relatively small for medium and 
high emission scenarios (SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) but is 
more significant for SSP1-2.6, in 2070 and 2080. Figures C5–C8 
show the space of options for different short SRM durations for a 
particular state. Extending the duration of short SRM has the effect 
of buying time and making some of the transgressing options via­
ble ones. Depending on the emission rate associated to the state 
being assessed, the liberated options are different:

For SSP1-2.6 in year 2070 decarbonisation has almost fin­
ished, see Fig. A2. Extending the short SRM period frees up 
the options with no CDR, short SRM independently of the 
decarbonisation rate, see Fig. C5, i.e. it buys time for natu­
ral sinks to kick in. 

For SSP2-4.5 in year 2040 emissions are high, see Fig. A2. 
Extending the short SRM period frees up the options with 
fast Dec, no CDR, short SRM, see Fig. C6. In this case SRM also 
buys time for natural sinks to kick in. Notice however that 
it does not buy enough time for medium Dec and slow Dec to 
become viable. 

For SSP3-7.0 in year 2050, we see in Fig. C7 that extending 
the short SRM period enables the options with slow Dec, 
strong CDR, short SRM. In this case a longer short SRM period 
SSP3-7.0

allows for a slower decabonisation with strong CDR deploy­
ment to be a viable option. 

Finally, for SSP5-8.5 in year 2060, Fig. C8, extending the 
short SRM period enables the options with fast Dec, medium 
CDR, short SRM and extending it further, the options with 
medium Dec, strong CDR, short SRM. 
C.4 Sensitivity to model parameters
Now we focus on the sensitivity of commitment level to model 
parameters. Climate models, even reduced complexity ones as 
SURFER contain many parameters. Here we perform a sensitivity 
analysis only for the equilibrium climate sensitivity. This is the 
amount of expected warming at equilibrium, for a doubling of 
CO2 concentration, and it is one of the most discussed about 
quantities in the science—policy intersection. In SURFER it is ex­
plicitly set as a parameter, but in most earth system climate 
models, it is computed based on the results of some experiments. 
Its value is uncertain, the IPCC WGI AR6 [19] reports a very likely 
range between 2.0
C and 5.0
C, a likely range between 2.5
C and 
4.0
C and a best estimate of 3
C. The sensitivity experiment 
shown in Fig. C9, considered seven different values of equilib­
rium climate sensitivity: 2.0
C, 2.5
C, 3.0
C, 3.5
C, 4.0
C, 4.5
C 
and 5.0
C, this range coincides with the aforementioned very 
likely range. There we see that expected, higher values of climate 
sensitivity lead to higher commitment levels. This is reasonable 
since the same CO2 concentrations would lead to higher temper­
atures and hence higher sea level rise. We also notice that the 
variation induced by the unknown value of equilibrium climate 
sensitivity is of the same order as the one induced by changes in 
the definitions of the commitment metric: time horizon and 
threshold, at least for the ranges of time horizon and thre­
solds explored.

C.5 Ice sheet tipping points and lost 
options commitment
We have stated that for the metric to be useful and reasonable 
some robustness to small criteria variations is required. We see 
two caveats to this argument. First, lost options commitment 
could be sensitive to very small variations in the target if several 
of the long-term scenarios produce similar or identical trajecto­
ries. This is what we observed for states after 2070 along of SSP1- 
2.6 in Fig. C2. Second, lost options commitment could be sensitive 
to very small variations in the time horizon if abrupt changes are 
observed in the target variable. This could typically happen in the 
presence of fast climate tipping elements. In this particular study, 
however, the only tipping elements considered are the ice sheets, 
which exhibit slow dynamics, and so we don’t expect our metric to 
be very sensitive to small changes in the time horizon.
In the presented sensitivity analyses of the previous sections, 
the ice sheet tipping points present in the SURFER model did not 
have an effect on the lost options commitment assessment. 
These analyses, however, were by design incapable of showcas­
ing such an effect because of two reasons:
1. We did not explore a big enough sea level rise target. 
2. We did not explore big enough time horizons. 
Ice sheets are modelled in SURFER via a non-linear ordinary dif­
ferential equation, see Equation (38) in [20]. That particular equa­
tion, which has been fitted to Greenland and Antarctica 
separately, encodes tipping points and bi-stability behaviour for 
both of the ice sheets and has been shown to agree with the 
steady states and dynamics of three dimensional ice sheet mod­
els [20]. Fig. C10 shows the sea level rise bifurcation diagram of 
the SURFER model in its default setup, which includes contribu­
tions from glaciers and ocean thermal expansion as well as the 
ice sheets. There we see two tipping points as temperature is in­
creased from pre-industrial conditions. The first bifurcation point 
encountered, as temperature is increased (around 1.52
C), corre­
sponds to Greenland’s tipping point and the second one (around 
6.8
C) corresponds to Antarctica’s tipping point.
In the default setup of the SURFER model [20], Greenland’s ice 
sheet tipping point is at a global mean temperature anomaly of 
1.52
C. The committed sea level rise from all sea level rise con­
tributors at that temperature corresponds to  5:9m for the state 
with ice on Greenland and to more than 10 m for the state with 
ice free Greenland, see Fig. C10. In order to see whether 
Greenland’s ice sheet tipping point has an effect on the commit­
ment assessment, the sea level rise target should be set to 5.9 m 
or larger. We repeated the target sensitivity experiment for sea 
level rise targets from 1 m to 10 m for states along SSP2-4.5 con­
sidering a time horizon of 5kyr and a time horizon of 50kyr, see  
Fig. C11. For both considered horizons we see that gradual 
changes in the target lead to gradual differences in the commit­
ment level. There we see increases in the commitment level of 
consecutive states for different climate targets. For targets 
smaller than  5:9m those increases are not necessarily related

to Greenland’s tipping point. We also see that both horizons lead 
to identical commitment levels when the targets are small 
enough (from 1 m to 5 m approx.) and that they differ for targets 
slightly smaller than  5:9 m to 10 m.
For the 50 k horizon with target  5:9 m there are increases in 
the commitment level for the state from 2060 to 2070 and 2090 to 
2100. These increases in commitment level happen because a 
group of options that end on the lower SLR branch of the bifurca­
tion diagram for the lower committed state (e.g. SSP2-4.5 at 
2060), end on the higher SLR branch for the consecutive state 
(in this case, SSP2-4.5 at 2070), this can be seen in Fig. C12. 
When this happens the trajectories associated with those lost 
options pass very close to the ice sheet bifurcation point in phase 
space. The dynamics close to a bifurcation point tend to be very 
slow, and a time horizon of 5kyr is not enough to appreciate the 
committed SLR. We put time markers in Fig. C12 to make this 
point and help understand the sensitivity shown on Fig. C11. We 
conclude that very large time horizons, together with appropriate 
targets, are needed for slow tipping behaviour to be apparent in 
the lost options commitment assessment. This is because the al­
ready slow ice sheet dynamics slow down even more close to bi­
furcation points. We have shown that even when considering 
very long horizons, the impact of ice sheet tipping points on lost 
options commitment assessment isn’t big. The increases seen in 
commitment level in Fig. C11 for bigger targets and 50k horizon 
is of the same order than the ones corresponding to other targets 
and timescales. Additionally, SURFER v.2.0 does not include sedi­
ment dynamics related to carbonate dissolution and silicate 
weathering, which determine the fate of fossil fuels at time 
scales beyond several millennia. Those additional processes act 
as CO2 sinks and have the potential of lowering the commitment 
level on assessments with such long horizons, making it even 
harder for ice sheet tipping points to show up as commitment 
level 
tipping 
points 
in 
such 
lost 
options 
commitment 
assessments.
