Abstract
Rising temperature and heat stress risks in the changing climate scenario might potentially affect workers globally, especially the ones with
strenuous workload in tropical settings. We used a cross-sectional study design to proﬁle the heat exposures of ~1900 workers from eight
industrial sectors using a QuesTemp Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) monitor, quantiﬁed select heat-strain indicators viz., rise in Core
Body Temperature, Sweat Rate, and Urine Speciﬁc Gravity and evaluated the perceived health impacts of heat stress using a structured
questionnaire. Heat exposures (average WBGT: 30.1 ± 2.6 C) exceeded the Threshold Limit Value for 67% workers and was positively
associated with the rise in Core Body Temperature >1 C in 13% and elevated Urine Speciﬁc Gravity >1.020 in 9% workers. Heat-related health
concerns were reported by 86% workers, and the heat-exposed workers had 2.3 times higher odds of adverse health outcomes compared to
unexposed workers ( p < 0.0001). Exposure to higher WBGT and adverse renal health among salt-pan workers were signiﬁcantly associated
( p ¼ 0.004), and steel workers had 9% prevalence of kidney stones. Evidence presented clearly points to heat stress as a health and productivity
risk factor that could have long-term and irreversible health impacts. In-depth assessments are urgently needed to develop scientiﬁcally sound
preventative interventions and protective labor policies to avert the adverse occupational health and productivity consequences for millions of
workers globally, thereby aiding poverty reduction.

1. Introduction
Temperature rise by at least 1.5
C with predicted
increasing frequency and intensity of heat waves is an ex-
pected adverse consequence of climate change around the
globe in the coming decades (IPCC, 2018; Baldwin et al.,
2019). Though the enhanced heat exposures in the climate
change scenario is likely to adversely impact the health,
wealth, and economy of the poor and low-income countries
around the world, the adverse effect of the heatwaves is pre-
dicted to impact the outdoor working population to a largest
extent (Kjellstrom, 2016). India has been classiﬁed as one of
the vulnerable regions exposed to extreme weather risks in the
global climate risk index (Kreft et al., 2016) with predicted
heat-induced economic losses due to decreased health and
fatalities (Kenny et al., 2017; Kjellstrom et al., 2014; Mitchell
et al., 2019). The southern region has high-heat conditions for
the
most
part
of
the
year
with
climatic
ﬂuctuations
(Ramachandran et al., 2017) that have a considerable inﬂuence
on the indoor workplace temperatures (Wagner et al., 2007).
Heat-generated from the processes indoor also inﬂuences the
workplace temperatures, and this, combined with lack of
ventilation precipitates into undesirable health outcomes and

productivity outcomes (Krishnamurthy et al., 2017; Methner
and Eisenberg, 2018; Nag et al., 2009; Xiang et al., 2014).
Global warming and occupational heat stress have been
previously linked to respiratory, cardiac, and kidney diseases
among working people due to elevated workplace tempera-
tures (Kjellstrom and Hogstedt, 2009). Heat stress causes
sweat and dehydration with subsequent volume depletion,
which, if progresses, may cause acute kidney injury (Johnson,
2016; Peraza et al., 2012). The incidence of heat-related dis-
eases, related dehydration, renal diseases, both acute and
chronic, are estimated to rise with the predicted increase in the
frequency and intensity of heatwaves (Hansen et al., 2008;
Knowlton et al., 2009). Workforce with physically exerting
jobs in hot work environments, both indoor and outdoor, have
chronic direct thermal injury that can cause kidney tissue
damage leading to repetitive Acute Kidney Injury (AKI),
kidney stones, adrenal damage (Gonzalez-Quiroz et al., 2018;
Krishnamurthy et al., 2017; Tanthanuch et al., 2005). Chronic
Kidney Disease of Unknown Cause (CKDu), attributed to heat
has reached epidemic proportions in select working commu-
nities in Central America, India, etc. (Johnson et al., 2019) is
currently being reported in other parts of the world too
(Venuthurupalli et al., 2018; Wanigasuriya et al., 2011).
Occupational heat stress has been associated with the
doctor-diagnosed kidney disease observed in a large cohort
study in South East Asia that recommended immediate
occupational health interventions for workers exposed to heat
stress for most part of the year especially in the tropical cli-
mates (Tawatsupa et al., 2012). Without sound prevention
strategies in place, this epidemic may accelerate due to tem-
perature rise in the global warming scenario (Glaser et al.,
2016). Designing comprehensive protective labor policies
coupled with scientiﬁcally sound workplace interventions are
urgently needed to avert health risks for a few million workers
across the globe, especially in the developing nations with hot
climates. With this background, the present study aimed to
study the impact and magnanimity of occupational heat stress
impacts on the health of the workforce in southern India.
2. Methodology
2.1. Study design and study population
We conducted a cross-sectional study in about 35 work-
places in eight work sectors spread across southern India and
central India. We obtained the ethics clearance from the
Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) and took prior approval
from the workplaces to conduct the study (Table 1). We con-
ducted an initial walk-through for selecting and recruiting the
workplaces from the various occupational sectors in about 50
workplaces, of which 35 workplaces were found to be suitable
and were willing to participate in the study. The workplaces
were located in Chennai, Villupuram, Nagapattinam, Tir-
uchirappalli, Tiruvannamalai districts in the state of Tamil-
nadu, Bengaluru in Karnataka state and Mumbai city in the
state of Maharashtra. Data collection was conducted in each
workplace for two seasons, once during the hotter season
(AprileJune) and another during the cooler season (Novem-
bereJanuary) between the years 2013e2019.
We conducted a preliminary screening to recruit workers
between the age of 18e60 years with heat exposures at the
same workplace for at least six months. From the screened
participants, we excluded the workers who had a pre-existing
medical condition like diabetes and hypertension. Based on
their willingness to participate, we obtained informed consent
from the workers and collected data on the worker's heat ex-
posures, their perception of heat stress, heat strain symptoms,
and self-reported health impacts.
2.2. Assessment of heat stress, physiological strain and
workers’ perception of health
We made qualitative assessments using a structured High
Occupational Temperature Health and Productivity Sup-
pression (HOTHAPS) questionnaire to obtain their percep-
tions on heat stress impacts on their health and heat strain
symptoms. Most of the workers could speak and understand
English or the local language spoken by the interviewer, or
we translated the questions for some migrant workers from
other states. The questionnaire had 25 sections that elicited
information about the demographic characteristics, their
work pattern, ﬂuid intake pattern, toileting practices, heat-
related health symptoms, adverse kidney symptoms, sick-
ness/absenteeism due to heat illnesses, productivity losses
etc. We explained the symptoms of heat strain clearly to each
participant before the responses were elicited and we used
excessive sweating, thirst, tiredness, cramps, headache,
nausea/vomiting, fainting, or prickly heat/rashes as heat
strain symptoms.

We obtained quantitative data on heat stress using a cali-
brated portable heat stress Wet Bulb Globe Temperature
(WBGT) monitor (QuesTemp34), QUEST Technologies,
USA which had an accuracy level of ±0.5 C between 0 C
and 120 C of dry bulb temperature and ±5% relative hu-
midity. We usually did the assessments as per the protocols
recommended by (NIOSH, 2016) during the regular shift
hours (9.00 ame3.00 pm) in most workplaces, except in salt
pans, brick kilns, and select agricultural workplaces depending
on when the work starts. We used the WBGT permissible heat
exposure Threshold Limit Value (TLV) to evaluate the risk of
heat stress and the corresponding WBGT under which
continuous work during an hour could be safely undertaken
(ACGIH, 2018; Krishnamurthy et al., 2017).
For consenting workers, we measured physiological heat
strain indicators viz., rise in Core Body Temperature (CBT)
using an infrared thermometer, Urine Speciﬁc Gravity (USG)
measured using a refractometer (Venugopal et al., 2016c) and
Sweat Rate (SwR) was calculated using the formula of Ca-
nadian Sports Association (Parsons, 2014). The CBT and SwR
were measured for 1361 workers. However, in some out-door
sectors, we could only collect 723 urine samples, due to
practical difﬁculties pertaining to the women workers. In order
to study and better understand the impacts of chronic high-
heat exposures on renal health, we selected one out door
informal sector (salt-pan industry) and one indoor formal
sector (steel industry) in which workers had high heat expo-
sures for most part of the year. We tested blood serum creat-
inine of workers for estimating the Glomerular Filtration Rate
(eGFR), an indicator of kidney function (Caplin et al., 2017) in
the steel industry. Based on the self-reported symptoms,
clinical history and recommendations of the occupational
health specialist, we subjected ~91 workers in the steel in-
dustry to a kidney ultrasound scan for diagnosing prescence of
any renal calculi and other kidney-related anomalies.
2.3. Data analysis
All data analysis was done using Microsoft Excel 2007 and
R-statistical software. We conducted a bi-variate analysis for
identifying associations using the chi-square test. We present
Crude Odds Ratios (COR) as the measure of association, and a
cut-off of 0.05 is used to interpret the signiﬁcance of the p-
values for all analyses. Multivariate logistic regression anal-
ysis using a stepwise method is used for controlling possible
confounders. The Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) thus calculated
is presented with the corresponding p-values and 95% Conﬁ-
dence Intervals (CI).
3. Results
3.1. Study population and demographics
We evaluated a total of 35 workplaces in about eight sectors
and selected 1842 workers after conducting a preliminary
screening with 1990 workers. We excluded 8% of the workers
from the study as they reported having one of the pre-existing
medical conditions such as diabetes and/or hypertension. Of
the total study population, 64% (n ¼ 1187) were males and
35% (n ¼ 655) were females (Table 1) with a mean age of
36.8 ± 12.6 years. Approximately 67% (n ¼ 1242) of the
participants had primary education. Eighty-four percent were
non-smokers, 22% consumed alcohol and about half of the
study population had more than ﬁve years of heat exposures,
and were working in the same industry.
3.2. Heat stress proﬁle
The WBGT levels ranged between 21.2 and 41.7 C in the
various sectors assessed, and a majority of the workers had
jobs with heavy workloads (67%) followed by 33% of workers
with moderate workload (Table 2). Among the 1842 workers,
nearly 85% had WBGT exposures above the TLV limits for the
various work intensity categories. We present the average
environmental exposures from the various work sectors in
Table 2, alongwith self-reported heat strain symptoms (per-
centage of workers who reported experiencing any one of the
heat strain symptoms mentioned in Section 2.2), and illustrate
the WBGT proﬁles in Fig.1 which clearly show that though
the maximum percentage of participants were working above
safe limit in salt-pan industry, the maximum WBGTs exposure
to the workers was observed in the steel industry. A signiﬁcant
association between heat stress and work intensity was
observed ( p < 0.0001). As can be seen from Table 2, the heat
stress levels were quite high in the salt pan, steel, and agri-
cultural sectors.
3.3. Workers’ perception of heat stress impacts on health
The workers’ perception on the impacts of heat stress and
experiencing heat strain symptoms were collected through
direct interviews using HOTHAPS questionnaire and about
85% (n ¼ 1564) of the workers reported experiencing any one
of the heat strain symptoms such as excessive sweating, thirst,
tiredness, cramps, headache, nausea/vomiting, fainting or
prickly heat/rashes. Workers with heat exposures above the
TLVs
(85%)
perceived
experiencing
heat-related
health
symptoms that were signiﬁcantly associated ( p ¼ 0.0001), as
compared to workers exposed to WBGTs below TLVs (Table
3). The odds of reporting heat-related health symptoms was
2.3 times higher among workers exposed to heat stress higher
than the TLV levels in the respective work categories
compared to workers who had heat exposures below TLV even
after adjusting for confounders like age, gender, education,
and type of sector ( p < 0.0001). As far as experiencing heat
strain symptoms, male workers (predominantly with the heavy
workload)
reported
more
heat-related
health
symptoms
compared to their female counterparts ( p ¼ 0.0001). Among
the workers with different workloads, workers engaged with
heavy workloads had 1.6 times higher risk of reporting more
heat-related health symptoms (67%) compared to workers
with moderate workloads ( p < 0.0001).

3.4. Heat strain responses and health symptom
The physiological responses indicative of heat strain such
as CBT, SwR, and USG measured with the participants while
working are given in Table 4 for the various work sectors
indicate that the heat strain symptoms are higher among the
workers employed in high-heat environments, notably in the
salt-pan and steel industries. High levels of symptoms of
dehydration was prevalent in all sectors (>75% of the workers
in each sector), but was found to be the highest among the
foundry workers (100%) and salt pan workers (99%). Con-
struction, agriculture, foundry and steel worker reported
higher percentages of urogenital issues compared to other
sectors (Table 4). As can be seen from Table 5, the level of
heat exposures had a direct bearing on the physiological strain
experienced by the workers. The workers with exposures to
higher heat loads (>30 C) had the highest risk of physio-
logical strain (OR ¼ 2.7; p < 0.0001) compared to workers
with moderate heat strain (27.5e30.0
C). Adverse heat-
related health symptoms were higher among workers with
heavy workload compared to workers with moderate workload
(OR ¼ 3.3; p < 0.0001). Workers with very high heat expo-
sures combined with physical exertion had 3.6 times higher
risk of physiological strain such as CBT, SwR and/or USG (a
proxy indicator for dehydration) even after adjusting for
confounders ( p < 0.0001) (Table 5). The blood serum creat-
inine levels of the workers from salt pans were signiﬁcantly
associated with their WBGT exposures, and the workers
exposed to higher WBGTs had 2.9 times higher risk of
decreased kidney function as indicated by their eGFR values
( p ¼ 0.05). The ultrasound results of the steel worker showed
renal calculi in about 9% of the workers who had high heat
exposures ( p < 0.0001) (Table 6).
4. Discussion
4.1. Heat stress proﬁle and workers’ perception
Heat conditions in many work sectors exceeded the TLVs
and WBGT exposures of about 85% of the workers exceeded
the recommended heat TLVs for the observed work intensity.
The workers in indoor workplaces with higher TLVs had ex-
posures from high-heat generating processes that included
furnaces/ovens or they were exposed to direct sun, if they were
outdoor workers, such as in agriculture, steel, foundry, con-
struction, salt pans, and brick manufacturing (Fig. 1). Our
results show that though outdoor sun exposures were high,
especially during summer, the heat exposures in many indoor
workplaces with high-heat generating processes and limited or
no ventilation had higher WBGTs than the recorded outdoor

ambient temperatures during the sampling period. Lack of
ventilation, limited cooling provisions and poor welfare fa-
cilities seen not only in many indoor informal workplaces but
also large formal industries that resulted in elevated heat levels
inside the workplaces which is very common (Nag et al., 2009;
Krishnamurthy et al., 2017; Venugopal et al., 2016a). With an
large economy like in India that is anticipated to grow even
faster in the coming decades (Sanders, 2015), the risk due to
work-related heat stress on the occupational health and pro-
ductivity is high (Fig. 1). The self-reported perceptions of the
workers also corroborate this observation as workers from
almost all workplaces perceived that occupational heat stress
had negative implications on their health (Table 3). Such high-
risk hot working environments have been reported not only in
India (Lundgren-Kownacki et al., 2018; Nag et al., 2009;
Venugopal et al., 2016a, 2016b) but also around the globe
(Alimohamadi et al., 2012; Crowe et al., 2010; Tawatsupa
et al., 2013). Heavy workload, lack of automation, and
limited cooling intervention exacerbate this heat for workers
that have been previously reported (Nag, 2001; Venugopal
et al., 2016a), which is also observed from the workers' per-
ceptions in this study (Table 3). The study results add further
evidence along with other Indian based studies (Nag et al.,
2009; Krishnamurthy et al., 2017; Venugopal et al., 2017) to
the fact that even modest increase in global temperature, as
predicted with climate change will potentially increase the
workers’ heat exposures that is likely to have signiﬁcant im-
plications on the workers' health and productivity in India and
other similar tropical countries where workers already have

exposures to excessively high heat levels (Kjellstrom et al.,
2009).
4.2. Heat-induced physiological strain and health
impacts
Human responses to excessive heat are usually manifested
by physiological indicators such as a rise in CBT, SwR, and
USG, if not controlled has consequent health risks that are
well established (Parsons, 2014). The results of the measured
heat strain indicators among workers (32%) especially SwR
was signiﬁcantly associated with the level of heat exposure
(AOR ¼ 1.8; 95% CI: 144e2.757; p ¼ 0.010) as was evi-
denced in previous studies (Chinnadurai and Venugopal, 2016;
Venugopal et al., 2016a, 2017; Manjunath et al., 2018). A
share of 92% of workers reported symptoms of physiological
strain such as excessive sweating and tiredness/weakness
(n ¼ 1265), a natural consequence of heat exposures, and
heavy workload. The high prevalence of elevated USG values
in about 27% (n ¼ 197) workers indicates excessive sweating
and consequent dehydration that increases heat strain (Sawka
et al., 2001) and also indicates workers’ behavioural modiﬁ-
cations in ﬂuid intake and urinating pattern (Venugopal et al.,
2016c) that increases the risk of heat-related illnesses (Rooney
et al., 1998; Casa, 1999; Aragon-Vargas et al., 2009). The
combined effect of heat and heavy workload subjects the
workers to a higher risk of heat-related health illnesses
(COR ¼ 2.5; p < 0.0001; 95% CI: 1.783e3.023) that has also
been reported in our previous studies (Venugopal et al., 2016a,
2016b; 2016c, 2017; Krishnamurthy et al., 2017) and by other
researchers (Akerman et al., 2016; Kjellstr€om et al., 2014;
Lucas et al., 2015; Wesseling et al., 2014).
An increase in the prevalence of kidney diseases in pop-
ulations living in hot, humid climates (Raju et al., 2014) and
prolonged exposures can produce a range of heat-related
health effects including exhaustion, fatigue, muscle cramps,
rashes, prickly heat and/or kidney anomalies (Crowe et al.,
2015; Mac et al., 2017; Nerbass et al., 2017; Jayasekara
et al., 2019). Upon exposure to hot, humid conditions and
strenuous work, an individual's core temperature rises and
produces excessive amounts of sweat to lose the internal heat
produced to maintain the thermal balance via evaporative
cooling (Sawka and Young, 2006). Repetitive severe dehy-
dration is commonly associated with ‘pre-renal’ dysfunction,
acute kidney injury and might potentially cause, rhabdo-
myolysis, and hypotension that may lead to low-grade renal
injury that could progress to Chronic Kidney Disease over
time (Nerbass et al., 2017). About 9% of workers had renal
calculi in the steel industry, of which 67% of the workers were
from the high-heat zones of the industry with chronic expo-
sures to WBGT > 30 C and this could be attributed to the
imbalance in blood osmolarity caused by intensiﬁed kidney
function while exercising in a warm environment and insuf-
ﬁcient ﬂuid intake (Vander et al., 2001). Such high incidence
of renal calculi among select working communities with
causalities being imbalanced ﬂuid intake, sweating, and re-
petitive dehydration (Butler-Dawson et al., 2019; Jayasekara
et al., 2019). Our ﬁnding is also supported by the high prev-
alence of reduced kidney function and CKD in agricultural
communities in hot and humid work settings (Wegman et al.,
2018; Wesseling et al., 2016). High prevalence of neph-
rolithiasis among workers toiling in high-heat environments
like in glass factories and foundries are caused due to heat,
recurrent dehydration, and strenuous work (Atan et al., 2005;
Borghi et al., 1993; Clark et al., 2016). Results similar to our
study was also observed among Brazilian metal workers
exposed to very high temperatures (45 C or more) suffered
from high kidney stone prevalence (~10%) compared to only
0.009% prevalence in workers who worked at room temper-
atures (Atan et al., 2005). Immediate health and productivity
risks of heat exposure and dehydration are well-established
factors that increase the risk of decreased/compromised renal

health (Brooks et al., 2012). An in-depth scientiﬁc under-
standing of the linkage between occupational heat stress and
related health effects will potentially contribute to the risk-
reduction
by
strategizing
appropriate
and
feasible
in-
terventions including automation and improving workers'
welfare facilities, an essential aspect of safe work practices.
5. Conclusions
A strong correlation between heat exposures, workload, and
physiological strain indicators was observed in this study,
demonstrates that high occupational heat exposures cause
adverse health outcomes among the exposed workforce.
Prevalence of a high level of dehydration among the workers
indicates insufﬁcient ﬂuid in-take behaviour, poor welfare
facilities, and lack of heat stress management practices in the
workplace. The following are the main results of the study.
1) Heat exposures exceeded the TLV for 67% workers for
their work categories;
2) Core Body Temperature > 1 C in 13% and elevated
Urine Speciﬁc Gravity > 1.020 in 9% workers clearly
indicate heat strain prevalence among workers;
3) Heat-related health concerns were reported by 86%
workers and the exposed workers had 2.3 times higher
risk of adverse health outcomes compared to unexposed
workers;
4) Exposure to higher WBGT and adverse renal health
among salt-pan workers were signiﬁcantly associated
( p ¼ 0.04), and steel workers had 9% prevalence of
kidney stones.
The results are of concern as the predicted temperature rise
due to global warming will further enhance the heat situation
in the already hot work environments with a consequent in-
crease in exposures and adverse health impacts on workers.
Interventions that are scientiﬁcally sound, cost-effective,
feasible, and with a holistic approach are urgently needed to
address the heat stress situation at workplaces, while at the
same time also ensuring climate change mitigation actions.
Evidence-based research and epidemiological assessments in
different workplaces and geographical locations with a sea-
sonal approach are imperative to drive comprehensive pro-
tective labour policies and workplace welfare facilities to avert
the adverse risks of occupational heat stress on health and
productivity for millions of workers globally to tackle the
looming climate crisis.
