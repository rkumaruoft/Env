A growing body of empirical evidence indicates that 
exposure to urban green spaces has positive impacts on 
both our physical and mental health. Spending only two 
hours a week in nature can do a lot for our health1. There 
is evidence that positive health benefits peak around  
4 hours of exposure to nature. The positive impacts are 
evident for both young and old, men and women, and 
for people with different health status. Furthermore, it  
is not necessary to do physical exercise for health 
benefits, it is sufficient to simply sit on a bench.
Every 10% increase in green space is associated with 
a reduction in diseases equivalent to an increase of 
five years of life expectancy according to the European 
Environment Agency2. 
Increased greenspace exposure was found to be 
associated with reduced blood pressure, better 
pulmonary and immune function, reduced risk of stroke, 
cardiovascular disease, and asthma3. Access to natural 
environments can also improve overall mental health. The 
impact of green spaces to mental health include stress 
levels, improved general mood, reduced depressive 
symptoms, better cognitive functioning, improved 
mindfulness and creativity.
Parks have notable cooling effects in the vegetated areas 
and also in the surrounding built environment.  
The oasis effect of park will become ever more relevant 
for urban residents as climate change related heat waves 
presents a range of health risks, including potentially 
fatal heat stroke4. Vegetation has an important role also 
in improving urban air quality by reducing exposure to 
pollutants through dispersion, deposition, decomposition 
and assimilation. Green urban areas also facilitate 
physical activity and relaxation and form a refuge from 
noise. Furthermore, parks and green spaces are places 
to connect with other people in the community and 
improve social well-being.
As artificial urban environment is rapidly expanding, and 
more and more people are forced to live in cities, urban 
green spaces are becoming particularly valuable. But 
as cities expand and densify, precious urban vegetation 
in cities is increasingly coming under threat. Despite 
their significant potential, the use of urban green spaces 
remains marginal, fragmented, and highly uneven within 
cities.
Local authorities can significantly influence how people 
use urban greenery, as well as how to improve their 
potential to deliver health and wellbeing benefits. Well 
planned and properly managed urban green spaces 
can contribute to healthy urban living, climate change 
adaptation and improved urban air quality.
There is a great variety of pathways to health and 
wellbeing that can be taken by cities. Examples for 
potential actions include among other the organization 
of community programs and cultural activities in 
green spaces, the development of health-nature trails 
and healing hospital gardens, temporary greening 
interventions, the transformation of streets into green 
cooling corridors, planting hedges along busy roads 
to capture air pollutants, the creation of outdoor 
educational routes and sites or natural play spaces, or 
the identification and protection of tranquil green areas. 
Even small-scale greening interventions were found 
to deliver health, social and environmental benefits5. 
Experience also shows that successful small-scale actions 
can trigger long-term, larger-scale investments in urban 
neighbourhoods.

The URBACT  
Health&Greenspace Network
The URBACT Health&Greenspace Network is  
a transnational network of 9 cities working together 
to link green infrastructure design and management 
to urban health policies and practices. The project 
focuses on physical and mental health benefits of urban 
greenspaces, and their role in improving social health 
and air quality and reducing heat stress in cities. Actions 
targeted by the network are linked to both physical 
changes to the urban environment and the promotion  
of social activities in green areas.
The Health&Greenspace URBACT Action Planning Network 
is a partnership of nine cities:
Budapest 12th District (HU), Breda (NL), Espoo (FI), 
Limerick (IE), Messina (IT), Poznan (PL), Santa Pola (ES), 
Suceava (RO), and Tartu (EE).

This guide developed under the URBACT 
Health&Greenspace Network aims to support cities that 
are making efforts to adopt policies targeting at health-
oriented planning and use of urban green spaces.  
The guide was prepared based on five thematic reports 
published under Health&Greenspace:
•  Impacts of Green Spaces on Physical and Mental 
Health (Thematic report No. 1)
•  Impacts of Urban Green Spaces on Social and 
Individual Wellbeing (Thematic report No. 2)
•  Urban Heat Stress and Cooling with Green 
Infrastructure (Thematic report No. 3)
•  Using Urban Greenery to Improve Air Quality 
(Thematic report No. 4)
•  Street Greening for Health and Wellbeing Outcomes 
(Thematic report No. 5)
The potential pathways linking green space to health 
and wellbeing are presented in the guide in five 
3 About this Guide
domains: Health Promotion, Wellbeing outcomes, Heat 
Stress, Air quality, and Noise. In addition, the guide 
covers also Street Greening separately as a priority area.
The guide is action-focused, supporting cities in the 
identification of specific measures most suitable for their 
situations. The document displays the rich diversity  
of actions that cities can take to link urban green space 
to improved health and well-being.
In Section 4, a Matrix of Policy Interventions is presented, 
that provides an overview of specific measures that can 
be adopted by cities to improve health and wellbeing 
outcomes with the use of urban green spaces.
In the subsequent sections, potential actions are described 
in detail together with specific aspects that need to be 
considered during implementation. The various types of 
actions are illustrated in the Annex of this document with  
a number of showcases from Europe and beyond.

4Matrix of Policy Interventions
This section includes a matrix of potential policy 
interventions promoting improved health and wellbeing 
outcomes through the design and use of urban green 
spaces. The actions in the matrix are clustered by five 
domains: Health Promotion, Wellbeing outcomes, Heat 
Stress, Air quality, and Noise. Under each cluster the 
actions are differentiated further on the basis of urban 
situations (urban density, potential for greening actions) 
and the availability of budget for interventions linked to 
urban green spaces.

Health Promotion with  
the Help of Urban Green Spaces
5.1.1  The impacts of urban green  
spaces on health and well-being 
Academic literature, the World Health Organization (WHO) 
and other institutional sources highlighted the importance 
of green spaces to improve health and well-being. WHO 
presented a causal model of the impacts of urban green 
spaces on health and well-being (Figure 1)6. Through 
improved air and water quality, reducing noise levels 
and contributing to temperature regulation, urban green 
spaces can effectively reduce environmental health risks 
associated with urban living. In addition, they deliver health 
and well-being by enabling stress reduction and relaxation, 
physical activity, improved social interaction and community 
cohesion. Access to natural environments can improve 
overall mental health, physical fitness level, cognitive and 
immune function, and can lower mortality rates in general.

5.1.2  Impacts on physical health 
There is evidence that the provision of open and green 
spaces is associated with improved general physical 
health outcomes. According to the European Environment 
Agency every 10% increase in green space is associated 
with a reduction in diseases equivalent to an increase of 
five years of life expectancy7.
A systematic review of five online databases and over 
100 studies undertaken by the University of East Anglia 
found that people who spend more time in green spaces 
have significantly reduced risks for a number of chronic 
illnesses. According to the research, exposure to green 
spaces was linked to lower heart rate, lower blood 
pressure, lower cholesterol, and reduced incidence of 
stroke, asthma, diabetes and coronary heart disease8. 
Some studies9,10 have indicated that there is a positive 
correlation between higher levels of green space and 
lower levels of obesity.
Evidence from a systematic review of studies shows that 
living in areas with higher residential greenness reduces 
the risk of cardiovascular mortality11. In Florida, higher 
level of exposure to green space has been associated 
with a reduced risk of stroke mortality12. 
A study undertaken in Australia13 was highlighting the 
relevant role of the diversity of landscape features, 
such as trees and open spaces in improving physical 
health outcomes. The study has indicated that a greater 
variability of neighbourhood greenness was associated 
with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. 
The likelihood of hospitalization and of self-reported 
heart disease or stroke was lower among people who 
lived in urban areas with highly variable greenness. It 
is suggested that heterogeneity in the distribution of 
greenness might contribute to better health outcomes 
through promoting physical activity.
Direct exposure to green space improves the functioning of the 
immune system14. According to a Finnish study15, the immune 
systems of children can strengthen in a short time if their 
day-care centre yards are made more natural using forest 
undergrowth and grass. The findings suggest that exposure to 
natural environment can change the microbiome of children 
that result in better functioning of their immune systems.
Residential access to green space was also found to be 
linked to improved pregnancy outcomes16.
In the 1980s, the study of Roger Ulrich showed that 
merely having a view of nature can provide physical 
benefits. Patients with a view of trees from their 
hospital bed recovered more quickly, required less pain 
medication, and had fewer post-surgical complications 
than patients in rooms with urban views.17 
5.1.3  Impacts on mental health
Access to natural environments can also improve overall 
mental health. There is an indication that experiencing 
the natural environment reduces stress levels.18 The impact 
of green spaces to mental health also include improved 
general mood, reduced depressive symptoms, enhanced 
cognitive functioning, improved mindfulness, short-term 
memory performance and enhanced creativity.19,20,21
At individual level, the lack of contact with natural 
spaces is linked to an increase in the incidence of 
mental illnesses22. Based on a growing body of evidence 
suggesting that living without nature is unhealthy, Richard 
Louv has coined the term ‘nature deficit disorder’23.
There are several theories that attempt to explain the 
beneficial effects of nature exposure:
•  Ulrich`s Stress Reduction Theory (SRT) proposes that 
contact with unthreatening natural environments or 
viewing natural elements, having a restorative effect, 
can be effective in reducing stress, creating positive 
emotions and feelings24.
•  Kaplan’s Attention Restoration Theory (ART) suggests 
that continued attention and fatigue can degrade 
our ability to solve problems and cause various 
negative emotions, and that mental fatigue and 
concentration can be improved by time spent in, or 
looking at nature, showing that natural environment 
can resolve health problems of modern people’s daily 
lives caused by stress and fatigue. Nature exposure 
allows individuals to be away from daily stressors, as 
natural environment attracts their attention through 
‘soft fascination’ providing the opportunity for 
recovery from mental fatigue.25
•  Wilson’s biophilia hypothesis claims that, as a 
consequence of evolution, humans have an innate 
tendency to interact positively with nature. When 
individuals engage in a non-threatening natural 
environment, the setting will naturally draw out strong 
positive responses, observed as research evidence 
of benefits from nature exposure. When individuals 
are exposed to natural environment, the setting will 
naturally trigger their strong positive responses.26
The biophilia concept is closely linked with the ‘biophilic 
cities movement’ Biophilic cities are cities that integrate 
natural features into their designs, providing close and 
daily contact with nature. A biophilic city is a biodiverse 
city, allowing people to integrate their daily lives with 
nature across different scales.27

5.2   Approaches and practices 
to improve  
health outcomes linked to 
green space use 
Urban green spaces can have a significant role 
in supporting or complementing various medical 
treatment programs. Examples for using urban green 
infrastructure for therapeutic purposes include nature-
based rehabilitation for people with stress-related 
illnesses or mild depression; nature-based addiction 
treatment, designed to help patients cope with drug and 
alcohol addiction; or postsurgical medical treatment, 
such as outdoor activities in green spaces as part of 
rehabilitation services for cardiac patients. A pilot 
study undertaken in Scotland has found that using a 
woodland-based cardiac rehabilitation programme that 
is combined with regular cardiac rehabilitation activity, 
can boost recovery28. To complement conventional 
therapies a health professional can prescribe activities in 
green spaces to patients.
Long-term exposure to green areas through reducing 
stress, increasing physical activity, and stimulating social 
cohesion can support preventative care, contributing 
to the prevention of many chronic disorders, such 
as cardiovascular diseases, and asthma.29 Various 
prevention measures for cardiovascular diseases can be 
easily linked to green space use. These include regular 
outdoor exercise, or stress management techniques 
applied in natural environment, such as stress-releasing 
walks or mindfulness practices.
Above all, the use of urban green spaces can contribute 
to health promotion. As defined by the Ottawa Charter 
signed in 1986 at the First International Conference 
on Health Promotion organized by the World Health 
Organization, health promotion is „the process of 
enabling people to increase control over, and to 
improve, their health”. it is not only the responsibility 
of the health care sector, but it goes beyond healthy 
life-styles to overall well-being.30 It is also more than 
disease prevention that calls for action in advance, 
in order to make it improbable that the disease will 
progress subsequently.31
A similar concept, ‘health creation’ has also been 
embraced recently. The concept is about changing the 
focus to the role of people and communities that create 
health instead of just mitigating illness. In his book, Lord 
Crisp explores the importance of creating health in the 
home, the workplace, the school, the community and 
wider society32, or in other words, the role of employers, 
teachers, community leaders, architects, and families in 
helping to build a healthy and health-creating society. 
Health creation represents a power shift from health 
care practitioners to people and communities.33 It can 
be actively promoted by supporting various engaging 
activities, and the provision of communal spaces.34
In line with the Ottawa Charter, health promotion relies 
on creating supportive environments35. Urban green 
spaces can function as such supporting environments. 
Parks and urban forests, apart from functioning as 
spaces enabling therapies and prevention, also have 
a particularly high potential for contributing to health 
promotion and health creation through making possible 
the contact with nature, social connections, and exercise.
5.2.1  Health-responsive planning of urban 
green spaces 
When designing greens spaces with an overall aim to 
bring about health benefits, a number of factors or 
aspects need to be considered.
In line with the biophilia hypothesis introduced by 
Wilson humans have an innate tendency to seek 
connections with nature and other forms of life36. 
At the same time people are attracted to built 
environments (urbanophilia) because civilization offers 
protection from the dangers of nature37. People prefer 
the combination of natural and built environments, 
although in terms of relaxation potential the more 
greenery versus hard surfaces, the better.
Design can help in turning green spaces into health-
promoting environments. In this regard, a report of the 
United States Environmental Protection Agency  
(US EPA)39 includes a number of recommendations:
•  green spaces need to be accessible with good 
links (pedestrian and cycleways) to nearby 
neighbourhoods
•  greens spaces should be designed with 
multifunctional uses; they should include spaces that 
encourage active mobility, physical activity and 
sports, relaxation and tranquillity, and opportunities 
for social interactions;
•  the development of green spaces should be framed 
as a public health investment;
•  when designing green space interventions, the 
needs of different age, social and cultural groups 
need to be considered;
•  the creation of multisensory restorative environments 
can help mitigate the psychological stresses.
A study by the research team of the Texas A&M 
University has found that the shape or form of green 
space has an impact on human health. The study 
revealed that irregularly shaped parks reduce 
the mortality risk of residents who live near them. 
The complexity of the park shape was found to be 
positively associated with a lower risk of mortality, 
that might be attributable to the higher number of 
available access points to the green space. In addition, 
as compared to compact-shaped green spaces, linear 
parks can also increase accessibility contributing to 
positive health outcomes.40
    Action:
Designing green spaces into health-
promoting environments
    Action:
Development of irregularly shaped or 
linear-shaped parks
A study of Hunter, Cleary and Cleland38 provides a 
number of general recommendations for designing 
urban green space interventions that can potentially 
deliver health benefits:
•  urban green space interventions should be a 
combination of a physical change to the green space 
and promotion programmes that aims at increasing 
park use,
•  small-scale physical interventions, such as urban 
greenways/trails and pocket parks can be effective in 
bringing about health and well-being benefits,
•  when designing green spaces, components that 
specifically focus on long-term health, social 
and environmental effects, as well as long-term 
management and maintenance need to be 
considered,
•  the local community should be engaged in the design 
process to ensure that their needs are met by the 
intervention and to mobilise local knowledge into 
local solutions,
•  the type and the context of green space should 
be considered when designing urban green space 
interventions.
See Showcases 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3.

5.2.2  Taking a life-course approach for 
green space planning 
Different subgroups (different age, social and cultural 
groups) use green spaces in a variety of ways. Although 
children and the elderly might have different needs, 
it is still possible to create a park or a garden that is 
attractive for all. While keeping the overall cohesion of 
the green space, it is possible to design it with ‘rooms’, 
which are distinct spaces responding to varying needs.41
A research led by the Institute of Future Cities at the 
Chinese University of Hong Kong explored how to plan 
and design urban green spaces to facilitate the needs 
of older adults and to promote active aging in an urban 
environment42. Their findings included the following:
•  as mobility decreases with increasing age, 
accessibility is an essential factor to consider in 
planning the spatial distribution of urban green 
spaces; in line with the findings of the study a green 
space within 400 m can be considered as accessible 
by walking for older adults;
•  there is an indication that in case of older adults, 
visiting of parks and other green spaces is closely 
related to their everyday activities, so it is worth 
locating urban green spaces close everyday places, 
such as stores, markets, service providers and public 
buildings; 
•  those with better self-reported health status 
preferred more stimulating, sunny and lively areas 
in urban green spaces, while people who perceive 
themselves to be in poorer health preferred less 
stimulating, shaded and quiet spots; 
•  attractive urban green spaces are considered safer 
and the maintenance condition of the urban green 
spaces as well as the colour of the plant affects 
perceptions of safety (in case of older adults there is 
an overall preference for greater number of flowers 
in green areas); 
•  Locations with design features (seating) that can 
encourage social interactions are typically the most 
popular spots in urban green spaces.
Douglas, Lennon and Scott in a study published in 
2017 taking a life-course approach have provided 
guidance on improving green space benefits for health 
and well-being for different age groups43. Some of the 
recommended interventions included in the study are 
listed below by age group:
•  children: engagement with nature and physical 
activity should be encouraged with certain 
designed-in elements, such as paved walkways, play 
equipment, fields and courts; 
•  adolescents: provision of sports facilities and 
other facilities supporting movement and physical 
activity; provision urban wilderness areas, untended 
vegetated areas, wildflower meadows for exploring 
and creative play; and zones of sheltered areas for 
relaxation and social interaction;
•  adulthood: ensuring proximity of green spaces; 
provision of opportunities to engage with nature, 
spaces for walking, cycling for stress relief; 
development of communal seating areas in parks to 
encourage social interactions;
•  pregnant women: provision of safe and accessible 
walkways, regular seating areas and clean public 
toilets; 
•  elderly: provision of accessible green spaces in close 
proximity to residential areas, sheltered seating 
areas with interesting views that encourage social 
interaction, spaces for games suitable for elderly 
abilities, such as chess and boules-type games; 
increasing exposure to green space through targeted 
greening of the streetscape.

A green prescription is an emerging nature-based 
health intervention, that is designed to improve 
physical and mental health and wellbeing of patients 
through exposure to natural environments.44 It is a 
written advice of a health professional to a patient to 
be physically active.45 Under the scheme the doctor 
can recommend the patient to go for regular jogs 
or walks in the park, or to participate in some other 
nature-based activity. Green prescriptions are typically 
complementing conventional therapies, and can be 
regarded as one part of a holistic health-promotion 
strategy.46 It is a smart and cost-effective option to 
promote health creation.47 
(See Showcase 5.4)
Potential examples of green prescription activities 
include: participation in regular group walks; 
gardening as part of a horticultural therapy; 
undertaking of biodiversity conservation activities, such 
as habitat creation and restoration; green exercise 
(e.g., nature walks, biking, climbing); or wilderness arts 
and crafts.48
The ’green prescription’ term was first introduced in 
New Zealand in 1998.49 In the original initiative the 
general practitioner provides patients with plans for 
strategic physical activities and healthy diet. The term 
has since been broadened to include nature-based 
activities aimed at addressing chronic diseases, mental 
health issues and social isolation.50
Green prescriptions are mostly used to support 
prevention and the complementary treatment of 
chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and 
diabetes.51 Such schemes were shown to result in 
increased levels of physical activity, quality of life, a 
decrease of blood pressure and a change in coronary 
risk.52
In the UK green prescriptions is a rapidly spreading 
practice. Liverpool City Council and Liverpool Clinical 
Commissioning has launched referral schemes that 
encourage activities in parks to tackle obesity and 
diabetes. In Devon and Somerset a three-year 
scheme is under way where general practitioners are 
encouraging patients to visit the national parks as part

of their treatment. Walks, conservation work, gardening 
and sailing are promoted by an initiative in Dorset.53
As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic the UK 
government has announced in July 2020 a £4 
million investment in a two-year pilot to bring 
green prescribing to four urban and rural areas 
that have been hit the hardest by coronavirus.54 
Green prescribing became an important lever of the 
recently adopted Tackling Obesity strategy of the  
UK government.
The development of health walk routes can help 
in supporting communities to connect with urban 
green spaces such as parks, gardens and forests to 
experience the various health benefits of nature. The 
aim of the creation of a green health route is to enable 
people to use their local green spaces and at the same 
time to improve their health condition or maintain 
a healthy lifestyle.55 Healthcare practitioners can 
recommend their use through green prescribing56. 
(See Showcase 5.5)
Green health routes can be used as part of 
rehabilitation services for cardiac patients through the 
organization of regular guided therapeutic walks.
URBACT Health&Greenspace network |  23
Hospital gardens can be used as a part of a therapy 
program. Patients’ access to natural landscape or a 
garden can potentially improve well-being and health 
outcomes.
Healing gardens in line with the definition of the 
American Horticultural Therapy Association are seen as 
plant dominated environments including green plants, 
flowers, water, and other aspects of nature that are 
designed as a retreat for patients and visitors. They 
are generally associated with hospitals and other 
healthcare settings. A therapeutic garden is a specific 
type of a healing garden, that is designed for use 
as a component of a treatment program. This can 
be a physical therapy, an occupational therapy or a 
horticultural therapy program. Therapeutic gardens 
are created to meet the needs of a specific user or 
population.57
A healing garden can function as a space for 
relaxation and restoration from mental and emotional 
fatigue58, it can potentially reduce recovery time for 
surgery patients, reduce stress, lower blood pressure59.
Providing patients with access to a gardening space 
can have additional therapeutic benefits. Letting the 
patients actively participate in gardening, rather than 
only passively enjoy the garden can have significant 
healing effects.60 In horticultural therapy patients are 
engaged in horticultural activities led by a therapist 
with an aim to achieve specific treatment goals.61 
(See Showcase 5.6)
    Action:
Developing healing gardens and 
therapeutic gardens
The effects of a healing garden can be enhanced by 
careful design. Greenery should take up roughly 70% 
of the space, while hard artificial surfaces about 30%. 
The following features are particularly effective: tree-
bordered views of water features, lush, multi-layered 
greenery, mature trees and flowering plants that 
attract birds and wildlife, private conservation areas, 
chairs that can be easily moved, features that engage 
multiple senses and easy entry.62
There are differences in what features are sought by 
various age groups in the gardens. With children, 
natural elements that enable interactive activities, 
such as plants, rocks, water features are particularly 
popular63. Middle-aged adults tend to look for peace 
and quiet in the garden, while older adults are mostly 
seeking stimulation, and opportunities for social 
interaction64.

Improving Wellbeing Outcomes 
with the Use of Green Spaces
The urban green spaces have a relevant impact on 
residents’ wellbeing. The World Health Organisation (WHO) 
defines health as ‘a state of complete physical, mental and 
social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease 
or infirmity’65. According to the definition social wellbeing 
is regarded as a key component of health. It is generally 
accepted that the social world affects physical, functional, 
psychological, and cognitive health and that each of these 
other dimensions of health influences social well-being66.
According to the European Environment Agency every 
10% increase in green spaces has been associated 
with an increase of five years of life expectancy67. 
However, the positive impact is not only on the length 
of life but also on its quality. Evidence shows that 
to have access to natural environments improve 
individual and community wellbeing.
6.1   Social wellbeing impacts of 
urban green spaces

services from urban green spaces and social cohesion

An avenue for health promotion. International journal of environmental research and public health, 16(3), 452.
Jennings and Bamkole68 summarize the main factors that 
relate urban green spaces to social interactions and 
consequently to social dimension of health: open parks 
design to encourage active recreational activities, the 
availability of sidewalks, improved access to parks through 
quality transportation options, shaded areas that support 
relaxing environments, functional playgrounds, and the 
extent of organized activities.
These authors developed a conceptual framework  
(Figure 2) to illustrate the relationship between cultural 
ecosystem services from urban green spaces and social 
cohesion (as a social determinant of health) with social 
and health outcomes, where social determinants of health 
are an overarching domain that includes the conditions for 
living, working, learning and playing. The presence and/
or access to urban green spaces stimulate activities that 
contribute to enhance various health benefits.

6.2   Pathways to improve 
wellbeing with the help of 
urban green spaces
6.2.1  The role of green spaces in 
strengthening communities and social 
groups 
Urban green spaces have a high value for communities, 
being the focal points for groups meetings. Urban green 
spaces contribute to build a sense of community among 
residents, promote social interaction, develop social 
ties and community cohesion. They provide places for 
social and cultural interaction in informal contacts (place 
to meet and celebrate with others) and more formal 
participation in social events (like music performances, 
concerts, dance up), social inclusion, recreation, 
individual and group sport activities, aesthetic pleasure 
and wildlife. As natural meeting points, urban green 
spaces increase the sense of identity and belonging, 
support civic society, increase individual social capital, 
and play a relevant role in any community development. 
All kind of people, without cultural, religious, ethnic 
distinctions, can access to these opportunities69. 
(See Showcase 6.1, and 6.2)
Urban green spaces are central spaces for community 
volunteer groups that provide facilities and activities, 
and often they are in charge of the conservation and 
maintenance of the greenery.
    Action:
Designing green spaces to support social activities
    Action:
Promoting the use of urban green spaces
A research team of the University of Illinois has found 
that there is a positive link between the level of tree 
and grass cover in an outdoor space and the amount 
of social activity that takes place there. Almost twice 
as many individuals are engaged in social activities in 
green compared to sparsely vegetated areas70. Another 
research by the Eindhoven University of Technology 
revealed that the level of social contact among 
neighbours is proportional with the availability of trees 
and grass71. Dedicated green space design can further 
increase social activity and improve community cohesion.
A number of aspects need to be considered when 
green spaces are designed for promoting social 
interactions:
•  Levels of green space usage are influenced by 
proximity and accessibility. Good public transport 
links, and good entry points away from busy roads 
increase the accessibility of green spaces.72
•  Urban green spaces should not be over-designed 
supporting only very specific functions. They 
should instead facilitate activities for various 
population groups, encouraging undedicated 
use through making these public spaces suitable 
for multiple uses.73
•  Higher levels of use can be stimulated by attractive 
natural attributes, such as landscaped features, 
ponds, trees and lakes.74
•  Welcoming meeting spaces should be created, e.g., 
by opening cafés or installing food kiosks in parks.75
•  Infrastructural features, such as benches, waste bins, 
toilets should be provided.76
The user-friendliness of green spaces can be effectively 
increased through the creation of social activities77. As  
a park can be regarded as much as a social space 
as a physical infrastructure, local authorities should 
promote activities that animate green spaces. 
Facilitated activities, such as family days, cultural 
events, guided walks, sports events, and markets 
should be funded, organized and endorsed by cities to 
increase community engagement78.
In line with the brief of WHO on ‘Urban green spaces’79, 
building on a ‘dual approach’, cities should always 
combine physical green infrastructure interventions 
with social promotion activities. Robust outreach and 
promotion activities are vital for effectively increasing 
park use by a diversity of population groups.
URBACT Health&Greenspace network |  27
To develop community programs in urban green spaces 
local authorities should engage and actively involve 
individuals and social groups through discussion groups 
and consultations in order to organize with the users’ 
involvement artistic events, sport activities, ethnic minority 
background activities, leisure programs, community 
gardens, etc. Through participatory approaches active 
community groups can share with local authorities the 
responsibility of tasks, and at the same time partnerships 
are promoted among different groups.80,81,82
Civil society involvement enhances the quality of 
experiences in urban green spaces and can support 
long-term sustainability through contributing to creative 
and innovative approaches for funding. International 
policies83 have encouraged users’ participation in the 
diverse phases of public green spaces development, 
but for achieving this goal citizens should be informed 
and motivated to become active in designing, planning 
and maintaining public green spaces and to promote 
community programs in these spaces84.
    Action:
Promoting cultural activities in green spaces
Green spaces can provide an appropriate setting for 
performing various cultural activities, such as public 
readings, exhibitions, dance and music, plays, drama, 
and to paint. 
(See Showcases 6.3 and 6.4)
Arts and cultural programs are ideal tools for 
effectively attracting people to parks and thereby 
improve wellbeing of visitors. The arts can play an 
essential role in the revitalization of a park and in 
intensifying social life in entire neighbourhoods.
Since the 19th century parks have been commonly 
used for sculpture or hosting musical events. Later on, 
as a widespread practice, outdoor theatre and film 
screening events, as well as dance performances have 
become activities to be included in park programming. 
Parks can also be appropriate venues for temporary 
photo exhibitions.
A dedicated briefing paper published under the 
City Parks Forum Program of the American Planning 
Association85 summarizes various options for promoting 
arts and cultural programs in parks:
•  Public film screenings are among inexpensive 
activities that can attract large numbers of visitors to 
a park at night, when such areas otherwise might be 
perceived by many as unsafe spaces.
•  The concentration of museums and other cultural 
institutions in a park can make the area an 
important artistic destination in a city and can help 
build a large circle of supporters for the park.
•  Outdoor classes offered in music, painting, drama, 
and dance in after-school setting can be particularly 
effective in attracting children to parks.
•  Abandoned, poorly maintained, deteriorating parks 
can be effectively improved through cultural activity.

6.2.2  Community gardening
Researches show a range of wellbeing and health 
benefits of community gardens especially for vulnerable 
populations, groups of people who are likely to fall 
or remain below a certain welfare threshold due to 
factors outside of their control, like age, ethnicity, 
illness, lower socioeconomic status. Malberg Dyg and 
her colleagues’ review shows that being involved in 
community gardening has positive effects on relationships 
and social connections, and on local communities, with 
consistent results among studies involving refugee and 
ethnic minority populations, disadvantaged youth and 
elderly86. Gardeners reported greater social support 
than non-gardeners, having more opportunities to 
develop new relationships87. Growing vegetables in 
community gardens with youth programs was found 
to improve interpersonal skills, informal social control, 
cognitive and behavioural competencies and nutrition88. 
Garden participation strengthens social involvement 
and connections, improves mutual trust, and civic 
engagement and contributes to community building, 
indirectly leading to better health outcomes89,90. 
Furthermore, collective gardens function as an interface 
between city, nature, and agriculture, that could work 
toward a sustainable city91. A study from Australia has 
revealed that refugees were able to connect to the new 
country through community garden participation92.
In dense urban areas allotment gardens can also 
be turned into places of social life, by making them 
accessible for the local community, apart from the 
renters, and by organizing smaller activities in their 
shared areas.
6.2.3  Seclusion and areas for reflections 
in green spaces and individual 
wellbeing
Although urban green spaces have a relevant role in 
reinforcing social relationship and community bonds, 
but sometimes for their wellbeing people need to enjoy 
the state of being private and away from other people, 
to find a relief from the pressure of urban living. Urban 
green spaces are also those places outside home 
where people can experience and enjoy nature, plants, 
trees, birdsongs, and the sound of water in a state of 
seclusion. In public green spaces one can be in touch 
with the natural cycle of the seasons. Surroundings are 
perceived with all sensory modalities, including visual 
(sight), auditory (hearing), olfactory (smells) and tactile 
(touch), with a synergistic effect. Sight is relevant as a 
visual sense of beauty and colour, hearing allows one to 
sense the sounds of water, birds and other animals, the 
sense of smell helps one to be aware of the scents from 
flowers in bloom, and touch to feel the soil while working 
with it or the breeze upon the skin93. Design targeting 
individual use can support activities like observation of 
nature (sensory perceptions) and mindfulness journeys 
(pathways, labyrinths and sites for reflection).
Walking alone, reading a book, lying with closed eyes 
on the lawn, having an immersive walk in the woods, 
sleeping away from the bustle or simply from others are 
some of the experiences that sometimes people need 
to do alone in order to get out of stress, to relax, to find 
their own wellbeing. In urban green spaces men and 
women can take a rest from the frenetic activities of 
the city life, or simply from their chaotic life. In case of 
appropriate dimensions and design it is possible in many 
public parks to have an immersive, tranquil experience, 
being surrounded by the sounds of nature. See Section  
9 on Reducing Noise Pollution with Urban Vegetation.

Landscape design can help develop contemplative 
settings. Olszewska94 provides some guidance on how 
to maximize the serenity of urban green space:
•  Settings with long-distance views (over 400 meters), 
open spaces or sparsely wooded areas that 
stimulate to look at the sky are found to be more 
contemplative.
•  A linear structure of green spaces with very far 
views, which are rare in urban areas, can have a 
particularly strong calming effect.
•  Green spaces should provide serenity at least in 
some of their zones, which should be designed in a 
way so one can feel the distance from other people 
and from built-up areas.
•  More stimulating and enjoyable landscapes with 
brightly coloured flowers, attractive elements and 
geometrical design and very organized parks are 
found to be less relaxing to spend time in.
•  Similarly to excessive design, wild landscapes are 
also perceived as less contemplative.
•  The least contemplative settings in green spaces 
include dense, complex, enclosed and canopied 
environments.

Designing green areas for contemplation
6.2.4  Education in green space
A study by the University College London revealed that 
living in areas with more green spaces does not just 
enhance health and wellbeing outcomes, but could 
also improve specific cognitive functions in children. 
The findings suggest that exposure to greenspace may 
help develop a better spatial working memory, which in 
turn can improve children’s academic achievement and 
particularly their mathematics performance.95  
A study from Taiwan showed similar results, suggesting 
that higher surrounding greenness contributes to a 
better English and Mathematics academic performance 
in students from elementary school, secondary school 
and higher education regardless of sociodemographic 
characteristics96. The type of vegetation influences the 
impact green space has on academic performance. 
Evidence indicates that children studying in schools 
with more trees had higher test scores advanced in 
Mathematics and Reading. On the other hand, such 
relationship was not found in case of grass and shrubs.97
If a school is not just simply surrounded by green spaces, 
but outdoor learning activities are also organized in 
these areas as part of the curriculum, that can bring  
a range of additional benefits to the students. Outdoor 
learning can be undertaken as part of fieldwork in 
various natural sites and forest schools, or outdoor visits 
to parks, forests, nature centres and gardens.
In 1994 in California an assessment of schools 
incorporating outdoor learning into their curriculum 
showed that secondary students from schools 
undertaking outdoor learning activities scored higher in 
a number of fields, such as reading, science and maths 
than students from traditional schools.98 
(See Showcase 6.5)
The findings of a study conducted in Amsterdam show 
that the proximity of green spaces strongly stimulate 
environmental education fieldwork. Visits to neighbouring 
green spaces were found to encourage teachers to 
organize more excursions that are further away from 
the school. The teachers involved in the study reported 
that lessons become more vivid helping pupils to stay 
focussed more easily.99
Environmental field studies in ecology organized for 
school children were also found to improve social skills of 
the students.100
(See Showcases 6.6, 6.7, 6.8 and 6.9)
Outdoor learning can take place not just outside the 
school’s premises, but also in green schoolyards, which 
are used as ‘outdoor classrooms’101. Sealed school 
grounds can be transformed into educational spaces, 
natural play spaces, educational organic gardens with 
raised beds, larger well-treed areas, or wildflower 
meadows. Numerous subjects can be taught in green 
schoolyards that are turned into outdoor classrooms, such 
as reading, writing, mathematics, sciences, environmental 
education, social studies, art and drama.102,103
In a study undertaken in Boston, 60% of the interviewed 
educators involved in school grounds programmes 
reported that their school garden schemes improved 
academic achievements in the fields of mathematics, 
sciences, language, art and reading.104 Schoolyards that 
are specifically designed to support learning can have 
a calming effect on students105, can reduce anti-social 
behaviour and build a stronger sense of community106. 
Children attending outdoor day-care facilities in 
schoolyards in any weather conditions were found to 
take fewer sick days than those attending conventional 
day-care facilities107.

The team of Out Teach Landscape Architecture, a 
non-profit organization based in the United States, 
has provided a guidance on creating quickly and 
inexpensively outdoor learning spaces.108 Their most 
important recommendations include the following:
•  a spot with natural shade should be identified for an 
outdoor learning space;
•  the site should be located near school doors so that 
it can be accessed and left quickly,
•  proximity to playgrounds and sport fields should be 
avoided, to prevent distraction during the class,
•  a whiteboard should be installed at the site, as 
teachers are less likely to use the outdoor classroom 
regularly if they need to bring along the equipment,
•  tree stumps can be used as inexpensive seating,
•  it is essential to provide a waterproof storage 
option near the whiteboard, where markers, wipes, 
cleaners, pencil and paper can be kept.

Development of outdoor learning spaces
6.2.5  Natural play spaces
A growing trend in urban design in Europe and North 
America is the creation of natural play spaces for 
children instead of over-programmed playgrounds.  
A natural playground or a natural play space is a play 
environment that consists of natural elements, such 
as trees, stumps, rocks, sand and water, instead of 
traditional playground equipment that include slides, 
swings and climbers. Natural playgrounds typically 
feature more open space109, and less structured play 
equipment110 as compared to conventional playgrounds.
(See Showcases 6.10 and 6.11)
Natural play spaces provide a vast array of benefits 
linked to health and wellbeing for children111,112,113.
•  They support an increased level of activity. Natural 
play areas, full of plants, logs, trees stumps 
and boulders create a particularly stimulating 
environment. Research by the University of Tennessee 
indicate that the time spent playing more than 
doubles when natural elements are incorporated into 
the playground.114
•  They encourage creative and imaginative play. 
Natural play features through supporting various 
types of sensory stimulation encourage imaginative 
play creativity. Children, instead of being dictated 
on how to play by the equipment, are motivated by 
natural play structures to engage in open-ended play 
and to develop new ways to challenge themselves. 
•  They improve the development of motor skills. In 
natural playgrounds children are engaged in more 
aerobic and bone- and muscle-strengthening 
activities, as well as various sensory activities involving 
touching, feeling and playing with natural objects, 
that improve their fine motor skills.
•  They strengthen social skills. Natural plays spaces 
through encouraging free play as well as group play, 
help the development of various social skills, such as 
communication, cooperation, and collaboration.
•  They are safer, as they are lacking the mechanical 
moving parts of traditional play equipment.
•  They are more accessible, since unlike traditional 
playgrounds, less structured natural play areas are 
more welcoming to children with differing abilities 
and fitness levels.
•  They help children learn about nature, as natural 
lay spaces bring children into direct contact with the 
environment.

Development of natural play spaces
    Action:
Promoting physical activity in green space
Experience shows that natural play spaces are easier to 
create, less costly, and more durable than conventional 
playgrounds, and at the same time children use them 
more often and for longer.115
Play structures in natural play spaces can range from 
logs, tree climbs, tree stumps, hillsides, long grass, 
sand, dirt, raised garden beds to water features.
The Government of South Australia has described 
some basic principles linked to the planning of 
natural play spaces116:
•  Stimulative spaces should be created that give 
children an opportunity to use all their senses, by 
using various colours, playing with forms and the 
intensity of light, providing different textures, using 
plants with scented leaves and flowers and creating 
an environment rich in natural sounds.
•  Natural elements should be used as they strongly 
support creative and imaginative play:
	
›  Water can be used to create small streams, 
ponds and other water features supporting 
interactive and multisensory play
	
›  Sand and mud urges children to dig and create 
particularly if mixed with water.
	
›  Wood and stone can be used to construct 
different structures, such as bridges or 
pathways.
•  A diversity of different play spaces should be 
developed to provide an inclusive place for children 
with various needs. Separate zones should be 
created for group play, for adventures and physical 
activities, and for tranquil small hidden places for 
seclusion.
•  Children should be offered the opportunity to 
play with loose parts with different size and 
form, such as stones, leaves, pinecones, sticks, 
log rounds, or shells.
6.2.6  Physical activity in green space
According to World Health Organization (WHO) physical 
inactivity is the fourth leading risk factor for global 
mortality.117 A study by the University of Cambridge 
indicated that almost 4 million premature deaths 
are being averted worldwide every year by people 
maintaining physical activity.118
Evidence suggests that out of all the relevant factors, 
close access to the site is the most relevant one that 
contributes to increased physical activity in green 
space. People who are within walking distance of 
a park are more likely to use it and the recreation 
services provided at the site, than those who are not.122
In a study, Kostrzewska from the Gdansk University 
of Technology, apart from highlighting the relevance 
of proximity to the place of residence, lists a number 
of other relevant features that should be considered 
during green space design that aims at increased 
physical activity123:
•  public spaces to be activated should be connected 
into a cohesive system that allows active mobility 
among different city areas,
•  to facilitate active and safe travels, bicycle stands 
and parking spaces should be provided near the 
activity areas,
•  the facilities to be installed should be diverse and 
multifunctional to encourage all age groups to 
undertake physical activity,
•  the design needs to be adapted to the local context 
and the surrounding landscape,
•  the green activity and recreation spaces should 
allow use all year round and in all weather 
conditions, due to good lighting, and various 
architectural features protecting from sun, wind, 
rain, or snow.
Availability of green space and greater levels of physical 
activity are strongly linked, as well as the associated 
health benefits. A study by the University of Oxford 
revealed that people who live in the greenest areas 
of England were more likely to undertake increased 
amounts of physical activity119. Parks provide places 
for people to engage in physical activity. Large and 
attractive parks were found to promote walking for 
health benefits120.
Several studies pointed to the role of natural factors of 
urban green open space in promoting physical activity 
suggesting that grass, trees, or flowers, cleanliness, 
maintenance, and aesthetics of the urban green open space 
were positively were associated with physical activity.121
URBACT Health&Greenspace network |  32
The development of large, open areas can maximize 
outdoor space appropriate for physical activity124. Park 
activity features (walking paths, play spaces, sport 
fields) should be complemented by good quality support 
features such as benches for rest and observation, 
shading, water fountains, and restrooms to attract higher 
visitation125. A review of studies provided evidence that 
neighbourhood spaces that encourage social interaction 
also stimulate physical activity126. As green activity spaces 
also have an important social function providing a 
meeting place for local communities, urban furniture that 
supports social interactions such as proper seating are 
particularly relevant in design127.
A review of studies provided evidence that 
neighbourhood spaces that encourage social interaction 
also stimulate physical activity.
Mixed-use parks, that facilitate a variety of activities 
and provide numerous reasons for more people to walk, 
show higher levels of physical activity128. Access to activity 
spaces depends on good connectivity. There is a need 
to improve travel connections to park and recreation 
facilities129. A greater variety of paths and a higher 
density of intersections within and next to parks supports 
more walking and physical activity130.
Proper design of park space and various facilities alone 
is not sufficient to physically activate visitors in green 
spaces, since as evidence shows that the organization 
of social programs and actions are also essential in 
bringing active park use to a higher level131.
Scheduling a wider menu of organized park activities 
and recreation programs targeting various groups of 
society can effectively improve the potential of green 
spaces for supporting physical activity132,133. Onsite and 
offsite promotion of park programs have an important 
role in increasing awareness of organized park 
opportunities and in achieving higher levels of active use 
of green space134.

6.2.7  Tactical urbanism and placemaking 
to enhance social wellbeing and 
community cohesion 
Tactical urbanism is a city, organizational, or citizen-led 
approach aiming at neighbourhood building that is 
based on the use of short-term, low-cost, and scalable 
interventions, which are meant to catalyse long-term 
change135. Tactical interventions can target at the 
creation of temporary spaces, performances in the 
public space, and all forms of community activism, that 
can trigger processes of change. Through supporting 
temporary interventions, such as the development of 
pop-up parks or pop-up parklets, or the promotion 
of guerrilla gardening, tactical urbanism can be a 
particularly effective tool supporting urban greening.
Longer-term changes can be made by placemaking 
in community public spaces such as parks and green 
streets. Placemaking is a creative, collaborative and 
place-based process for the design and development 
of built environment, that helps shaping the public realm 
to maximize shared value136,137. The aim is to create 
spaces that facilitate social engagement and chance 
interactions138. Placemaking is fundamentally helping 
people to turn a space into a place that they call home. 
In essence, placemaking brings together urban planning, 
mobility, sustainability, arts, ecology, and landscape 
architecture to build healthier and more liveable 
neighbourhoods.
Placemaking approaches can provide support in 
converting temporary spaces into permanent places 
by introducing green infrastructure, such as city trees, 
green roofs, green zones, and green walking routes. 
Pocket parks and parklets can be particularly effective 
placemaking devices.139 
(See Showcases 6.19, and 6.20)
6.2.8  Safety in green spaces
Parks can function as community spaces as long as 
they are considered safe by potential users. There is 
an indication that parks and other urban green spaces 
can in general prevent violence. In a study undertaken 
in Chicago in 2001 it was found that residents living in 
a greener urban area reported lower levels of fear, 
and less aggressive and violent behaviour140. A similar 
relationship was seen between green space and crime 
in another study conducted in 2012 in Baltimore that has 
shown that a 10% increase in tree canopy brings about a 
roughly 12% decrease in crime141.
But the type and quality of the green spaces really 
matters when it comes to perception of safety. In line 
with a study undertaken by Schroeder and Anderson 
undeveloped densely forested sites are associated 
with low security, while open areas with few trees are 
perceived significantly safer142. Another study carried out 
by Talbot and Kaplan has found similar results indicating 
that well-maintained areas were preferred over more 
untouched and densely wooded areas, which were often 
associated with danger143. View distance seems to be 
a decisive factor in the perception of safety in green 
spaces. Research suggests that at sites, where vegetation 
blocks views, fear of crime increases144.
URBACT Health&Greenspace network |  34
Design and maintenance of green spaces are critical 
in improving the public’s perception of safety. Evidence 
suggests that investing in a combination of good 
design, attractive facilities, park staff and maintenance 
of green spaces can be more effective in avoiding 
vandalism and anti-social behaviour, than the use of 
video surveillance145. Investing in the quality of the 
park can result in long-term savings. as a significant 
proportion of parks’ maintenance budgets in cities is 
spent on replacing vandalised items in parks146.
Open views and visibility are essential to perceived 
security147. Visibility is as much about being seen 
as about being able to see around. For people to 
feel safe and secure in public spaces, other people 
need to be present in accordance with the concept 
of “eyes on the street” proposed by Jane Jacobs148. 
Therefore, the animation green spaces with a range 
of activities is relevant in improving perceived safety. 
Parks that are heavily programmed on a regular basis 
tend to attract more visitors. After dark, carefully 
designed lighting can promote positive activities in 
parks reducing violence149. Maintenance of greenery is 
another essential factor, as low levels of maintenance 
in urban green areas were found to result in reduced 
perceptions of safety150. 
(See Showcase 6.21)
The Commission for Architecture and the Built 
Environment (CABE), a former non-departmental 
public body of the UK government responsible for 
advising on architecture and urban design, which was 
merged in 2011 into the Design Council, had provided 
recommendations for preventing anti-social behaviour 
in green spaces151,152:
•  a clarity of the design with open vistas and clear 
sight lines should be ensured,
•  exits should be visible and long corridors with no 
alternative ways out should be avoided,
    Action:
Promoting wellbeing through increasing 
the perception of safety in green spaces
•  positive features that attract people to parks, 
such as play spaces, flower and herb beds, water 
features and boardwalks should be developed,
•  in the design passive surveillance from surrounding 
areas should be exploited; cafés, apartments, stores 
and offices within parks or nearby have a great 
potential in this regard,
•  to be able to create a public space that is 
attractive for various user groups, it is important to 
involve early on the community in the design and 
maintenance of the green space,
•  there are significant benefits of involving ’problem’ 
groups or various under-represented groups in the 
revitalisation of green spaces, so that they feel a 
sense of ownership,
•  the establishment of ‘parks’ friends’ groups’ can lead 
to significant improvements in levels of anti-social 
behaviour, since such groups can support informal 
surveillance,
•  introducing a park warden service, ensuring that 
park staff is patrolling larger parks can dramatically 
increase the perception of safety among visitors.
A guide produced by Toronto Parks & Recreation also 
highlights a number of aspects to consider to create 
safer parks153:
•  the layout of the park should be easily understood, 
entrances and exits should be easy to locate, focal 
points should be clearly visible,
•  the edges of the park should be open, allowing the 
passer-by to see into the park and park users to look 
out,
•  the location and clustering of activity areas, such as 
play spaces and sports fields should allow informal 
surveillance,
•  a diversity of physical features, vegetation and 
activities is likely to result in attractive environments 
and frequent use,
•  it is beneficial to locate washrooms beside major 
activity areas,
•  lighting should help in directing movement between 
destinations at night,
•  night-time activity nodes should be located nearby 
street lighting.

Reducing Heat Stress with the 
Help of Green Infrastructure
Green infrastructure, such as parks and gardens, trees, 
green facades and roofs, can reduce the heat load in 
cities. In general, it reduces the heat storage capacity of 
urban surfaces, reduces air temperature through shading 
and evapotranspiration of water from the leaves and 
supports the chimney effect and ventilation bringing 
cool air into the city. The EEA has analysed sources on the 
effectiveness of different types of nature-based solutions to 
reduce heat and found strong evidence that nature-based 
solutions are moderately and highly effective (Figure 3).
Trees and green spaces appear to be particularly 
effective in regulating air and surface temperatures. 
Dense tree cover has an exceptionally high cooling 
potential. Air and surface temperature increases can 
be prevented by green roofs and green walls. In case 
7.1   The potential of green 
infrastructure to reduce heat 
stress 
Cooling by vegetation happens in two ways - by 
evapotranspiration and shading. When radiation hits 
the trees' canopy it causes water to evaporate from 
the surface of leaves. In addition, during transpiration, 
water moving through a plant is converted from liquid 
into gas as it passes through small openings on the 
undersides of leaves156. This process of direct evaporation 
at the ground and on plant surfaces combined with 
transpiration, called evapotranspiration, cools the plants 
down – just as sweating cools humans’ skin. The leaves 
release water into the atmosphere which vaporizes and 
cools the surrounding air. Urban green can thus catch 
Figure 3. Effectiveness of different NBS types to reduce heat.
Source: EEA, 2020155
of green roofs, spatial coverage is less important than 
leaf density and canopy height in achieving greater 
temperature reductions.154
URBACT Health&Greenspace network |  37
Trees provide cooling by shading and this is not just 
a physical effect. Peoples’ perception may even play 
a bigger role. While the reduction in air temperature 
is found to be relatively small, a research team of 
the University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam158, that 
analysed shaded and sunny locations in parks, streets, 
squares, and near water bodies in Amsterdam, found a 
reduction in the physiological equivalent temperature 
(PET) between 12 and 22 °C in spaces shaded by trees 
compared to sunlit areas. While shaded areas are 
perceived cooler and more comfortable, open grassy 
green spaces were not perceived as cooler. These results 
have been found consistent with other studies and lead to 
the conclusion that thermal comfort in parks on summer 
days could be improved by placing more trees and 
shade provisions.159,160 
It needs however to be noted that the actual heat 
reduction potential of green space and elements 
depends not only on the type of vegetation, but also 
their distribution and design. Open, vegetation-
covered areas at the edges of cities will deliver fresh 
air during night time, if ventilation corridors are not 
blocked. Vegetation that shades in surplus of cooling 
by evapotranspiration, like trees, provide humans more 
relief in outdoor environments than grasslands. However, 
if standing densely or as a tunnel in streets, trees may 
block ventilation and hamper cooling.
Cities can generate a country breeze, a local low-level 
air flow directed towards the centre. Its driving force 
is temperature difference between the usually warmer 
urban areas and cooler rural areas. The warmer air over 
built-up areas rises and cooler air rushes in into its place 
from non-urban areas.161
Similarly to rural areas, parks, acting as small-scale 
‘non-urban areas’, can create a smaller circulation, the 
‘park breeze’. The daytime cooling that is a result of 
evapotranspiration of park vegetation and the evening 
cooling that happens as vegetation does not retain as 
7.2   Practical approaches to 
reduce urban heat stress 
with green infrastructure
Adaptation to the impacts of climate change with 
warming temperatures in cities requires re-thinking urban 
design, in particular the design of green urban spaces 
and green elements. A number of general principles 
should be born in mind when urban green spaces are 
developed to reduces heat stress164,165:
•  Areas with high exposure and vulnerability should 
be prioritized when designing green infrastructure 
interventions for cooling. Neighbourhoods with a 
high proportion of elderly and very young citizens, 
or with large numbers of aged care facilities can we 
considered particularly vulnerable.
•  Detailed microclimatic analysis (i.e., the assessment 
of shadow or wind patterns) can help answer design 
questions, such as whether cooling is prioritized during 
day or night time, or whether cooling is desired within 
or outside buildings.
•  Deciduous trees should be preferred for cooling as they 
can provide shade during summer and do not block 
radiation during winter.
•  Species resistant against heat and drought should be 
used.
•  Urban green open spaces with primarily grassed 
areas and a relatively sparse or absent tree canopy, 
can provide ‘islands’ of cool in hot urban areas and 
can also lower the temperature of the surrounding 
landscape. Larger urban green open spaces should be 
located upwind of priority areas as they can effectively 
cool down areas downwind.
•  Adequate water supply is essential for maximizing the 
cooling services of vegetation. This can be achieved 
through storm water capture and storage, providing 
sufficient root space, and increasing the cover of 
permeable surfaces.
(See Showcase 7.1)
the radiation before it reaches the ground and use the 
energy for evapotranspiration. However, the extent of 
this cooling effect depends on the type of vegetation 
and on how well it is thriving. Evapotranspiration can be 
greatly reduced if the growing conditions are poor157.
much heat as artificial surfaces, creates a ‘park cool 
island’ (PCI) effect. As a result, the cooler air over parks 
replaces warmer air in nearby neighbourhoods.162 Larger 
parks are able to cool the surrounding urban fabric by 
creating stronger park-breezes163.

    Action:
Increasing the share and accessibility 
of green spaces
    Action:
Designing parks for cooling
In general, a higher share of urban green spaces will 
increase the cooling potential of a city. Heat stress risk 
can be reduced with increased accessibility of green 
spaces166. During planning actions for city-level cooling, 
the followings should be considered167,168.
•  A higher percentage of city area devoted to parks 
has more enhanced cooling benefits.
•  On a city level a network of interconnected green 
spaces and green elements should be maintained 
and developed further.
•  Larger parks have greater cooling potential than 
smaller ones, although in neighbourhoods, where 
space is limited, small green areas should still be 
used for reducing heat stress. 
•  In dense neighbourhoods with minimal private 
outdoor spaces the presence and accessibility of 
public green spaces should be ensured.
Green parks can be particularly effective in reducing 
urban temperatures. The cooling effect of parks 
extends beyond its boundary into the surrounding 
neighbourhood. With increasing park size, the area 
around the park benefiting from the cooling effect also 
increases169. Planners should consider among others 
the following aspects when parks are designed for 
cooling170,171.
•  Apart from park size, vegetation greenness is also 
an important factor for park cooling efficiency.
•  Increasing the share of water body can effectively 
improve the cooling effect of a park.
•  Flexible and multifunctional spaces should be 
created in parks to enable individual thermal 
adaptation.
•  In a park, gradients of open areas and shading 
elements should be developed, as edges between 
sun and shade are popular places for visitors in 
parks providing them opportunities to adapt to 
diverse thermal conditions. A ratio of 40% sun, 
20% half-shade and 40% shade seems to be in line 
with the preferences of park visitors under various 
thermal conditions and on various times of the day.
•  In a park, green fraction should be preserved or 
increased on the wind side of the park (prevailing 
summer wind direction should be considered) and 
cold air corridors should be kept open, to improve 
thermal conditions within the park.

Cooling corridors, such as tree-lined urban streets 
provide a cooling effect in a largely paved 
environment172. Squares can be transformed into 
cooling islands if they are designed with more 
greenery, water and shading. The majority of buildings 
in a city have flat roofs creating the potential to form 
a green roof landscape that can reduce temperatures 
of roof surfaces and the surrounding air. In densely 
built neighbourhoods green facades can also provide 
cooling effects. 
(See Showcase 7.2)
A study in Shanghai173 indicated that in most of the 
cases pocket green spaces have a cooling effect 
on their surroundings. Some recommendations for 
planning cooling streets and cooling islands are listed 
below174,175,176.
•  In streets with high solar radiation tree species with 
large canopies should be planted.
•  In streets with heavy traffic, to avoid the ‘tunnel 
effect’, space should be created for wind circulation 
between tree canopies.
•  In street canyons a diversity of microclimates should be 
created with sunny and shaded areas so that pedestrians 
might select their preferred route for walking.
•  In street canyons the thermal perception of 
pedestrians can be improved when green elements 
are installed at various heights.
•  Wide street canyons and narrow canyons with 
low buildings can be considered priority streets 
for cooling with greenery. Green cover should be 
maximised on the west-facing (east) side of the street, 
that is likely to become the hottest, as it is exposed to 
the afternoon sun.
Green spaces, both small and large ones, can improve 
thermal comfort in extreme heat events. Parks, school 
grounds, gardens and green patios of public buildings 
can all function as cooling elements for residents during 
prolonged hot days and nights. 
(See Showcase 7.3) 
Larger parks with high presence of urban greenery and 
water fountains are particularly effective as climate 
shelters. During heat waves public and private gardens 
can be made accessible for all, and park hours can be 
extended.
•  In street canyons ‘overhead’ vegetation canopy cover 
should be maximized (optimally tree canopies, or 
vine-covered archways). Broad, wide and short trees 
are particularly effective at shading sideways.
•  ITrees can trap heat under their foliage at night, 
therefore street trees should not form a continuous 
canopy to allow hot air to escape through the spaces 
between the plants.
•  Pocket green space that are dominated by tree-
shrub-grass have particularly high cooling efficiency.

Using Urban Greenery  
to Improve Air Quality
Urban green infrastructure can bring about positive 
health outcomes through reducing the public’s exposure 
to air pollution. The use of greenery can offer options for 
mitigating air pollution that can effectively complement 
conventional emission control strategies. Vegetation plays 
an important part in controlling the flow and distribution of 
pollutants.
In general, the adverse impacts of air pollution can be 
reduced through the application of three basic methods:
•  Reducing emissions at source. Measures linked to this 
method include using less polluting industrial processes, 
using less polluting raw materials, improving process 
efficiency, emission control technologies, traffic calming, 
emission controls on vehicles, or use of cleaner fuels. This 
method should be prioritized, since reducing emissions 
is the most effective way of mitigating exposure to 
pollutants.
•  Extending the distance between pollution sources and 
receptors. The concentration of pollutants decreases with 
distance from the source as pollutants are mixing with 
cleaner air.
•  Protecting receptors. This method has to do with direct 
interventions targeting reduced concentrations at the 
receptor site.177
Green infrastructure can help to varying degrees in the 
application of all three methods. By placing vegetation as 
barriers, the distance between sources and receptors can 
be extended virtually. Hedges acting in this role can be 
used as green buffers separating vehicles and pedestrians. 
Greenery can also protect people from air pollution, 
through increasing the deposition rates of pollutants with 
the help of the relatively large surface area of the plants178. 
Urban green spaces can even help in reducing emissions 
indirectly, through taking the place of emission sources, or 
through encouraging less polluting active transport179.
8.1   The potential of greenery to 
reduce concentration of air 
pollutants
8.1.1  Processes influencing air quality
Urban greenery can protect people from air pollution 
through two key processes, dispersion and deposition.180
Dispersion is a process through which air pollution is 
distributed into the atmosphere. Urban vegetation, with 
its dispersive effect, changes the speed of pollutants 
and also the distance pollutants travel before they reach 
people. This can lead to significant reductions in the 
concentration of pollutants locally181.
Trees and hedges by providing obstacles to the airflow, 
introduce turbulence, increasing the dilution of pollutants. 
As a result, the distance between the source and 
receptor will be virtually extended. The introduction of 
a vegetation barrier displaces the flow of pollutants 
upwards, extending the effective path-length of air from 
source to receptor, while dilution is promoted182.
In an open-road environment a vegetation barrier (i.e., 
a hedge) can halve the concentrations of pollutants 
in its immediate vicinity183. The introduction of hedges 
between road and pedestrians are particularly effective 
in reducing pollutant concentrations through dispersion. 
A study of the University of Surrey indicated that hedges 
along roadsides can cut back the concentration of black 
carbon, a key component of fine particulate matter, 
by up to 63%. It was also confirmed by the study that 
hedges or a combination of trees with hedges are the 
most effective forms of greenery for reducing exposure 
to pollution emitted by cars184. Smaller reductions were 
shown for gaseous pollutants185.
Deposition is a process by which pollutants land on 
solid surfaces and are removed from the air186. Green 
infrastructure can reduce the concentration of air 
pollutants locally by enhancing their deposition rates, 
since pollutants deposit more efficiently on vegetation 
than on smoother artificial surfaces187. Trees and shrubs 
have a relatively high surface area that can function 
as natural sink for pollutants. The rate of deposition 
is subject to the available surface area as well as the 
aerodynamic roughness of the surface188.
URBACT Health&Greenspace network |  42
Apart from dispersion and deposition there is a third 
mechanism, the modification of particulate matter, 
through which green infrastructure can improve air 
quality. These modifications include the coagulation of 
smaller particles that may accelerate deposition, and the 
changing of pollutant compositions that may reduce the 
toxicity of particulate matter189.
Leaf-associated microbes, such as bacteria, yeasts, and 
fungi have a role in bioremediation (phylloremediation) 
of air pollutants. Microbial communities colonizing the 
surface and the interior of plants’ leaves were found 
to be able to adsorb and biodegrade or transform 
pollutants into less toxic molecules.190
8.2   Practical approaches to 
reduce air pollution with the 
use of greenery
Some trees are far more effective at trapping air 
pollutants than others191. A number of vegetation traits 
needs to be considered for the selecting appropriate 
plant species for pollutant capture.
The filtering activity of trees depends mainly on the 
canopy size. Not surprisingly, larger canopies can trap 
more pollutants than smaller ones192. The density of 
the foliage is a key factor as it actually determines the 
vegetation area available for deposition193. The density 
of a tree is influenced by the branching of the crown and 
the characteristics of the leaves194. Although vegetation 
density increases deposition, still a green filtration 
barrier should not be too dense to allow penetration 
and to ensure that the airflow is not directed above the 
barrier limiting opportunities for deposition195. An optimal 
vegetation barrier density will permit infiltration without 
throughflow196.
Mature trees with large canopies are significantly more 
efficient in removing pollutants compared to young 
trees197. Research indicates that large, healthy trees with 
a trunk diameter above 75 cm remove more than 70 
times more air pollution than small, healthy trees with a 
trunk diameter below 25 cm198.
Apart from the height of a tree and foliage density, the 
shape of the crown is also relevant. A spherical crown for 
instance is found to be more effective than one with a 
pyramid shape .
Foliage longevity is another important aspect. As 
opposed to deciduous trees, which lose their leaves 
during winter, evergreen species can act as year-round 
filters200,201. However, evergreen species may be more 
sensitive to certain environmental stressors, such as 
draught and heat202. Among deciduous species those 
ones are preferable that exhibit longer in-leaf seasons203.
There is an indication that species with smaller leaves 
tend to be more effective than ones with larger leaves. 
Conifers with their dense canopy of needles seem to 
support more effectively deposition of particulates than 
deciduous species.204
The features of leaf surface also influence the filtration 
potential of plants. Rough, hairy and rugged surfaces 
that include grooves and ridges act as the best biofilters 
for particulates205,206. The stickiness of the leaves was 
also found to be significant in trapping particulates207. 
Due to their hairy leaves, silver birch, yew and elder are 
particularly effective at capturing ultrafine particles, 
which can pose substantial hazards to human health208.
Stomata that are the small pores found on leaf surfaces 
controlling gas exchange, have a relevant role in 
pollutant capture, particularly in case of gaseous 
pollutants209. Air pollutant removal may be enhanced 
by the selection of species that have stomata with 
extensive opening periods, such as poplar and some oak 
species210. 
Not only the structure and other properties of the leaves 
are relevant for particle capture efficiency, but also the 
canopy shape and shoot structure. There is an indication 
that tree species with more complex shoot structure have 
higher particle capture efficiency.211
Despite its ability to capture air pollutants, greenery 
can also be a source of pollution. Trees and other plants 
produce volatile organic compounds, which when 
URBACT Health&Greenspace network |  43
exposed to sunlight react with nitrogen oxides emitted 
mainly from vehicles and industrial sources to form 
ozone, that can lead to the formation of ground-level 
smog. In addition, many tree species produce pollen, 
which can cause allergic reactions.212 When planning 
urban greenery in the vicinity of residential areas, it is 
wise to avoid planting tree species that produce highly 
allergenic pollen, such as birch, ash, oak, and elm213, 
or those ones that emit significant amount of volatile 
organic compounds, such as black locust, poplar  
or plane tree214.
Various beneficial vegetation traits that influence capture 
efficiency does not automatically make certain plant 
species fit for any context. Simply selecting tree species 
that have a high potential for air pollution mitigation 
will not lead to desirable results. When designing 
greenery for pollutant capture, plant species should be 
selected that are adapted to the local environmental 
conditions. In urban settings, and particularly in roadside 
environments, vegetation has to cope with multiple 
stressors, such as dry or poor soil conditions, various 
diseases, soil compaction, lack of root space, excess 
water in the root zone accompanied by anaerobic 
conditions, air pollution, or salt pollution215. Considering 
these extreme conditions in urban systems, when 
assessing the suitability of various species, it is plants’ 
stress tolerance that should be given priority over all 
other functionalities216.
Different foliage density is desirable depending 
on whether the greenery is used for dispersion or 
deposition. As the density of the barrier decreases, 
the effective path-length shortens and with this the 
dispersive effect of the vegetation decreases, but at the 
same time the opportunity for pollution removal through 
deposition increases217. The denser the vegetation 
barrier, the more effective it will be at displacing and 
diluting the polluted air. Therefore, green barriers used 
for dispersion should be as dense as possible218,219. In 
contrast, vegetation barriers that aim at the filtration 
of pollutants should be sufficiently dense to promote 
deposition with an extensive surface area, while at 
the same time should not be overly dense, to support 
penetration, instead deflecting the airflow220.
    Action:
Using greenery to improve air quality along roads
A guide titled, ’Using green Infrastructure to protect 
people from air pollution’ published by the Greater 
London Authority221 provides a range of practical 
recommendations for designing greenery for 
reductions in exposure to urban air pollution along 
roads. Depending on the type of urban road the guide 
provides help in the identification of the appropriate 
type of green infrastructure intervention. The guide 
highlights the relevance of careful design, as in certain 
urban situations wrongly placed vegetation can even 
increase locally pollution concentrations. Some of the 
key recommendations of the guide are summarized 
below:
•  On busy roads surrounded by buildings on each side 
(street canyons), where the air is more polluted at 
street level than above, a dense row of trees can 
have an adverse effect on local air quality, as the 
trees can trap the pollution emitted from vehicles 
under their canopies. In such urban situations, 
vegetation barriers between the vehicles and 
pedestrians, such as hedgerows, can be effective in 
reducing pollutant concentration at the receptor side.
•  On very quiet street canyons where air is more 
polluted above the buildings than at street level, 
a dense tree alley with extensive canopies can 
effectively reduce downward dispersion, protecting 
people at street level.
•  On open roads, when the aim is to protect people 
right next to the road, hedges can function as 
effective barriers between the road and pedestrians 
(Figure 4). As the height of the vegetation barrier 
increases, the protected area increases.
•  When the goal is to protect people further away 
from an open road, a taller barrier, such as a dense 
row of trees with hedges, can be useful to reduce 
concentration of pollutants in a larger area.
•  Green open space next to a road, such as a park has 
an essential role in reducing exposure to pollution 
from transport, as it allows pollutants to disperse.
•  A thicker vegetation barrier will be more effective at 
displacing road transport emissions and at supporting 
their dilution.

    Action:
Installing green roofs and green walls  
for air pollutant removal
Hedges are particularly effective in protecting 
schoolgrounds, kindergarten yards, and playgrounds 
from air pollution exposure.
(See Showcase 8.1). 
Evergreen species are proposed for vegetation barriers 
by a study undertaken by the University of Surrey222, 
which can effectively reduce exposure to air pollution in 
all seasons.
When greenery is designed for deposition, a number 
of factors need to be considered. One key aspect is 
the height of the vegetation. Low grasslands have the 
weakest, while coniferous forests have the strongest 
filtering potential. In between, filtering effect increases 
in the following order, high grassland, shrubs and 
deciduous forests. Research has shown that transitions 
in the landscape from low vegetation to forest also 
have a significant effect on the deposition process of 
air pollutants. Because of an ‘edge effect’, deposition 
in the centre of a forest is significantly lower than in 
the fringe zone. Deposition will increase further and 
the deposition zone will grow if the transition in the 
woodland fringe is sharp.226 
(See Showcase 8.3). 
Green roofs and green walls can also remove large 
amounts of pollutants from air. While trees can 
trap pollution under their canopies in certain urban 
situations, green roofs and walls let the air circulate 
freely and at the same time can remove pollutants223 
(See Showcase 8.2). 
A study conducted in Australia indicated that green 
roofs can contribute to emission reductions ranging 
from 35% to 83%224. Green walls in street canyons were 
found to reduce PM10 concentrations of by up to 50%, 
and NO2 concentrations by up to 35%225.

Using greenery to invite people  
to areas with better air quality
    Action:
Developing green spaces  
to support ventilation
Urban planners can also use green infrastructure to 
invite residents to spend more time in public spaces 
with better air quality. 
(See Showcases 8.4 and 8.5)  
Such areas can be made more welcoming and 
comfortable by adding new greenery227. Parks 
can protect people from air pollution indirectly by 
attracting them away from polluted areas into cleaner 
ones228. When designing streets, people could be 
encouraged by adding greenery to stay longer in 
the mid-sections of the streets and away from street 
corners229, as intersections are typical pollution hotspots 
in a city230.
Green corridors and parks promote ventilation within 
the urban fabric and through this can help improve 
air quality. Strategic urban planning can enhance 
the natural circulation of air in a city. Designed in line 
with natural wind patterns, green corridors create air 
pathways that can reduce pollution in stagnant air231. 
Ventilation in a city can be supported by the creation 
of wide linear parks232, by the use of construction 
bans at strategic places (such as valleys, hills, hillsides, 
and saddle-like topographies)233,234, and by the 
development of a grid of parks and small green areas 
that are connected to one another235
(See Showcase 8.6). 
The greenery in ventilation corridors should be planted 
in a less compact arrangement, to make it possible for 
the wind to pass through them236.

Reducing Noise Pollution  
with Urban Vegetation
9.1   The role of vegetation  
in noise reduction
9.2   Practical approaches to 
reduce noise exposure 
through green infrastructure
Hedgerows, green roofs and green walls can function 
as sound barriers. Vegetation reduces noise pollution 
by accelerating the dissipation of the energy of 
sound through absorption, deflection, refraction, and 
masking.237 Sound is absorbed by plant parts such 
as leaves, stems, branches, and trunks. Due to their 
dynamic surface area, rough bark and thick leaves are 
particularly effective at absorbing sound. During sound 
deflection, when sound waves hit the flexible material of 
plants, it will vibrate as audible energy is transformed 
into physical energy. Refraction of sound waves happens 
when sound passes through vegetation barriers and 
bends around plant structures.238
Apart from blocking noise, trees and shrubs also have 
a masking effect, as they produce natural sounds (the 
rustling of leaves, the movement of branches in the 
wind, the sounds of birds and insects associated with 
trees, etc.)239.The sounds of nature have been associated 
with a range of perceived restorative experiences such 
as pleasure, relaxation, and escape from everyday 
concerns240.
Compared to bare soil or pavement, low vegetation 
in open areas has a muffling effect on sound, similarly 
to the carpeting in a room.241 There is evidence that a 
dense belt of trees and shrubs can reduce sound levels 
by as much as 6 to 8 decibels.242 In addition, green noise 
buffers absorb sounds mainly at the highest frequencies 
that annoy people the most.243
Vegetation apart from physically dampening noise, can 
also contribute to the perception of quietness. Noise 
bother people less, when they do not see its source. The 
use of green infrastructure between people and the 
source of noise impacts the human perception regardless 
of the thickness of the vegetation.244
    Action:
Using plants as noise buffers
Green noise barriers can be an alternative means 
of reducing urban traffic noise245. Forest Research, 
Great Britain’s principal organisation for forestry and 
tree-related research, provided recommendations for 
planning noise buffers246:
•  The noise buffer should be planted closer to the noise 
source than to the area to be protected.
•  Trees and shrubs should be planted as close to each 
other as the species will allow.
•  Plants with dense foliage should be used.
•  The foliage of the plant should reach the ground. 
This effect can be achieved by combining shrubs and 
trees.
•  Year-round protection is provided by evergreen 
plants.
•  Tall trees should be used as noise buffers, or if that is 
not possible, then shorter shrubs should be combined 
with tall grass.
For effective traffic noise reduction, the ideal depth 
of vegetation barrier is around 5 meters247. In wide 
open spaces, dense hedges are more appropriate for 
blocking off noise than a single row of trees248.
Green roofs have a great potential to substantially 
abate road traffic noise. Green facade walls seem to 
be less effective in noise reduction.249

    Action:
Creation of tranquil areas  
and increasing their accessibility 
Tranquil areas that imply both quiet and natural 
settings, can be beneficial to human health and 
wellbeing through contributing to stress reduction. 
Accordingly, the provision, protection and improvement 
of tranquil areas should be seen as important goals 
in urban planning250. Tranquil areas are not areas of 
complete silence, they are rather places that ensure 
relative quietness, which are dominated by natural 
sounds. 
(See Showcase 9.1)
When cities develop measures supporting tranquil 
areas, the following should be considered:
•  Policies should be developed for the identification of 
tranquil areas.
•  Tranquil green spaces under threat should be 
protected.
•  The creation of tranquil amenity spaces can 
effectively contribute to human health and wellbeing 
through contributing to stress reduction.
•  Establishment of buffer zones can increase the 
perception of silence.
•  Access to quiet, natural places in urban areas can 
be enhanced by improving the ecological quality of 
urban green spaces.

Street Greening for Health  
and Wellbeing Outcomes
10.1  Benefits of green streets
The benefits of street greening can enhance the 
ecological, economic and social environment around  
a city street.
Ecological benefits
Improves water quality
During episodes of heavy rains, green infrastructure  
is temporarily storing runoff water and filtering it from 
pollutants, improving the quality of water entering water 
bodies.
Increases groundwater recharge
In an urban environment the high share of impermeable 
pavement aggravates the problem of flooding and 
negatively affects runoff water management. Therefore, 
increasing the permeability city surfaces is a priority. 
Green infrastructure, such as rain gardens and bioswales 
fulfil this function: they catch stormwater, with the help of 
plants they remove pollutants, and they infiltrate water 
into the groundwater plate.
Improves air quality
Trees and other vegetation can improve air quality by 
directly removing air pollution and slowing temperature-
dependent reactions that form particulate matter that  
is hazardous to human health. 
Reduces urban heat island effects
Vegetation blocks the short-wave solar radiation, but 
also absorbs long-wave radiation emitted by surrounding 
materials, lowering temperatures especially during 
the day. Permeable pavements and vegetation will 
evapotranspire water and cool air temperatures.
Enhances wildlife habitat
Green infrastructure can offer a better environment to 
live, find food and shelter for wildlife living in an urban 
environment.
Economic benefits
Reduces water treatment costs
Green infrastructure practices that increase infiltration 
or use water on-site (bioretention systems, permeable 
surfaces) can reduce the amount of water being 
conveyed to wastewater treatment facilities and reduce 
the volume of water discharged to the sewage system.
Reduces infrastructure costs
Green infrastructure can reduce investment costs through 
reducing the need for infrastructure expansion.
Increases property values
Increased greenery within urban areas enhances the 
aesthetic value of neighbourhoods. The positive impact 
of green infrastructure practices on aesthetics can be 
reflected in the relationship between urban greening and 
property value.
Social benefits
Increases pedestrian safety and traffic calming
Bump-out curbs, swales and segregated bike lanes 
offer security to bikers and pedestrians, and stimulate 
a healthier kind of mobility. By promoting walking and 
cycling, the risk of obesity and related heart diseases will 
decrease.
Enhances well-being of individuals
Aesthetically pleasing pathways, trees and other 
vegetation, enhance well-being and help the mind 
recover from mental fatigue or stress251.
Increases the sense of community
Green street projects provide an opportunity to involve 
the community in the process of designing and proposing 
ideas for their communal environment. For this reason,  
it is important to implement green infrastructure practices 
together with placemaking and the participation of the 
community.
URBACT Health&Greenspace network |  51
10.2   Greening streets for 
improved health and 
wellbeing outcomes
10.3   Design considerations
Positive impacts of green streets on physical and mental 
health
A greater exposure to green space is linked to improved 
physical and mental health across all socioeconomic 
groups252. A 2021 study at Harvard T.H. Chan School 
of Public Health253 shows that regularly spending time 
around trees provides a wide range of health benefits, 
from lowering stress to improving cognition to increasing 
longevity.
Reducing heat stress with street greening
Vegetation blocks the short-wave solar radiation, but 
also absorbs long-wave radiation emitted by surrounding 
materials, lowering temperatures especially during the 
day. Using reflective and lighter surfaces in pavements 
and incorporating vegetation can reduce temperature 
impacts. Permeable pavements and vegetation 
contribute to increased evapotranspiration of water that 
help cool air temperatures.254
Street greening contributing to improved air quality
Trees and other vegetation can improve air quality 
by directly capturing air pollutants and slowing 
temperature-dependent atmospheric reactions that form 
hazardous particulate matter.255
Positive impacts of green streets on social wellbeing and 
community cohesion
Green spaces can strengthen social ties among 
neighbours256. Neighbourhoods with strong social 
cohesion have lower rates of anxiety and depression. The 
contact with greenery enhances well-being and helps 
the mind recover from mental fatigue or stress257. A study 
has found a link between increased vegetation and the 
use of outdoor spaces for social activity, concluding that 
urban greening can foster interactions that build social 
capital.258
Green streets for noise reduction
Vegetation has been considered as a means to reduce 
outdoor noise pollution, mainly in areas with high 
volumes of traffic. But also the use of porous pavement 
in city streets was found to reduce noise level by up to 10 
decibels259. In some cases, linear tree buffers can even 
replace conventional noise mitigation strategies, such as 
concrete noise walls260.
10.3.1  Identification of priority areas for 
street greening
In cities there are countless of opportunities for 
introducing green streets into the townscape. But, when 
resources available for interventions aiming at the use 
of nature-based solutions across streets are limited, 
then urban authorities need to be careful with the 
prioritization of target areas. A number of aspects need 
to be considered during the selection of priority areas for 
street greening261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266.
•  The current built environment should be carefully 
mapped to capitalize on inefficient use of space.
•  It is essential to distribute greening in streets fairly 
across various neighbourhoods. The amount of 
greening and the access to canopy cover across the 
local government area should be assessed to identify 
hotspots lacking sufficient greenery.
•  Low-cost and simple projects should be ranked as high-
priority.
•  In case of streets that are wider than necessary, 
greening interventions combined with street width 
narrowing actions (such as the elimination of travel 
lanes on multi-streets or the reduction of the number 
or the size of on-street parking places) should be 
considered, contributing thus to traffic calming and a 
balance and healthy streetscape. 
•  The space under and above ground should be suitable 
for increased canopy.
•  Heat hotspot and vulnerability hotspot mapping should 
be used determine the priority zones for greening streets. 
Neighbourhoods with a high proportion of elderly or 
children, or with large numbers of aged care facilities can 
we considered particularly vulnerable to heat stress. Wide 
street canyons and also narrow canyons with low buildings 
can be considered priority streets for cooling with greenery.
•  Areas/streets should be mapped that can effectively 
contribute to the establishment of a calm space 
network through targeted greening actions. In sections 
where permanent greening is not available, the use 
of temporary and ‘pop-up’ green spaces can be 
considered to offer respite.
•  It is worth combining street greening efforts with planned 
road or footpath upgrades due to occur in the street.
•  Capital improvement projects, weather resiliency plans, 
stormwater management plans or citywide initiatives 
can help identify potential green infrastructure sites.
•  Large-scale development projects can offer 
opportunities for greening the streetscape in the vicinity 
of the development site.
URBACT Health&Greenspace network |  52
10.3.2  Species selection
Urban trees and street trees in particular are growing 
under exceptionally harsh conditions in the presence 
of multiple stress factors. Soil compaction, caused by 
heavy traffic, construction work, and dense buildings are 
some of the major problems affecting street trees. In 
compacted soil the water and air permeability are poor 
and the roots grow more slowly.
(See Showcase 10.1). 
Increased surface runoff and poor water retention in 
urban areas result in soil drought. In addition, street 
trees typically need to cope with contamination, nutrient 
deficiency, limited light access in densely built-up areas, 
or excessive illumination due to the use of reflective 
materials on buildings, or light pollution disrupting plant 
physiology267. Therefore, in an urban environment it is of 
paramount importance to select species that are tolerant 
to various stress factors. As urban habitats do not favour 
tree growth and shortens the lifetime of the plants, 
more durable species should be selected for a street 
environment268.
Here some basic principles are summarized for the 
selections of species269, 270, 271, 272.
•  When possible, it is preferable to use native species, 
although many native species do not adapt well to 
harsh urban conditions, or might not meet desired 
functions.
•  Consideration should be given to watering needs and 
heat resistance of the species in light of a changing 
climate.
•  Where it is desired to maintain canopy during the 
winter season (e.g., for pollution reduction), evergreen 
species should be used, but if the goal is to let through 
the sunlight during winter, then deciduous trees should 
be selected.
•  Vegetation placed along roads should be tolerant 
to air pollution as well as salt and other de-icing 
compounds.
•  An increase in tree diversity in the city can reduce the 
vulnerability of trees to pests and diseases. On the 
other hand, forced diversity of trees may results in 
planting unsuitable species of trees.
10.3.3  Planning for maintenance
Without designing with maintenance in mind, green 
streets will not perform as expected over the long-
term. There are several maintenance factors to consider 
before project implementation. During the green streets 
design process, designers should be in close contact 
with municipal staff to be able to understand the human 
resources available for long-term maintenance. If the 
new greenery will require duties that is different from 
current practices, the training of staff needs to be 
undertaken prior to project completion.273
Maintenance of green infrastructure needs to take 
account of a wider landscape context (biodiversity, 
amenity) together with drainage requirements.274
At a minimum, green infrastructure practices should be 
inspected annually to remove trash, clean inlets and 
outlets, remove invasive species and prune vegetation. 
Maintenance should be performed more frequently while 
vegetation becomes established.
10.3.4  Accommodating utilities during of 
green infrastructure
Utilities in the streetscape above and below ground 
can often hinder the implementation of green streets 
projects. Yet, with the right site conditions, careful 
planning and stakeholder support, green infrastructure 
can coexist with utility systems. Close cooperation with the 
local utility companies during the design phase of green 
infrastructure interventions can ensure that utility needs 
and concerns are also addressed.275
The Green Streets Handbook published by the United 
States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)276 provides 
a summary of basic principles that should be considered 
for accommodating utilities during the implementation of 
green street projects.
During project design among other the following 
requirements might arise associated with utility systems:
•  providing access to utility lines for repair or 
replacement and sufficient space for accommodating 
utility vaults and utility valve boxes, and
•  providing adequate protection around utility lines.
URBACT Health&Greenspace network |  53
To avoid any utility conflict, the simplest and most 
cost-effective option is to locate green infrastructure 
clear of any utility or to reduce its size to provide 
sufficient distance from the utility lines. In case sufficient 
protection and clearance is ensured on the site, then 
utility companies can be encouraged to coexist with the 
new greenery. Modifications to the design of both the 
green elements or the utility system can also be effective 
in specific urban situations. As a last resort, the utility 
can be replaced or relocated. Ideally utility lines can be 
rearranged as a compact system rather than separate 
infrastructure.
In many cases, a number of solutions are available to 
address utility challenges and enable the realization of 
green infrastructure projects in streets. Options provided 
by the handbook to avoid problems include:
•  placing utility vaults outside the wet zones,
•  protecting utility trenches with impermeable geotextile 
or liners or clay or other impermeable plugs to prevent 
the infiltration of stormwater,
•  installing a clay or other impermeable plug within the 
utility trench to inhibit movement of stormwater within 
the trench line,
•  construction of a deep curb profile to separate the 
layer of native soil on which the foundation of a road is 
laid from the green verge.
The Green Streets Guide of Vermont277 provides some 
additional considerations in this context:
•  in case overhead utilities are present on the site, then 
during the selection of plants, the mature height of 
various tree species needs to be carefully considered,
•  the minimum required setback distances for 
maintenance of above and below ground utility systems 
need to be applied,
•  the cost of underground utility access for repairs might 
be lower in case of greenery systems (and pervious 
pavers) since they are easier to remove or replace than 
traditional hardscapes.
10.3.5  Green infrastructure contributing to 
healthy street design
Due to car-centric planning, in most of the modern cities 
across the globe the air is poor, noise levels are high, 
there is little space for cycling and walking, the amount 
of greenery is often negligible, and in certain cases it is 
particularly dangerous not to drive a car.
A Healthy Streets Approach was developed by Lucy 
Saunders, according to which streets need to be made 
much more pleasant, welcoming and safe to promote an 
active urban life278 
(See Showcases 10.2 and 10.3).
According to the approach, in a typical healthy street 
there is a wide sidewalk for pedestrians urging people 
to take a leisurely walk, conditions for two-way bicycle 
traffic are provided, car traffic is limited, and there 
are facilities around, such as cafes, stores, benches 
or fountains that motivate people to stay longer and 
socialize.279
    Action:
Creating healthy streets with the use of greenery
Well designed and maintained green infrastructure 
can effectively contribute to the creation of a healthy 
street280:
•  good-quality and attractive street greenery feels 
welcoming, and encourages people to be more 
physically active on the street,
•  well maintained green infrastructure by improving 
the ambience of a street, increases the perception of 
safety of pedestrians,
•  vegetation on streets (e.g., parklets, trees with 
benches around and under them, or planter boxes 
next to benches) can provide a sheltered resting 
place,
•  greenery, such as hedges, can reduce the exposure to 
air pollutants on the street,
•  trees and hedges can mitigate heat, providing shade 
from the sun,
•  green infrastructure can function as a sound barrier 
and can reduce the perception of noise,
•  street greenery has a calming effect on people 
contributing to stress reduction.

10.3.6  Tactical urbanism and placemaking 
with greenery on street level
A tactical urbanism approach for street greening, could 
be to add temporary green elements to a street section, 
such as planters or parklets, to enhance social wellbeing 
and community cohesion on neighbourhood level. 
Following this initial temporary intervention, a process of 
placemaking can generate a collective design with the 
participation of the local community, to turn the same 
temporary space into a more stable green space, with 
trees and other elements of green infrastructure. One 
example illustrating this practice is described in
(Showcase 10.4.)
10.3.7  Planning for walkability and 
bikeability
Cities are largely composed through traffic. Modern 
urban development is car-dominated, leading to an 
unfortunate distribution of land. The streetscape however 
should not be designed only for traffic. Streets, and 
particularly streets in city centres should be places to 
slow down and stop, rather than places for passing 
through. If in a typical street in an urban centre a car 
lane is replaced or narrowed by different services, such 
as greenery, wider sidewalks, or bike lanes, similar or 
increased traffic capacity can be achieved that will 
be accompanied with health and wellbeing and other 
benefits.
A green street can provide space to stimulate walking, 
running and biking, not only to enjoy physical activity, but 
also to use alternative and healthier modes of transport 
to commute and move around in the city.
One of the proposals of the Mayor of the City of Paris, 
developed by Carlos Moreno, in this line is the ’15-minute 
city’. It promotes walkability and cycling in big cities 
based on a concept of urban proximity.
Carlos Moreno’s 15-minute city framework is based on 
four key characteristics281:
•  Proximity: services, stores need to be close.
•  Diversity: a wide variety of urban amenities need to be 
offered through mixed land uses.
•  Density: the neighbourhood needs to be dense so 
that there is sufficient number of people to support a 
diversity of businesses in a compact land area.
•  Ubiquity: these compact neighbourhoods should be 
available and affordable to anyone who would move in 
one of them.
Walkable and bikeable streets and cities start by 
planning with a human-centred design, that aims to 
enhance a sense of proximity and ease of access to an 
ameliorated urban way of living.

Biodiversity is important for our health. A biodiverse 
vegetation with various wild plants creates favourable 
living conditions for many bacteria associated with 
these native wild plants that are very important to 
human health. Around the roots and stems of plants 
there are hundreds of thousands of bacteria, the 
services of which are essential for the human body, e.g., 
in the production of vitamin K, or in the transportation 
of nutrients in the intestines. By having contact with 
microbes through the environment and healthy food, 
they colonize our skin and intestines. This makes us 
more resilient by developing a stronger immune system. 
Adequate access to a biodiverse environment is seen 
as an important factor in defending ourselves against 
diseases that have been on the rise since World War II.
The City of Breda is working on a programme 
establishing a green biodiverse belt around the city.  
Source: City of Breda
As part of the programme, ecological connection zones 
or nature roads will be linked to the green belt to bring 
biodiversity into the city to improve health outcomes. 
The aim of the programme is to ensure that children 
and citizens can get in contact as much as possible 
with bacterial biodiversity. The monotonous vegetation 
such as lawns, will be replaced by more natural and 
biodiverse urban meadows. The programme promotes 
sowing instead of planting and aims to increase 
exposure to bacteria by making semi-natural green 
areas experienceable, and locating them in upwind 
direction of the houses of residents. Priority areas for the 
greening interventions will be urban areas frequented 
by many people. Residents will also be encouraged 
in the programme to turn their private gardens more 
natural.

In 2019, the yard of Vallipuisto public day care centre 
in Espoo, Finland was renovated based on a research 
intervention by the University of Helsinki. In the project, 
asphalt, gravel, and sand were replaced with natural 
materials rich in microbiota biodiversity, including sod, 
shrubs, meadow grasses, and forest floor patches.  
The staff, children and their parents in the day care 
centre took part in the research projects Towards 
Healthy Adulthood (KOTA) and Autoimmune Defense 
and Living Environment, which studied, how nature-
oriented yard affects children’s microbiota and how 
engaging with the natural environment enhanced the 
children’s well-being in the day care centres.
Two kinds of litter cover were used in Vallipuisto day 
care centre. One was a mixture of pinecones, conifer 
needles and sticks. The other was a mixture of sand 
and mull, and the microbe fauna of the material 
was enriched beforehand. Also, blocks of peat and 
decaying wood were placed in the yard. The new yard 
had a zonal structure, where the immediate vicinity of 
buildings and passageways were left with asphalt and 
other artificial materials. The next zone is a mixture  
Source: City of Espoo
of sticks and soil. The outer zone is covered with forest 
cover and soil, shrubs, trees and undergrowth.
The studies showed that letting urban children play in 
microbiologically diverse dirt and vegetation alters skin 
and gut microbiota. These results indicate that even 
small changes in materials towards a more nature-
based environment have a positive effect on children´s 
health by decreasing the risk of immune-mediated 
diseases in urban societies. The commensal microbiota 
of children in the intervention day care centre became 
similar to that observed in children who visit nearby 
forests on a daily basis. The forest floor mat, sod, peat 
blocks, and planters also offered day care children 
new dynamic and emotional ways of engaging with the 
natural environment, which had positive impacts  
on children’s mood, energy and motivation. The greener 
yards enabled the children to become skilful in using the 
natural environment as a play environment.  
In addition, activities related to caring for vegetation 
and exploring them boost the development of 
environmental relationships.

In the recent decades, significant progress was 
made in Hungary in the treatment and prevention of 
cardiovascular diseases, however, they are still the 
leading cause of deaths in the country, more than 
half of the population dying from them. Therefore, 
rehabilitation and preventive measures and innovative 
solutions should be top priority in the health-care 
system. Budapest Szent Ferenc Hospital, a pioneer 
in cardiac rehabilitation innovation, in partnership 
with Normafa Park, the green space management 
organization of one of the most popular green areas 
of Budapest, designed a Cardio Trail in Budapest 12th 
District with the aim to enable rehabilitation walks 
and outdoor cardio check-up in an urban forest that 
is easily accessible for all interested patients. The trail 
consists of several check-up points where, following the 
Source: Budapest 12th District
instructions, patients can measure their heart rate and 
fill out the check-up forms provided at the start of the 
trail. At the end of the trail, the forms are collected in  
a box that is emptied at regular intervals, and delivered 
to the hospital where doctors examine the results.  
If they see something irregular, they get in touch with 
the patient suggesting another check-up in the hospital, 
this time, conducted by the medical staff. There are 
also regular guided rehabilitation walks on the Cardio 
Trail organized by Szent Ferenc Hospital, during which 
a physiotherapist helps patients master the use of 
Nordic-walking sticks. The cardio trail does not only 
support cardiac rehabilitation and the prevention of 
cardiovascular diseases but can also save lives: several 
times patients were referred to heart surgery based on 
their trail check-up forms.

According to the statistics of a Budapest clinic 
specialized on cardiovascular diseases, one third  
of heart surgery patients die within three years after 
their treatment. The reason for these tragic statistics 
lies in the fact that these patients are unable to change 
their lifestyles, lose weight and exercise more, which 
would be essential for them to keep healthy. Therefore, 
more emphasis needs to be put on supporting healthy 
life choices by doctors. So far, outdoor physical activity 
and the health services were not connected, but now, 
thanks to the green prescription concept originating 
from New-Zealand more than 30 years ago, Budapest 
12th District (Hegyvidék) linked them together, 
approaching prevention and health promotion in an 
interdisciplinary manner. Just like a regular prescription, 
the green prescription is provided as a written advice 
by the general practitioner to the patients during a visit. 
However, green prescription, instead of medication, 
offers free outdoor exercising opportunities in the 
district, motivating patients to be physically active in 
urban green spaces. The green prescription scheme 
was directly linked to the Active Hegyvidék Programme 
that offers a number of free physical activity sessions, 
such as running and hiking, to local residents in larger 
parks of the district. The health care professional can 
tick several categories on the green prescription sheet, 
which include prevention, aerobic or cardio-type 
energization, mental development, stress reduction, 
mood improvement, or stretching. Patients are urged 
to contact the call centre of the Active Hegyvidék 
Programme, where based on the selected categories on 
the green prescription sheets various types of outdoor 
physical activity sessions are offered to them. The 
scheme is also linked to the Alzheimer Café initiative 
of the district, to the guided rehabilitation walks on a 
cardio trail, or to the activities of a local pétanque club 
or a picnic for the elderly. In the near future, Budapest 
12th District plans to support additional activities, such 
as local heritage walks or bird-watching walks. The 
municipality hopes that building on the authority of the 
doctors already existing free outdoor exercising options 
will become more popular.

In the Olari district of the city of Espoo, a new health 
nature trail was opened in 2019, where visitors can 
experience the health benefits of nature and take  
a break from everyday life. The trail is located in Espoo 
Central Park and enters various landscapes in the 
Kokinmetsä forest. The path with an approximately  
2.4 km length has eight checkpoints with three separate 
exercises each. The various exercises guide the hikers 
to observe, learn and experience the multiple health 
effects of nature. These exercises have been designed 
with a view to target the three main target groups 
of the trail, children, visitors unfamiliar with the 
forest, and those who are seeking the health benefits 
provided by nature. The trail is marked with easily 
distinguishable blue hearts. The development of the 
trail was initiated by a local association, Olari-seura. 
Several organisations, including scout troops, day care 
centres, schools, a mental health association, residents’ 
associations worked together in the planning and 
creation of the trail. A wide range of local stakeholders 
co-designed the trail and the exercises. The construction 
of the path was primarily undertaken by volunteers.

In 2017 a Mental Health Day Care centre was opened 
in Szent János Hospital that aimed at the psychosocial 
reintegration and rehabilitation of chronic psychotic 
patients. A couple of months later, in early 2018,  
as a result of a joint initiative of the patients and the 
therapeutic group, a small strip of soil was planted with 
vegetables next to the building of the day care centre. 
Patients and the medical team started gardening 
together, initially during the breaks and later already  
as part of the therapies. The aim was to establish  
a recovery-oriented psychosocial reintegration  
and rehabilitation practice by actively involving  
patents in gardening.
Building on the initial positive experiences, a year later 
in Spring 2019 a therapeutic biogarden was established 
with the involvement a bio-gardener, a human-ecologist 
and a sociologist. Raised garden beds were used with 
differing heights to allow also older patients’ activities 
and to enable deconstruction in case of a potential 
relocation. The patients were actively involved in the 
planning of the garden, the assembly of frames of the 
garden beds, and planting. In the biogarden various 
vegetables and herbs are cultivated.
During the breaks in between therapeutic occupation 
the patients together with the therapeutic team 
undertake smaller tasks, such as watering or weeding. 
During the socio-therapeutic and skill-developing 
teamwork the patients are engaged in harvesting, 
cooking, eating together with the medical team.
As a result of the initiative patients have left the closed 
therapeutic space and this in itself is a therapeutic 
factor supporting the improvement of their mental 
and social health. The shared gardening helps them 
reintegrate into society. With time, it became common 
that during breaks patients went out into the garden 
to socialize while they were routinely weeding the 
vegetables. The therapeutic garden can also effectively 
help the medical team in burnout syndrome prevention.
This easily adaptable ‘green care’ initiative served as  
a proof of concept study that can provide inspiration for 
other urban institutes providing health and social care 
services for psychiatric patients and people living with 
psychosocial disabilities.

In Poznan, Poland an ‘Open Gardens’ programme 
was initiated in 2017 for unlocking green spaces of 
public institutions for local communities. Under the 
programme part of the yards of kindergartens are 
made accessible for residents.
The idea for Open Gardens came about as a response 
to the fact that central districts of Poznan lack easily 
accessible green space and suffer from their uneven 
distribution. Principally in old, historical neighbourhoods 
the urban fabric is so dense that there is physically  
no space to create new green areas. Therefore, the aim 
of the program is to make better use of existing green 
spaces in these districts, making them available for as 
many users as possible. According to the concept a part 
of the kindergarten yard is made accessible for the local 
community in a controlled manner.
A pilot project of the program was implemented  
in a kindergarten in Wilda district of Poznan from March 
2017 till June 2018 based on a participative approach. 
The entire kindergarten community with the children,  
the preschool teachers, and the parents were engaged 
in the planning process together with the local community 
and the district council under the supervision of  
a landscape architect. A series of three workshops were 
Source: City of Poznan
organized to discuss the needs and concerns  
of potential users.
As a result of the planning process a place was 
developed where children can learn about nature, adults 
can relax, and local residents can grow plants. The local 
community is allowed to use a designated part of the 
yard that is separated by a low fence from the rest of the 
area. The larger preschool part of the yard, accessible 
only for children, was revitalized through greening and 
the provision of play facilities. In the ‘open garden zone’ 
raised beds, hammocks, a gazebo, seats, an insect hotel, 
and a composter were installed. All these features aim  
at fostering social interactions.
In the summer season the garden is open from Monday 
to Friday from 1 PM to 8 PM, and in winter from 1 PM to 
5 PM. Until 1 PM the entire yard is used by pre-schoolers. 
On weekends the garden is opened on individual 
requests to host get-togethers or workshops.
Following the pandemic additional kindergartens are 
planned to be opened in Poznan for local communities 
under the programme. The scope of the scheme will also 
be broadened to include also allotment gardens, where 
common spaces are foreseen to be opened to host 
various community events.

Frizon (Free zone) was designed together with young 
girls in Umeå, Sweden to cater for young girls’ needs in 
public areas. During spring and autumn of 2015,  
a total of 30 girls between the ages of 15 to 18, have 
worked together with the municipality to design the 
Frizon meeting place. One group also participated  
in the implementation phase of the project, they were 
present at a press conference about the project and in 
the opening of an exhibition about Frizon in the Museum 
of Västerbottens. The exhibition showed a film, along 
with some postcards, signs and photographs about the 
planning process.
Based on the dialogues with the girls, the basic 
requirements for the design of the new meeting place 
were collected for the designer. Finally, the project has 
been realized in a central park in Umeå, in line with the 
control’s group vision. Following the girls’ feedback, 
Frizon was designed around an existing tree. It is open 
all seasons, it has sitting and hanging surfaces for 
socializing, WiFi connection and the possibility to listen 
to music together. An important feature for ensuring 
a sense of safety, is that Frizon is close to other social 
places and has lightning in the evenings.

Arts organizations usually struggle with finding space  
in cities for rehearsal and performance. In Los Angeles 
and Chicago specific initiatives were developed to 
promote cultural activities in public areas through 
creative placemaking.
In Los Angeles a community-based programme was 
launched in 1992 to promote innovative uses of land and 
foster creativity and community involvement. The goal 
of programme, managed by ARTScorpsLA, a non-profit 
organization in association with the University of Southern 
California, was to turn abandoned lots into art parks that 
function also as gathering places. The new community art 
parks were open to all, even to gang members.  
The artistic and landscape projects of ARTScorpsLA 
actively engaged young adults. Workshop spaces were 
created and educational programs were offered for 
local youth. Under the programme with the help  
of a city-wide anti-graffiti initiative 28 murals were 
created across the neighbourhoods of Los Angeles.
The Arts Partners in Residence, a similar programme  
in Chicago identified underused parks or parks spaces 
to turn them into cultural spaces. Under the scheme 
arts organizations looking for venues were contracted 
to provide performances or educational services in 
exchange for free space. As a result, the neglected 
public spaces became animated with the help of art 
activity, local communities had been strengthened, 
and at the same time arts organizations were provided 
with precious space.

In order to reduce the risk of COVID contagion,  
the classes of the Felix Rodrigez de la Fuente primary 
school were moved to the beach for a day alongside 
the Mar Menor coastal salt water lagoon in Los Nietos, 
Spain. The special day was implemented in the frame  
of the “Aire Limpio” (Clean Air) program which aims  
to improve children’s knowledge and understanding  
of the natural environment in which they live.
Morning classroom areas were drawn into the sand, 
while one zone was reserved for physical education.  
On top of learning and in the breaks also playing  
in a Covid-safe environment, teachers reported also 
other benefits of the outdoor class: instead of being 
over-excited pupils behaved in a responsible way 
and rose to the challenge. Students were reported to 
be more attentive than in conventional classes held 
indoors. The mild climate of Spain provides execptional 
opportunities for outdoor teaching.
Based on the success of the scheme, the exercise  
is planned to be incorporated into the educational 
planning documents so that these outings can be 
repeated at the beach.

Baggot Estate is a public park west of Limerick city, 
Ireland. Once a week from September to December 
2020 a local primary school for children with a hearing 
impairment delivered a Forest School in Baggot Estate. 
Each session lasted three hours with children from 2nd

used the outdoor space to engage students in their 
learning but also helping to maintain social distancing 
as per government guidance for teaching and learning 
due to COVID-19.
Before each session the teacher and two students 
prepared an area in the estate for the Forest School. 
This included establishing boundaries which were

In Sicily the City of Messina organized during Spring 
of 2021 a birdwatching activity for schoolchildren. 
The aim was to deepen the knowledge of citizens and 
schoolchildren of the natural context that surrounds the 
urban territory in Messina.
Messina has always been historically a seaside city and its 
economy has always been closely linked to the sea. The 
city has about 70 km of coastline and many citizens have 
the opportunity to reach the beach on foot. The citizens of 
Messina love the sea which is much easier to reach.
On the other hand, the Peloritani mountains that are 
bordering the city from the west tend to be neglected 
by urban residents.
Sources: City of Messina
The City of Messina aims to promote the natural context 
of the Peloritani mountains, an ecosystem rich in native 
botanical and fauna species, and to bring citizens closer 
to the mountains. Birdwatching is an important tool for 
reaching this goal.
The activity took part in the mountains at a height 
of 1200 meters. The children, apart from watching 
birds, participated in various environmental 
education activities led by the ornithologists of MAN 
(Mediterranean Association Nature). Building on the 
popularity of the initiative, later similar activities were 
organized for adult residents of Messina.

The Multifunctional Centre of Camaro is a natural area 
managed by the regional forestry agency and  
is located on the Peloritani mountains at about  
a thousand meters high not far from the city centre of 
Messina. The initiative conceived by a large stakeholder 
group led by Messina, was born from the need to make 
the citizens of Messina more familiar with the Peloritani 
Mountains. The paradox of the Camaro Multifunctional 
Centre is that it is unknown to the majority of the 
inhabitants of Messina. The Centre has a considerable 
variety of native botanical species and a reproduction

of the lithographic map of the province of Messina, 
as well as of all the rock types present in the province. 
With the help of the University Orthobotanical Institute 
of Messina, a detailed census was made of all the 
botanical species present in the Centre. Subsequently, 
a special website was created where all the recorded 
data were uploaded. After, wooden panels were 
created positioned in various points of the centre 
containing a QR code through which visitors can easily 
connect to the site and obtain all the information.

For the last few years Poznań has been promoting the 
idea of a “natural playground” in public kindergartens. 
Each year, the city hall is providing the kindergartens 
support. The play spaces were designed by a landscape 
architect. Workshops were organized for teachers on 
how to use such space with children. Kindergartens were 
equipped with ‘ecological demonstrators’ and provided 
by lesson plans for eco-education.
Natural playground is more like a ‘garden to play’ 
than a typical playground. Among traditional playing 
facilities like a swing or a slide, playing facilities are 
introduced made of living plants (like willow tipi or a 
maze made of tall grass), of earth (hills, natural paths) 
or from natural materials (wood, stone). Artificial 
safety surface is replaced by natural, water absorbing 
surfaces (sand or gravel). Vegetation is introduced 
to provide a pleasant microclimate, shade or natural 
isolation from the traffic noise and pollution.  
Sources: City of Poznan
Children can observe how the plants grow and 
sometimes can even consume the fruits. The natural 
playgrounds support recreation, as well as creative 
play with natural substances. A mud kitchen 
encourages play with sand and water, a wooden stage 
around the tree or tree trunks forming a ring support 
group play. There are also places designated for eco-
education, such as ‘wild biodiversity zones’, meadows 
with houses for insects, flower beds, or raised planters 
with fruit and vegetables.
The advantage of a natural playground in comparison 
to a traditional one is double, for both the city 
environment and the children themselves. A natural 
playground is more ecological, creates a green zone in 
the city, helps with increasing biodiversity and natural 
water retention. On the other hand, it provides for 
children direct contact with nature, improves their 
creativity and makes them happier.

Tartu City Government in cooperation with The University 
of Tartu Research Group of Physical Activity for Health 
has successfully promoted the Active School Yards 
project. The project redesigns both the programmes 
and physical spaces inside and outside schools to 
encourage students to be more active.
The programme resulted in robust outcomes. Three 
schoolyards have been promoted by the local 
community and they have been the winners of the 
participatory budget campaign of the City of Tartu and

llustration: a redesigned school yard at Reiniku school. The project was one of the winning entries of Tartu 2019 Participatory Budget programme
thus rebuilt to follow the Active School Yards brand.  
The redesigns consider a daily safe and healthy 
commute, present simple universal equipment that 
inspire play and movement rather than suggest certain 
use, add seating and greenery to promote time spent 
outdoors. The main aim is not so much to provide 
places for sports but allow for a variety of outdoor 
spaces for all types and ages of students, including 
quiet places for observing and contemplating.  
The goal is to get students outdoors.

The Birmingham Active Parks scheme offers free physical 
activity sessions at various parks across the city with the 
aim to encourage people to enjoy being active,  
to improve their health and wellbeing, and to 
strengthen local communities. The sessions run 
throughout the year and include a wide range of 
activities, such as led walks, running, cycling, frisbee,  
Tai Chi, Zumba, boules, skipping, rowing, tennis, 
gardening, orienteering, or nature play.
Active Parks was meant to animate previously 
underused parks, and aimed to tackle social 
inequalities. The programme first started as a pilot 
project in 2013 in six parks, and then over the years 
it was gradually rolled out to over 80 parks and 
green spaces across Birmingham. The activities were 
specifically designed to engage those who would not

normally use traditional sports facilities.
The scheme has successfully engaged groups of society 
that are typically underrepresented in sport activity, 
such as women and ethnic minorities. In many activities 
children are involved helping mothers who have 
difficulties with child care. In 2016 over 80%  
of participants came from the most deprived areas 
of the city. The activities successfully engaged young 
children and the elderly. In case equipment is needed 
for the sessions a van is used by the Active Parks team  
to transfer them around various sites.
The evaluation of the scheme shows its effectiveness, 
particularly among inactive people, as 74% of the users 
were previously not a member of a sport facility, and 
20% of the users were previously totally inactive.

In the City of Espoo (Finland), the Sports and Exercise 
and Elderly Services Units uphold together a network 
of volunteers, who have committed themselves to help 
senior citizens to spend time outdoors. As part of  
a scheme coordinated by the national Age Institute, 
the outdoor friends help the aged citizens to go out for 
fresh air or to run an errand safely. Some volunteers 
also help at joint excursions with multiple participants  
or in outdoor events. In Espoo, most of the volunteers 
help senior citizens living at sheltered homes.
Many of the aged, also those still living at home, do not 
dare to go out alone. A trusted company encourages 
upholding one´s physical activity, which enhances 
muscular strength, balance, and vitality. The ‘Outdoor 
friends to elderly’ scheme have also been experienced 
to have a significant effect on the mental wellbeing 
of the elderly, as well as on their independence, 
participation, and social interaction among different 
age groups. The volunteers, on the other hand, have 
found to enjoy the company of the aged and get fresh 
air also themselves. In sheltered homes, volunteers are 
considered as a valuable resource for the wellbeing  
of the senior residents.
Source: City of Espoo
The scheme is based on a written agreement. The aged 
and the volunteer agree together on the frequency  
of the visits and the length and route of the walks. 
Many of the volunteers in Espoo have found the scheme 
through public sports groups, by advertisements  
in local newspapers or in Espoo liikkuu newspaper, 
which is published by the Sports and Exercise Unit.  
Each new volunteer goes through a training for acting  
as a voluntary outdoor friend. Senior citizens in need  
of outdoor friends are charted ahead of time,  
so the volunteer and the aged are able to get a good 
start for the walks already during the training.
In Espoo, the scheme was developed as the result  
of a collaboration among the public sector,  
non-governmental organizations, and active volunteers. 
One of the crucial success factors of the activity was  
the creation of clear procedures and making the 
volunteers feel welcome in the sheltered homes and 
by the aged. The scheme is planned to be further 
developed, the number of outdoor friends  
is to be increased, and further training and support  
is to be given to the volunteers.

The Green Gym is a program put in practice in Sonning 
Common, Oxfordshire, UK since 1997 on the principle 
of creating a healthy natural environment and improve 
people’s wellbeing and health. The program is now 
spread around UK with thousands of volunteers involved. 
Different work sessions take place in diverse sites in 
urban spaces (including parks and allotments) or in the 
countryside. Tasks vary by location so that people with 
different abilities or difficulties can find the right place.
Each session lasts about 3 hours and is led by two 
team leaders who are responsible for the smooth 
running of the session. All the sessions follow roughly 
the following format:
•  ‘Tool Talk’: the safe handling and correct use of tools 
are discussed as well as the aim of the day.
•  ‘Warm up’: exercises to prepare muscles for activity 
and reduce the risk of injury.
•  ‘Work session’: always includes light and heavy tasks, 
there is something for everybody. Most of the activities 
are made by hand to burn the calories and to get the 
blood flowing.

•  ‘Refreshment’: time to share food and cakes but also 
for chatting.
•  ‘Work session’
•  ‘Gather up tools’: tools are collected and checked if 
something is missing.
•  ‘Cool down’: exercises to prevent stiffness.
In addition to improving fitness, the participants valued 
the scheme as a means of enhancing mental wellbeing, 
being stimulated by nature and enjoying social contact, 
and as a flexible way in which to attain a valued 
productive role. Even if the program has adults as main 
target, children are also welcome. They have to be 
accompanied by an adult, and children’s tools are also 
provided.
The flexibility and diversity of tasks at the Green 
Gym suggest that it has the potential to enable 
occupationally deprived individuals, including those 
who have experienced social exclusion through mental 
ill-health, to access a productive occupation in the 
community283,284.

Orienteering is a competitive sport that combines racing 
with navigation, using the geographical skills of map 
reading and the physical activity of running or walking.
Limerick City and County Council (LCCC) has several 
large seminatural green spaces which offer the 
potential for outdoor recreation but which are currently. 
The greater use of some of these spaces can be 
encouraged by introducing new organised activities 
such as orienteering to the areas.
LCCC developed an orienteering map and orienteering 
course in a semi-natural woodland called Baggot Estate 
(13ha), located approx. 1.5 miles outside of Limerick 
City centre. The orienteering courses provided the 
opportunity to increase the number of local residents, 
school and community groups, and visitors walking 
and socialising in Baggot Estate. A variety of courses 
were created, of varied technical difficulty, and 
distance. The primary route is in Baggot Estate and 
for the longer, more technical courses the surrounding 
urban streets are included. All orienteering courses 
and maps are available in both hard copy and 
through the Maprun6 app.
Orienteering leader training delivered by Irish 
Orienteering Association was subsequently organised  
to promote these newly created courses. Teachers, local 
youth group leaders and residents association members 
took part in the workshop. Each participant received 
Source: Limerick City and County Council
four hours of training and a resource folder of games 
cards/equipment to run their own orienteering events.
Feedback from the event included requests to 
organise larger orienteering events in Baggot 
Estate in the future. Future events will demonstrate 
how best to use the MapRun6 courses for different 
levels of orienteering, illustrate the different type of 
orienteering that can be used, including score and 
star relay. Introducing participants to the key skills of 
orienteering in a fun and exciting way.
On the success of this course LCCC will develop similar 
maps for other areas of the city.

“Let´s do the Mile” or "Anem a fer La Milla” are 
expressions that are common knowledge among Santa 
Pola citizens. This Spanish term coming from the past is 
related to the marine Mile, when most of the men from 
the town who worked as fishermen came back home 
every now and then and had to do exercise  
to be healthy until it was time to leave again over the 
seas for months. They used to walk from the city centre 
until the end of the east urban beaches in Varadero,  
or even beyond them until the protected coastline.
Building on this tradition Dr Maria Jose Cencerrado,  
a municipal doctor incorporated it into the routines of 
the Maintenance Gymnastics Groups for the Elderly

in 1998. At first, the walk started from the Civic Centre 
door following the gym sessions, but in the 2020, 
because of the Covid-19 pandemic, as the gymnastics 
sessions were moved to the beach instead, it sets off 
from the door of the town hall every Wednesday, where 
people can join freely an open and dynamic group.
The Municipality of Santa Pola, building on its 
participation in the Health&Greenspace Network 
created a new brand to encourage people to do 
physical activity in a healthy and attractive natural 
environment. The same brand will also promote  
a network of safe paths and bike lanes in Santa Pola  
to stimulate healthy lifestyles.

In 2004 in Santa Pola, Spain Dr Maria Jose Cencerrado, 
a municipal doctor has launched indoor gym sessions 
for fibromyalgia groups. During the Covid-19 pandemic, 
starting from June 2020, these groups started  
to do activities on the beach. It became a free activity 
for elderly people from Monday to Friday, from 9:30 
to 10:30. The initiative that only costs 11,240 euros per 
year to the council and is free for everybody. Up to 80% 
of the participants are not local residents. The initiative 
is expanding to other target groups and also to other 
neighbouring municipalities.
A survey was undertaken on the initiative to learn

details about the user profiles to be able to improve 
the services. According to the results most of the 
participants were women, aged between 60-80,  
and the vast majority of them were neither social 
services users nor under medical prescription. 
Participants highlighted that after taking part in the 
program their self-appraisal and physical well-being 
improved, and that they became more willing to leave 
their homes and relate to others. Participants also 
reported to have more stamina. Almost none of them 
would be happy to go back to do indoor exercising.

Under a Swedish governmental project, called Street 
Moves, pop-up parklets started to appear in Stockholm 
and Gothenburg. Street Moves aims to study how 
parking spaces can be taken away in the city, and 
how street can be turned into vibrant, healthy and 
sustainable places in Sweden. Street Moves builds  
on tactical urbanism but applies a strategic approach 
with an overall aim to create streets of the future.
The system Wooden strips with a width of 9 cm provide 
the basis for the parklets, which can be laid down 
rapidly. Through a participatory co-development 
process, the parklets are customized to the specific 
need of the site. The wooden strips can cover one, two 
or more parking, and can feature different amenities 
or attractions suiting the site. These light structures, 
working like a Lego system, can change the streetscape 
immediately. One unit can be installed in five hours.
The parklet in Gothenburg installed next to a gourmet 
shop, having a bench, a picnic table and a bicycle 
rack became a popular micro space for hanging 
out. Another parklet in Helsingborg features seating, 
planters and integrated LED lighting.

The blueprint for the global parklet movement was 
first developed as temporary interventions  
in San Francisco in 2005 by the designers of Rebar. 
In 2009 the San Francisco Planning Department 
stepped in adopting policies to support the local 
parklet movement to move away from tactical 
urbanism. By March 2015, more than 60 parklets 
have been installed in San Francisco by merchants, 
neighbourhood groups, and civil society organizations.
San Francisco Planning Department recognizing 
the added value of the small scale temporary 
interventions, developed targeted policies to support 
the scheme. First ‘Pavements to Parks’, an experimental 
city programme was created to repurpose in a quick 
and inexpensive way a significant portion of public 
spaces in San Francisco dedicated to parking. Under 
the programme Rebar was hired by the city to design

a flexible Parklet prototype with its elements, such as 
seating, tables, bike racks and landscaping. Parklets 
developed under the programme are removable and 
do not impede curb side drainage. They are open 
to the public and cannot be used for commercial 
purposes. They are raised to curb height so that they 
can be accessed by wheelchairs. Parklets can contribute 
to the green infrastructure of the city when they are 
created with greenery.
A Parklet permit programme was also developed by  
the City of San Francisco. The programme enables  
a simplified permit process for businesses or residents 
who want to convert parking spaces into parklets. 
By obtaining a parklet permit, one is responsible for 
maintenance of the parklet.
In September 2021, the Parklet Program was 
transitioned into San Francisco Shared Spaces Program.

Bryant Park in New York City, which once was a place 
for criminal activity, was transformed as a result  
of an extensive renovation lasting four years into  
one of the most welcoming and influential public 
spaces in the world.
After decades of deterioration from the 1960s, by the 
early 1980s the park became an intimidating area 
that was taken over by drug dealers, prostitutes and 
homeless people widely avoided by New Yorkers.
Poor design was the reason for the bad conditions. 
The park itself was elevated from the street, 
surrounded by high walls and covered from view  
by tall hedges. Sideways were connected to the park 
by steps at narrow entrances. The site lacked  
activities and amenities.
As part of the renovation starting in 1988, the park 
was cleaned up, graffiti were removed, damaged 
architectural elements were repaired. The park was 
lowered nearly to street level, entrances were opened 
up, and iron fences and shrubs were removed to 
improve visibility. To improve accessibility of the site, 
new entrances, stairs, ramps and pavements were 
added. New lighting was installed in the park

and also on a nearby rooftop to improve the perception 
of safety at night.
Furthermore, a number of actions were taken  
to attract people into the park. More than 2000 
moveable folding chair were scattered around 
allowing visitors to sit wherever they wanted. Two food 
kiosks were installed and a restaurant and outdoor 
cafe were built. These services operated by private 
companies apart from attracting visitors also provide 
income for the park’s maintenance.
The organization of various events, activities and games, 
such as chess and pétanque in the newly refurbished 
park also proved to be a magnet for users. An outdoor 
movie series held at night became particularly popular 
among visitors. Providing access  
to outside programmers generates additional income 
for the park’s operation and maintenance.
As a result of increased access and visibility, improved 
lighting and a range of services, events and activities 
provided, in seven years following the reopening  
of Bryant Park, crime had been reported to be  
reduced by 92 percent.

As Stuttgart is located in a valley basin with low wind 
speeds, heat is easily trapped in the city. Over time, 
development on the valley slopes has prevented cooling 
airflows from moving through the city. As a response, 
early on, since the 1970s the German city has embarked 
on a long-term and complex climate planning strategy 
to become a cool city.
Stuttgart has adopted a wide range of interventions 
to apply the cool city concept, exploiting natural wind 
patterns and the positive effects of dense vegetation.  
To hinder overheating through the preservation  
of cool air flows in the city, at strategic places, such  
as valleys and hillsides, construction bans have been 
used, and green ventilation corridors have been 
developed and kept wide. In densely built areas and 
around new developments increased vegetation has 
been recommended. The prevention of construction 
projects enhanced the ventilation effect of cold-air flows 
at night rushing down from the hills surrounding the city.
An environmental office with the task to evaluate the 
effect of planned buildings on the microclimate and  
Sources: Rehan, 2016285, Climate ADAPT286
to protect key areas was established in the city. In 2008 
a Climate Atlas was developed for the Stuttgart region, 
indicating the distribution of temperature and cold air 
flows. With the help of these detailed climate plans the 
city has stopped planned construction over 60 hectares.
More than 60% of the city is covered by green area. 
Starting from the 70s, Stuttgart has integrated green 
areas into a massive U-shaped public park that has 
a substantial cooling effect on the city, and besides 
that the city boasts lots of other parks. Furthermore, 
Stuttgart is a global frontrunner in green roof 
infrastructure development. As a result of a combination 
of economic incentives and regulatory instruments 
introduced from the mid-‘80s, over 300,000 m2  
of rooftops have been greened by 2019.
Other adaptation measures implemented include the 
greening of 63 kilometres of tram tracks, using street 
trees for shading building facades, developing smaller 
public spaces into ‘cool spots’, and installation of water 
fountains, since dispersed water has a significant 
cooling effect.

Medellín, the second largest city of Colombia, has 
created an interconnected 20-km network of greenery 
that includes 30 Green Corridors (‘Corredores 
Verdes’). This large-scale green infrastructure system 
connects existing green spaces, reduces the urban 
heat island effect in  
the city, improves biodiversity and urban air quality.
In recent decades Medellin was struggling with rising 
temperatures as the urban heat island effect has 
increased dramatically in line with the rapid urban 
development and population growth. To mitigate heat 
stress in urban areas, the city implemented a three-year 
programme called ‘greener Medellín for you’. Native 
trees, tropical plants, and palms were planted in big 
numbers along sidewalks, busy roads, and riverbanks 
and in squares and parks. Under the programme about 
8,800 trees and 90,000 smaller plants were planted 
along 36 green corridors on 65 hectares. The more than 
$ 16 million initiative gave 75 disadvantaged residents 
the opportunity to become gardeners after training  
in the city’s botanical garden.
New green spaces were created functioning as cooling 
islands along busy roads, new parks were opened, new 
public spaces were designed with less concrete and 
more greenery, pillars, bridges and metro stations were 
turned green, and green roofs and vertical gardens 
were installed on government buildings to reduce 
temperatures.
This massive tree planting initiative had an extensive 
impact on the local environment. The project has 
managed to reduce average city temperatures  
by 2 degrees Celsius since 2018.

By September 2019, nine new schoolyards were 
transformed in Paris into ‘cool islands’, by integrating 
nature-based solutions for shading and for storm-
water management.
Over the last decades the frequency of heatwaves has 
increased in Paris. During a heatwave in June 2017,  
due to record-high temperatures the schools had  
to be closed down for 3 days. This event triggered the 
idea of converting the predominantly asphalt covered 
schoolyards into shared green spaces.
Under the UIA OASIS project, the city has selected  
10 schoolyards out of which nine was converted into 
‘cool islands’. These revitalized spaces will also be open 
on a regular basis to the local neighbourhood after 
school hours and weekends, providing a recreation 
area to the broader local community. During heatwaves 
the schoolyards offer a cool and shaded refuge for 
locals. The OASIS project is implemented under the 
broader frameworks of the Climate Adaptation Strategy 
and the Resilient Strategy of the City of Paris.
During the planning stage, the aim was to focus the 
renovation of schoolyards on the well-being of children, 
especially through nature, to design more natural

spaces at low costs, and to strengthen the social bonds 
within neighbourhoods.
The new schoolyards offer increased vegetation, 
permeable grounds, inventive play areas, natural and 
artificial shaded areas, water points, quiet corners and 
an inclusive use of space. At least 20-30% of the total 
area of the schoolyards are dedicated to green spaces. 
These new shared spaces provide an opportunity for 
residents to come together and interact. The newly 
transformed schoolyards are places for physical activity 
and contact with nature, which offer comfortable 
microclimates. They support psychomotor learning, 
sensory learning and the development of imagination. 
Building on the experience of the pilot projects, OASIS 
has produced a set of recommendations and plans 
for other schoolyards. So far, another 35 schoolyards 
have been transformed in Paris and the city is planning 
to have all 760 public schoolyards transformed into 
neighbourhood oases by 2050. As every Parisian resides 
within a radius of 250m from a public school, according 
to the plans eventually each neighbourhood in the city 
would acquire a cool and shaded green refuge for days 
of extreme heat.

testing indicated the presence of sooty particles in the 
children's lungs. After the installation of the new greenery, 
pollution levels were reduced by 53% in the playground, while 
the concentration of pollutants still remained high around the 
school. In addition, laboratory tests showed that pupils had 
benefitted from reduced exposure from pollutants.
Under a targeted program, 29 schools are supported 
across London to install barriers made of plants and 
hedges around primary school playgrounds to combat 
air pollution.

The City of Stuttgart has been experimenting with 
innovative solutions since 2017 to combat serious  
air pollution. One of them, is the installation of a moss 
wall which is over 100 meters long and three meters 
high. Moss that usually grows in damp places, such  
as forest floors, tree trunks, moors, cliffs, and artificial 
surfaces, can store water and nutrients. It also has 
a capacity to filter air pollutants clinging to its sticky 
surfaces. The filtered pollutants with the help of  
a bacteria are converted into the biomass of the plant.
Two moss species were used in Stuttgart (Ceratodon 
purpureus and Racomitrium canescens), which 
were specifically bred to capture and degrade fine 
particulate matter. Moss walls were found to be more 
effective in reducing particulate matter and  
NOx concentrations than other plants due to  
a number of reasons. Mosses have a 30 times larger 
surface area than other plants, that significantly 
increase the filtration efficiency. As the surfaces of 
mosses are negatively charged, airborne particles 
adhere through electrostatic attraction to them. This 
process is particularly effective for the filtration of fine 
particulates. The evergreen mosses filter pollutants all 
year round and in addition they are more active  
in winter, when the concentrations of air pollutants are 
typically higher. The organic components of pollutants 
are biodegraded or transformed into less toxic 
molecules by bacteria living on the surface of mosses.

The CLAIRO project under the Urban Innovative Actions 
initiative of the European Union aims at the systematic 
reduction of air pollution through comprehensive 
planning and planting of greenery with a positive 
impact on air quality. Under the project new greenery 
was planted in Ostrava, Czech Republic in 2021 that is 
aimed to function as a living lab for cities in the Upper 
Silesian metropolitan area and beyond, providing long-
term information on air quality improvement.  
The vegetation was installed in two plots located in the 
most polluted neighbourhoods of Ostrava, close  
to a metallurgical plant. The design of the composition 
and structure of the greenery was supported by 
measurements of air pollutants and climatic conditions. 
The long-term goal is to share with other districts 
and cities the novel experience gained at the urban 
greenery living lab, and to inspire them with innovative 
green solutions.
The detailed design of the greenery structure and 
composition was finalized in summer 2020.  
The objective was to establish communities of trees and 
shrubs that form continuous and dense canopies  
to allow effective filtration of the air.
Communities of multiple plant species with similar 
ecological needs were specified that correspond to 
the habitat conditions of the target sites. Maximizing 
leaf surface that allows increased pollution deposition 
was an important consideration in the selection of the 
species. Preference was given to species with a densely 
branched crown and a large volume of green matter, 
as well as to evergreen tree species that can catch 
pollution all year round. The new vegetation has two 
tree layers and a shrub layer in order to maximize the 
canopy density and through this filtration efficiency. 
In addition, species with increased resistance to air 
pollution were preferred.
At the two target sites, which are located next to an 
industrial area, the newly planted trees are exposed  
to air pollution and other abiotic stressors. To increase 
their tolerance to air pollutants and contamination, as 
part of an experiment, the soil and the plants are treated 
with specific preparations that contain plant hormones.
Modelling results indicate that with the designed 
vegetation the capture of particulates at one of the 
target sites is expected to almost triple as compared  
to the initial state.

In Copenhagen as part of a unique initiative Google’s 
Air View data was combined with Gehl Architects’ data 
on the everyday movement of children and day care 
workers, and based on this urban design solutions were 
suggested to reduce exposure to air pollution and  
to increase access to better air quality.
In 2013 Google started to develop the Air View Project 
in order to measure street-by-street air quality in cities. 
For measurements Google Street View Cars were used 
that were equipped with air quality sensors. Such 
detailed measurements have shown that air pollution 
differs street by street sometimes up to 5-8 times within 
a city block. Under a related research heart diseases 
were found to be related to street-level variation of air 
quality. The results have indicated that hyper-local maps 
of air pollution can be useful for supporting policies  
to reduce air pollution.
In 2018 in a collaboration with Gehl Architects, Google 
started measuring air quality in Copenhagen to build  
an annual average street by street map. Gehl was

tasked in the project to operationalize the air quality 
data by assessing the everyday movement of children 
and day-care workers. Gehl mapped childcare 
institutions and playgrounds in the Vesterbro 
neighbourhood and studied where small children 
move through the city. The mapping has shown that  
a lot of children move through streets with really  
poor air quality.
Under the project, busy areas with poor air quality 
were identified in Vesterbro, where the aim was to 
reduce exposure to air pollutants. For such areas 
Gehl proposed traffic calming measures, the removal 
of parking, and the installation of green buffers as 
pollution barriers.
At the same time areas with better air quality were 
also identified, where small children could be invited 
to spend more time. A concept was developed for such 
areas, featuring wider sidewalks and new greenery 
to make the place more welcoming, as well as narrow 
roads to lower car speeds.

Under the HOPE UIA project, the Digital Geography 
Lab of the University of Helsinki has developed a new 
Green Paths routing tool for the Helsinki Metropolitan 
Area building on real-time air quality data collected 
by the air quality monitoring network in Helsinki. 
With the help of the app users can find quick 
routes while avoiding busier and noisy streets with 
poor air quality. The app currently covers the four 
municipalities of the Helsinki Metropolitan area: 
Helsinki, Vantaa, Espoo, and Kauniainen.
Most route planners offer the fastest or most direct 
routes, but do not consider pleasantness or health

and wellbeing. However, positive experiences during 
cycling and walking can urge people to opt for active 
mobility, as opposed to slightly faster motorized options.
The Green Paths route planner finds cycling and walking 
routes with the best air quality, or with the least noise, 
or with the greenest streetscapes. The app optimises 
route choices based on environmental exposure and the 
duration of the trip. A crowdsourced OpenStreetMap 
database is used by the tool for displaying the street 
and trail network. The source code for the route planner 
is freely accessible on GitHub.

Poznan has a well-established green infrastructure that 
is defined as a wedge-and-ring greenery system. The 
green wedges follow the main watercourses in the city, 
the Warta, Cybina and Bogdanka rivers connecting city 
borders with the city centre.
In addition to the wedges, there are two green rings 
belonging to greenery system. The inner ring is running 
along the line of medieval city walls. The second 
ring is based on the remnants of the former Prussian 
fortifications of Poznan. The layout of this outstanding 
greenery system was developed by an architect and 
urban planner, Władysław Czarnecki, and a botanist, 
Adam Wodziczko in the years 1930–1934. The main 
purpose of the wedge system apart from providing 
recreational opportunities to residents was to ventilate 
the city and to protect surface waters. This extensive 
green network was meant to ensure internal coherence 
and spatial connectivity, enhance internal differentiation 
with the graduation of forms and functions of green 
areas and to establish connections with the natural 
environment beyond the borders of the city. The wedges 
form parks in the city centre, while in the outskirts of the 
city they integrate urban forests, allotment gardens, 
meadows and pastures.
Some fragments of this greenery system have been 
transformed into built-up areas, or are threatened by 
new investments, but the assumptions of this coherent

system are still valid. Spatial planning documents of 
Poznan, including the land use plan mention green 
wedges and green rings as basic elements shaping the 
spatial structure of the city.
The wedges with open areas and greenery function  
as air corridors that improve air circulation by allowing 
air exchange in the city. As the wedges extend beyond 
city borders, they supply air from non-urban areas and 
through this effectively contribute to the dilution  
of pollutants in the inner city.

Research over the last decade has shown that 
prolonged exposure to high levels of traffic noise can 
have an adverse impact on our health. It can increase 
the risk of sleep disturbance, heart attack and stroke, 
amongst other ill effects. With this in mind, Limerick 
City and County Council invited the public to begin 
using the Hush City App to help the Council identify, 
enhance and protect the peaceful areas that Limerick 
people value the most.
The Hush City approach was developed by Antonella 
Radicchi at the Berlin Technical University. A key element 
of the approach is the free Hush City Smart phone 
app, which allows members of the public to record 
information on ‘quiet areas’ in their cities. This collected 
data is available for other app users and importantly, 
policy makers! It can therefore perform the dual function 
of inputting into policy as well as showing citizens where 
they can find peace and quiet in their city.
Data input consists of audio recordings, sound pressure 
levels, pictures of the places which are georeferenced 
and timestamped. A questionnaire within the app asks 
for users’ perceptions of quietness, and their emotional 
Source: Limerick City and County Council
responses to positive/negative sounds and overall 
accessibility to the places. All data can be shared using 
the Hush City app.
The Hush City approach is a robust resource which 
has the potential to meaningfully influence urban 
development policy and planning. However, 
designating ‘quiet areas’ is not a simple matter: the 
areas that city authorities identify as potential quiet 
areas are not always the areas that residents use 
and enjoy the most. Added to this, the natural world 
can be a loud place, for example, birdsong, flowing 
water and the sound of the wind in the trees. But these 
sounds have a restorative quality unlike the sound  
of planes, trains and automobiles.
This is an important point for Limerick City and County 
Council. The Hush City app helps the city  
to a) better understand which tranquil and quiet areas 
are important to the citizens of Limerick and b) inform 
how, and in what way Limerick City and County Council 
applies for official designations of quiet areas by the 
Department of Communications, Climate Action and 
the Environment.

In Stockholm a very successful street tree planting 
program has been developed since 2001, that resulted 
in tree growth in downtown sidewalks that is equal  
to or even better than trees growing in nearby parks.
In sidewalks trees are typically lacking space, oxygen, 
nutrients, water, and suffer from ground compaction 
and soil damage. Under the program of Stockholm 
trees are provided with a specific growing bed that 
dramatically improves the growing conditions for the 
plants in an urban environment. The solution applied 
in the Swedish capital is based on the use of specially 
constructed structural or skeletal soils that effectively 
hinders the soil compaction and at the same time 
functions as a substrate for the roots of the trees.
The trees are planted in holes that are surrounded by 
structural soil from below and from the side.  
The structural soil consists of layers of crushed rocks. 
These layers have 25% – 30% pore space that is filled 
with soil. The crushed rock bears the load and the roots 
can grow in the soil.
Following the compaction of the first layer of rocks, soil 
and a slow-release fertilizer is washed into the voids 
between the stones. Then a second layer of stone  
is added, the pore space of which is filled up with soil 
and humus. The layers of rock are covered by a finely 
crushed stone layer. A geotextile fabric separates the

entire planting pit and the surface layer. The geotextile 
prevents the pavement base material from sinking down 
into the planting pit and roots from growing up into  
the pavement.
Over 2000 projects have been completed across 
Stockholm, since the program was launched,  
and the practice is planned to be taken up  
elsewhere in Sweden.

In Tartu, Estonia a Healthy Street guidelines was 
prepared in 2022 that promotes:
•  ‘the development of street green infrastructure 
with an aim to provide a healthier streetscape for 
residents, 
•  ‘improved social interactions in urban green spaces, 
•  ‘the use of green infrastructure for absorbing excess 
water from rainfall,
•  ‘the installation of nature-based solutions to improve 
the cooling capacity of the urban environment, and
•  ‘the use of street greenery for locally improving air 
quality and reducing noise.
The guide supports the application of a new strategic 
approach when constructing or renovating streets

(e.g., the rearrangement of underground utility lines 
as a compact system rather than separate and sparse 
entities). The guidelines function as a link between vision 
documents and actions in practice. The document was 
compiled by a mixed team of landscape architects and 
technical consultants. 
A key component of the guide is a unique street quality 
evaluation method, which consists of four sections – 
walkability, bicycles, biodiversity and continuity. All four 
sections are divided into series of different qualities that 
indicate the overall condition of the street. The qualities 
are measured on a scale from 0 to 3, first evaluating the 
current situation and also proposing the desired score 
for reconstruction.

Barcelona superblock unit was imagined in the 
Eixample neighbourhood, measuring approximately 
400 square metres (nine square blocks). It contains 
a network of basic vehicle routes connecting starting 
points and destinations throughout the city. The interior 
routes constitute a local network where the speed limit 
is 10 km/h. The roads inside a superblock are local, 
and less polluted, less noisy, and with less crashes.  
It also frees up more than 70% of the space currently 
occupied by motor vehicle traffic passing through the 
area, making it available for pedestrians and cyclists.
The idea was developed by Salvador Rueda, urban 
ecologist and head of the environmental department  
of the city of Barcelona.
The pilot project was developed in 2016 in the 
neighbourhood of Poble Nou, and it was a first step  
of a low-cost intervention on a street as a public space: 
colourfully painted asphalt, signalling, new urban 
furniture. The second step, during the pandemic period, 
was to implement car free spots or axes, in different 
neighbourhoods of the city, offering places to sit,  
to chat, and to be surrounded by green planters. Now 
the next step, that will start its implementation in 2022, 
is to convert four axes and four nodes of the Eixample 
neighbourhood into green avenues and plazas, car 
free and with a special emphasis on social wellbeing, 
community cohesion, and ecological amelioration 
through permeable surfaces and stormwater treatment 
solutions to fight climate change.

In Manhattan, New York an abandoned 2.4 km long 
elevated rail structure was transformed into an iconic 
green corridor and promenade. The first section  
of the High Line was opened in 2009. The park features 
individual and group seating areas, a sun deck,  
an observation area and social spaces.
The landscape architecture of the High Line imitates 
wild and spontaneous growth, and emphasizes 
native plants that had colonized the structure after 
1980, when the rail line had been stopped being 
used. One section of the park was even left in its 
previously uncultivated state. As a result of the green 
transformation, the structure hosts more than 1500 
species of plants, birds and insects.
Various kinds of facilitated activities are organized on 
the High Line, such as Pilates classes, astronomy classes 
or guided tours. The activities are free, and are led 
by volunteers. The High Line is also home to rotating 
public art exhibitions.
The linear park quickly became one of New York's 
defining features, triggering a building boom nearby,

Streets in Berlin take up one fourth of the city’ total 
area, and one third of its total public space, playing  
a major role in the city’s life, providing an exchange 
point between services, amenities, entertainment, 
culture and private and public life.
However, streets were mainly seen only as a mobility 
corridor until the Berlin’s Municipal department for 
Urban Development and the Environment investigated 
new ways streets could be used as a shared asset. 
Two street sections were selected for testing, and 
politicians, planners and experts were invited to 
participate in a 3-step engagement process.
First, the local authority introduced a new way of 
looking at streets through a workshop, focusing on how 
mobility influences the street’s function and character.
Next, participants measured the use and quality 
(according to 12 quality criteria), or lack thereof the 
two streets, using Gehl’s PSPL (Public Space & Public 
Life) method. Then, in a second workshop participants 
identified different planning perspectives and 
motivations for the future, using the data they had 
collected. To promote thinking of the planning process 
in increments, participants had to structure their visions 
in three scales: small, medium and large.
Finally, participants created a set of intervention 
recommendations for the two streets, such as creating  
a parklet or a new zebra crossing. The interventions 
were pilot tested, allowing the participants to learn 
more about possible solutions. This 3-step method  
is recommended to use for finding the right interventions 
for more livable streets.

Car-free Avenue is a municipality-initiated action  
in Tartu, Estonia. The City of Tartu is planning to reserve 
during the summer of 2022 one of the main streets of 
the city (Vabaduse puiestee: Freedom avenue) already 
for the third time in a row for pedestrians and cyclists 
only. The initiative in the previous years was a huge 
success, becoming one of the most awaited public 
events of the year.
Tartu piloted the event space in July 2020 when people 
were longing for public activities after the lockdown.  
It was decided to close a section of the street for 
traffic to open the space for pedestrians as a kind of 
festival space with events, temporary greening, outdoor 
furniture and food trucks. It was an immediate success 
and the same layout was repeated in 2021. The area 
used for the urban intervention hosted meadow boxes, 
water-features, various markets, an outdoor cinema, 
and a wide range of programming.
The 2022 solution is slightly different. The event space 
will be open during weekends when all car traffic  
is closed on the avenue. On business days two lanes  
of traffic are open and two lanes designated for cyclists 
will be added. The same arrangement with restricted 
car traffic and added bike lanes will stretch along the 
two main streets of the city. This temporary solution  
is 2.2 km long and is open for cyclists until late autumn.
In order to promote the positive effects of greenery, 
simple mobile greening solutions are used in the Car-
free Avenue. The City of Tartu purchased about 30 
large plant containers and are using them after the 
event in various urban situations where fast temporary 
changes are needed. The use of large plant containers 
demonstrates the instant effect of street greening- as 
everyone can estimate the difference that adding 
greenery can make. The containers have been used  
in different locations and situations.

Municipal River Beaches (Plaże miejskie) in Poznan  
is a project of seasonal use of the Warta riverbank 
(flood plain) as an urban beach and recreational 
area. The idea aimed at bringing citizens back to 
the Warta River and using the potential of natural 
environment for urban regeneration. The areas along 
the Warta River for a long time were abandoned and 
neglected. For that reason, the city authorities began 
to act and introduced a new approach in politics 
called ‘return to the river’.
The first beach was established in 2012 in the 
Chwaliszewo district. With the growing interest  
of residents, the number of activities, workshops and 
events were systematically increased, which in turn 
gave the impulse to the city's further activities and 
the opening of new beaches along the Warta River. 
In 2015, two additional beaches were established – 
in the Rataje and Szeląg District. In 2016 and 2017, 
there were already 4 municipal beaches of different 
character, with different programs, providing residents 
with various services depending on the age of a 
given social group. Every urban beach had the basic 
infrastructure, deckchairs, chairs, tables, umbrellas and 
sandy playground. Year by year more new facilities 
were added.
Until 2018 beaches were financed from the city budget 
of Poznan, and the management of the beach was on 
the operator's side, that was selected every year  
in a public tender.
In 2018, the first three beaches, and in 2020 the fourth 
one, were leased by commercial entities. As a result, 
the business potential increased, especially on the 
eastern bank of the Warta River, where new commercial 
beaches were opened. A significant impulse was also 
the construction of the Wartostrada in 2018, which  
is a system of pedestrian and bicycle routes along the 
Warta River that increases the accessibility of the area.
