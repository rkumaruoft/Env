Abstract
The controversy between the IPCC and Non-governmental IPCC (NIPCC) on the attribution of global warming
are reviewed. IPCC holds that today’s global warming is mainly due to anthropogenic activities rather than natural
variability, which is emphasized by NIPCC. The surface temperature observations since the mid-20th century support
the hypothesis of anthropogenic impact, but for the last one hundred years or so, natural forcings such as solar activity,
volcanic eruptions and thermohaline circulation variations also have had great inﬂuences on the Earth’s climate, especially
on inter-decadal timescales. In addition, evidence suggests that the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and Little Ice Age
(LIA) are closely associated with the solar activity over the past 1 thousand years. Over the past 10 thousand years,
the North Atlantic cold events and solar activity are closely correlated. Nevertheless, the physical mechanisms of the
solar-climate variability and interrelation are not well understood, yet. Notably, a prevailing view recently indicates that
galactic cosmic rays may result in climatic cooling through modulating global low cloud cover. However, its process and
mechanism need to be further investigated.

1 Introduction
Global warming is one of today’s most popular
and controversial topics. Beyond our early expecta-
tion, the controversy almost involved every aspects of
global warming, including its nature, causes, conse-
quences, and even whether the global warming has
really happened. Three key issues of the current con-
troversy covering the current status of global warming,
its impacts and anthropogenic eﬀect, were reviewed by
Wang et al. [2010], who pointed out that the global
warming is the result of combined eﬀects of human ac-
tivity and natural variability. In this paper, two appar-
ently diametrically opposed views on the global warm-
ing from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) and Non-governmental International Panel on
Climate Change (NIPCC) will be reviewed.
2 Focus of the debates
The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4)
[IPCC, 2007] pointed out that most of the observed
global temperature rising since the mid-20th cen-
tury is “very likely” due to the increase of anthro-
pogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs) concentrations in
atmosphere.
This conclusion made a great progress
in attribution of global warming as compared to the
IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR) [IPCC, 2001],

in which the global warming is “likely” induced by an-
thropogenic emissions.
In IPCC AR4, “very likely”
means above 90% in probability of occurrence, while
“likely” means just more than 66%.
So, this ad-
vance implies that IPCC has a higher conﬁdence in
the conclusion of anthropogenic global warming than
before. However, NIPCC, as a strong opponent of an-
thropogenic global warming, takes an entirely oppo-
site standpoint, which is expressed clearly in the ti-
tle of their summary for policymakers [Singer, 2008],
“Nature, not human activity, rules the climate”. In
order to understand this discrepancy between IPCC
and NIPCC, it is necessary to review these two oppo-
site views and their respective arguments.
3 Evidence for the greenhouse eﬀect
hypothesis
From the First Assessment Report released in
1990, IPCC still has been insisting on its conclusion
which attributes modern climate warming to the in-
crease of anthropogenic GHGs concentrations in the
atmosphere. This conclusion appears to be reinforced
continuously by emerging scientiﬁc evidence in re-
cent years. Generally, the scientiﬁc evidence for the
IPCC’s standpoint of human-made global warming
comes from two sources: the observations and model
simulations. They will be reviewed in the following
paragraphs.
3.1
Observations
It is required by the greenhouse eﬀect hypothesis
that the increase of temperature (such as daily aver-
age, maximum and minimum temperature) owing to
increased concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere,
should occur globally in each season, and more notice-
ably in high latitudes than low latitudes, especially
in winter.
Additionally, the minimum temperature
should rise more drastically than the maximum tem-
perature if the global warming is induced by increased
GHGs in the atmosphere. So far, all of these theo-
retical assumptions associated with greenhouse eﬀect
hypothesis have been almost proved by instrumental
records. Over the past four decades, the global sur-
face temperature variations, as shown in Figure 1, are
characterized by signiﬁcant warming, especially over
the continental high latitudes [Hansen et al., 2010].
The warming is highest in the ﬁrst decade of the 21st
century with global averaged temperature rising about
0.51◦C relative to 1951–1980. The trends of seasonal
surface temperature are comparable in each season
with signiﬁcant upward trend ranging from 0.60 to
0.65◦C (Fig. 2) over the past 60 years [Hansen et al.,
2010]. The increase of boreal winter temperature is
most noticeable over the continent of Eurasia and the
northern part of North America, while in austral win-
ter (June-July-August) distinctive warming appears
over the coastal area of Antarctica.
In addition, instrumental observations show that
the diurnal temperature range (DTR) has a downward
trend [IPCC, 2007], which also meets the requirements
of the greenhouse eﬀect theory. About 80% of this de-
creasing trend in the DTR, which is slighter in IPCC
AR4 than in IPCC TAR, can be attributed to changes
in cloud cover and rainfall. Satellite datasets over the
period of 1979–2005 demonstrate that warming has
been globally occurring in the troposphere from the
Earth’s surface to the level of 10 km high, while cool-
ing in the stratosphere [IPCC, 2007]. This observed
phenomenon is also in agreement with the greenhouse
eﬀect hypothesis. Climate models are additional use-
ful and powerful tools to provide evidence for anthro-
pogenic global warming.
One discrepancy, however,
exists between model simulations and observations.
Driven by increased anthropogenic GHGs, model sim-
ulations’ results show much warmer conditions in the
tropical upper troposphere than at surface level. How-
ever, this phenomenon is not veriﬁed in observations
and becomes an evidence for NIPCC against IPCC’s
viewpoint on anthropogenic warming. But, Allen and
Sherwood [2008] made a calculation of the temperature
of the tropical (20◦N–20◦S) upper troposphere with
observational data based on the thermal wind theory
recently. The results show that the temperature in-
crease is larger at the tropical upper troposphere than
at the Earth’s surface. In addition, Thorne [2008] also
pointed out that temperature at the level of 200 hPa
increased by about (0.40±0.29)◦C per 10 years over
the period of 1979–2005, which is much larger than
that of surface temperature (0.13◦C per 10 years).

It needs to be further investigated why this phe-
nomenon only appears both in model simulations and
theoretical calculations, but not in observations.
3.2
Model simulations
If the global averaged temperature variations
could be reproduced in model simulations forced by
the prescribed anthropogenic GHGs, it would be con-
vinced with high conﬁdence that the warming of the
20th century was caused principally by human activ-
ities. For a more realistic climate in the models, the
climate of the 20th century were simulated (summa-
rized in IPCC AR4) using atmosphere-ocean gen-
eral circulation models (AOGCMs) integrated with
HUANG Jian-Bin et al. / Debates on the Causes of Global Warming
41
forcings of GHGs, aerosol, volcanic eruptions, so-
lar activity, ozone, etc.
These climate models have
good performance on the global temperature varia-
tions from 1960s, although they do not capture some
striking features before 1960s, such as one peak of
the global temperature series from late 1930s to mid-
1940s, and two valleys in the early and middle of
1950s, respectively. Particularly, without forcings of
anthropogenic emissions, the warming starting from
the late 20th century cannot be realized in model
simulations.
Hence, these experiments imply that
the increase of GHGs concentrations in atmosphere
play a principal role in the warming of the late 20th
century.
Additionally, the IPCC AR4 also summa-
rized model simulations of the past millennial climate
changes, which were performed in the period of 2002–
2007 with 12 models comprising of 6 global climate
models (GCMs), 4 Earth-system models of intermedi-
ate complexity (EMICs) and 2 energy balance mod-
els (EBMs). These models were driven only by natu-
ral forcings of insolation and volcanic eruptions, and
succeed in reproducing the warming of the 12th–14th
century and cooling in the 15th, 17th, and 19th cen-
tury. After taking account of anthropogenic emissions,
these models can also reproduce the warming in both
the 1940s and the latter 30 years of the 20th century.
As a result, these modeling experiments suggest that
anthropogenic activities dominate the warming of the
20th century, while natural forcings, such as volcanic
and solar activities, are the principal drivers of climate
change over the past millennium.
However, on the issue of anthropogenic global
warming, NIPCC took an entirely diﬀerent position
from IPCC and vigorously criticized IPCC for their
exaggerating the eﬀect of human-generated GHGs on
climate change.
They pointed out that the global
temperature records cited by the IPCC is unreli-
able because of their poor geographic distribution and
sampling, and contamination from urban heat-island
eﬀect.
In terms of climate models, a crucial source
for predominance of anthropogenic GHGs in global
warming, their mismatch with observations is taken by
the NIPCC as an important evidence for the current
warming of natural rather than anthropogenic origin
[Singer, 2008].
4 Evidence for solar activity impacts
The relationship of solar activity with climate
started to attract attention of scientists from the late
19th to the early 20th century. A hypothesis on the in-
ﬂuence of solar activity on the global climate was pro-
posed, but it still has to face challenges mainly from
two aspects: 1) no persistent 11-year cycles associated
with the sunspot cycle are observed in long-term cli-
mate indices; 2) how solar variability inﬂuences the
Earth’s climate.
Initially, the total solar irradiance
(TSI) was believed to be a constant, but later this
“constant” is proved to be a variable. The amplitude
of the TSI varies in an 11-year cycle by only about
0.1%, which induces that the solar irradiance change
is not enough to entirely explain the past climate vari-
ability. Therefore, a new mechanism needs to be es-
tablished for the solar-climate variability.
4.1
Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and Lit-
tle Ice Age (LIA)
As there is no persistent 11-year cycle in the long-
term Earth’s climate, we mainly focus on climate vari-
ability of decadal to centennial timescales. Over the
past one thousand years, the MWP and LIA are two
important epochs for the global climate. Prior to the
industrial revolution, the MWP and LIA do almost
not involve the inﬂuence of human activity and are
attributed to natural forcings such as solar activity
by most scientists. Kikby [2007] summarized the rela-
tionship of the surface temperature with solar varia-
tions over the past thousand years (Fig. 3). Compared
with temperature variations (Fig. 3a), it is obvious in
Figure 3b that galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) are weak
(corresponding to strong solar activity) in the MWP,
while the condition is reversed in the LIA. Addition-
ally, the GCRs variability also matches well with the
advance and retreat of the tropical Andean glacier.
These evidences suggest a close relationship of GCRs
with Earth’s climate.

Figure 3 (a) The surface temperature, (b) galactic cos-
mic rays, and (c) tropical Andean glacier changes during
the past millennium (After Figure 2 in Kikby [2007])
et al. [1997] indicated that the North Atlantic has ex-
perienced ice-rafting events (also named cold events)
8 times, numbered 1–8. Later, as result of having sim-
ilar features with the preceding cold events, the LIA
is also regarded as a cold event and numbered the 0
event. Consequently, there are altogether 9 cold events
in the Holocene. Substantial studies [Mayewski et al.,
2004; Morrill et al., 2003; Staubwasser, 2006; Wang et
al., 2005] show that cold events in the North Atlantic
are closely associated with climate over the North-
ern Hemisphere, even with the global climate changes.
Wang [2009] analyzed the chronology of the North At-
lantic cold events in the Holocene and its impacts, and
pointed out that when cold events happen in the North
Atlantic, it is cold and dry over the boreal high lat-
itudes, especially over Northwest Europe, while it is
wet in Central and Western Europe. Additionally, ev-
idently reduced summer monsoon precipitation over
the Africa-Asian monsoon regions, droughts occurred
over the areas extending from the coastal area of East-
ern Africa through the Arabian Sea to South Asia and
East Asia, and droughts in South China recorded in
stalagmite records are also closely associated with the
Northern Atlantic cold events [Wang et al., 2005].
Denton and Karl´en [1973] proposed that the
weakening solar activity may be the reason for the
Holocene abrupt climate changes. Bond et al. [2001]
reconstructed the solar variations using 14C and 10Be
records, and established a composite index with 4 sea
sediment records to represent the North Atlantic cold
events in the Holocene.
These reconstructed series
were removed from linear trends ﬁrstly, and then ﬁl-
tered by 70 years. It is obvious that the solar activity
is closely correlated with the composite index (Fig. 4),
which the correlation coeﬃcients are 0.44 and 0.56, re-
spectively. In addition, 9 times of Northern Atlantic
cold events match well with the valley of the solar in-
tensity (corresponding peak in GCRs series). These
suggest that the Northern Atlantic cold events may
be induced by the weakening of the solar intensity.

4.3
Mechanisms of solar-climate variability
The solar activity exerts great inﬂuence on the
Earth’s climate in three ways [Carslaw et al., 2002]:
TSI, ultraviolet radiation, and GCRs changes. With
respect of TSI, the observations over the past two and
HUANG Jian-Bin et al. / Debates on the Causes of Global Warming
43
a half 11-year cycles proved that the “solar constant”
does not keep a constant, and varies with an amplitude
of 0.1% [Fr¨ohlich and Lean, 2004].
This amplitude
can only induce Earth’s temperature change of 0.1◦C,
which is not nearly enough to explain the observed
climate variability [Wigley and Raper, 1990].
Even
though the variation of TSI is larger in the past several
hundred years than at present, it has just increased by
0.5 W m−2 (equivalent to a radiative forcing enhancing
about 0.08 W m−2 at the top of the atmosphere), and
induced temperature rising only 0.06◦C since the 18th
century, almost smaller than the observed (0.6◦C) by
an order of magnitude, presuming climate sensitivity is
0.7◦C (W m−2)−1 [Foukal et al., 2006]. Consequently,
TSI variations are not believed as the major way of so-
lar activity to inﬂuence the Earth’s climate currently
by more and more climatologists and astronomers.
Drastic change of ultraviolet radiation in the 11-
year solar cycle is the second way of solar activity to
inﬂuence the Earth’s climate [Haigh, 1996]. The ultra-
violet radiation variation is estimated to be about 7%
from the maximum year (M year) to the minimum year
(m year) in an 11-year cycle, although diﬀerent scien-
tists have diﬀerent estimates. When the solar activity
intensiﬁes, ultraviolet radiation becomes stronger, O3
concentration increases and absorbs more ultraviolet
radiation leading to a warming in the stratosphere.
Thereafter, through the way of radiation and dynamic
processes, the stratosphere exerts great inﬂuence on
the troposphere. However, the process and mechanism
by which solar activity aﬀects the Earth’s climate are
hardly understood and require more attention.
On the third way of solar activity aﬀecting the
Earth’s climate, numerous researches have already
been carried out [Carslaw et al., 2002; Kikby, 2007;
Svensmark, 2007]. In an 11-year cycle, about 15% of
GCRs variation is measured, and at the same time
about 1.77% of low cloud amount change is also ob-
served, which is equivalent to radiative forcing varying
by about 1 W m−2. Compared with the radiative forc-
ing change (1.66 W m−2) due to the increase of CO2
in the atmosphere, the inﬂuence of GCRs on radiative
forcing (1 W m−2) cannot be negligible [Svensmark,
2007]. The mechanism and process by which GCR af-
fects the Earth’s climate cause great attention. Three
hypotheses are proposed to explain how GCRs aﬀect
the low cloud cover: 1) ionization from GCRs inﬂu-
ences the number of cloud condensation nuclei [Dikin-
son, 1975]; 2) ionization from GCRs modulates the
cloud physical processes through thunderstorm cur-
rents [Markson and Muir, 1980]; 3) ionization from
GCRs aﬀects the nucleation and/or growth rate of ice
crystals in high-level clouds in winter cyclone [Tinsley
and Deen, 1991; Tinsley, 1996]. In addition, Carslaw
et al. [2002] pointed out that the bottleneck of the
inﬂuence of GCR on the climate is to modulate the
formation of cloud particles and ice crystals, and pro-
posed two kinds of mechanisms for this process: “ion-
aerosol clear-air” and “ion-aerosol near-cloud”. How-
ever, these mechanisms are not entirely proved by the
observations.
To what extent the solar activity in-
ﬂuence the Earth’s climate is not clear, and to what
extent to strengthen or oﬀset the greenhouse eﬀect on
the Earth’s climate need to be investigated further.
5 Conclusions
The hypothesis of global warming since the mid-
20th century owing to the increase of CO2 in the atmo-
sphere is supported observationally by the spatial and
seasonal characteristics of global temperatures varia-
tions.
Additionally, climate warming over the past
30 years can be reproduced by climate models forced
by increased GHGs concentrations in the atmosphere.
Over the last hundred years, however, the warming
in the 1940s and cooling in the period of 1950–1970
cannot be reproduced by climate models driven only
by increased concentrations of GHGs. This discrep-
ancy between model simulations and observations im-
ply that natural forcings, such as solar activity, vol-
canic activity and thermohaline circulation in global
deep oceans, also play important roles in climate vari-
ability on decadal timescales.
Substantial evidences indicate that the MWP and
the LIA are closely associated with solar activity, and
the Northern Atlantic cold events in the Holocene was
also closely correlated with the weakening solar activ-
ity recorded in 14C and 10Be. The variations of TSI
are not enough to explain the contemporaneous cli-
matic changes. At present, most scientists are aware of
the importance of GCRs’s impacts on climate variabil-
ity. When solar irradiance weakens, increased GCR
induces more low clouds leading to the climatic cool-
ing. However, the details of the mechanism are poorly
understood, and need to be investigated further. To
what extent, the solar activity and natural forcings
strengthen or oﬀset the greenhouse eﬀect also needs
to be studied further, too.

ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH
Although NIPCC insists on the current warming
of natural rather than anthropogenic origin, accumu-
lated evidence demonstrates that the global warm-
ing is due to the combined eﬀects of anthropogenic
and natural forcing, and mainly due to man-generated
GHGs especially from the mid-20th century. The in-
ﬂuence of GCR on the radiation received by the Earth
through modulating the low cloud cover is considered
the major mechanism. Therefore, how solar activity
aﬀects the Earth’s climate is urgently needed to be
explored further.
