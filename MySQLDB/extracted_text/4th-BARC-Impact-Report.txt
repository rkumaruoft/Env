4th
BARC 
IMPACT
REPORT
We need to focus efforts on collective
implementation, with diverse
partners, at various scales, and
across sectors.
As we prepare the 4th Building Adaptive and
Resilient Communities (BARC) Impact Report,
we reflect on 2023 as one of the wildest years
in history. Every corner of Canada has been
touched by climate change in some way — by
storms, floods, heatwaves, and droughts —
damaging infrastructure and, in tragic cases,
claiming lives. The wildfire season alone broke
records with nearly 18.5 million hectares of
land burning resulting in mass evacuations.
The IPCC has made it clear: the impacts of
climate change we are experiencing are not
unexpected. This is a new reality and one we
need to prepare for now more than ever. At
the same time, we must drastically shift
towards a net-zero future to lessen these
impacts and their tragic consequences. 
In addition to marking one of the wildest
weather years in history, 2023 also marks the
15-year anniversary of ICLEI Canada’s BARC
program. In this time, BARC has steadily been
helping Canadian communities prepare for
and address the risks of climate change. It has
helped local practitioners understand present
and future climate risk and what can be done
locally to adapt and reduce our risk. It has
also contributed to a national dialogue
around the policy changes we need to realize
a resilient and low-carbon future.
But how can we ensure we stay the course?
We need specific objectives and targets to
guide us and, on this front, Canada’s National
Adaptation Strategy: Building Resilient
Communities and a Strong Economy (NAS) has
served us well. The NAS has given us a
collective plan from which we can act on. By
outlining a vision, objectives, targets, and
specific actions, the NAS represents a whole-
of-society approach to preparing for climate
change — one that communities will play a
key role in implementing.
We need to focus efforts on collective
implementation, with diverse partners, at
various scales, and across sectors. Part of
implementation is ensuring we have the
metrics and indicators to track our progress
and course correct when necessary. This is
where we are turning our sights. Through
various initiatives — including the 11th Livable
Cities Forum scheduled for fall 2024 — we will
continue to bring local practitioners together
to support implementation and mobilize
action at the pace required to address the
climate challenge. Our focus on
implementation also presents an incredible
opportunity to prioritize low-carbon resilience
to meet net-zero and resilience goals, as well
as an opportunity to multi-solve and address
equity, diversity and inclusion issues.

Building Adaptive and
Resilient Communities
The open-source foundation established
by BARC has become so widely used that
it's impossible for ICLEI to track its uptake
and application with the same degree of
accuracy as we have in earlier BARC
Impact Reports. However, that doesn’t
mean we won’t try. 
Many will know BARC as a
national capacity building
program for municipalities
focused on adaptation and
resilience. Over 120
municipalities, large and small,
have used the BARC framework,
tools and resources to guide
their adaptation and resilience
building efforts; however, BARC
has grown to become much more
than a program. BARC is the
window through which ICLEI
engages in adaptation and
resilience policy development,
financing, applied research,
resource development, capacity
building, networking, and much
more.

Insights & Priorities
5
Increasing the pace of
implementation
We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again:
implementation is not keeping pace with the
frequency and severity of impacts being felt by
communities. We are seeing dozens of adaptation
plans being created each year with the majority of
these supported by robust vulnerability and risk
assessment processes. However, there is a serious
lag in the implementation of these plans. In order
to help communities get beyond assessment and
planning, we are committed to creating unique and
tailored capacity building supports for
implementation. Whether these are cohorts of
local governments working together on financing
or specific tools that address communication
challenges, we will continue to focus our efforts on
helping local governments implement adaptation
in their communities.
Over the last year, we have been in
conversation with many adaptation
practitioners, policy makers,
researchers, and thought leaders —
from national policy dialogues to local
community-based workshops and
everything in between. Through these
conversations, we are constantly
hearing about and learning from the
challenges, opportunities, and
possibilities that practitioners are faced
with every day which informs how we
approach capacity building. Here are a
few of our latest insights and priorities.

Getting comfortable with
failing forward
While we are seeing adaptation action happening
across the country, our collective response has not
been perfect — but there’s a lot to learn from
imperfection. If we agree we need innovation, then
we must get comfortable with things not going
exactly to plan and learn to rebound from that.
Simply put: we must learn to fail forward. At ICLEI
Canada, we are getting comfortable in that space
of innovation where an idea is born, tested,
pivoted, tested, and reapplied again and again. We
are striving to fail forward in our work to build
adaptive and resilient communities, having learned
that some of our best ideas have come from the
thoughtful processes of failing forward.
Unlocking innovative
finance mechanisms for
adaptation
Despite the strong economic case for investing in
climate adaptation at a time when Canadians are
experiencing increasing and worsening climate
events, public funds are limited. This challenge is
particularly acute for municipalities which own and
operate 60 percent of Canada’s public
infrastructure, face limited capacity and revenue
sources to address climate impacts, and are facing
a large price tag for infrastructure adaptation — an
estimated $5 billion annually. Given the
accelerating changes in our climate and the multi-
billion-dollar loss events recently experienced in
communities across Canada, a whole-of-society
approach where private investors work alongside
all levels of government is needed to achieve the
scale and speed of construction required. We are
focused on using this approach as we explore
innovative opportunities to finance climate action
and socialize these among local practitioners and
investors.

Mainstreaming climate
governance and
accountability
It’s time to shift from making promises to act
on climate change to promising results from
our actions on climate change — a subtle but
very important distinction. This is where
climate governance and accountability come
in. Climate budgeting and climate-related
financial disclosure build accountability and
governance into our municipal climate
planning and implementation processes. They
create a culture of consistent, cross-
departmental climate leadership — one that
is more accountable and transparent towards
official climate goals and targets. However,
both climate budgeting and climate disclosure
are in their infancy. We are committed to
harnessing the creativity, ingenuity, and
collaborative spirit of municipal practitioners
to put climate budgeting to the test and help
realize its full potential. 
Addressing the climate
and housing crises in
tandem
We are currently bearing witness to two crises
rising in tandem: the housing crisis and the
climate crisis. Both of these are intrinsically
linked. We need to simultaneously safeguard
existing homes from extreme weather and
build millions of new homes while reaching
net-zero resiliency goals, not exacerbating
them. At the national scale, Canada’s new
Task Force for Housing and Climate is tackling
just that. Locally, we are supporting
municipalities as they address both of these
challenges by applying a multi-solving lens to
new developments. With this approach, public
investments can address affordability, reduce
climate impacts, and contribute to a net-zero
future.

Finding the climate action
and biodiversity nexus
Taking action on biodiversity and nature
conservation is taking action on climate
adaptation. Enhancing green infrastructure,
increasing tree canopy, and applying nature-based
solutions all reduce the impacts of climate change
while also bringing nature back into our cities. The
NAS guides our collective efforts towards climate
adaptation while the 2030 Biodiversity Strategy for
Canada guides our collective efforts towards
halting and reversing biodiversity loss. Local
governments have an important role to play in the
implementation of both these strategies and we
are committed to ensuring they continue to be
engaged and empowered in their implementation.  
Weaving together
knowledge systems to
advance climate action
Indigenous and local knowledge are central to
understanding and adapting to the impacts of
climate change. Drawing on multiple Knowledges
(Indigenous, local, and Western scientific) provides
a more holistic evidence-base for policies and
decision making while also addressing underlying
equity issues. Weaving together Indigenous and
Western knowledge systems can improve our
understanding of socio-ecological
interdependencies and mechanisms while working
towards reconciliation by building trust, promoting
Indigenous agency and self-determination, and
addressing ongoing issues related to power
dynamics. Truth and Reconciliation is a
fundamental component to achieving net-zero
resilient communities that we are committed to
working towards.
