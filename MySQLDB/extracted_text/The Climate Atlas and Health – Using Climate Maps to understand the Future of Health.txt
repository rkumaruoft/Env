Climate change is a global issue affecting the health of communities and individuals. However, 
the impacts and solutions can be very different depending on what area of Canada you live. Under-
standing the magnitude of the changes and risks locally and regionally, allows citizens, politicians, 
and planners to take meaningful action to mitigate and adapt.
Maps are great tools to communicate information, this includes information on future climate pro-
jections and public health. They help visualize data at national, regional, and local scales. This helps 
readers connect with locations that are known and loved, making the information more relatable and 
relevant. 
Maps often contain so much information that we can all use a little help to ensure important details 
are not missed. This guidebook will provide a detailed explanation of maps and how they can be used 
to describe some of the key climate impacts facing the health of Canadians.

MENTAL HEALTH
Climate is impacting the health of Canadians in many ways. While physical health risks come 
from increased injury risk, heat illness, air quality issues, and diseases, it is also important to 
acknowledge the mental health impact climate has on all Canadians.

Maps are powerful tools to help visualize data and information. They allow us to see patterns or 
changes across space. While maps are very useful for a variety of professions, including policy-makers, 
engineers, planners, geologists, and pilots, to name a few, they are also widely used on a day-to-day 
basis for common things, like navigating in an unfamiliar place.
There are many different types of maps. Each map aims to communicate different information, and 
can be used for a variety of purposes. However, most maps will have common features that are key 
to help understand the information that is being displayed. Below is an overview of these features.
Data/Information:
The type of data that could be represented by a map is vast. An important first 
step when looking at a map is to identify the type of data and the information it is 
communicating.
The maps on the Climate Atlas display climate model data of the past and future, 
however, there are many other types of data that can be presented. For instance 
demographic data, economic data, indicators of health, geography and elevation, etc. 
By combining or comparing maps showing different types of data we are able to see 
patterns or trends which improves our understanding and supports decision-making.
Visual components:
For a map to be effective, it has to contain some key visual elements which will help 
the reader understand what the map is trying to show. Here are some key elements 
you can expect to see on any map, including the ones in this guide:1

Legend or Key: 
This explains symbols and colours used on the 
map by identifying a sample of the symbol/
colour along with a short description.
Title:
The title is the subject of the map. Effective 
titles have the geographic location of the map, 
what it is indicating and a date or year. 
Scale: 
The scale is usually displayed as a ratio compar-
ing one map unit to its distance representation 
in real world context.
Orientation indicator: 
This shows the relationship between the 
directions on the map and compass directions in 
real world context. 
Source: 
This identifies where the information or data 
about the map came from.
Climate Projection Maps: 
	üûÇüûÇ	 This guidebook features maps from the Climate Atlas of Canada, an online interactive map that displays climate 
model projections for different time frames and climate change scenarios. The primary source of climate model data 
presented in this Climate Atlas maps is the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium (PCIC) statistically downscaled data. 
 
Climate projection maps allow you to explore what climate models say about future climate across the country and 
specifically where you live. 
Regions across Canada are experiencing impacts from climate change differently. Focusing on 
each region can allow for a more detailed understanding of climate change experiences, and future 
expectations. The following sections provide an overview of the impacts in each region through maps 
found on the Climate Atlas. Each section will provide an explanation of the features of the map and 
an interpretation of the information it communicates. The maps are based on historical data that has 
been used to create future models of projected trends we are seeing with our climate. They show the 
change from the recent past to the near future (i.e. a warming of 4.8¬∞C in Winnipeg from 1976-2005 
to 2051-2080) rather than expected values to make it easier to compare the differences.
 
North: Yukon, NWT, Nunavut
The north is warming faster than the rest of Canada, making it a highly vulnerable 
region for climate change impacts. Loss of winters and ice increases risks of injury/
death and mental health impacts. Foodborne illnesses can also increase with climate 
change in the north as after increased rainfall and snowmelt events there are more 
visits to health clinics with foodborne illness symptoms in the following weeks.2 
Changing climate has impacted sea-ice, wildlife, and vegetation, making it more 
challenging for hunting, fishing, and foraging. Water is also impacted by changes in 
climate as supply and quality become affected. Food and water insecurities can lead 
to poor nutrition, gastrointestinal issues, diabetes, mental health concerns, and other 
negative health effects.3 Climate change is impacting the Inuit way of life as the cold 
and sea ice are at the center of culture, transportation, safety, health, and education.

Global warming has a direct and obvious effect on wildfire risk by raising tem-
peratures, which will dry out vegetation more quickly and more thoroughly. The 
presence of all this dry fuel will allow more fires to start and then burn farther and 
wider. Warmer weather is also causing earlier snowmelt and later fall frosts, which 
are expanding the fire season. More wildfires mean more wildfire smoke, and more 
smoke means more smoke-related health problems. And since smoke travels easily, 
these health problems don‚Äôt only affect people who live in fire-prone areas. Dense 
smoke from wildfires can have fifty times the amount of these tiny particles than 
the World Health Organization‚Äôs guidelines for safe exposure. Emergency room 
visits spike during wildfires as people experience shortness of breath, coughing and 
irritation, worsened asthma, and other breathing problems. 
(2051-2080)
Projected Average Number of Very Hot (30¬∞C) Days
The legend of this map shows varia-
tion in the number of hot days across 
western Canada. A Very Hot Day is a 
day when the temperature rises to at 
least 30¬∞C. The values start at 0 days 
which is indicated by blue on the map 
and increase to 50 days indicated by 
the colour red on the map. Areas on 
the map shaded in yellow or red on

Prairies: AB, SK, MB
The prairies are expected to become a climate change hotspot, seeing some of the 
most extreme changes in climate which will impact the population in various ways. 
Infrastructure is falling behind and no longer compatible with changing climate 
norms as it degrades our roads and buildings including our homes faster, and in turn, 
negatively impacts our safety and wellbeing if not addressed. The prairies can expect 
to see an increase in weather extremes such as record temperatures (both high and 
low), large scale storms, flooding, droughts and forest fires. While the crop season 
lengthening may seem potentially beneficial for economic purposes, this lengthened 
season also increases disease carrying vectors (such as tick- and mosquito-borne 
diseases like west nile and in the prairies as well as an increase in pollens that 
contribute to seasonal allergies. 
(2051-2080)
Projected Change in Annual Number of Extremely Hot Days (+34¬∞C)
The legend of this map shows varia-

prairie provinces. An Extremely Hot 
Day is when the temperature rises to 
at least 34¬∞C. The values on this map 
start at -20 days which is indicated by 
dark blue on the legend and increases 
to +20 days indicated by dark red 
seen on the map. Areas on the map 
shaded in dark red on the map will 
experience up to 20 more extremely 
hot days than the rest of the region.

Communities across Canada know the dangers of heat all too well. In general, a heat 
wave is an extended period of unusually hot weather. While there isn‚Äôt a simple 
commonly accepted scientific definition of a heat wave, we define it as a period of 
at least three days in a row that reaches 30¬∞C or higher. Heat waves are projected to 
become longer, hotter, and more frequent. Heat waves and extreme heat warnings 
have happened frequently in recent summers, including in Winnipeg, Ottawa, Halifax, 
Toronto, and‚Äîmost dramatically‚ÄîMontreal. By choosing to green our cities, promote 
transportation, and shift towards the use of renewables for our energy needs, we can 
create healthier communities with fewer air pollutants, which are also more resilient 
to extreme heat. 
(2051-2080) 
Projected Change in Annual Total Cooling Degree Days
The legend of this map shows 
variation in cooling degree days 
across 
central 
Canada. 
Cooling 
Degree Days (CDD) are equal to the 
number of degrees Celsius a given 
day‚Äôs mean temperature is above 
18¬∞C (For example, if the daily mean 
temperature is 21¬∞C, the CDD value 
for that day is equal to 3¬∞C.) We use 
18¬∞C as the base because this is the 
temperature which air conditioning is 
required to cool buildings. The values 
start at -300 degree days which is 
indicated by dark blue on the legend 
and increase to +300 degree days 
indicated by dark red on the map. 
Areas on the map shaded in dark red 
on the map will experience up to 300 
more cooling degree days.

Atlantic: NB, NS, PEI, NL
Increased precipitation and storm surges are causing an increase in coastal erosion 
and flooding across the region. Climate change is also bringing higher tides and 
stronger winds leaving more and more people shouldering the costs and risks. 
Places like Prince Edward Island are slowly disappearing into the ocean, in large part 
due to climate-change-related sea level rise and powerful storm surges which are 
increasing erosion of the island‚Äôs soft sandstone base. Tides have become noticeably 
different and have destroyed infrastructure including lighthouses, bridges, wharfs, 
streets, boardwalks, water wells, and sewer lines. Heavy investments are needed for 
shoreline protection for those with homes close to the sea in order to minimize the 
need to evacuate. Experiences with and witnessing climate change both dramatically 
or gradually, such as experiencing flooding events and observing coastal erosion, can 
lead to significant mental health impacts.

So far only maps from the Climate Atlas have been presented, however, there are many 
different types of maps that are used to present different types of information. For more localized 
information, you can find maps with even more details. 
These types of maps can inform community-based planning by identifying high risk areas for climate 
health impacts (such as heat illness). This information is important for community planning and policy 
development to protect populations against climate change. In this section, the Urban Heat Island 
effect will be explained featuring maps from Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal, and Winnipeg to highlight 
some maps using historical climate information. 
Note: the maps in this section are showing data values from a particular place and time, compared 
to the above maps which have shown future climate projection of data. While all the maps show the 
urban heat island effect effectively, the maps for each city are not comparable to each other as their 
legends are not compatible and are displaying the urban heat island effect using different variables. 
Urban heat island effect 
Urban heat island eÔ¨Äect

Urban Heat Island
Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect describes the temperature difference between urban 
(or city) areas and nearby rural areas. Our cities are often filled with buildings and 
paved surfaces that trap heat far more effectively than natural ecosystems and rural 
areas. Heat from the sun, known as solar radiation, is absorbed by these man-made 
surfaces (e.g., concrete, brick, asphalt etc.) which later contribute to an increased air 
temperature in urban areas. 
UHI effect is more pronounced in large cities where surfaces can absorb large 
quantities of solar radiation during the day and release the heat at night. Large cities 
can be as much as 12 ¬∞C warmer than their surrounding environments in the evening 
(Health Canada, 2020).
UHI Health Impacts
UHI in Canadian regions
The health risks of extreme heat events are intensified by the UHI effect. Vulnerable 
populations including children, seniors, and people with chronic illness, are at particular 
risk of respiratory difficulties, heat cramps, exhaustion, heat stroke, and heat-related 
mortality (Health Canada, 2020). 
Marginalized people such as socially isolated, homeless or low-income people are also 
vulnerable to extreme heat particularly in regions where air conditioners and mechan-
ical ventilation systems are not available in apartment buildings and homes. 
UHIs are more pronounced in the southern parts of Canada. If greenhouse gas emis-
sions are not reduced, projections for 2051-2080 show that many Canadian cities will 
see at least four times as many +30¬∞C days per year on average as they have in the 
recent past (Climate Atlas of Canada).
Vancouver
In Metropolitan areas of Vancouver, residential, commercial and industrial land uses 
have been replacing natural vegetation covers. As a result, the surface temperature 
is rising. Dense urban areas like Metro Vancouver tend to be hotter than surrounding 
areas due to the UHI effect. 
 
In June of 2021, Metro Vancouver went through a deathly hot heat event that is 
usually temperate in the summer. This record-breaking temperature was caused by 
a ‚ÄúHeat Dome‚Äù where hot air was ‚Äútrapped‚Äù over Western Canada which led to the 
prolonged period of heat. Temperatures in the downtown area exceeded 40¬∞C. The 
BC government reported that the Heat Dome resulted in 619 deaths which is far 
greater than the typical year. Many of the victims were without adequate cooling and 
from vulnerable populations such as senior citizens, low-income people, people with 
pre-existing health issues. (Gov BC, 2022)
 Maximum apparent temperature relative to Vancouver airport 
This is a Map of the Metropolitan 
Area of Vancouver. The map depicts 
the temperature difference between 
the Vancouver Airport and Vancouver 
and the surrounding area. The map 
shows relatively high temperatures 
observed in the urban areas as 
opposed to temperatures found in the 
mountainous areas of West and North 
of Vancouver. Due to the sea breeze 
cooling and ‚Äúwall effect‚Äù, downtown 
Vancouver is relatively cooler (shown 
as dark blue) than other major urban 
areas. The major urban areas in the 
Vancouver Metropolitan area are 
the most densely populated and de-
veloped which contributed to higher 
apparent temperatures (shown as 
dark red) than the surrounding area.

Toronto 
Toronto is one of the fastest growing urban areas in North America. Toronto‚Äôs 
urban atmosphere is strongly affected by the design and density of buildings and by 
man-made changes to the urban environment. The paved surfaces within the City 
of Toronto have been constructed using materials that absorb heat from the sun 
(City of Toronto, 2009).  In Toronto, average temperatures are significantly higher for 
commercial and resource/industrial land uses, and lower for parks and recreational 
areas, as well as water bodies in Toronto (Rinner et. al. 2011).
(July 7, 2010) 
Land Surface Temperature for the Greater Toronto Area 
This is a Map of the Greater Toronto 
Area. The map shows the land 
surface temperatures of the different 
locations in the GTA on July 7, 2010. 
The map reveals that the southern 
parts of GTA have relatively cooler 
temperatures 
than 
other 
urban 
areas due to the Lake Ontario effect. 
While the average temperatures are 
significantly higher for commercial 
and resource/industrial land uses 
(shown as dark red), they are lower 
for parks, recreational land uses 
and water bodies (shown as orange, 
yellow and blue). High proportion of 
built-up surface has contributed to 
higher temperatures observed in the 
commercial and resource/industrial 
land uses of GTA.

Montreal
Montreal is the second most populated city in Canada. It has a humid climate - the 
summers are long and warm; the winters are freezing, snowy, and windy; and it is 
partly cloudy year-round. It is predicted that climate change will make heat waves 
in Montreal more frequent and more intense. The impact of UHI is not equally 
observed across Montreal metropolitan areas. Areas that are characterized by 
large-scale industrial and commercial uses, where dark-surfaced buildings and 
parking lots predominate in Montreal are more likely to experience severe UHIs 
(Chan et. al. 2007). Due to lower population density and a lot of tree cover, the 
western end of the island in Montreal is less vulnerable to urban heat than the 
central portion of the island.
An overlay of temperature and UHI vulnerability in central Montreal
This is a Map of Central Montreal. The 
map shows there are two different 
types of data being displayed. One: 
the temperature difference between a 
specific location on the map and the 
regional average; this is indicated by 
the yellow to red coloured legend. Two: 
the Level of Vulnerability of an Area, 
determined 
by 
socio-demographic 
variables 
(dependent 
population, 
income and people living alone); this 
is indicated by the white to dark grey 
legend. Most parts of central Montreal 
have higher temperatures than the 
regional average. As expected, the 
most severe UHIs in central Montreal 
were located over industrial and 
commercial developments (shown as 
dark red) where a higher proportion of 
the vulnerable populations reside. The 
purpose of overlaying the two types of 
data is to help policy makers determine 
which UHI adaptation strategies make 
sense for different parts of Montreal.

Not all areas of a city, region, or country will be impacted by changes in climate equally. Ad-
ditionally, individuals living in certain areas of a city may be less able to cope with changes due to 
environmental, infrastructural, social and economic reasons.
Maps such as those presented above help create awareness around the most impacted areas and in 
some cases the most vulnerable areas of a city or region. This supports our collective ability to adopt 
adaptive health behaviors on an individual level, and encourage policy and infrastructure changes to 
protect citizens on a regional and community scale.
In the case of Urban Heat Islands, maps like those presented above can support initiatives to combat 
UHI effects on citizens. Sustainable Montreal, Vancouver‚Äôs Street Cooling Network, Winnipeg Urban 
Forest Strategy are great examples of local governments using weather and climate information for 
on the ground action. Redeveloping traditional infrastructures to implement more green spaces and 
increase shaded areas to minimize temperature increases in urban areas.
