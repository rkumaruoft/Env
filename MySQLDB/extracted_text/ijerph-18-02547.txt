Abstract: Climate change represents a serious threat to the health and well-being of populations.
Today, many countries, regions, and cities around the world are implementing policies and strategies
to adapt to climate change and mitigate its effects. A scoping review was performed to identify tools
and methods that help integrate health into climate change adaptation and mitigation policies and
strategies. The literature search includes scientiﬁc and grey literature. The scientiﬁc literature was
conducted using PubMed, Elsevier Embase, and Web of Science databases. A grey literature web
search was performed to complement the results. A total of 35 studies (28 from the scientiﬁc literature
and 7 from the grey literature) were ﬁnally included. A large majority of research articles (24/28)
and almost all reports (6/7) from the grey literature were published after 2010. Results show that
the tools that were found most frequently are the nested models (12/35), health impact assessment
(6/35), vulnerability and adaptation assessment (3/35), conceptual frameworks (3/35), and mixed
methods (3/35). This review shows an increasing interest in the topic of developing tools to better
manage health issues in adaptation and mitigation strategies, with a recent increase in the number of
publications. Additional analyses of tools’ effectiveness should be conducted in further studies.
Keywords: climate change policies; health; tools; adaptation; mitigation
1. Introduction
Climate change poses serious threats to human health and well-being, and it con-
tributes to increasing health inequalities between and within countries. The health impacts
of climate change can be direct (for example, heat waves, extreme weather, and events
such as storms, forest ﬁres, ﬂoods, or drought) or indirect through the effects of climate
change on ecosystems (for example, agricultural losses, changes in disease distribution
patterns, infrastructure disruptions) and on the economy and social structures (for example,
migration and conﬂict) [1–3].
The health effects of climate change can be summarized as follows [4]: heat-related
disorders, respiratory disorders, infectious diseases including vector- and water-borne
diseases, disruptions to food production and mental health disorders. In 2014, World health
Organization (WHO) established that more than 7 million deaths are attributable to air
pollution each year [5]. WHO says climate change is likely to lengthen the transmission
period of some major vector-borne diseases and change their geographic distribution.
Concerning the effects on water-borne diseases, extreme weather events are associated
with an increased risk of surface water contamination by protozoa, such as Giardia cysts
and cryptosporidium oocysts [6]. Finally, the effects of climate change on mental health is
an emerging research topic. These effects will not be felt in the same way by all, but will
disproportionately affect vulnerable groups.

The 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate is seen as an important step towards the global
strategy to reduce the risks of climate change [7]. This agreement called upon countries
to take ambitious adaptation and mitigation actions and ensure their implementation [8].
Following this, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change appealed for actions to
limit the temperature increase to 1.5 ◦C to avoid, among others, signiﬁcant risks to human
health [9].
In this context, cities, and countries are developing policies or strategies to reduce
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (mitigation) and to reduce vulnerability to the effects
of climate change (adaptation). In these policies or strategies, it is necessary that health
impacts be speciﬁcally taken into account in order to achieve both environmental protection
and health promotion. However, health impacts are rarely considered by decision-makers
involved in developing climate change adaptation and mitigation policies [10]. Actually,
some existing tools such as health impact assessment (HIA) can be deployed to help take
health issues into consideration when developing climate change-related policies [10].
However, to date and to our knowledge, there has not been a study that systematically
reviews the tools and methods that were designed to promote or integrate health into
climate change adaptation and mitigation policies or strategies. Selecting such tools and
methods will help in the development of speciﬁc policies and strategies of adaptation and
mitigation that contribute to environmental protection and health promotion.
The purposes of this paper are (1) to conduct a scoping review on climate change
studies that focus on the development of tools and methods that help integrate health
into climate change adaptation and mitigation policies and strategies, and (2) to assess
and select the tools and methods that could be useful for stakeholders and contribute to
protecting and promoting health.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Search Criteria
The literature search focused on the identiﬁcation of all primary studies that aim
to develop methods and tools that integrate health into climate change adaptation and
mitigation policies and strategies published in English and French in scientiﬁc journals and
grey literature between January 1990 and September 2019. The strategy used to conduct this
review, in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines [11], consisted of grouping keywords
that represented (i) the tools (frameworks, methods, etc.), (ii) the climatic events (namely,
climate change and its effects: extreme events, etc.), and (iii) the health-related aspects
(policies or diseases).
The following keywords and combinations were used for the literature search on Pubmed:
(Tool*[TIAB] OR Method[TIAB] OR framework[TIAB] OR “Health Impact Assessment”[MeSH])
AND (“Climate change”[MeSH] OR “Climate change”[TIAB] OR “Climatic change”[TIAB] OR
“Global warming”[TIAB] OR “Greenhouse effect”[MeSH:NoExp] OR “Extreme events”[TIAB])
AND (“Public health”[MeSH:NoExp] OR “Public policy”[MeSH:NoExp] OR “Health plan-
ning”[MeSH:NoExp] OR “Health policy”[MeSH:NoExp] OR “Air pollution” OR “Aeroaller-
gens” OR “Heat waves” OR “Urban heat island effect” OR “Vector-borne diseases” OR “Water-
borne diseases” OR “Water & food supply” OR “Mental health” OR “Environmental refugees”).
The literature search included scientiﬁc and grey literature. Keywords, titles, and
abstracts were searched in PubMed, Elsevier Embase and Web of Science for scientiﬁc
literature. For the grey literature search, Québec University databases, websites of the
World Health Organization (WHO), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC), United Nations (United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC)), World Meteorological Organization,
ministries of health, and ministries of the environment of the United States, Canada
(including state and provincial websites) and France were included. Considering the
considerable number of documents published in the grey literature, the geographical
area was restricted to North America to focus on regional studies and France to include
some relevant studies published in French. There was no restriction on geographical

location for the scientiﬁc literature search. Librarians of Laval University and of the
documentation service of the Institut National de Santé Publique du Québec (INSPQ—
Québec’s Public Health Institute) helped the two ﬁrst authors to design and validate the
literature search strategy.
2.2. Selection Criteria
In the ﬁrst selection stage (exclusion criteria), the abstract of each article was read and
screened. The papers meeting the following criteria were excluded from our review:
•
Studies only presenting the climate change impacts on human health or the health
system in qualitative or quantitative terms.
•
Studies presenting only health impact assessment tools for extreme events (e.g.,
droughts, heatwaves, hurricanes).
•
Studies presenting tools/methods that assess the health beneﬁts of policies/strategies
outside of the scope of climate change adaptation and mitigation.
•
Commentaries, editorials, press releases, speeches, review articles, systematic reviews,
or meta-analyses.
•
Studies not published in English or French.
In a second selection stage (inclusion criteria), papers that remained from the previous
stage were fully screened and then retained according to the following criteria:
•
Studies that clearly present the link between the health issue and a meteorological
factor that could be modiﬁed by climate change.
•
Studies that aim to assess the health effects of a policy/strategy designed to adapt to
or mitigate climate change consequences or reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
•
Studies in which tools/methods are presented and described.
Finally, the references sections of the studies identiﬁed were screened, and relevant
references that were not initially identiﬁed were added.
2.3. Data Extraction
Selected articles were reviewed and documented for the following information: ﬁrst
author, location, date of publication, type of climatic event, exposure measurement, health
outcomes assessed, type and description of mitigation/adaptation strategy, tool name,
origin, objective, and description; and strategy’s health effects measurements.
3. Results
3.1. Description of Studies Selected
3.1.1. Scientiﬁc Literature
The literature search was conducted between 4–7 February 2019; 1718 articles were
identiﬁed.
The ﬁrst selection was based on titles, keywords, and abstracts. It should be noted that
a majority of studies used models to assess the health impacts of different climate change
scenarios without presenting any adaptation or mitigation strategies or tools and methods.
These studies were not retained for in-depth review.
After this first selection, 108 articles were retained. Among these articles, 4 were un-
available, 2 were not in French or English, and 1 was a conference proceeding; these were
consequently removed. Then, a final selection of 101 articles was retained for in-depth review.
3.1.2. Grey Literature
The grey literature review was conducted between 15 February and 15 March 2019.
The ﬁrst selection was made based on titles, keywords, and abstracts. 43 reports were
selected for in-depth review. All studies were in English. Table 1 synthesizes the scientiﬁc
and grey literature search results.
The detailed results of the article and report selection are presented in Figure 1.

3.2. Description of Tools Selected
In the scientiﬁc literature, the studies identiﬁed were conducted mainly in Europe
(11), followed by North America (7) and Asia (6), the remaining ones being conducted in
Australia (1) and New Zealand (1). There was a majority of mitigation studies that focus on
exposure to air pollution (22 of 28), such as particulate matter (PM2.5 and/or PM10). Some
studies focus on exposure to air temperature (n = 3) or urban heat island (n = 2). The main
health indicators used are mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALY), and years of life
lost (YLL). Publication dates were between 2008 and 2018, with a large majority of studies
(24 of 28) published after 2010. Reports found through the grey literature research have
different characteristics than the scientiﬁc literature. The WHO is the main organization
providing tools aiming at including health in adaptation plans and policies (6 of 7 reports).
The reports were published between 2003 and 2018, with almost all after 2010 (6 of 7).

The different tools that were identiﬁed through this literature review were grouped
into four main categories: impact assessment tools, adaptation tools, nested models, and
conceptual frameworks. We also added one additional category that regrouped mixed
methodological approaches. The tools are presented in Table 2.
3.2.1. Impact Assessment Tools
Health Impact Assessment (HIA)
HIA has been deﬁned as “a combination of procedures, methods and tools by which
a policy, programme, or project may be judged as to its potential effects on the health
of a population, and the distribution of those effects within the population” [47]. It
consists of ﬁve steps: (1) Screening: to decide whether or not a proposal needs an HIA;
(2) Scoping: to plan how the HIA should be done; (3) Appraisal: to determine the extent
to which the proposal will affect health, the nature of these effects and which population
groups will be affected by these effects; (4) Recommendations and reporting: to formulate
recommendations for minimizing the negative effects and maximizing the positive effects of
a proposal and to present the results of the HIA in a report; (5) Evaluation and monitoring:
to review the process and its inﬂuence and to monitor what happens once the proposal
is put in place [47]. HIA can be used to analyze the potential health impacts of planned
climate change policies. For example, this tool can be used to assess the impact on health of
climate change mitigation policies at the local level [19,20], to evaluate the climate change
resilience that is incorporated into speciﬁc building projects [24], or to study the health
co-beneﬁts of local climate change mitigation policies in the transport sector [29,34].
Comparative Risk Assessment (CRA)
The World Health Organization (WHO) deﬁned Comparative Risk Assessment (CRA)
as “the systematic evaluation of the changes in population health which result from
modifying the population distribution of exposure to a risk factor or a group of risk
factors” [48]. This method consists of four steps (adapted from [49]): (1) Identifying
health risks associated with exposure; (2) Quantifying the dose-response relationship
for a baseline; (3) Deﬁning future exposure scenarios, and (4) Estimating the burden of
disease that is attributable to a risk factor and the burden that is avoidable by plausible
reductions in the risk factor. CRA has been used to inform climate change mitigation
decisions [49]. For example, it has been used to evaluate the potential health co-beneﬁts
from the establishment of a mass rapid transit project in Kuala Lumpur [25]; to estimate the
health effects of alternative urban land transport scenarios in the context of greenhouse gas
emissions reduction in London and Delhi [38]; and to evaluate the health beneﬁts resulting
from GHG reduction measures in the electricity generation sector in the European Union
(EU), China, and India [28].
Integrated Environmental Health Impact Assessment (IEHIA)
Integrated environmental health impact assessment (IEHIA) is an inclusive approach
for assessing health-related issues associated with environmental changes in order to
consider the complexities, interdependencies, and uncertainties of the real world [14].
As [14] indicated in his study, IEHIA derives from risk assessment, environmental impact
assessment, HIA, and CRA. The IEHIA process involves four steps [14]: (1) Issue framing:
specifying the policy question and developing a conceptual model of the issue to be ad-
dressed; (2) Design: deﬁning a detailed protocol for assessment from the conceptual model
elaborated in the previous step. This will include deﬁning variables, causal relationships,
policy scenarios, models, data, and tools. (3) Execution: modeling and analyzing different
scenarios in terms of exposure and health effects and comparing results of the assessment;
(4) Appraisal: this step involves synthesizing and interpreting the results; evaluating the
outcome actions for the scenarios; and prioritizing the different policy options based on
acceptability or effectiveness.

Environmental Assessments
The aim of environmental assessments is to identify and evaluate the potential conse-
quences on the environment of proposed initiatives. In this context, environmental impact
assessment (EIA) is used to assess the environmental impacts of projects while strategic
environmental assessment (SEA) is applied to policies, plans, or programs. EIA and SEA
processes are quite similar to that of HIA. EIA can be used to determine adaptation and
mitigation measures that are favorable to both the environment and health. This implies
that EIA is conducted in accordance with the European Union Directive (2014/52/EU),
which broadened the scope of assessment by explicitly including human health among the
topics to be addressed in an EIA. Similarly, SEA can be applied to select climate change
adaptation or mitigation options to favor environmental protection and health promotion.
To achieve this, conducting SEA needs to comply with the Directive 2001/42/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council and the SEA protocol to the Espoo Convention,
both requiring human health issues to be taken into account when conducting a SEA.
3.2.2. Adaptation tools
Vulnerability and Adaptation (V&A) Assessment
The WHO Executive Board has developed the Vulnerability and adaptation (V&A)
assessment. This is an approach to understand the current and future health risks related
to climate change and thus develop strategies, policies, and measure to better address
these risks [46]. It is a way to help involve the health sector in climate change adaptation
efforts [50].
The objective of a V&A assessment is to assist decision-makers in understanding
the potential health risks attributable to climate change, in managing these risks, and
in prioritizing policies and programmes to improve population health in a changing
climate. A V&A assessment involves the following ﬁve basic steps: (1) Deﬁne the frame
and scope of the assessment; (2) Conduct the vulnerability and adaptation assessment;
(3) Understand future impacts on health; (4) Prioritize and implement health protection
regarding adaptation to climate change; (5) Establish an iterative process for managing and
monitoring the health risks of climate change [44].
An example of an adaption tool is the Geospatial Emergency Management Support
System (GEMSS), a browser-based tool. GEMSS is a platform developed by the Texas Water
Development Board for integrating data linked to environmental, public health, and policy
indicators related to climate change that can be visualized on the web. It makes it possible
to combine the information in the form of several maps: climatic events (hot days, heavy
rains), mortality, an indicator of vulnerability, climate-related policies. This tool has been
used by the City of Austin to assess climate-health vulnerability [23], including adaptation
and mitigation policies.
Health National Adaptation Process (HNAP)
Developed by the WHO, and based on the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC) climate change agenda, the HNAP’s objective is to ensure
that the iterative management process of health risks resulting from climate change is
integrated into the overall national adaptation plan (NAP) process to achieve the goal of
a healthy population in healthy communities. This process consists of the following four
elements (A–D), which are subdivided into eleven steps:
(A) Lay the groundwork and address gaps in undertaking the HNAP process:
Step 1. Aligning the health adaptation planning process with the national process for
developing a NAP;
Step 2. Taking stock of available information;
Step 3. Identifying approaches to address capacity gaps and weaknesses in HNAP imple-
mentation.
(B) HNAP preparatory elements:
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 2547
10 of 16
Step 4. Conducting a V&A assessment in the health sector, including short- and long-term
needs in the context of development priorities;
Step 5. Examining the implications of climate change for development goals, legislation,
strategies, policies, and plans related to health;
Step 6. Developing a national health adaptation strategy that identiﬁes priority adaptation
options.
(C) Implementation strategies:
Step 7. Elaborating an implementation strategy for operationalizing HNAPs and incorporat-
ing climate change adaptation in health-related planning processes at all levels, including
strengthening the capacity for conducting future HNAPs;
Step 8. Promoting coordination and synergies with the NAP process, especially with sectors
affecting health, and with multilateral environmental agreements.
(D) Reporting, monitoring, and review:
Step 9. Following-up and reviewing the HNAP to assess progress, effectiveness, and gaps;
Step 10. Updating the health component of the NAPs in an iterative manner;
Step 11. Communicating and reporting on the progress and effectiveness of the HNAP
implementation [45].
Economic Assessment Tool—Health and Adaptation Costs
The WHO Regional Ofﬁce for Europe has developed this economic analysis tool to
facilitate the planning of adaptation measures to protect health from the adverse effects
of climate change in the Member States of the European Region. The tool allows users
to estimate health and adaptation costs through three dimensions: (1) the costs related to
damage to health caused by climate change; (2) the costs for adaptation in various sectors
to protect health from such damage and (3) the efﬁciency of adaptation measures including
avoided health costs [42]. The process for assessing health damage and adaptation costs
involves four steps. Step (i) Deﬁne the scope of the assessment, involves deciding on the
type of analysis and specifying the following elements: the level of application of the tool,
the types of disease to be incorporated, the population groups concerned and the period
of the analysis. Step (ii) Methods, data, sources, and analysis, consists of estimating both
health damage costs and adaptation costs. It involves understanding methods, identifying
data and sources, collecting data and inserting them in Excel sheets, conducting a sensitivity
analysis, and analyzing results. Step (iii) Compare damage and adaptation costs, involves
conducting a crude cost-beneﬁt assessment. Step (iv) Present results, considers the target
audience and communication needs.
3.2.3. Nested Models
Nested models have been deﬁned and used to assess the effect on health of greenhouse
gas (GHG) reduction policies in different sectors (transport, energy, industry, or building),
as well as in urban planning (greening policies, in [17]). The energy sector is the most
studied, and nested models have been applied regionally to study the energy sector in
different jurisdictions such as in China [16,28], Europe [28,36], and the United States [15].
The other applications are linked with building emissions [12,35], with public transport
in municipalities [30], or in the cement industry [39]. Finally, some studies assess the
global effects of national or subnational carbon policies [21,33,37]. These type of tools
have the same general structure and consist of a suite of several nested modeling modules:
different mitigation scenarios, a model converting these scenarios into modiﬁcations in
GHG emissions (NOx, CO2, PM, or ozone), a model estimating resulting atmospheric
pollutant concentrations, and ﬁnally a health effects assessment model (i.e., BenMAP, [12]).
These ensembles of models also include some tools already developed, such as the Health
Economic Assessment Tool, developed by the WHO to estimate economic and health
beneﬁts of different policies, or HIA and comparative risk assessment [28]. Nested models
are tools that allow for the prediction of the health impacts of different adaptation or
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 2547
11 of 16
mitigation strategies, although these strategies are mainly hypothetical and based on global
policy objectives (such as the Paris Agreement, for example).
3.2.4. Conceptual Frameworks
This review of the scientiﬁc and grey literature revealed three examples of concep-
tual frameworks of interest as tools for integrating health into climate change adapta-
tion/mitigation policies.
The ﬁrst one is the “Ecosystems enriched” Driver, Pressure, State, Exposure, Effect,
Action (eDPSEEA). Chiabai et al. [18] used the eDPSEEA framework to link climate change,
adaptation actions and health by focusing on the potential health effects of changes in
green spaces. In the proposed eDPSEEA conceptual framework, the driver is climate
change caused by GHG emissions and concentrations. The pressures are represented by
temperature and precipitation patterns, heat, air pollution and extreme weather events.
This contributes to a potential change in the state of the environment, producing alterations
in the functioning of the ecosystem that will then affect the terrestrial distribution of natural
areas, and the regulation of the ecosystem services they provide in the short and long
term. The state is characterized by 6 types of ecosystemic services that can affect the
use or perception of a site through exposure (exposure): urban heat islands effect, air
pollution, water cycle regulation, social environment, recreation, tourism, and microbiome.
Based on a set of contextual factors (socioeconomic status, health status, culture, attitudes,
beliefs, and environmental factors), these changes may have a direct or indirect, positive or
negative impact on health (effect). Any intervention affecting green spaces and population
exposure are considered an action.
The second one is a framework based on risk modelling to evaluate and provide
scientiﬁc assessments of potential climate change adaptation measures. This framework
includes three components: (1) knowledge synthesis; (2) Data storage and access; and (3)
Quantitative risk modeling. Smith et al. [32] applied the framework to assess and compare
the impacts of different adaptation scenarios related to water and food safety.
The third one is Climate, health and equity vulnerability assessment (CHEVA). CHEVA
is a framework for assessing climate and health vulnerability. It includes four components
for which a list of indicators is provided: (1) current and future physical threats of climate
change; (2) population vulnerabilities including social determinants of health; (3) “adaptive
capacity” that reﬂects individual and community-based resources that could counteract the
negative impacts of climate change; and (4) health impact projections. A list of indicators
has been developed to support the use of CHEVA. These indicators cover climate threats,
population vulnerability, adaptive capacity, and resiliency [40].
3.2.5. Other Methodological Approaches
This review of the scientiﬁc and grey literature revealed three examples of method-
ological approaches of interest as tools for integrating health into climate change adapta-
tion/mitigation policies.
Participatory approach
The participatory approach is a way to mobilize and involve the community in the
ﬁght against climate change. This approach has been used to assess the effects on the quality
of life and well-being of residents and users of several pilot projects on the reduction of
urban heat islands in the Montréal area. The assessment was based on four criteria: beauty,
comfort, coolness and security [13].
Mixed Methods
Mixed methods refer to methods that combine different analytical approaches (survey
data, literature review, models, and tools). Haluza et al. [22] applied a mixed-methods
approach in the energy sector to estimate the health impacts of a shift from light fuel to
residential wood-burning in one state in Austria. The methodological approach combines
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 2547
12 of 16
modeling to estimate emissions of air pollutants with reviewing epidemiological studies to
assess health impacts (literature review).
In the transport sector, Lindsay et al. [27] used a combination of survey data and tools
to study the impact of shifting urban transport from cars to bicycles on health, air pollution,
and GHG emissions, in New Zealand. The following data sources and tools were used:
the New Zealand Household Travel Survey, the Vehicle Emissions Prediction Model, the
Health and Pollution in New Zealand study, the WHO Health Economic Assessment Tool
(HEAT), and the Cycling injury/death data and ‘safety in numbers’ [27].
Finally, Smith et al. [31] presented a set of scoping methods to quickly assess co-
beneﬁts for interventions in the energy sector.
4. Discussion
The tools that were found most frequently in this scoping review are the nested models
(12 of 35); these were applied to assess the health impacts of mitigation options on different
sectors such as transport, energy, industry, or building, as well as in urban planning. Health
Impact Assessments were also frequently identiﬁed (6/35) and were applied to speciﬁc
building projects, alternative transportation options or in urban planning.
Among the identiﬁed tools, several have a similar structure. For example, the family
of impact assessments such as EIA, SEA, and HIA comprises similar tools to aid decision-
making processes, but the tools differ in the scope of impacts analyzed. Environmental
assessments (EIA and SEA) focus on the impacts of proposed policies or projects on
the physical environment, while HIA analyzes the consequences of these policies and
projects on physical, social, and economic determinants of health. EIA, SEA, and HIA are
prospective tools based on methodologies that attempt to integrate the concerns of different
stakeholders’ groups into the assessment process [47]. This means that an interdisciplinary
and intersectoral scientiﬁc approach could be needed to evaluate the public health beneﬁts
of climate change adaptation or mitigation policies. Indeed, HIA is a combination of
methods and tools. One of the differences between HIA and CRA is the object of analysis,
which is a policy, program or project in the case of an HIA and a substance or exposure in
the case of a CRA. A CRA can be integrated into an HIA framework.
The tools used could be different depending on the strategy chosen to face climate
change consequences (adaptation or mitigation). Some tools tend to be dedicated to
adaptation contexts such as V&A assessment, Health National Adaptation Process, or
health and adaptation costs. In contrast, nested models are also almost exclusively (11/12
studies) used to assess mitigation scenarios in prospective studies.
The scale of application also differs among the different tools identiﬁed. Nested
models are adaptable to varying scales of study, and this ﬂexibility means that they are
applied to both city, national-level, or supranational contexts, depending on the policy.
Some tools such as vulnerability assessment, also allow an application at different scales.
Some methods, such as HIA, are applied mostly at a local scale (city- or project-level).
However, it should be noted that these tools are not designed speciﬁcally to be applied at a
particular scale and might also be applied at other scales. It is worth noting that studies
identiﬁed in the scientiﬁc literature are mainly conducted in wealthier nations and regions,
in Europe, North America, and Asia. Few case studies have been conducted in developing
countries. Some studies were conducted in India, Malaysia, and Thailand, but no studies
were reported in Africa, the Middle East or in South America. However, these regions may
suffer greater mortality risks due to climate change [51,52].
The robustness of data is also of primary importance to provide robust tools. Practition-
ers need to rely on robust data from health networks and emissions monitoring networks
in place. Quantiﬁcation of health impacts is often a difﬁcult exercise due to the availability
of valid data and rigorous analytical methods for predicting these impacts [53,54].
Some limitations in the application of these tools are linked with the accessibility
of data. The use of impact assessment tools, adaptation tools, and nested models all
depend upon access to a lot of different data relating to impact quantiﬁcation, potential
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 2547
13 of 16
health impacts or scenario assessment, as well as data on climatic or health conditions or
socioeconomic proﬁles of the population.
This review shows that in recent years there has been increased interest in the topic of
developing tools to better manage health issues in adaptation and mitigation strategies.
This subject emerged as a scientiﬁc topic at the end of the 2000s, with an increase in the
number of publications in recent years. Nested models have also been increasingly used
since 2014; these complete the other groups of tools that emerged in the 2000s.
In a context of a health crisis such as the Covid-19 pandemic, which has led to the
lockdown of billions of people, to dramatic decreases in transport emissions and industrial
emissions in the main GHG emitting countries [55–57], the methods identiﬁed in this
review could provide an interesting basis for assessing the health co-beneﬁts of such rapid
mitigation measures. Some of the methods identiﬁed, such as nested models could allow
for the assessment of the short-term health effects of a decrease in transport emissions in a
region (such as in Lombardy, Catalunya, or in the greater Paris region) or across a greater
geographical area such as a country (e.g., China, [58]) or an entire continent. From another
perspective, some actions taken during the COVID-19 pandemic could be favorable to the
climate. In this context, some tools identiﬁed in this work, such as environmental impact
assessment and HIA, can help optimize the health beneﬁts of these actions before their
implementation with a view to combating climate change.
This literature review, as is often the case in bibliographic research, has some lim-
itations. Despite a rigorous methodological approach, it is possible that some relevant
articles were not identiﬁed. There are three reasons for this. The ﬁrst is that the keywords
used for the research may not have been included in the titles or abstracts of relevant
documents. The second is the exclusion of publications in languages other than French and
English. Finally, the third is that this literature review focused only on the documentation
available online and thus excluded all other documents that were not published online.
T One additional limitation is that the choice of keywords used in the literature search
could have disproportionately favored some tools in the results, as for example, the term
“health impact assessment” that was included in the keywords search. However, this
keyword was selected in keeping with this review’s primary aim: to identify the tools
that assess the health impacts of climate change. Removing this term from the literature
review would have also led to missing some articles directly related to the objectives of this
review. One limitation is that no analysis of the effectiveness of the tools identiﬁed was
made, as that was judged to be beyond the scope of this review. Despite these limitations,
we believe that this work helps to highlight several existing tools and methods that enable
the integration of health concerns into the development of climate change adaptation and
mitigation policies and strategies.
As suggested, an analysis of the effectiveness of these tools should be conducted in
further studies. Moreover, the transferability of the tools identiﬁed in different jurisdictions
(federal, provincial, or municipal) should be made in order to better identify the facilitating
factors and the barriers for their application (such as, for example, political commitment,
working in silos, knowledge, and skills). Uncertainties in climate change projections are
linked with climate feedback, regional changes, or the strength of equilibrium climate
sensitivity [59]. A better estimation and reduction of these uncertainties (and those linked
with the quantiﬁcation of health impacts) is also needed to reﬁne and better approximate
the quantiﬁcation of health impacts.
5. Conclusions
Different countries, regions and cities around the world are implementing policies
and strategies to adapt to climate change and mitigate its effects. This scoping review
allowed for the identiﬁcation of a total of 35 studies (28 from the scientiﬁc literature and 7
from the grey literature) that present tools and methods that were designed to promote or
integrate health into climate change adaptation and mitigation policies or strategies. An
increasing interest in this topic in the scientiﬁc literature was also noted since the beginning
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 2547
14 of 16
of the 2010s. The methods and tools that were most frequently found in this review are the
nested models (12 of 35) and HIA (6 of 35) that were used to assess the health impacts of
mitigation and adaptation options on different sectors such as transport, energy, industry or
building, as well as in urban planning. Further studies should include additional analyses
of the effectiveness of the tools and methods identiﬁed, as well as a quantiﬁcation of the
uncertainties linked with climate change projections and health impact estimates.
