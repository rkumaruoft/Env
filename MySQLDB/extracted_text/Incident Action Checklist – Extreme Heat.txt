Incident Action Checklist – Extreme Heat
Extreme Heat Impacts on Water and Wastewater Utilities
An extreme heat event or heat wave is a period of abnormally hot and/or humid weather, typically lasting two 
or more days. Though temperature thresholds that mark extreme heat events can vary by geographic location, 
these events can be extremely dangerous; in fact, heat is the top weather-related killer in the United States. 
Extreme heat can impact employee operations and power delivery, and can cause the public to seek relief. 
Extreme heat or heat wave impacts to water and wastewater utilities may include, but are not limited to:
•
Loss of power and communication lines due to increased 
electricity demand
•
Increased water demand due to higher temperatures, 
which could result in shortages
•
Changes in source water quality related to increased water 
temperatures due to both higher air temperatures and
higher temperatures of industrial discharges (e.g., cooling
water used at power plants)
•
Safety risks for staff working in the field for prolonged 
periods of time
The following sections outline actions water and wastewater utilities can take to prepare for, respond to and 
recover from an extreme heat event. (Because extreme heat events and drought often coincide, please see 
the Drought Incident Action Checklist for drought-specific activities.) 
Example of Water Sector Impacts and Response to an Extreme Heat 
Event
Wisconsin Utility Anticipates Potential Water Shortages
Madison, Wisconsin, experienced a heat wave in June and July 2012, which resulted in an increase in water 
use. Due to the high temperatures and drier-than-normal conditions, the Madison Water Utility anticipated a 
potential water shortage and issued advisories for their customers to stay hydrated, but otherwise conserve 
water during the heat wave to reduce the risk of a shortage. 
The utility advised customers to water their gardens and lawns only when needed, repair leaks in their 
homes, install water-saving devices such as aerators and flow regulators and use the most efficient setting for 
dishwashers and washing machines.

The actions in this checklist are divided up into three “rip & run” sections and are examples of activities that water and 
wastewater utilities can take to: prepare for, respond to and recover from extreme heat. For on-the-go convenience, you 
can also populate the “My Contacts” section with critical information that your utility may need during an incident.
1 of 7
Planning_________________________
	Actively monitor weather conditions and 
extended weather forecasts.
	Review and update your utility’s emergency 
response plan (ERP) and ensure all emergency 
contacts are current.
	Conduct briefings, training and exercises to 
ensure utility staff is aware of all preparedness, 
response and recovery procedures.
	Identify priority water customers (e.g., hospitals), 
obtain their contact information, map their 
locations and develop a plan to restore those 
customers first, in case of water service 
disruptions.
	Monitor water supply and calculate how long 
water could be provided if increased demand 
persists.
•  Actively monitor surface water levels and 
groundwater well levels, and identify the 
sustainable withdrawal rate for each
	Establish “triggers” or “threshold values” for 
extreme heat conditions that will require action 
(e.g., if reservoirs fall below a certain level, 
if water quality measures exceed a specified 
level). 
	Develop an emergency drinking water supply 
plan and establish response partner contacts 
(potentially through your local emergency 
management agency [EMA] or mutual aid 
network) to discuss procedures, which may 
include bulk water hauling, mobile treatment 
units or temporary supply lines, as well as 
storage and distribution.  
	Conduct a hazard vulnerability analysis in which 
you review historical records to understand 
the past frequency and intensity of extreme 
heat events and how your utility may have 
been impacted. Consider taking actions to 
mitigate drought impacts to the utility, including 
those provided in the “Actions to Recover from 
Extreme Heat Events: Mitigation” section. 
	Complete pre-disaster activities to help apply for 
federal disaster funding (e.g., contact state/local 
officials with connections to funding, set up a 
system to document damage and costs). 
	Determine if technical assistance programs 
are offered by the state, including wellhead 
protection programs for community water 
supplies. Assistance may involve:
•  Development and utilization of predictive 
water use models that assist in locating 
water for communities
•  Development and utilization of formal 
groundwater monitoring networks
Coordination_ ____________________
	Join your state’s Water/Wastewater Agency 
Response Network (WARN) or other local 
mutual aid network.
	Coordinate with WARN members and other 
neighboring utilities to discuss:
•  Outlining response activities, roles and 
responsibilities and mutual aid procedures 
(e.g., how to request and offer assistance)
•  Conducting joint tabletop or full-scale 
exercises 
•  Obtaining resources and assistance, such as 
equipment, personnel, technical support or 
water
•  Establishing interconnections between 
systems and agreements with necessary 
approvals to activate this alternate source. 
Equipment, pumping rates and demand on 
the water sources need to be considered and 
addressed in the design and operations
•  Establishing communication protocols and 
equipment to reduce misunderstandings 
during the incident
Actions to Prepare for Extreme Heat
2 of 7
	Coordinate with other key response partners, 
such as your local EMA, to identify potential 
points of distribution for the delivery of 
emergency water supply (e.g., bottled water) 
to the public, as well as who is responsible for 
distributing the water.
	Understand how the local and utility emergency 
operations center (EOC) will be activated and 
what your utility may be called on to do, as 
well as how local emergency responders and 
the local EOC can support your utility during a 
response. If your utility has assets outside of the 
county EMA’s jurisdiction, consider coordination 
or preparedness efforts that should be done in 
those areas.
	Sign up for mobile and/or email alerts from your 
local EMA, if available.
Communication with Customers_____
 Communicate with critical customers, high water 
users and agricultural customers to discuss 
seasonal demand, conservation measures and 
irrigation practices. 
	Review public information protocols with local 
EMA and public health/primacy agencies. 
These protocols should include developing 
water advisory messages (e.g., boil water, 
warnings that service disruptions are likely) and 
distributing them to customers using appropriate 
mechanisms, such as reverse 911.
	Develop outreach materials for the public 
(e.g., radio, social media, and bill stuffers) 
that encourage personal hydration, as well as 
materials that clearly describe conservation 
measures and activities.           
• Become a WaterSense partner and download 
free water efficiency outreach materials to 
distribute to your customers.
Facility and Service Area_ __________
 Document pumping requirements and storage 
capabilities, as well as critical treatment 
components and parameters.
	Maintain a full storage tank to assist with 
demand should there be a source loss, power 
failure or fire suppression needs.
 In the case of a power loss, ensure personnel 
are trained to shut down and start up the system 
manually.
Power, Energy and Fuel____________
	Evaluate condition of electrical panels to accept 
generators; inspect connections and switches.
	Document power requirements of the facility.
 Confirm and document generator connection 
type, capacity load and fuel consumption. Test 
regularly, exercise under load and service 
backup generators.  
 Collaborate with your local power provider and 
EOC to ensure that your water utility is on the 
critical facilities list for priority electrical power 
restoration, generators and emergency fuel.
Actions to Prepare for Extreme Heat (continued)

Planning_________________________
	Work with your regulatory agency to assist 
in identifying and approving alternate water 
supplies and operational or design changes.
 Monitor wildfire conditions and outlooks. See 
the Wildfire Incident Action Checklist for more 
information on how to prepare for wildfires.
Coordination_ ____________________
 Communicate with public health officials, local 
EMA and other partners to:
•
Discuss issues related to extreme heat 
emergencies and public health activities
•
Evaluate conditions and water use 
requirements related to HVAC systems 
required by hospitals and identify alternative 
means to supply water if the utility is unable
to meet demand
 If needed, request or offer assistance (e.g., 
water buffalos, water sampling teams, 
generators) through mutual aid networks, such 
as WARN.
	Work with your local EMA to establish cooling 
centers for the public.
Communication with Customers_____          
Implement mandatory or voluntary water 
conservation efforts and conduct regular 
outreach to customers.
 If water shortages or outages occur, notify 
customers of water advisories; consider 
collaborating with local media (television, radio, 
newspaper, etc.) to distribute the message. If 
emergency water is being supplied, provide 
information on the distribution locations.
Facility and Service Area_ __________
 Utilize pre-established emergency connections 
or set up temporary connections to nearby 
communities, as needed. Alternatively, implement 
plans to draw emergency water from pre-
determined tanks or hydrants. Notify employees 
of the activated sites.
 Monitor source water quantity (e.g., reservoir 
levels, stream flows, well levels, groundwater 
levels).
 Monitor water quality and adjust treatment, 
if necessary, as reduced water quantity and 
increased temperatures could change water 
chemistry.
	Notify regulatory/primacy agency if operations 
and/or water quality or quantity are affected.
 If possible, run pumps during off-peak hours when 
there is less demand on power and less risk of a 
power failure. 
Actions to Respond to Extreme Heat
Notes:
4 of 7
Documentation and Reporting________
	Document all damage assessments, mutual aid 
requests, emergency repair work, equipment 
used, purchases made, staff hours worked and 
contractors used during the response to assist 
in requesting reimbursement and applying for 
disaster funds. When possible, take photographs 
that illustrate the extreme heat conditions (with 
time and date stamp). Proper documentation is 
critical to requesting reimbursement.
Personnel_________________________
 Ensure all staff working in the field are aware 
of the risks of extreme heat and that they take 
actions to avoid health risks and over-exertion 
(e.g., hydration, sunscreen, taking frequent breaks 
in the shade, wearing appropriate clothing).
Power, Energy and Fuel____________
	Fill vehicles and fuel tanks to full capacity; ensure 
that you have the ability to manually pump gas in 
the event of a power outage.
	Use backup generators, as needed, to supply 
power to system components.
	Monitor and plan for additional fuel needs 
in advance; coordinate fuel deliveries to the 
generators.
	Maintain contact with electric provider for power 
outage duration estimates.
