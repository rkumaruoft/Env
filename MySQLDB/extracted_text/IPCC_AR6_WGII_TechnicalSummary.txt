Technical Summary

Introduction
TS.A.1	
Background
This technical summary complements and expands the key findings of 
the Working Group (WG) II contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report 
(AR6) presented in the Summary for Policymakers and covers literature 
accepted for publication by 1 September 2021. It provides technical 
understanding and is developed from the key findings of chapters and 
cross-chapter papers (CCPs) as presented in their executive summaries 
and integrates across them. The report builds on the WGII contribution 
to the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the IPCC and three special 
reports of the AR6 cycle providing new knowledge and updates. The 
three special reports are the Special Report on Global Warming of 
1.5°C (2018), an IPCC special report on the impacts of global warming 
of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse 
gas emission pathways in the context of strengthening the global 
response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development 
and efforts to eradicate poverty; the Special Report on Climate Change 
and Land, which is concerned with climate change, desertification, 
land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and 
greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems (2019); and the Special 
Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (2019). 
The WGII assessment integrates with the WGI (the physical science 
basis) and WGIII (mitigation of climate change) contributions and 
contributes to the Synthesis Report.
The contribution of Working Group II (WGII) to the Sixth Assessment 
Report (AR6) of the IPCC summarizes the current understanding of 
observed climate change impacts on ecosystems, human societies 
and their cities, settlements, infrastructures and industrial systems, as 
well as vulnerabilities and future risks tied to different socioeconomic 
development pathways. The report is set against a current backdrop 
of rapid urbanisation, biodiversity loss, a growing and dynamic global 
human population, significant inequality and demands for social justice, 
rapid technological change, continuing poverty, land degradation 
and food insecurity, and risks from shocks such as pandemics and 
increasingly intense extreme events from ongoing climate change. 
The report also assesses existing adaptations and their feasibility and 
limits. Any success of adaptation is dependent on the achieved level of 
mitigation and the transformation of global and regional sustainability 
outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Accordingly, 
adaptation is essential for climate resilient development. Compared to 
earlier IPCC assessments, this report integrates more strongly across 
the natural, social and economic sciences, highlighting the role of social 
justice and diverse forms of knowledge, such as Indigenous knowledge 
and local knowledge, and reflects the increasing importance of urgent 
and immediate action to address climate risk. {1.1.1}
Since AR5, climate action has increased at all levels of governance, 
including among non-governmental organisations, small and large 
enterprises, and citizens. Two international agreements—the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Paris 
Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—
jointly provide overarching goals for climate action. The 2030 Agenda 
for Sustainable Development, adopted in 2015 by UN member states, 
sets out 17 SDGs, frames policies for achieving a more sustainable 
future and aligns efforts globally to prioritise ending extreme poverty, 
protect the planet and promote more peaceful, prosperous and 
inclusive societies. Since AR5, several new international conventions 
have identified climate change adaptation and risk reduction as 
important global priorities for sustainable development, including the 
Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR), the finance-
oriented Addis Ababa Action Agenda, and the New Urban Agenda. The 
Convention on Biological Diversity and its Aichi targets recognise that 
biodiversity is affected by climate change, with negative consequences 
for human well-being, but biodiversity, through ecosystem services, 
contributes to both climate change mitigation and adaptation. {1.1.2}
TS.A.2	
TS Structure of the Report
This technical summary is structured in five sections: Section A 
‘Introduction’, Section B ‘Observed Impacts and Adaptation’, Section 
C ‘Projected Impacts and Risks’, Section D ‘Contribution of Adaptation 
to Solutions’ and Section E ‘Climate Resilient Development’. Each 
section includes several headline statements followed by several 
bullet points providing details about the underlying assessments. All 
findings and figures are supported by and traceable to the underlying 
report, indicated by references {in curly brackets} to relevant sections 
of chapters and cross-chapter papers.
Confidence in the key findings of this assessment is communicated 
using the IPCC calibrated uncertainty language. This calibrated 
language is designed to consistently evaluate and communicate 
uncertainties that arise from incomplete knowledge due to a lack 
of information or from disagreement about what is known or even 
knowable. The IPCC calibrated language uses qualitative expressions 
of confidence based on the robustness of evidence for a finding 
and (where possible) uses quantitative expressions to describe the 
likelihood of a finding. Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of 
underlying evidence and agreement. A level of confidence is expressed 
using five qualifiers, very low, low, medium, high and very high, and 
typeset in italics, for example, medium confidence. The following terms 
have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or 
a result: virtually certain 99–100% probability, very likely 90–100%, 
likely 66–100%, as likely as not 33–66%, unlikely 0–33%, very unlikely 
0–10%, exceptionally unlikely 0–1%. Assessed likelihood is typeset in 
italics, for example, very likely. This is consistent with AR5 and the 
other AR6 reports. (Figure TS.1) {1.3.4}
TS.A.3	
Key Developments Since AR5
Interdisciplinary climate change assessment, which has played a 
prominent role in science–society interactions on the climate issue 
since 1988, has advanced in important ways since AR5. Building on 
a substantially expanded scientific and technical literature, this AR6 
report emphasises at least three broad themes. (Figure TS.2) {1.1.4}
First, this AR6 assessment has an increased focus on risk and solution 
frameworks. The risk framing can move beyond the limits of single 
best estimates or most likely outcomes and include high-consequence 
outcomes for which probabilities are low or in some cases unknown. 
41
Technical Summary
TS
In this report, the risk framing for the first time spans all three 
working groups, includes risks from the responses to climate change, 
considers dynamic and cascading consequences, describes with more 
geographic detail risks to people and ecosystems, and assesses such 
risks over a range of scenarios. The focus on solutions encompasses the 
interconnections among climate responses, sustainable development 
and transformation—and the implications for governance across scales 
within the public and private sectors. The assessment therefore includes 
climate-related decision-making and risk management, climate resilient 
development pathways, implementation and evaluation of adaptation, 
and also limits to adaptation and loss and damage. Specific focal 
areas reflect contexts increasingly important for the implementation of 
responses, such as cities. {1.3.1, 1.4.4, 16, 17, 18}
Second, emphases on social justice, equity and different forms of 
expertise have emerged. As climate change impacts and implemented 
responses increasingly occur, there is heightened awareness of the 
ways that climate responses interact with issues of justice and social 
progress. In this report, expanded attention is given to inequity in 
climate vulnerability and responses, the role of power and participation 
in processes of implementation, unequal and differential impacts 
and climate justice. The historic focus on scientific literature has also 
been increasingly accompanied by attention to and incorporation of 
Indigenous knowledge, local knowledge, and associated scholars. 
{1.3.2, 1.4.1, 17.5.2}
Third, AR6 has a more extensive focus on the role of transformation in 
meeting societal goals. {1.5}
The following overarching conclusions have been derived from the 
whole of the assessment of WGII:
i)	 The magnitude of observed impacts and projected climate risks 
indicate the scale of decision-making, funding and investment 
needed over the next decade if climate resilient development is to 
be achieved.

(b) Options to reduce climate risks and establish resilience
Figure TS.2 |  This report has a strong focus on the interactions among the coupled systems climate, ecosystems (including their biodiversity) and human society. These interactions are the basis of emerging risks from 
climate change, ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss and, at the same time, offer opportunities for the future.
(a)  Human society causes climate change. Climate change, through hazards, exposure and vulnerability generates impacts and risks that can surpass limits to adaptation and result in losses and damages. Human society can adapt to, 
maladapt and mitigate climate change, ecosystems can adapt and mitigate within limits. Ecosystems and their biodiversity provision livelihoods and ecosystem services. Human society impacts ecosystems and can restore and conserve them.
(b)  Meeting the objectives of climate resilient development thereby supporting human, ecosystem and planetary health, as well as human well-being, requires society and ecosystems to move over (transition) to a more resilient state. 
The recognition of climate risks can strengthen adaptation and mitigation actions and transitions that reduce risks. Taking action is enabled by governance, finance, knowledge and capacity building, technology and catalysing conditions. 
Transformation entails system transitions strengthening the resilience of ecosystems and society (Section E). In a) arrow colours represent principle human society interactions (blue), ecosystem (including biodiversity) interactions (green) and 
the impacts of climate change and human activities, including losses and damages, under continued climate change (red). In b) arrow colours represent human system interactions (blue), ecosystem (including biodiversity) interactions (green) 
and reduced impacts from climate change and human activities (grey). {1.2, Figure 1.2}

Technical Summary
TS
ii)	 Since AR5, climate risks are appearing faster and will get more 
severe sooner (high confidence). Impacts cascade through natural 
and human systems, often compounding with the impacts from 
other human activities. Feasible, integrated mitigation and 
adaptation solutions can be tailored to specific locations and 
monitored for their effectiveness while avoiding conflict with 
sustainable development objectives and managing risks and trade-
offs (high confidence).
iii)	 Available evidence on projected climate risks indicates that 
opportunities for adaptation to many climate risks will likely 
become constrained and have reduced effectiveness should 
1.5°C global warming be exceeded and that, for many locations 
on Earth, capacity for adaptation is already significantly limited. 
The maintenance and recovery of natural and human systems will 
require the achievement of mitigation targets.
Box TS.1 | Core Concepts of the Report
This box provides an overview of key definitions and concepts relevant to the WGII AR6 assessment, with a focus on those updated or 
new since AR5.
Risk in this report is defined as the potential for adverse consequences for human or ecological systems, recognising the diversity of 
values and objectives associated with such systems. In the context of climate change impacts, risks result from dynamic interactions 
between climate-related hazards with the exposure and vulnerability of the affected human or ecological system. In the context of 
climate change responses, risks result from the potential for such responses not to achieve the intended objective(s) or from potential 
trade-offs or negative side-effects. Risk management is defined as plans, actions, strategies or policies to reduce the likelihood and/or 
magnitude of adverse potential consequences, based on assessed or perceived risks. {1.2.1, Annex II: Glossary}
Vulnerability is a component of risk, but also, independently, an important focus. Vulnerability in this report is defined as the propensity 
or predisposition to be adversely affected and encompasses a variety of concepts and elements, including sensitivity or susceptibility 
to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt (Annex II: Glossary). Over the past several decades, approaches to analysing and 
assessing vulnerability have evolved. An early emphasis on top-down, biophysical evaluation of vulnerability included—and often started 
with—exposure to climate hazards in assessing vulnerability. From this starting point, attention to bottom-up, social and contextual 
determinants of vulnerability, which often differ, has emerged, although this approach is incompletely applied or integrated across 
contexts. Vulnerability is now widely understood to differ within communities and across societies, also changing through time. In WGII 
AR6, assessment of the vulnerability of people and ecosystems encompasses the differing approaches that exist within the literature, 
both critiquing and harmonising them based on available evidence. In this context, exposure is defined as the presence of people; 
livelihoods; species or ecosystems; environmental functions, services and resources; infrastructure; or economic, social or cultural assets 
in places and settings that could be adversely affected. Potentially affected places and settings can be defined geographically, as well as 
more dynamically, for example through transmission or interconnections through markets or flows of people. {1.2.1, Annex II: Glossary}
Adaptation in this report is defined, in human systems, as the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects in 
order to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In natural systems, adaptation is the process of adjustment to actual climate 
and its effects; human intervention may facilitate this (see Annex II: Glossary). Adaptation planning in human systems generally entails 
a process of iterative risk management. Different types of adaptation have been distinguished, including anticipatory versus reactive, 
autonomous versus planned and incremental versus transformational adaptation. Adaptation is often seen as having five general stages: 
(a) awareness, (b) assessment, (c) planning, (d) implementation and (e) monitoring and evaluation. Government, non-government, and 
private-sector actors have adopted a wide variety of specific approaches to adaptation that, to varying degrees, conform to these five 
general stages. Adaptation in natural systems includes autonomous adjustments through ecological and evolutionary processes. It also 
involves the use of nature through ecosystem-based adaptation. The role of species, biodiversity and ecosystems in such adaptation 
options can range from the rehabilitation or restoration of ecosystems (e.g., wetlands or mangroves) to hybrid combinations of so-
called green and grey infrastructure (e.g., horizontal levees). The WGII AR6 emphasises the assessment of observed adaptation-related 
responses to climate change, governance and decision-making in adaptation and the role of adaptation in reducing key risks and global-
scale reasons for concern, as well as limits to such adaptation. {1.2.1, 17.4}
Resilience in this report is defined as the capacity of social, economic and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or trend 
or disturbance, responding or reorganising in ways that maintain their essential function, identity and structure while also maintaining 
the capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation. Resilience is an entry point commonly used, although under a wide spectrum 
of meanings. Resilience as a system trait overlaps with concepts of vulnerability, adaptive capacity and, thus, risk, and resilience as a 
strategy overlaps with risk management, adaptation and transformation. Implemented adaptation is often organised around resilience 
as bouncing back and returning to a previous state after a disturbance. {1.2.1, Annex II: Glossary}

Box TS.2 | AR6 Climate Dimensions, Global Warming Levels and Reference Periods
Assessments of climate risks consider possible future climate change, societal development and responses. This report assesses literature 
including that based on climate model simulations that are part of the fifth and sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 
(CMIP5, CMIP6) of the World Climate Research Programme. Future projections are driven by emissions and/or concentrations from 
illustrative Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)1 and Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs)2 scenarios, respectively3. Climate 
impacts literature is based primarily on climate projections assessed in AR5 or earlier, or assumed global warming levels, though some 
recent impacts literature uses newer projections based on the CMIP6 exercise. Given differences in the impacts literature regarding 
socioeconomic details and assumptions, WGII chapters contextualize impacts with respect to exposure, vulnerability and adaptation as 
appropriate for their literature, this includes assessments regarding sustainable development and climate resilient development. There are 
many emissions and socioeconomic pathways that are consistent with a given global warming outcome. These represent a broad range 
of possibilities as available in the literature assessed that affect future climate change exposure and vulnerability. Where available, WGII 
also assesses literature that is based on an integrative SSP-RCP framework where climate projections obtained under the RCP scenarios 
are analysed against the backdrop of various illustrative SSPs2. The WGII assessment combines multiple lines of evidence including 
impacts modelling driven by climate projections, observations, and process understanding. {1.2, 16.5, 18.2, CCB CLIMATE, WGI AR6 
SPM.C, WGI AR6 Box SPM.1, WGI AR6 1.6, WGI AR6 12, WGI AR5}
A common set of reference years and time periods are adopted for assessing climate change and its impacts and risks: the reference 
period 1850–1900 approximates pre-industrial global surface temperature, and three future reference periods cover the near-term 
(2021–2040), mid-term (2041–2060) and long-term (2081–2100). {CCB CLIMATE}
Common levels of global warming relative to 1850–1900 are used to contextualize and facilitate analysis, synthesis and communication 
of assessed past, present and future climate change impacts and risks considering multiple lines of evidence. Robust geographical 
patterns of many variables can be identified at a given level of global warming, common to all scenarios considered and independent of 
timing when the global warming level is reached. {16.5, CCB CLIMATE, WGI AR6 Box SPM.1, WGI AR6 4.2, WGI AR6 CCB11.1}
WGI assessed increase in global surface temperature is 1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]4 °C in 2011–2020 above 1850–1900. The estimated increase 
in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C).5 Considering 
all five illustrative scenarios assessed by WGI, there is at least a greater than 50% likelihood that global warming will reach or exceed 
1.5°C in the near-term, even for the very low greenhouse gas emissions scenario6. {WGI AR6 SPM A1.2, WGI AR6 SPM B1.3, WGI AR6

RCP-based scenarios are referred to as RCPy, where ‘y’ refers to the level of radiative forcing (in watts per square meter, or W m-2) resulting from the scenario in the year 2100.
2	
SSP-based scenarios are referred to as SSPx-y, where ‘SSPx’ refers to the Shared Socio-economic Pathway describing the socio-economic trends underlying the scenarios, and ‘y’ refers to the level of 
radiative forcing (in watts per square meter, or W m-2) resulting from the scenario in the year 2100.

IPCC is neutral with regard to the assumptions underlying the SSPs, which do not cover all possible scenarios. Alternative scenarios may be considered or developed.

In the WGI report, square brackets [x to y] are used to provide the assessed very likely range, or 90% interval.
5	
Since AR5, methodological advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5.
6	
Global warming of 1.5°C relative to 1850–1900 would be exceeded during the 21st century under the intermediate, high and very high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios considered in this report 
(SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, respectively). Under the five illustrative scenarios, in the near term (2021–2040), the 1.5°C global warming level is very likely to be exceeded under the very high 
greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5), likely to be exceeded under the intermediate and high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0), more likely than not to be exceeded 
under the low greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6) and more likely than not to be reached under the very low greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9). Furthermore, for the very low 
greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9), it is more likely than not that global surface temperature would decline back to below 1.5°C toward the end of the 21st century, with a temporary 
overshoot of no more than 0.1°C above 1.5°C global warming.

Observed Impacts
This section reports on how worldwide climate change is increasingly 
affecting marine, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems and ecosystem 
services, water and food security, settlements and infrastructure, 
health and well-being, and economies and culture, especially through 
compound stresses and events. It refers to the increasing confidence 
since AR5 that detected impacts are attributable to climate change, 
including the impacts of extreme events. It illustrates how compound 
hazards have become more frequent in all world regions, with 
widespread consequences. Regional increases in temperature, aridity 
and drought have increased the frequency and intensity of fire. The 
interaction between fire, land use change, particularly deforestation, 
and climate change, is directly impacting human health, ecosystem 
functioning, forest structure, food security and the livelihoods of 
resource-dependent communities.

Technical Summary
TS
Climate change impacts are concurrent and interact with other 
significant societal changes that have become more salient since AR5, 
including a growing and urbanising global population; significant 
inequality and demands for social justice; rapid technological change; 
continuing poverty, land and water degradation, biodiversity loss; food 
insecurity; and a global pandemic.
Ecosystems and biodiversity
TS.B.1  Climate change has altered marine, terrestrial and fresh-
water ecosystems all around the world (very high confidence). 
Effects were experienced earlier and are more widespread with 
more far-reaching consequences than anticipated (medium 
confidence). Biological responses, including changes in physi-
ology, growth, abundance, geographic placement and shifting 
seasonal timing, are often not sufficient to cope with recent 
climate change (very high confidence). Climate change 
has caused local species losses, increases in disease (high 
confidence) and mass mortality events of plants and animals 
(very high confidence), resulting in the first climate-driven 
extinctions (medium confidence), ecosystem restructuring, 
increases in areas burned by wildfire (high confidence) and 
declines in key ecosystem services (high confidence). Climate-
driven impacts on ecosystems have caused measurable eco-
nomic and livelihood losses and altered cultural practices and 
recreational activities around the world (high confidence).

TS.B.1.1 Anthropogenic climate change has exposed ecosystems 
to conditions that are unprecedented over millennia (high 
confidence), which has greatly impacted species on land and 
in the ocean (very high confidence). Consistent with expectations, 
species in all ecosystems have shifted their geographic ranges and 
altered the timing of seasonal events (very high confidence). Among 
thousands of species spread across terrestrial, freshwater and marine 
systems, half to two-thirds have shifted their ranges to higher latitudes 
(very high confidence), and approximately two-thirds have shifted 
towards earlier spring life events (very high confidence) in response 
to warming. The move of diseases and their vectors has brought new 
diseases into the high Arctic and at higher elevations in mountain 
regions to which local wildlife and humans are not resistant (high 
confidence). These processes have led to emerging hybridisation, 
competition, temporal or spatial mismatches in predator–prey, insect–
plant and host–parasite relationships and invasion of alien plant pests 
or pathogens (medium confidence). (Figure TS.5 ECOSYSTEMS) {2.4.2, 
2.4.3, 2.5.2, 2.5.4, 2.6.1, 3.2.4, 3.4.2, 3.4.3, 3.5.2, 4.3.5, 9.6.1, 10.4.2,

EXTREMES, CCB ILLNESS, CCB MOVING PLATE}
TS.B.1.2 Observed responses of species to climate change 
have altered biodiversity and impacted ecosystem structure 
and resilience in most regions (very high confidence). Range 
shifts reduce biodiversity in the warmest regions and locations as 
adaptation limits are exceeded (high confidence). Simultaneously, 
these shifts homogenise biodiversity (medium confidence) in regions 
receiving climate-migrant species, alter food webs and eliminate the 
distinctiveness of communities (medium confidence). Increasing losses 
of habitat-forming species such as trees, corals, kelp and seagrass have 
caused irreversible shifts in some ecosystems and threaten associated 
biodiversity in marine systems (high confidence). Human-introduced 
invasive (non-native) species can reduce or replace native species and 
alter ecosystem characteristics if they fare better than endemic species in 
new climate-altered ecological niches (high confidence). Such invasive 
species effects are most prominent in geographically constrained 
areas, including islands, semi-enclosed seas and mountains, and they 
increase vulnerability in these systems (high confidence). Phenological 
shifts increase the risks of temporal mismatches between trophic levels 
within ecosystems (medium confidence), which can lead to reduced 
food availability and population abundances (medium confidence) and 
can further destabilise ecosystem resilience. (Figure TS.5 ECOSYSTEMS)

TS.B.1.3 At the warm (equatorward and lower) edges of 
distribu­tions, adaptation limits to human-induced warming have 
led to widespread local population losses (extirpations) that result 
in range contractions (very high confidence). Among land plants and 
animals, local population loss was detected in around 50% of studied 
species and is often attributable to extreme events (high confidence). 
Such extirpations are most common in tropical habitats (55%) and 
freshwater systems (74%), but also high in marine (51%) and terrestrial 
(46%) habitats. Many mountain-top species have suffered population 
losses along lower elevations, leaving them increasingly restricted to 
a smaller area and at higher risk of extinction (medium confidence). 
Global extinctions due to climate change are already being observed, 
with two extinctions currently attributed to anthropogenic climate 
change (medium confidence). Climate-induced extinctions, including 
mass extinctions, are common in the palaeo record, underlining the 
potential of climate change to have catastrophic impacts on species and 
ecosystems (high confidence). (Figure TS.5 ECOSYSTEMS) {2.3.1, 2.3.3,

CCP1.2.1, CCP5.2.1, CCP5.2.7, CCP7.2.1, CCB EXTREMES, CCB PALEO}
TS.B.1.4 Ecosystem change has led to the loss of specialised 
ecosystems where warming has reduced thermal habitat, as at 
the poles, at the tops of mountains and at the equator, with 
the hottest ecosystems becoming intolerable for many species 
(very high confidence). For example, warming, reduced ice, thawing 
permafrost and a changing hydrological cycle have resulted in the 
contraction of polar and mountain ecosystems. The Arctic is showing 
increased arrival of species from warmer areas on land and in the sea, 
with a declining extent of tundra and ice-dependent species, such as 
the polar bear (high confidence). Similar patterns of change in the 
Antarctic terrestrial and marine environment are beginning to emerge,

Figure TS.3 |  Observed global and regional impacts on ecosystems and human systems attributed to climate change. Confidence levels reflect uncertainty in 
attribution of the observed impact to climate change. Global assessments focus on large studies, multi-species, meta-analyses and large reviews. For that reason they can be 
assessed with higher confidence than regional studies, which may often rely on smaller studies that have more limited data. Regional assessments consider evidence on impacts 
across an entire region and do not focus on any country in particular.

such as declining ranges of krill and emperor penguins (medium 
confidence). Coral reefs are suffering global declines, with abrupt shifts 
in community composition persisting for years (very high confidence). 
Deserts and tropical systems are decreasing in diversity due to heat 
stress and extreme events (high confidence). In contrast, arid lands are 
displaying varied responses around the globe in response to regional 
changes in the hydrological cycle (high confidence). {2.3.1, 2.3.3, 2.4.2,

TS.B.1.5 Climate change is affecting ecosystem services connected 
to human health, livelihoods and well-being (medium confidence). 
In terrestrial ecosystems, carbon uptake services linked to CO2 fertilisation 
effects are being increasingly limited by drought and warming and 
exacerbated by non-climatic anthropogenic impacts (high confidence). 
Deforestation, draining and burning of peatlands and tropical forests 
and thawing of Arctic permafrost have already shifted some areas from 
being carbon sinks to carbon sources (high confidence). The severity and 
outbreak extent of forest insect pests increased in several regions (high 
confidence). Woody plant expansion into grasslands and savannahs, 
linked to increased CO2, has reduced grazing land, while invasive grasses 
in semiarid lands increased the risk of fire (high confidence). Coastal 
‘blue carbon’ systems are already impacted by multiple climate and non-
climate drivers (very high confidence). Warming and CO2 fertilisation 
have altered coastal ecosystem biodiversity, making carbon storage 
or release regionally variable (high confidence). {2.2, Table 2.1, 2.4.2,

TS.B.1.6 Human communities, especially Indigenous Peoples and 
those more directly reliant on the environment for subsistence, 
are already negatively impacted by the loss of ecosystem 
functions, replacement of endemic species and regime shifts 
across landscapes and seascapes (high confidence). Indigenous 
knowledge contains unique information sources about past changes 
and potential solutions to present issues (medium confidence). 
Tangible heritage, such as traditional harvesting sites or species and 
archaeological and cultural heritage sites, and intangible heritage, such 
as festivals and rites associated with nature-based activities, endemic 
knowledge and unique insights about plants and animals, are being 
lost (high confidence). As 80% of the world’s remaining biodiversity 
is on Indigenous homelands, these losses have cascading impacts on 
cultural and linguistic diversity and Indigenous knowledge systems, 
food security, health, and livelihoods, often with irreparable damage 
and consequences (medium evidence, high agreement). Cultural losses 
threaten adaptive capacity and may accumulate into intergenerational 
trauma and irrevocable losses of sense of belonging, valued cultural 
practices, identity and home (medium confidence). {2.2, Table  2.1,

TS.B.2  Widespread and severe loss and damage to human and 
natural systems are being driven by human-induced climate 
changes increasing the frequency and/or intensity and/or dura-
tion of extreme weather events, including droughts, wildfires, 
terrestrial and marine heatwaves, cyclones (high confidence) 
and flood (low confidence). Extremes are surpassing the resil-
ience of some ecological and human systems and challenging 
the adaptation capacities of others, including impacts with irre-
versible consequences (high confidence). Vulnerable people and 
human systems and climate-sensitive species and ecosystems 
are most at risk (very high confidence). (Figure TS.3) {2.3, 2.3.1,

TS.B.2.1 Extreme climate events comprising conditions beyond 
which many species are adapted are occurring on all continents, 
with severe impacts (very high confidence). The most severe 
impacts are occurring in the most climate-sensitive species and 
ecosystems, characterised by traits that limit their abilities to regenerate 
between events or to adapt, and those most exposed to climate hazards 
(high confidence). Losses of local plant and animal populations have 
been widespread, many associated with large increases in hottest 
yearly temperatures and heatwave events (very high confidence). 
Marine heatwave events have led to widespread, abrupt and extensive 
mortality of key habitat-forming species among tropical corals, kelps, 
seagrasses and mangroves, as well as mass mortality of wildlife species, 
including benthic sessile species (high confidence). On land, extreme 
heat events also have been implicated in the mass mortality of fruit bats 
(a)  Climate change has already altered terrestrial, freshwater and ocean ecosystems at global scale, with multiple impacts evident at regional and local scales where there is 
sufficient literature to make an assessment. Impacts are evident on ecosystem structure, species geographic ranges and timing of seasonal life cycles (phenology) (for methodology 
and detailed references to chapters and cross-chapter papers see SMTS.1 and SMTS.1.1).
(b)  Climate change has already had diverse adverse impacts on human systems, including on water security and food production, health and well-being, and cities, settlements and 
infrastructure. The + and – symbols indicate the direction of observed impacts, with a – denoting an increasing adverse impact and a ± denoting that, within a region or globally, 
both adverse and positive impacts have been observed (e.g., adverse impacts in one area or food item may occur with positive impacts in another area or food item). Globally, ‘–’ 
denotes an overall adverse impact; ‘Water scarcity’ considers, e.g., water availability in general, groundwater, water quality, demand for water, drought in cities. Impacts on food 
production were assessed by excluding non-climatic drivers of production increases; Global assessment for agricultural production is based on the impacts on global aggregated 
production; ‘Reduced animal and livestock health and productivity’ considers, e.g., heat stress, diseases, productivity, mortality; ‘Reduced fisheries yields and aquaculture production’ 
includes marine and freshwater fisheries/production; ‘Infectious diseases’ include, e.g., water-borne and vector-borne diseases; ‘Heat, malnutrition and other’ considers, e.g., human 
heat-related morbidity and mortality, labour productivity, harm from wildfire, nutritional deficiencies; ‘Mental health’ includes impacts from extreme weather events, cumulative 
events, and vicarious or anticipatory events; ‘Displacement’ assessments refer to evidence of displacement attributable to climate and weather extremes; ‘Inland flooding and 
associated damages’ considers, e.g., river overflows, heavy rain, glacier outbursts, urban flooding; ‘Flood/storm induced damages in coastal areas’ include damages due to, e.g., 
cyclones, sea level rise, storm surges. Damages by key economic sectors are observed impacts related to an attributable mean or extreme climate hazard or directly attributed. Key 
economic sectors include standard classifications and sectors of importance to regions (for methodology and detailed references to chapters and cross-chapter papers see SMTS.1 
and SMTS.1.2).

TS.B.2.2 Some extreme events have already emerged which 
exceeded projected global mean warming conditions for 2100, 
leading to abrupt changes in marine and terrestrial ecosystems 
(high confidence). For some forest types an increase in the frequency, 
severity and duration of wildfires and droughts has resulted in abrupt 
and possibly irreversible changes (medium to high confidence). The 
interplay between extreme events, long-term climate trends and other 
human pressures has pushed some climate-sensitive ecosystems towards 
thresholds that exceed their natural regenerative capacity (medium 
to high confidence). Extreme events can alter or impede evolutionary 
responses to climate change and the potential for acclimation to extreme 
conditions both on land and in the ocean (medium to high confidence).

Climate-related 
extremes 
have 
affected 
the 
productivity of agricultural, forestry and fishery sectors (high 
confidence). Droughts, floods, wildfires and marine heatwaves 
contribute to reduced food availability and increased food 
prices, threatening food security, nutrition and livelihoods of 
millions of people across regions (high confidence). Extreme 
events caused economic losses in forest productivity and crops and 
livestock farming, including losses in wheat production in 2012, 2016 
and 2018, with the severity of impacts from extreme heat and drought 
tripling over the last 50  years in Europe (high confidence). Forests 
were impacted by extreme heat and drought impacting timber sales, 
for example, in Europe (high confidence). Marine heatwaves, including 
well-documented events along the west coast of North America 
(2013–2016) and east coast of Australia (2015–2016, 2016–2017 and 
2020), have caused the collapse of regional fisheries and aquaculture 
(high confidence). Human populations exposed to extreme weather 
and climate events are at risk of food insecurity with lower diversity 
in diets, leading to malnutrition and increased risk of disease (high 
confidence). (Figure  TS.6 WATER-FOOD) {2.4.4, 3.2.2, 3.4.2, 3.4.3,

TS.B.2.4 Extreme climatic events have been observed in all 
inhabited regions, with many regions experiencing unprece­
dented consequences, particularly when multiple hazards 
occur at the same time or within the same space (very high 
confidence). Since AR5, the impacts of climate change and extreme 
weather events such as wildfires, extreme heat, cyclones, storms 
and floods have adversely affected or caused loss and damage to 
human health, shelter, displacement, incomes and livelihoods, security 
and inequality (high confidence). Over 20 million people have been 
internally displaced annually by weather-related extreme events 
since 2008, with storms and floods the most common drivers (high 
confidence). Climate-related extreme events are followed by negative 
impacts on mental health, well-being, life satisfaction, happiness, 
cognitive performance and aggression in exposed populations (very 
high confidence). (Figure TS.8 HEALTH, Figure TS.10 COMPLEX RISK)

Food systems, food security and forestry
TS.B.3  Climate change is already stressing food and forestry 
systems, with negative consequences for the livelihoods, 
food security and nutrition of hundreds of millions of people, 
especially in low and mid-latitudes (high confidence). The global 
food system is failing to address food insecurity and malnutrition 
in an environmentally sustainable way. (Figure TS.2, Figure TS.3,

TS.B 3.1 Climate change impacts are negatively affecting 
agriculture, forestry, fisheries and aquaculture, increasingly 
hindering efforts to meet human needs (high confidence). 
Human-induced global warming has slowed the growth of agricultural 
productivity over the past 50 years in mid and low latitudes (medium 
confidence). Crop yields are compromised by surface ozone (high 
confidence). Methane emissions have negatively impacted crop 
yields by increasing temperatures and surface ozone concentrations 
(medium confidence). Warming is negatively affecting crop and 
grassland quality and harvest stability (high confidence). Warmer and 
drier conditions have increased tree mortality and forest disturbances 
in many temperate and boreal biomes (high confidence), negatively 
impacting provisioning services (medium confidence). Ocean warming 
has decreased sustainable yields of some wild fish populations (high 
confidence) by 4.1% between 1930 and 2010. Ocean acidification 
and warming have already affected farmed aquatic species (high 
confidence). (Figure  TS.3, Figure  TS.6 FOOD-WATER) {2.4.3, 2.4.4,

TS.B.3.2 Warming has altered the distribution, growing 
area suitability and timing of key biological events, such as 
flowering and insect emergence, impacting food quality and 
harvest stability (high confidence). There is high confidence that 
climate change is altering the distribution of cultivated and wild 
terrestrial, marine and freshwater species. At higher latitudes, warming 
has expanded the available area but has also altered phenology (high 
confidence), potentially causing plant–pollinator and pest mismatches 
(medium confidence). At low latitudes, temperatures have crossed 
upper tolerance thresholds, more frequently leading to heat stress and/
or shifts in distribution and losses for crops, livestock, fisheries and 
aquaculture (high confidence). {2.4.2, 3.4.2, 3.4.3, 5.4.1, 5.7.4, 5.8.1,

Technical Summary
TS
TS.B.3.3 Climate-related extremes have affected the productivity 
of all agricultural and fishery sectors, with negative consequences 
for food security and livelihoods (high confidence). The frequency 
of sudden food production losses has increased since at least the mid-
20th century on land and sea (medium evidence, high agreement). 
The impacts of climate-related extremes on food security, nutrition 
and livelihoods are particularly acute and severe for people living in 
sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, small islands, Central and South America and 
the Arctic and small-scale food producers globally (high confidence). 
Droughts induced by the 2015–2016 El Niño, partially attributable to 
human influences (medium confidence), caused acute food insecurity 
in various regions, including eastern and southern Africa and the Dry 
Corridor of Central America (high confidence). In the northeast Pacific, a 
5-year warm period (2013 to 2017) impacted the migration, distribution 
and abundance of key fish resources (high confidence). Increasing 
variability in grazing systems has negatively affected animal fertility, 
mortality and herd recovery rates, reducing livestock keepers’ resilience 
(medium confidence). (Figure TS.6 FOOD-WATER) {3.5.5, 4.3.1, 5.2.1,

TS.B.3.4 Climate-related emerging food safety risks are 
increasing globally in agriculture and fisheries (high confidence). 
Higher temperatures and humidity caused by climate change increases 
toxigenic fungi on many food crops (very high confidence). Harmful 
algal blooms and water-borne diseases threaten food security and the 
economy and livelihoods of many coastal communities (high confidence). 
Increasing ocean warming and acidification are enhancing movement 
and bioaccumulation of toxins and contaminants into marine food webs 
(medium confidence) and with bio-magnification of persistent organic 
pollutants and methyl mercury already affecting fisheries (medium 
confidence). Indigenous Peoples and local communities, especially 
where food safety monitoring is underdeveloped, are among the most 
vulnerable to these risks, in particular in the Arctic (high confidence).

TS.B.3.5 The impacts of climate change on food systems affect 
everyone, but some groups are more vulnerable. Women, the elderly 
and children in low-income households, Indigenous Peoples, minority 
groups, small-scale producers and fishing communities and people in 
high-risk regions more often experience malnutrition, livelihood loss 
and rising costs (high confidence). Increasing competition for critical 
resources, such as land, energy and water, can exacerbate the impacts 
of climate change on food security (high confidence). Examples include 
large-scale land deals, water use, dietary patterns, energy crops and 
use of feed crops. (Figure TS.10 COMPLEX RISK) {2.6.5, 4.8.3, 5.4.2,

Water systems and water security
TS.B.4  Currently, roughly half of the world’s population are 
experiencing severe water scarcity for at least 1  month yr-1 
due to climatic and other factors (medium confidence). Water 
insecurity is manifested through climate-induced water scar-
city and hazards and is further exacerbated by inadequate 
water governance (high confidence). Extreme events and un-
derlying vulnerabilities have intensified the societal impacts 
of droughts and floods, negatively impacted agriculture and 
energy production and increased the incidence of water-borne 
diseases. Economic and societal impacts of water insecurity are 
more pronounced in low-income countries than in middle- and 
high-income ones (high confidence). (Figure TS.2, Figure TS.3,

TS.B.4.1 Climate change has intensified the global hydrological 
cycle, causing several societal impacts, which are felt 
disproportionately by vulnerable people (high confidence). 
Human-induced climate change has affected physical aspects of water 
security through increasing water scarcity and exposing more people 
to water-related extreme events like floods and droughts, thereby 
exacerbating existing water-related vulnerabilities caused by other 
socioeconomic factors (high confidence). Many of these changes in 
water availability and water-related hazards can be directly attributed 
to anthropogenic climate change (high confidence). Water insecurity 
disproportionately impacts the poor, women, children, Indigenous 
Peoples and the elderly in low-income countries (high confidence) and 
specific marginal geographies (e.g., small island states and mountain 
regions). Water insecurity can contribute to social unrest in regions 
where inequality is high and water governance and institutions are 
weak (medium confidence). (Figure  TS.6 WATER-FOOD, Figure  TS.7

TS.B.4.2 Worldwide, people are increasingly experiencing unfa-
miliar precipitation patterns, including extreme precipitation 
events (high confidence). Nearly half a billion people now live in 
areas where the long-term average precipitation is now as high as 
was previously seen in only about 1 in 6 years (medium confidence). 
Approximately 163 million people now live in unfamiliarly dry areas 
(medium confidence) compared to 50 years ago. The intensity of heavy 
precipitation has increased in many regions since the 1950s (high con-
fidence). Substantially more people (around 709 million) live in regions 
where annual maximum 1-d precipitation has increased than in re-
gions where it has decreased (around 86 million) (medium confidence) 
since the 1950s. At the same time, more people (around 700 million) 
have been experiencing longer dry spells than shorter dry spells since 
the 1950s (medium confidence), leading to compound hazards related 
to both warming and precipitation extremes in most parts of the world

TS.B.4.3 Glaciers are melting at unprecedented rates, causing 
negative societal impacts among communities that depend 
on cryospheric water resources (high confidence). Over the last 
two decades, the global glacier mass loss rate has been the highest 
since the glacier mass balance measurements began a century ago 
(high confidence). Melting of glaciers, snow decline and thawing of 
permafrost have threatened the water and livelihood security of 
local and downstream communities through changes in hydrological 
regimes and increases in the potential of landslides and glacier lake 
outburst floods. Cryosphere changes have impacted cultural uses 
of water among vulnerable mountain and Arctic communities and 
Indigenous Peoples (high confidence), who have long experienced 
historical, socioeconomic and political marginalisation (medium to 
high confidence). Cryosphere change has affected ecosystems, water 
resources, livelihoods and cultural uses of water in all cryosphere-
dependent regions across the world (very high confidence).

TS.B.4.4 Impacts of droughts and floods have intensified due 
to extreme events and underlying societal vulnerabilities (high 
­confidence). Anthropogenic climate change has led to ­increased 
­likelihood, severity and societal impacts of droughts (primarily­ 
­agricultural and hydrological droughts) in many regions (high 
­confidence). Between 1970 and 2019, drought-related disaster events 
worldwide caused billions of dollars in economic damages (medium 
confidence). Drylands are particularly exposed to climate change related 
droughts (high ­confidence). Recent heavy rainfall events that have led to 
­catastrophic flooding were made more likely by anthropogenic climate 
change (high confidence). Observed mortality and losses due to floods 
and droughts are much greater in regions with high vulnerability and 
vulnerable ­populations such as the poor, women, children, Indigenous 
Peoples and the elderly due to historical, political and socioeconomic 
inequities (high confidence). {4.2.4, 4.2.5, 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 6.2.2, 7.2.2, 7.2.4,

TS.B.4.5 Climate-induced changes in the hydrological cycle have 
negatively impacted freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems. 
Climate change and changes in land use and water pollution are key 
drivers of ecosystem loss and degradation (high confidence), with 
negative impacts observed on culturally significant terrestrial and 
freshwater species and ecosystems in the Arctic, mountain regions 
and other biodiversity hotspots (high confidence). Climate trends and 
extreme events have had major impacts on many natural systems (high 
confidence). For example, periodic droughts in parts of the Amazon 
since the 1990s, partly attributed to climate change, resulted in high 
tree mortality rates and basin-wide reductions in forest productivity, 
momentarily turning Amazon forests from a carbon sink into a net 
carbon source (high confidence). Fire risks have increased due to 
heat and drought conditions in many parts of the world (medium 
confidence). Increased precipitation has resulted in range shifts of 
species in some regions (high confidence). (Figure TS.10 COMPLEX

TS.B.4.6 Hydrological cycle changes have impacted food and 
energy production and increased the incidence of water-borne 
diseases. Climate-induced trends and extremes in the water cycle 
have impacted agricultural production positively and negatively, with 
negative impacts outweighing the positive ones (high confidence). 
Droughts, floods and rainfall variability have contributed to reduced food 
availability and increased food prices, threatening food and nutrition 
security, and the livelihoods of millions globally (high confidence), with 
the poor in parts of Asia, Africa and South and Central America being 
disproportionately affected (high confidence). Drought years have 
reduced thermoelectric and hydropower production by around 4–5% 
compared to long-term average production since the 1980s (medium 
confidence), reducing economic growth in Africa and with billions in 
US dollars of existing and planned hydropower infrastructure assets 
in mountain regions worldwide and in Africa exposed to increasing 
hazards (high confidence). Changes in temperature, precipitation and 
water-related disasters are linked to increased incidences of water-
borne diseases such as cholera, especially in regions with limited 
access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene infrastructure (high 
confidence). {4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.3.3, 4.3.4, 4.3.5,4.3.6, 4.3.8, 5.9.1, 7.2.2,

TS.B.5.2 Mental health challenges increase with warming 
temperatures (high confidence), trauma associated with extreme 
weather (very high confidence) and loss of livelihoods and culture 
(high confidence). Distress sufficient to impair mental health has been 
caused by climate-related ecological grief associated with environmental 
change (e.g., solastalgia) or extreme weather and climate events (very 
high confidence), vicarious experience or anticipation of climate events 
(medium confidence) and climate-related loss of livelihoods and food 
insecurity (very high confidence). Vulnerability to mental health effects 
of climate change varies by region and population, with evidence that 
Indigenous Peoples, agricultural communities, first responders, women 
and members of minority groups experience greater impacts (high 
confidence). {7.2.5, 7.4.2, 8.3.4, Box 8.6, 9.10.2, 11.3.6, 13.7.1, 14.5.6,

TS.B.5.3 Increasing temperatures and heatwaves have increased 
mortality and morbidity (very high confidence), with impacts that 
vary by age, gender, urbanisation and socioeconomic factors (very 
high confidence). A significant proportion of warm-season heat-related 
mortality in temperate regions is attributed to observed anthropogenic 
climate change (medium confidence), with fewer data available for 
tropical regions in Africa (high confidence). For some heatwave events 
over the last two decades, associated health impacts have been partially 
attributed to observed climate change (high confidence). Highly 
vulnerable groups experiencing health impacts from heat stress include 
anyone working outdoors and, especially, those doing outdoor manual 
labour (e.g., construction work, farming). Potential hours of work lost 
due to heat have increased significantly over the past two decades 
(high confidence). Some regions are already experiencing heat stress 
conditions at or approaching the upper limits of labour productivity 
(high confidence). {7.2.1, 7.2.4 8.2.1, 9.1.5, 9.10.1, Figure 9.34, 10.4.7,

TS.B.5.4 Climate change has contributed to malnutrition in all its 
forms in many regions, including undernutrition, overnutrition 
and obesity, and to disease susceptibility (high confidence), 
especially for women, pregnant women, children, low-income 
households, Indigenous Peoples, minority groups and small-scale 
producers (high confidence). Extreme climate events have been key 
drivers in rising undernutrition of millions of people, primarily in Africa 
and Central America (high confidence). For example, anthropogenic 
warming contributed to climate extremes induced by the 2015–2016 
El Niño, which resulted in severe droughts, leading to an additional 
5.9  million children in 51  countries becoming underweight (high 
confidence). Undernutrition can in turn increase susceptibility to other 
health problems, including mental health problems, and impair cognitive 
and work performance, with resulting economic impacts (very high 
confidence). Children and pregnant women experience disproportionate

TS.B.5.5 Climate-related food safety risks have increased globally 
(high confidence). These risks include Salmonella, Campylobacter and 
Cryptosporidium infections (medium confidence) mycotoxins associated 
with cancer and stunting in children (high confidence) and seafood 
contamination with marine toxins and pathogens (high confidence). 
Climate-related food-borne disease risks vary temporally and are 
influenced, in part, by food availability, accessibility, preparation and 
preferences (medium confidence), as well as adequate food safety 
monitoring (high confidence). {3.4.2, 3.5.3, 3.5.5, 3.5.6, 5.11.1, Box 5.10,

TS.B.5.6 Higher temperatures combined with land use/land cover 
change are making more areas suitable for the transmission of 
vector-borne diseases (high confidence). More extreme weather 
events have contributed to vector-borne disease outbreaks in humans 
through direct effects on pathogens and vectors and indirect effects on 
human behaviour and emergency response destabilisation (medium 
confidence). Climate change and variability are facilitating the spread 
of chikungunya virus in North, Central and South America, Europe 
and Asia (medium to high confidence); tick-borne encephalitis in 
Europe (medium confidence); Rift Valley fever in Africa; West Nile 
fever in southeastern Europe, western Asia, the Canadian prairies 
and parts of the USA (medium confidence); Lyme disease vectors in 
North America (high confidence) and Europe (medium confidence); 
malaria in eastern and southern Africa (high confidence); and dengue 
globally (high confidence). For example, in Central and South America, 
the reproduction potential for the transmission of dengue increased 
between 17% and 80% for the period 1950–1954 to 2016–2021, 
depending on the sub-region, as a result of changes in temperature 
and precipitation (high confidence). {2.4.2, 4.3.3, 7.2.1, 7.2.2, 9.10.2,

TS.B.5.7 Higher temperatures (very high confidence), heavy

particularly diarrhoeal diseases, including cholera (very high confidence) 
and other gastrointestinal infections (high confidence) in high-, middle- 
and low-income countries. Water insecurity and inadequate water, 
sanitation and hygiene increase disease risk (high confidence), stress

food insecurity and adverse nutritional outcomes and poor cognitive

and sub-Arctic regions of Europe, Asia and North America are emerging 
as a result of climate-induced environmental change (e.g., anthrax), 
spreading polewards and increasing in incidence (e.g., tularemia) (very

TS.B.5.9 Several chronic, non-communicable respiratory diseases 
are climate-sensitive based on their exposure pathways (e.g., 
heat, cold, dust, small particulates, ozone, fire smoke and 
allergens) (high confidence), although climate change is not the 
dominant driver in all cases. Exposure to wildfires and associated 
smoke has increased in several regions (very high confidence). The 
2019–2020 southeastern Australian wildfires resulted in the deaths 
of 33 people, a further 429 deaths and 3230 hospitalisations due to 
cardiovascular or respiratory conditions and $1.95  billion in health 
costs. Spring pollen season start dates in northern mid-latitudes are 
occurring earlier due to climate change, increasing the risks of allergic 
respiratory diseases (high confidence). {2.4.4, 7.2.3, 14.5.6, Box 14.2,

Migration and displacement
TS.B.6  Since AR5 there is increased evidence that climate 
hazards associated with extreme events and variability act as 
direct drivers of involuntary migration and displacement and 
as indirect drivers through deteriorating climate-sensitive live-
lihoods (high confidence). Most climate-related displacement 
and migration occur within national boundaries, with interna-
tional movements occurring primarily between countries with 
contiguous borders (high confidence). Since 2008, an annual 
average of over 20  million people have been internally dis-
placed annually by weather-related extreme events, with 
storms and floods being the most common (high confidence). 
{1.1.1, 1.3, 7.2.6, 9.9.2, Box 9.8, Box 10.2, 12.3, 13.8.1, 15.3.4, 
16.2.3, 18.2, CCP3.2, CCB MIGRATE}
TS.B.6.1 The most common climatic drivers for migration and 
displacement are drought, tropical storms and hurricanes, heavy 
rains and floods (high confidence). Extreme climate events act as 
both direct drivers (e.g., destruction of homes by tropical cyclones) and 
indirect drivers (e.g., rural income losses during prolonged droughts) 
of involuntary migration and displacement (very high confidence). 
The largest absolute number of people displaced by extreme weather 
each year occurs in Asia (South, Southeast and East), followed by 
sub-Saharan Africa, but small island states in the Caribbean and 
South Pacific are disproportionately affected relative to their small 
population size (high confidence). {4.3.7, 7.2.6, 9.9.2, Box 9.8, 12.3.1, 
12.3.2, 12.3.3, 12.3.5, 12.5.8, 15.3.4, 16.2.3, CCB MIGRATE}
TS.B.6.2 The impacts of climatic drivers on migration are highly 
context-specific and interact with social, political, geopolitical 
and economic drivers (high confidence). Specific climate events 
and conditions cause migration to increase, decrease or flow in new 
directions (high confidence). One of the main pathways for climate-
induced migration is through deteriorating economic conditions and 
livelihoods (high confidence). Climate change has influenced changes 
in temporary, seasonal or permanent migration, often rural to urban 
or rural to rural, that is associated with labour diversification as a risk-
reduction strategy in Central America, Africa, South Asia and Mexico 
(high confidence). This movement is often followed by remittances 
(medium confidence). However, the same economic losses can also 
undermine household resources and savings, limiting mobility and 
compounding people’s exposure and vulnerability (high confidence). 
{4.3.7, 5.5.4, 7.2.6, 8.2.1, Box  9.8, 12.3.1, 12.3.2, 12.3.3, 12.3.5, 
12.5.8, 13.8.1, CCP5.2.5, CCB MIGRATE}
TS.B.6.3 Outcomes of climate-related migration are highly 
variable, with socioeconomic factors and household resources 
affecting migration success (high confidence). The more agency 
migrants have (i.e., the degree of voluntarity and freedom of movement), 
the greater the potential benefits for sending and receiving areas (high 
agreement, medium evidence). Displacement or low-agency migration is 
associated with poor health, well-being and socioeconomic outcomes for 
migrants and yields fewer benefits to sending or receiving communities 
(high agreement, medium evidence). Involuntary migration occurs 
when adaptation alternatives are exhausted or not viable and reflects 
non-climatic factors that constrain adaptive capacity and create high 
levels of exposure and vulnerability (high confidence). These outcomes 
are also shaped by policy and planning decisions at regional, national 
and local scales that relate to housing, infrastructure, water provisioning, 
schools and healthcare to support the integration of migrants into 
receiving communities (high confidence). {4.3.7, 5.5.3, 5.5.4, 5.10.1,

CCB SLR}
TS.B.6.4 Immobility in the context of climatic risk reflects both 
vulnerability and lack of agency, but is also a deliberate choice 
(high confidence). Deliberate or voluntary, immobility represents an 
assertion of the importance of culture, livelihood and sense of place. 
Planned relocations by governments of settlements and populations 
exposed to climatic hazards are not presently commonplace, although 
the need is expected to grow. Existing examples of relocations of 
Indigenous Peoples in coastal Alaska and villages in the Solomon 
Islands and Fiji suggest that relocated people can experience significant 
financial and emotional distress as cultural and spiritual bonds to place 
and livelihoods are disrupted (high confidence). {7.2.6, 13.8.1, 15.3.4, 
CCP6.2.5, CCB MIGRATE}
Human vulnerability
TS.B.7  Vulnerability significantly determines how climate 
change impacts are being experienced by societies and com-
munities. Vulnerability to climate change is a multi-dimension-
al, dynamic phenomenon shaped by intersecting historical and 
contemporary political, economic and cultural processes of 
marginalisation (high confidence). Societies with high levels of 
inequity are less resilient to climate change (high confidence).

TS.B.7.1 About 3.3  billion people are living in countries with 
high human vulnerability to climate change (high confidence). 
53
Technical Summary
TS
Approximately 1.8 billion people reside in regions classified as having 
low vulnerability. Global concentrations of high vulnerability are 
emerging in transboundary areas encompassing more than one country 
as a result of interlinked issues concerning health, poverty, migration, 
conflict, gender inequality, inequity, education, high debt, weak 
institutions, lack of governance capacities and infrastructure. Complex 
human vulnerability patterns are shaped by past developments, such 
as colonialism and its ongoing legacy (high confidence), are worsened 
by compounding and cascading risks (high confidence) and are socially 
differentiated. For example, low-income, young, poor and female-
headed households face greater livelihood risks from climate hazards 
(high confidence). (Figure TS.7 VULNERABILITY) {4.3.1, 5.5.2, 5.12.3,

TS.B.7.2 Climate change is impacting Indigenous Peoples’ ways 
of life (very high confidence), cultural and linguistic diversity 
(medium confidence), food security (high confidence) and health 
and well-being (very high confidence). Indigenous knowledge 
and local knowledge can contribute to reducing the vulnerability of 
communities to climate change (medium to high confidence). Supporting 
Indigenous self-determination, recognising Indigenous Peoples’ rights 
and supporting Indigenous knowledge-based adaptation are critical 
to reducing climate change risks and effective adaptation (very high 
confidence). {1.3.2, 2.6.5, 4.3.8, 4.6.9, 4.8.4, 5.5.2, 5.8.2, 5.10.2,

TS.B.7.3 The intersection of gender with race, class, ethnicity, 
sexuality, Indigenous identity, age, disability, income, 
migrant status and geographical location often compounds 
vulnerability to climate change impacts (very high confidence), 
exacerbates inequity and creates further injustice (high 
confidence). There is evidence that present adaptation strategies do 
not sufficiently include poverty reduction and the underlying social 
determinants of human vulnerability such as gender, ethnicity and 
governance (high confidence). {1.2.1, 1.4.1, 4.8.3, 4.8.5, 4.8.6, 4.6.3,

TS.B.7.4 Climate variability and extremes are associated with 
more prolonged conflict through food price spikes, food 
and water insecurity, loss of income and loss of livelihoods 
(high confidence), with more consistent evidence for low-
intensity organised violence within countries than for major 
or international armed conflict (medium confidence). Compared 
to other socioeconomic factors, the influence of climate on conflict 
has been assessed as being relatively weak (high confidence) but is 
exacerbated by insecure land tenure, weather-sensitive economic 
activities, weak institutions and fragile governance, poverty and 
inequality (medium confidence). The literature also suggests a 
larger climate-related influence on the dynamics of conflict than on 
the likelihood of initial conflict outbreak (low confidence). There is 
insufficient evidence at present to attribute armed conflict to human-
induced climate change. {4.1, 4.3.1, 4.3.6, 5.8.3, 5.12.4, Box  5.9, 
Box 6.3; Box 9.9; 7.2.7, 12.5.8, 12.7.4, 16.2.3}
Cities, settlements and infrastructure 
TS.B.8  Cities and settlements (particularly unplanned and in-
formal settlements and in coastal and mountain regions) have 
continued to grow at rapid rates and remain crucial both as 
concentrated sites of increased exposure to risk and increas-
ing vulnerability and as sites of action on climate change 
(high confidence). More people and key assets are exposed to 
climate-induced impacts, and loss and damage in cities, set-
tlements and key infrastructure since AR5 (high confidence). 
Sea level rise, heatwaves, droughts, changes in runoff, floods, 
wildfires and permafrost thaw cause disruptions of key infra-
structure and services such as energy supply and transmission, 
communications, food and water supply and transport systems 
in and between urban and peri-urban areas (high confidence). 
The most rapid growth in urban vulnerability and exposure 
has been in cities and settlements where adaptive capacity is 
limited, including informal settlements in low- and middle-in-
come communities and in smaller and medium-sized urban 
communities (high confidence). (Figure  TS.9 URBAN) {4.3.4, 
8.2, 8.3, 6.1.4, Box 6.1, 9.9.1, 9.9.2, 10.4.6, 11.6, Table 11.14,

Table CCP6.5, Table CCP6.6}
TS.B.8.1 Globally, urban populations grew by more than 
397 million people between 2015 and 2020, with more than 
90% of this growth taking place in less developed regions. 
The most rapid growth in urban vulnerability has been 
in unplanned and informal settlements and in smaller to 
medium urban centres in low- and middle-income nations 
where adaptive capacity is limited (high confidence). Since 
AR5, observed impacts of climate change on cities, peri-urban 
areas and settlements have extended from direct, climate-driven 
impacts to compound, cascading and systemic impacts (high 
confidence). Patterns of urban growth, inequity, poverty, informality 
and precariousness in housing are uneven and shape cities in key 
regions, such as within Africa and Asia. In sub-Saharan Africa, 
about 60% of the urban population lives in informal settlements, 
while Asia is home to the largest share of people—529 million—
living in informal settlements. The high degree of informality limits 
adaptation and increases differential vulnerability to climate change 
(high confidence). Globally, exposure to climate-driven impacts such 
as heatwaves, extreme precipitation and storms in combination 
with rapid urbanisation and lack of climate-sensitive planning, 
along with continuing threats from urban heat islands, is increasing 
the vulnerability of marginalised urban populations and key 
infrastructure to climate change, for example, more frequent and/
or extreme rainfall and drought stress existing design and capacity 
of current urban water systems and heighten urban and peri-urban 
water insecurity (high confidence). COVID-19 has had a substantial 
urban impact and generated new climate-vulnerable populations 
(high confidence). (Figure TS.9 URBAN) {4.3.4, 6.1.4 6.2, 6.2.2, 9.9.1,

already experiencing severe compounding impacts, including 
from sea level rise and climate variability (high confidence). 
Coastal cities are disproportionately affected by interacting, cascading 
and climate-compounding climate- and ocean-driven impacts, in 
part because of the exposure of multiple assets, economic activities 
and large populations concentrated in narrow coastal zones (high 
confidence), with about a tenth of the world’s population and physical 
assets in the Low Elevation Coastal Zone (less than 10 m above sea 
level). Early impacts of accelerating sea level rise have been detected 
at sheltered or subsiding coasts, manifesting as nuisance and chronic 
flooding at high tides, water-table salinisation, ecosystem and 
agricultural transitions, increased erosion and coastal flood damage 
(medium confidence). Coastal settlements with high inequality, for 
example a high proportion of informal settlements, as well as deltaic 
cities prone to land subsidence (e.g., Bangkok, Jakarta, Lagos, New 
Orleans, Mississippi, Nile, Ganges-Brahmaputra deltas) and small 
island states are highly vulnerable and have experienced impacts 
from severe storms and floods in addition to, or in combination with, 
those from accelerating sea level rise (high confidence). Currently, 
coastal cities already dependent on extensive protective works face 
the prospects of significantly increasing costs to maintain current 
protection levels, especially if the local sea level rises to the point 
that financial and technical limits are reached; systemic changes, 
such as relocation of millions of people, will be necessary (medium 
confidence). (Figure TS.9 URBAN) {4.3.4, Box 6.3, 6.3.1, 6.4.5, Box 6.4,

TS.B.8.3 Climate impacts on urban population health, livelihoods 
and well-being are felt disproportionately, with the most 
economically and socially marginalised being most affected 
(high confidence). Vulnerabilities vary by location and are shaped 
by intersecting processes of marginalization, including gender, class, 
race, income, ethnic origin, age, level of ability, sexuality and non-
conforming gender orientation (high confidence). (Figure TS.9 URBAN)

TS.B.8.4 Infrastructure systems provide critical services to 
individuals, society and the economy in both urban and rural 
areas; their availability and reliability directly or indirectly 
influence the attainment of all SDGs (high confidence). Due 
to the connectivity of infrastructure systems, climate impacts, such 
as with thawing permafrost or severe storms affecting energy and 
transport networks, can propagate outside the reach of the hazard 
footprint and cause larger impacts and widespread regional disruption 
(high confidence). Interdependencies between infrastructure systems 
have created new pathways for compounding climate risk, which 
has been accelerated by trends in information and communication 
technologies, increased reliance on energy, and complex (often global) 
supply chains (high confidence). (Figure TS.10 COMPLEX RISK) {2.3,

Economic sectors
TS.B.9 The effects of climate change impacts have been observed 
across economic sectors, although the magnitude of the damage 
varies by sector and by region (high confidence). Recent extreme 
weather and climate-induced events have been associated with 
large costs through damaged property, infrastructure and supply 
chain disruptions, although development patterns have driven 
much of these increases (high confidence). Adverse impacts on 
economic growth have been identified from extreme weather 
events (high confidence) with large effects in developing 
countries (high confidence). Widespread climate impacts have 
undermined economic livelihoods, especially among vulnerable 
populations (high confidence). Climate impacts and projected 
risks have been insufficiently internalised into private- and 
public-sector planning and budgeting practices and adaptation 
finance (medium confidence). (Figure TS.3) {3.5.5, 4.3.1, 4.3.2,

TS.B.9.1 Economic losses of climate change arise from adverse 
impacts on inputs, such as crop yields (very high confidence), 
water availability (high confidence) and outdoor labour 
productivity due to heat stress (high confidence). Greater 
economic losses are observed for sectors with high direct climate 
exposure, including regional losses to agriculture, forestry, fisheries, 
energy and tourism (high confidence). Many industrial and service 
sectors are indirectly affected through supply disruptions, especially 
during and following extreme events (high confidence). Costs are also 
incurred from adaptation, disaster spending, recovery and rebuilding 
of infrastructure (high confidence). Estimates of the global effects of 
climate change on aggregate measures of economic performance and 
gross domestic product (GDP) range from negative to positive, in part 
due to uncertainty in how weather variability and climate impacts 
manifest in GDP (high confidence). Climate change is estimated to have 
slowed trends of decreasing economic inequality between developed 
and developing countries (low confidence), with particularly negative 
effects for Africa (medium confidence). {4.2.2, 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.7.5, 9.6.3,

TS.B.9.2 A growing range of economic and non-economic 
losses has been detected and attributed to climate extremes 
and slow-onset events under observed increases in global 
temperatures in both low- and high-income countries (medium 
confidence). Extreme weather events, such as tropical cyclones, 
droughts and severe fluvial floods, have reduced economic growth 
in the short term (high confidence) and will continue to reduce it in 
the coming decades (medium confidence) in both developing and 
industrialised countries. Patterns of development have augmented the 
exposure of more assets to extreme hazards, increasing the magnitude 
of the losses (high confidence). Small Island Developing States have 
reported economic losses and a wide range of damage from tropical 
cyclones and increases in sea level rise (high confidence). Wildfires

TS.B.9.3 Economic livelihoods that are more climate sensitive 
have been disproportionately degraded by climate change (high 
confidence). Climate-sensitive livelihoods are more concentrated 
in regions that have higher socioeconomic vulnerabilities and lower 
adaptive capacities, exacerbating existing inequalities (medium 
confidence). Extreme events have also had more pronounced adverse 
effects in poorer regions and on more vulnerable populations (medium 
confidence). These greater economic effects have further reduced the 
ability of these populations to adapt to existing impacts (medium 
confidence). Within populations, the poor, women, children, elderly 
and Indigenous populations have been especially vulnerable due to 
a combination of factors, including gendered divisions of paid and/
or unpaid labour (high confidence). {4.3.1, 4.3.8, 8.3.5, 9.1.1, 13.8.1, 
Box 14.6, 16.2.3, CCB GENDER, CWGB ECONOMIC}
TS.B.9.4 Current planning and budgeting practices have given 
insufficient consideration to climate impacts and projected 
risks, placing more assets and people in regions with current 
and projected climate hazards (medium confidence). Existing 
adaptation has prevented greater economic losses (medium 
confidence), yet adaptation gaps remain due to limited financial 
resources, including gaps in international adaptation finance and 
competing priorities in budget allocations (medium confidence). 
Insufficient consideration of these impacts, however, has placed more 
assets in areas that are highly exposed to climate hazards (medium 
confidence). {4.7.1, 6.4.5, Box 8.3, 9.4.1, 10.5, 10.6, 11.8.1, 13.11.1,

Projected Impacts and Risks
This section identifies future impacts and risks under different degrees 
of climate change. As a result, 127 key risks have been found across 
regions and sectors. These are integrated as eight overarching risks 
(called Representative Key Risks, RKRs) which relate to low-lying 
coastal systems; terrestrial and ocean ecosystems; critical physical 
infrastructure, networks and services; living standards and equity; 
human health; food security; water security; and peace and migration. 
Risks are projected to become severe with increased warming and under 
ecological or societal conditions of high exposure and vulnerability. The 
intertwined issues of biodiversity loss and climatic change together 
with human demographic changes, particularly rapid growth in low-
income countries, an ageing population in high-income countries 
and rapid urbanisation are seen as core issues in understanding risk 
distribution at all scales. {16.5.2, Table 16.A.4, SMTS.2}
Ecosystems and biodiversity
TS.C.1  Without urgent and ambitious emissions reductions, 
more terrestrial, marine and freshwater species and ecosystems 
will face conditions that approach or exceed the limits of 
their historical experience (very high confidence). Threats to 
species and ecosystems in oceans, coastal regions and on land, 
particularly in biodiversity hotspots, present a global risk that 
will increase with every additional tenth of a degree of warming 
(high confidence). The transformation of terrestrial and ocean/
coastal ecosystems and loss of biodiversity, exacerbated by 
pollution, habitat fragmentation and land use changes, will 
threaten livelihoods and food security (high confidence). 
(Figure  TS.5 ECOSYSTEMS) {2.5.1, 2.5.2, 2.5.3, Figure  2.6, 
Figure 2.7, Figure 2.8, 2.5.4, Figure 2.11, Table 2.5, 3.2.4, 3.4.2, 
3.4.3, 4.5.5, 9.6.2, 12.4, 13.10.2, 14.5.1, 14.5.2, 15.3.3, 16.4.2, 
16.4.3, CCP1.2.4, CCP5.3.2, CCP5.2.7, CCP 7.3.5}
TS.C.1.1 Near-term warming will continue to cause plants and 
animals to alter their timing of seasonal events (high confidence) 
and to move their geographic ranges (high confidence). Risks 
escalate with additional near-term warming in all regions and domains 
(high confidence). Without urgent and deep emissions reductions, some 
species and ecosystems, especially those in polar and already-warm 
areas, will face temperatures beyond their historical experience in 
coming decades (e.g., >20% of species on some tropical landscapes and 
coastlines at 1.5°C global warming). Unique and threatened ecosystems 
are expected to be at high risk in the very near term at 1.2°C global 
warming levels (very high confidence) due to mass tree mortality, coral 
reef bleaching, large declines in sea-ice-dependent species and mass 
mortality events from heatwaves. Even for less vulnerable species and 
systems, projected climate change risks surpass hard limits to natural 
adaptation, increasing species at high risk of population declines 
(medium confidence) and loss of critical habitats (medium to high 
confidence) and compromising ecosystem structure, functioning and 
resilience (medium confidence). At a global warming of 2°C with 
associated changes in precipitation global land area burned by wildfire 
is projected to increase by 35% (medium confidence). (Figure  TS.5 
ECOSYSTEMS) {2.5.1, 2.5.2, 2.5.3, 2.5.4, 2.6.1, Figure 2.6, Figure 2.7, 
Figure 2.8, Figure 2.9, Figure 2.11, Table 2.5, 3.4.2, 3.4.3, 3.5.5, 4.5.5, 
9.6.2, 11.3.1, 11.3.2, 12.3, 13.10.2, 14.5.1, 14.5.2, 15.3.3, 16.4.2, 16.4.3, 
CCP1.2.1, CCP1.2.4, CCP5.3.2, CCP7.3, CCB DEEP, CCB SLR}
TS.C.1.2 Risks to ecosystem integrity, functioning and resilience 
are projected to escalate with every tenth of a degree increase 
in global warming (very high confidence). Beginning at 1.5°C 
warming, natural adaptation faces hard limits, driving high risks of 
biodiversity decline, mortality, species extinction and loss of related 
livelihoods (high confidence). At 1.6°C (median estimate), >10% of 
species are projected to become endangered, increasing to >20% 
at 2.1°C, representing severe biodiversity risk (medium confidence). 
These risks escalate with warming, most rapidly and severely in areas 
at both extremes of temperature and precipitation (high confidence). 
With warming of 3°C, >80% of marine species across large parts of the 
tropical Indian and Pacific Ocean will experience potentially dangerous 
climate conditions (medium confidence). Beyond 4°C warming, 
projected impacts expand, including extirpation of approx. 50% of 
tropical marine species (medium confidence) and biome shifts (changes 
in the major vegetation form of an ecosystem) across 35% of global 
land area (medium confidence). These will lead to a shift of much of 
the Amazon rainforest to drier and lower-biomass vegetation (medium 
confidence), poleward shifts of boreal forest into treeless tundra across 
the Arctic and upslope shifts of montane forests into alpine grassland

TS.C.1.3 Damage and degradation of ecosystems exacerbate 
the projected impacts of climate change on biodiversity (high 
confidence). Space for nature is shrinking as large areas of 
forest are lost to deforestation (high confidence), peat draining 
and agricultural expansion, land reclamation and protection 
structures in urban and coastal settlements (high confidence). 
Currently less than 15% of the land and 8% of the ocean are under some 
form of protection, and enforcement of protection is often weak (high 
confidence). Future ecosystem vulnerability will strongly depend on 
developments in society, including demographic and economic change 
(high confidence). Deforestation is projected to increase the threat to 
terrestrial ecosystems, as is increasing the use of hard coastal protection 
of cities and settlements by the sea for coastal ecosystems. Coordinated 
and well-monitored habitat restoration, protection and management, 
combined with consumer pressure and incentives, can reduce non-
climatic impacts and increase resilience (high confidence). Adaptation 
and mitigation options, such as afforestation, dam construction and 
coastal infrastructure placements, can increase vulnerability, compete 
for land and water and generate risks for the integrity and functioning 
of ecosystems (high confidence). {2.2, 2.3, 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.4.3, 2.5.4, 
2.6.2, 2.6.3, 2.6.4, 2.6.5, 2.6.6, 2.6.7, Figure 2.1, 3.4.2, 3.5, 3.6.3, 4.5.5,

NATURAL, CCB SLR}
TS.C.1.4 Changes induced by climate change in the physiology, 
biomass, structure and extent of ecosystems will determine 
their future carbon storage capacity (high confidence). In 
terrestrial ecosystems, the fertilisation effects of high atmospheric 
CO2 concentrations on carbon uptake will be increasingly saturated 
and limited by warming and drought (medium confidence). Increases 
in wildfires, tree mortality, insect pest outbreaks, peatland drying and 
permafrost thaw (high confidence) all exacerbate self-reinforcing 
feedbacks between emissions from high-carbon ecosystems and 
warming with the potential to turn many ecosystems that are currently 
net carbon sinks into sources (medium confidence). In coastal areas 
beyond 1.5°C warming, blue carbon storage by mangroves, marshes 
and seagrass habitats are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels 
and the intensity, duration and extent of marine heatwaves, as well as 
adaptation options (including coastal development) (high confidence). 
Changes in ocean stratification are projected to reduce nutrient supply 
and alter the magnitude and efficiency of the biological carbon pump 
(medium confidence). {2.5.2, 2.5.3, 2.5.4, Figure 2.9, Figure 2.11, 3.2.2, 
3.4.2, 3.4.3, Box  3.4, 9.5.10, 9.6.2, 10.4.2, 10.4.3, 11.3.1, 11.3.4,

15.3.3, CCB SLR, CCP1.2.4, CCP1.3, CCP7.3, WGI AR6 5.4}
TS.C.1.5 Extinction risk increases disproportionately from global 
warming of 1.5°C to 3°C and is especially high for endemic 
species and species rendered less resilient by human-induced 
non-climate stressors (very high confidence). The median values 
for percentage of species at very high risk of extinction are 9% at 
1.5°C, 10% at 2°C, 12% at 3°C, 13% at 4°C and 15% at 5°C (high 
confidence), with the likely range of estimates having a maximum of 
14% at 1.5°C and rising to a maximum of 48% at 5°C. Extinction risks 
are higher for species in biodiversity hotspots (medium confidence), 
reaching 24% of species at very high extinction risk above 1.5°C, 
with yet higher proportions for endemic species of 84% in mountains 
(medium confidence) and 100% on islands (medium confidence). 
Thousands of individual populations are projected to be locally lost, 
which will reduce species diversity in some areas where there are no 
species moving in to replace them, for example, in tropical systems 
(high confidence). Novel species interactions at the cold edge of 
species’ distribution may also lead to extirpations and extinctions of 
newly encountered species (low confidence). Palaeo records indicate 
that at extreme warming levels (>5°C), mass extinctions of species 
occur (medium confidence). Among the thousands of species at risk, 
many are species of ecological, cultural and economic importance.

13.10.2, CCP1.2.1¸ CCP1.2.4, CCP5.3.1, CCB PALEO}
TS.C.2  Cumulative stressors and extreme events are projected 
to increase in magnitude and frequency (very high confidence) 
and will accelerate projected climate-driven shifts in eco­
systems and loss of the services they provide to people (high 
confidence). These processes will exacerbate both stress on 
systems already at risk from climate impacts and non-climate 
impacts like habitat fragmentation and pollution (high 
confidence). The increasing frequency and severity of extreme 
events will decrease the recovery time available for ecosystems 
(high confidence). Irreversible changes will occur from the 
interaction of stressors and the occurrence of extreme events 
(very high confidence), such as the expansion of arid systems 
or total loss of stony coral and sea ice communities. {2.3, 2.3.1, 
3.2.2, 3.4.2, 3.4.3, 13.3.1, 13.4.1, 13.10.2, 14.5.2, 14.5.5, 14.5.9, 
Box 14.2, Box 14.4}
TS.C.2.1. Ecosystem integrity is threatened by the positive 
feedback between direct human impacts (land use change, 
pollution, overexploitation, fragmentation and destruction) and 
climate change (high confidence). In the case of the Amazon forest, 
this could lead to large-scale ecological transformations and shifts 
from a closed, wet forest into a drier and lower-biomass vegetation 
(medium confidence). If these pressures are not successfully addressed, 
the combined and interactive effects between climate change, 
deforestation and forest degradation, and forest fires are projected 
to lead to a reduction of over 60% of the area covered by forest in 
response to 2.5°C global warming level (medium confidence). Some 
habitat-forming coastal ecosystems, including many coral reefs, kelp 
forests and seagrass meadows, will undergo irreversible phase shifts 
due to marine heatwaves with global warming levels >1.5°C and are 
at high risk this century even in <1.5°C scenarios that include periods 
of temperature overshoot beyond 1.5°C (high confidence). Under 
SSP1–2.6, coral reefs are at risk of widespread decline, loss of structural 
integrity and transitioning to net erosion by mid-century due to the 
increasing intensity and frequency of marine heatwaves (very high 
confidence). Due to these impacts, the rate of sea level rise is very likely 
57
Technical Summary
TS
to exceed that of reef growth by 2050, absent adaptation. In response 
to heatwaves, bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef is projected to occur 
annually if warming increases above 2.0°C, resulting in widespread 
decline and loss of structural integrity (very high confidence). Global 
warming of 3.0°C–3.5°C increases the likelihood of extreme and lethal 
heat events in western and northern Africa (medium confidence) and 
across Asia. Drought risks are projected to increase in many regions 
over the 21st century (very high confidence). {2.5.2, 2.5.4, 3.4.2, 3.4.3, 
9.5.3, 9.10, 10.2.1, 10.3.7, 11.3.1, 11.3.2, Box 11.2, Table 11.14, 13.3.1, 
13.4.1, 14.5.3, Box 14.3, CCP7.3.6}
TS.C.2.2 Pests, weeds and disease occurrence and distribution 
are projected to increase with global warming, amplified by 
climate change induced extreme events (e.g., droughts, floods, 
heatwaves and wildfires), with negative consequences for 
ecosystem health, food security, human health and livelihoods 
(medium confidence). Invasive plant species are predicted to expand 
both in latitude and altitude (high confidence). Climatically disrupted 
ecosystems will make organisms more susceptible to disease via 
reduced immunity and biodiversity losses, which can increase disease 
transmission. Risks of climate-driven emerging zoonoses will increase. 
Depending on location and human–wildlife interactions, climate-driven 
shifts in distributions of wild animals increase the risk of emergence of 
novel human infectious diseases, as has occurred with SARS, MERS and 
SARS-CoV-2 (medium confidence). Changes in the rates of reproduction 
and distribution of weeds, insect pests, pathogens and disease vectors 
will increase biotic stress on crops, forests and livestock (medium 
evidence, high agreement). Pest and disease outbreaks will require 
greater use of control measures, increasing the cost of production, 
food safety impacts and the risk of biodiversity loss and ecosystem 
impacts. These control measures will become costlier under climate 
change (medium confidence). {2.4.2, 2.5.1, 2.5.2, 3.5.5, 4.2.4, 4.2.5, 
4.3.1, 5.4.1, 5.4.3, 5.5.2, 5.9.4, 5.12, 11.3.1, 13.5.1, 14.5.4, 14.5.6, CCB 
ILLNESS, CCB MOVING PLATE, CCB COVID}
TS.C.2.3 The ability of natural ecosystems to provide carbon stor-
age and sequestration is increasingly impacted by heat, wildfire, 
droughts, loss and degradation of vegetation from land use and 
other impacts (high confidence). Limiting the global temperature 
increase to 1.5°C, compared to 2°C, could reduce projected permafrost 
CO2 losses by 2100 by 24.2 GtC (low confidence). A temperature rise of 
4°C by 2100 is projected to increase global burned area 50–70% and 
fire frequency by approx. 30%, potentially releasing 11–200 GtC from 
the Arctic alone (medium confidence). Changes in plankton community 
structure and productivity are projected to reduce carbon sequestration 
at depth (low to medium confidence). {2.5.2, 2.5.3, 2.5.4, Figure 2.11, 
Table 2.5, 3.4.2, 3.4.3, 3.4.2, 4.2.4, 13.3.1, 13.4.1, Box 14.7, Box 3.4}
TS.C.2.4 Climate change impacts on marine ecosystems are 
projected to lead to profound changes and irreversible losses 
in many regions, with negative consequences for human ways 
of life, economy and cultural identity (medium confidence). For 
example, by 2100, 18.8% ± 19.0% to 38.9% ± 9.4% of the ocean 
will very likely undergo a change of more than 20  days (advances 
and delays) in the start of the phytoplankton growth period under 
SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 respectively (low confidence). This altered 
timing increases the risk of temporal mismatches between plankton 
blooms and fish spawning seasons (medium to high confidence) and 
increases the risk of fish recruitment failure for species with restricted 
spawning locations, especially in mid- to high latitudes of the northern 
hemisphere (low confidence) but provide short-term opportunities to 
countries benefiting from shifting fish stocks (medium confidence).

CCB MOVING SPECIES}
TS.C.2.5 Warming pathways that temporarily increase global 
mean temperature over 1.5°C above pre-industrial for multi-
decadal time spans imply severe risks and irreversible impacts 
in many ecosystems (high confidence). Major risks include loss of 
coastal ecosystems such as wetlands and marshlands from committed 
sea level rise associated with overshoot warming (medium confidence), 
coral reefs and kelps from heat-related mortality and associated 
ecosystem transitions (high confidence), disruption of water flows in 
high-elevation ecosystems from glacier loss and shrinking snow cover, 
and local extinctions of terrestrial species. {2.5, 3.4.2, 3.4.4, 4.7.4, 
9.6.2, 12.3, 13.10.2, CCP5.3.1}
Food systems and food security
TS.C.3  Climate change will increasingly add pressure on food 
production systems, undermining food security (high confidence). 
With every increment of warming, exposure to climate hazards 
will grow substantially (high confidence), and adverse impacts 
on all food sectors will become prevalent, further stressing 
food security (high confidence). Regional disparity in risks to 
food security will grow with warming levels, increasing poverty 
traps, particularly in regions characterised by a high level of 
human vulnerability (high confidence). (Figure  TS.4) {4.5.1, 
4.6.1, 5.2.2, 5.4.3, 5.4.4, 5.5.3, 5.8.3, 5.9.3, 5.12.4, 7.3.1, 9.8.2, 
9.8.5, 13.5.1, 14.5.4, 16.5.2, 16.6.3, CCB MOVING PLATE}
TS.C.3.1 Climate change will increasingly add pressure on 
terrestrial food production systems with every increment of 
warming (high confidence). Some current global crop and livestock 
areas will become climatically unsuitable depending on the emissions 
scenario (high confidence; 10% globally by 2050, by 2100 over 30% 
under SSP-8.5 versus below 8% under SSP1-2.6). Compared to 1.5°C 
global warming level, 2°C global warming level will even further 
negatively impact food production where current temperatures are 
already high as in lower latitudes (high confidence). Increased and 
potentially concurrent climate extremes will increase simultaneous 
losses in major food-producing regions (medium confidence). The 
adverse effects of climate change on food production will become 
more severe when global temperatures rise by more than 2°C (high 
confidence). At 3°C or higher global warming levels, exposure to 
climate hazards will grow substantially (high confidence), further 
stressing food production, notably in sub-Saharan Africa and South 
and South East Asia (high confidence). (Figure TS.4) {4.5.1, 4.6.1, 5.2.2, 
5.4.3, 5.4.4, 5.5.3, 5.8.3, 5.9.3, 5.12.4, 9.8.2, 9.8.5, 11.3.4, 13.5.1, 
14.5.4, 16.5.2, 16.6.3, CCB MOVING PLATE}
TS.C.3.2 Climate change will significantly alter aquatic food 
provisioning services, with direct impacts on food-insecure 
people (high confidence). Global ocean animal biomass will

Absence of risk diagrams does not imply absence of risks within a 
region. The development of synthetic diagrams for Small Islands, Asia and Central and 
South America was limited due to the paucity of adequately downscaled climate projections, 
with uncertainty in the direction of change, the diversity of climatologies and socioeconomic 
contexts across countries within a region, and the resulting few numbers of impact and risk 
projections for different warming levels.

decrease by 5.7% ± 4.1% and 15.5% ± 8.5% under SSP1-2.6 and 
SSP5-8.5 respectively by 2080–2099 relative to 1995–2014 (medium 
confidence), affecting food provisioning, revenue value and distribution. 
Catch composition will change regionally, and the vulnerability of 
fishers will partially depend on their ability to move, diversify and 
leverage technology (medium confidence). Global marine aquaculture 
will decline under increasing temperature and acidification conditions 
by 2100, with potential short-term gains for finfish aquaculture in 
some temperate regions and overall negative impacts on bivalve 
aquaculture due to habitat reduction (medium confidence). Changes 
in precipitation, sea level rise, temperature and extreme events will 
negatively affect food provisioning from inland aquatic systems 
(medium confidence), which provide a significant source of livelihoods 
and food for direct human consumption, particularly in Asia and Africa.

TS.C.3.3 Climate change will increasingly add significant 
pressure and regionally different impacts on all components 
of food systems, undermining all dimensions of food security 
(high confidence). Extreme weather events will increase risks 
of food insecurity via spikes in food prices, reduced food diversity 
and reduced income for agricultural and fishery livelihoods (high 
confidence), preventing achievement of the UN SDG 2 (‘Zero Hunger’) 
by 2030 in regions with limited adaptive capacities, including Africa, 
small island states and South Asia (high confidence). With about 2°C 
warming, climate-related changes in food availability and diet quality 
are estimated to increase nutrition-related diseases and the number of 
undernourished people by 2050, affecting tens (under low vulnerability 
and low warming) to hundreds of millions of people (under high 
vulnerability and high warming, i.e., SSP-3-RCP6.0), particularly among 
low-income households in low- and middle-income countries in sub-
Saharan Africa, South Asia and Central America (high confidence), for 
example, between 8 million under SSP1-6.0 to up to 80 million people 
under SSP3-6.0. At 3°C or higher global warming levels, adverse 
impacts on all food sectors will become prevalent, further stressing 
food availability (high confidence), agricultural labour productivity and 
food access (medium confidence). Regional disparity in risks to food 
security will grow at these higher warming levels, increasing poverty 
traps, particularly in regions characterised by a high level of human 
vulnerability (high confidence). {4.5.1, 4.6.1, 5.2.2, 5.4.3, 5.4.4, 5.5.3,

TS.C.3.4 Climate change is projected to increase malnutrition 
through reduced nutritional quality, access to balanced food 
and inequality (high confidence). Increased CO2 concentrations 
promote crop growth and yield but reduce the density of important 
nutrients in some crops (high confidence) with projected increases in 
undernutrition and micronutrient deficiency, particularly in countries 
that currently have high levels of nutrient deficiency (high confidence) 
and regions with low access to diverse foods (medium confidence). 
Marine-dependent communities, including Indigenous Peoples and 
local peoples, will be at increased risk of malnutrition due to losses of 
seafood-sourced nutrients (medium confidence). {3.5.3, 5.2.2, 5.4.2, 
(a)  Global surface temperature changes in °C relative to 1850–1900. These changes were obtained by combining CMIP6 model simulations with observational constraints based 
on past simulated warming, as well as an updated assessment of equilibrium climate sensitivity (Box TS.2). Changes relative to 1850–1900 based on 20-year averaging periods are 
calculated by adding 0.85°C (the observed global surface temperature increase from 1850–1900 to 1995–2014) to simulated changes relative to 1995–2014. Very likely ranges 
are shown for SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0 (WGI AR6 Figure SPM.8). Assessments were carried out at the global scale for (b), (c), (d) and (e).
(b)  The Reasons for Concern (RFC) framework communicates scientific understanding about accrual of risk for five broad categories. Diagrams are shown for each RFC, assuming 
low to no adaptation (i.e., adaptation is fragmented, localized and comprises incremental adjustments to existing practices). However, the transition to a very high risk level has an 
emphasis on irreversibility and adaptation limits. Undetectable risk level (white) indicates no associated impacts are detectable and attributable to climate change; moderate risk 
(yellow) indicates associated impacts are both detectable and attributable to climate change with at least medium confidence, also accounting for the other specific criteria for key 
risks; high risk (red) indicates severe and widespread impacts that are judged to be high on one or more criteria for assessing key risks; and very high risk level (purple) indicates 
very high risk of severe impacts and the presence of significant irreversibility or the persistence of climate-related hazards, combined with limited ability to adapt due to the nature 
of the hazard or impacts/risks. The horizontal line denotes the present global warming of 1.09°C which is used to separate the observed, past impacts below the line from the future 
projected risks above it. RFC1: Unique and threatened systems: ecological and human systems that have restricted geographic ranges constrained by climate-related conditions and 
have high endemism or other distinctive properties. Examples include coral reefs, the Arctic and its Indigenous Peoples, mountain glaciers and biodiversity hotspots. RFC2: Extreme 
weather events: risks/impacts to human health, livelihoods, assets and ecosystems from extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rain, drought and associated wildfires, 
and coastal flooding. RFC3: Distribution of impacts: risks/impacts that disproportionately affect particular groups due to uneven distribution of physical climate change hazards, 
exposure or vulnerability. RFC4: Global aggregate impacts: impacts to socio-ecological systems that can be aggregated globally into a single metric, such as monetary damages, lives 
affected, species lost or ecosystem degradation at a global scale. RFC5: Large-scale singular events: relatively large, abrupt and sometimes irreversible changes in systems caused 
by global warming, such as ice sheet disintegration or thermohaline circulation slowing. Assessment methods are described in SM16.6 and are identical to AR5, but are enhanced 
by a structured approach to improve robustness and facilitate comparison between AR5 and AR6. Risks for (c) terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems and (d) ocean ecosystems. 
For (c) and (d), diagrams shown for each risk assume low to no adaptation. The transition to a very high risk level has an emphasis on irreversibility and adaptation limits.
(e)  Climate-sensitive human health outcomes under three scenarios of adaptation effectiveness. The assessed projections were based on a range of scenarios, including SRES, 
CMIP5, and ISIMIP, and, in some cases, demographic trends. The diagrams are truncated at the nearest whole °C within the range of temperature change in 2100 under three SSP 
scenarios in panel (a).
(f)  Examples of regional key risks. Risks identified are of at least medium confidence level. Key risks are identified based on the magnitude of adverse consequences (pervasiveness 
of the consequences, degree of change, irreversibility of consequences, potential for impact thresholds or tipping points, potential for cascading effects beyond system boundaries); 
likelihood of adverse consequences; temporal characteristics of the risk; and ability to respond to the risk, e.g., by adaptation. The full set of 127 assessed global and regional key 
risks is given in SMTS.4 and SM16.7. Diagrams are provided for some risks. The development of synthetic diagrams for Small Islands, Asia and Central and South America were 
limited by the availability of adequately downscaled climate projections, with uncertainty in the direction of change, the diversity of climatologies and socio-economic contexts 
across countries within a region, and the resulting low number of impact and risk projections for different warming levels. Absence of risks diagrams does not imply absence 
of risks within a region. (Box TS.2) {Figure 2.11, Figure SM3.1, Figure 7.9, Figure 9.6, Figure 11.6, Figure 13.28, 16.5, 16.6, Figure 16.15, SM16.3, SM16.4, SM16.5, SM16.6

TS.C.3.5 Climate change will further increase pressures on 
those terrestrial ecosystem services which support global food 
production systems (high confidence). Climate change will reduce 
the effectiveness of pollination as species are lost from certain areas, or 
the coordination of pollinator activity and flower receptiveness will be 
disrupted in some regions (high confidence). Greenhouse gas emissions 
will negatively impact air, soil and water quality, exacerbating direct 
climatic impacts on yields (high confidence). {5.4.3, 5.5.3, 5.7.1, 5.7.4,

TS.C.3.6 Climate change will compromise food safety through 
multiple pathways (high confidence).  Higher temperatures and 
humidity will expand the risk of aflatoxin contamination into higher-
latitude regions (high confidence). More frequent and intense flood 
events and increased melting of snow and ice will increase food 
contamination (high confidence). Aquatic food safety will decrease 
through increased detrimental impacts from harmful algal blooms 
(high confidence) and human exposure to elevated bioaccumulation 
of persistent organic pollutants and methylmercury (low to medium 
confidence). These negative food safety impacts will be greater without 
adaptation and fall disproportionately on low-income countries and 
communities with high consumption of seafood, including coastal 
Indigenous communities (medium confidence). {3.6.3, 5.4.3, 5.8.1,

warming levels, with risks being proportionally lower at 1.5°C 
than at higher degrees of warming (high confidence). Regions 
and populations with higher exposure and vulnerability are pro-
jected to face greater risks than others (medium confidence). 
Projected changes in the water cycle, water quality, cryosphere 
changes, drought and flood will negatively impact natural and 
human systems (high confidence). {2.5.1, 2.5.2, 2.5.3, 2.5.4,

TS.C.4.1 Water-related risks are projected to increase with 
every increment in warming level, and the impacts will be felt 
disproportionately by vulnerable people in regions with high 
exposure and vulnerability (high confidence). About 800 million 
to 3 billion people at 2°C and about 4 billion at 4°C warming are 
projected to experience different levels of water scarcity (medium 
confidence), leading to increased water insecurity. At 4°C global 
warming by the end of the century, approximately 10% of the global 
land area is projected to face simultaneously increasing high extreme 
streamflow and decreasing low extreme streamflow, affecting over 
2.1 billion people (medium confidence). Globally, the greatest risks to 
attaining global sustainability goals come from risks to water security 
(high confidence). {4.4.1, 4.4.3, 4.4.5, 4.5.4, 4.6.1, Box 4.2, 5.8.3, 5.9.3,

TS.C.4.2 Projected cryosphere changes will negatively impact 
water security and livelihoods, with higher severity of risks 
at higher levels of global warming (high confidence). Glacier 
mass loss, permafrost thaw and decline in snow cover are projected 
to continue beyond the 21st century (high confidence). Many low-
elevation and small glaciers around the world will lose most of their 
total mass at 1.5°C warming (high confidence). Glaciers are likely to 
disappear by nearly 50% in High Mountain Asia and about 70% in 
Central and Western Asia by the end of the 21st century under the 
medium warming scenario. Glacier lake outburst flood will threaten 
the security of local and downstream communities in High Mountain 
Asia (high confidence). By 2100, annual runoff in one-third of the 56 
large-scale glacierised catchments are projected to decline by over 
10%, with the most significant reductions in Central Asia and the 
Andes (medium confidence). Cryosphere related changes in floods, 
landslides and water availability have the potential to lead to severe 
consequences for people, infrastructure and the economy in most 
mountain regions (high confidence). {4.4.2, 4.4.3, 4.5.8, 9.5.8, 10.4.4,

TS.C.4.3 Projected changes in the water cycle will impact 
various ecosystem services (medium confidence). By 2050, 
environmentally critical streamflow is projected to be affected in 
42% to 79% of the world’s watersheds, causing negative impacts 
on freshwater ecosystems (medium confidence). Increased wildfire, 
combined with soil erosion due to deforestation, could degrade water 
supplies (medium confidence). Projected climate-driven water cycle 
changes, including increases in evapotranspiration, altered spatial 
patterns and amount of precipitation, and associated changes in 
groundwater recharge, runoff and streamflow, will impact terrestrial, 
freshwater, estuarine and coastal ecosystems and the transport of 
materials through the biogeochemical cycles, impacting humans 
and societal well-being (medium confidence). In Africa, 55–68% 
of commercially harvested inland fish species are vulnerable to 
extinction under 2.5°C global warming by 2071–2100. In Central and 
South America, disruption in water flows will significantly degrade 
ecosystems such as high-elevation wetlands (high confidence). {2.5.1, 
2.5.2, 2.5.3, 2.5.4, 2.6.3, 3.5.5, 3.5.5, 4.4.1, 4.4.3, 4.4.5, 4.4.6, 4.5.4,

TS.C.4.4  Drought risks and related societal damage are 
projected to increase with every degree of warming (medium 
confidence). Under RCP6.0 and SSP2, the population that is projected 
to be exposed to extreme to exceptional low total water storage will 
reach up to 7% over the 21st century (medium confidence). Under 
RCP8.5, aridity zones could expand by one-quarter of the 1990 area 
by 2100. In southern Europe, more than a third of the population 
will be exposed to water scarcity at 2°C, and the risk doubles at 3°C, 
with significant economic losses (medium confidence).  Over large

areas of northern South America, the Mediterranean, western China 
and high latitudes in North America and Eurasia, the frequency of 
extreme agricultural droughts is projected to be 150% to 200% more 
likely at 2°C and over 200% more likely at 4°C (medium confidence). 
Above 2°C, the frequency and duration of meteorological drought are 
projected to double over North Africa, the western Sahel and southern 
Africa (medium confidence). More droughts and extreme fire weather 
are projected in southern and eastern Australia (high confidence) and 
over most of New Zealand (medium confidence). {4.5.1, 4.6.1, Box 4.1,

TS.C.4.5 Flood risks and societal damages are projected to 
increase with every increment of global warming (medium 
confidence). The projected increase in precipitation intensity (high 
confidence) will increase rain-generated local flooding (medium 
confidence). Direct flood damage is projected to increase by four to five 
times at 4°C compared to 1.5°C (medium confidence). A higher sea level 
with storm surge further inland may create more severe coastal flooding 
(high confidence). Projected intensifications of the hydrological cycle 
pose increasing risks, including potential doubling of flood risk and 
1.2- to 1.8-fold increase in GDP loss due to flooding between 1.5°C and 
3°C (medium confidence). Projected increase in heavy rainfall events 
at all levels of warming in many regions in Africa will cause increasing 
exposure to pluvial and riverine flooding  (high confidence), with 
expected human displacement increasing 200% for 1.6°C and 600% 
for 2.6°C. A 1.5°C increase would result in an increase of 100–200% 
in the population affected by floods in Colombia, Brazil and Argentina, 
300% in Ecuador and 400% in Peru (medium confidence). In Europe, 
above 3°C global warming level, the costs of damage and people 
affected by precipitation and river flooding may double. {4.4.1, 4.4.4,

TS.C.4.6 Projected water cycle changes will impact agriculture, 
energy production and urban water uses (medium confidence). 
Agricultural water use will increase globally as a consequence of 
population increase and dietary changes, as well as increased water 
requirements due to climate change (high confidence). Groundwater 
recharge in some semiarid regions are projected to increase, but 
worldwide depletion of non-renewable groundwater storage will 
continue due to increased groundwater demand (medium to high 
confidence). Increased floods and droughts, together with heat stress, 
will have an adverse impact on food availability and prices, resulting 
in increased undernourishment in South and Southeast Asia (high 
confidence). In the Mediterranean and parts of Europe, potential 
reductions of hydropower of up to 40% are projected under 3°C 
warming, while declines below 10% and 5% are projected under 
2°C and 1.5°C warming levels respectively. An additional 350 and 
410  million people living in urban areas will be exposed to water 
scarcity from severe droughts at 1.5°C and 2°C respectively. {2.5.3,

Risks from sea level rise
TS.C.5  Coastal risks will increase by at least one order of mag-
nitude over the 21st century due to committed sea level rise 
impacting ecosystems, people, livelihoods, infrastructure, food 
security, cultural and natural heritage and climate mitigation 
at the coast. Concentrated in cities and settlements by the sea, 
these risks are already being faced and will accelerate beyond 
2050 and continue to escalate beyond 2100, even if warming 
stops. Historically rare extreme sea level events will occur annu-
ally by 2100, compounding these risks (high confidence). {3.4.2, 
3.5.5, 3.6.3, 9.9.4, Box 11.6, 13.2, Box 13.1, 14.5.2, Box 14.4, 
CCP2.2, CCB SLR}
TS.C.5.1 Under all emissions scenarios, coastal wetlands will 
likely face high risk from sea level rise in the mid-term (medium 
confidence), with substantial losses before 2100. These risks will 
be compounded where coastal development prevents upshore 
migration of habitats or where terrestrial sediment inputs are 
limited and tidal ranges are small (high confidence). Loss of these 
habitats disrupts associated ecosystem services, including wave-energy 
attenuation, habitat provision for biodiversity, climate mitigation and 
food and fuel resources (high confidence). Near- to mid-term sea 
level rise will also exacerbate coastal erosion and submersion and 
the salinisation of coastal groundwater, expanding the loss of many 
different coastal habitats, ecosystems and ecosystem services (medium 
confidence). {3.4.2, 3.5.2, 3.5.5, 3.6.3, 9.6.2, 11.3.1, 13.4.1, 13.4.2, 
14.5.2, CCB NATURAL, CCB SLR}
TS.C.5.2 The exposure of many coastal populations and 
associated development to sea level rise is high, increasing risks, 
and is concentrated in and around coastal cities and settlements 
(virtually certain). High population growth and urbanisation in 
low-lying coastal zones will be the major driver of increasing exposure 
to sea level rise in the coming decades (high confidence). By 2030, 108–
116 million people will be exposed to sea level rise in Africa (compared 
to 54 million in 2000), increasing to 190–245 million by 2060 (medium 
confidence). By 2050, more than a billion people located in low-lying 
cities and settlements will be at risk from coast-specific climate 
hazards, influenced by coastal geomorphology, geographical location 
and adaptation action (high confidence). {9.9.1, 9.9.4, Box 11.6, 14.5.2, 
Box 14.4, CCP2.2, CCB SLR}
TS.C.5.3 Under all climate and socioeconomic scenarios, low-
lying cities and settlements, small islands, Arctic communities, 
remote Indigenous communities and deltaic communities 
will face severe disruption by 2100, and as early as 2050 in 
many cases (very high confidence). Large numbers of people are 
at risk in Asia, Africa and Europe, while a large relative increase in 
risk occurs in small island states and in parts of North and South 
America and Australasia. Risks to water security will occur as early as 
2030 or earlier for the small island states and Torres Strait Islands in 
Australia and remote Maori communities in New Zealand. By 2100, 
compound and cascading risks will result in the submergence of some 
low-lying island states and damage to coastal heritage, livelihoods 
and infrastructure (very high confidence). Sea level rise, combined 
with altered rainfall patterns, will increase coastal inundation and

TS.C.5.4 Risks to coastal cities and settlements are projected to 
increase by at least one order of magnitude by 2100 without 
significant adaptation and mitigation action (high confidence). 
The population at risk in coastal cities and settlements from a 100-
year coastal flood increases by approx. 20% if the global mean sea 
level rises by 0.15 m relative to current levels, doubles at 0.75 m and 
triples at 1.4 m, assuming present-day population and protection 
height (high confidence). For example, in Europe, coastal flood 
damage is projected to increase at least 10-fold by the end of the 
21st century, and even more or earlier with current adaptation and 
mitigation (high confidence). By 2100, 158–510 million people and 
USD7,919–12,739 billion in assets are projected to be exposed to the 
1-in-100-year coastal floodplain under RCP4.5, and 176–880 million 
people and USD8,813–14,178  billion assets under RCP8.5 (high 
confidence).  Projected impacts reach far beyond coastal cities and 
settlements, with damage to ports potentially severely compromising 
global supply chains and maritime trade, with local to global geopolitical 
and economic ramifications (medium confidence). Compounded and 
cascading climate risks, such as tropical cyclone storm surge damage 
to coastal infrastructure and supply chain networks, are expected to 
increase (medium confidence). (Figure TS.9 URBAN) {3.5.5, 3.6.2, 6.2.5,

Particularly 
exposed 
and 
vulnerable 
coastal 
communities,­ especially those relying on coastal  ecosystems 
for protection or  livelihoods, may face adaptation limits well 
before the end of this century, even at low warming levels (high 
­confidence).  Changes in wave climate superimposed on sea level 
rise will significantly increase coastal flooding (high confidence) and 
erosion of low-lying coastal and reef islands (limited evidence, medium 
agreement). The frequency, extent and duration of coastal flooding will 
significantly increase from 2050 (high confidence), unless coastal and 
marine ecosystems are able to naturally adapt to sea level rise through 
vertical growth and landward migration (low confidence). Permafrost 
thaw, sea level rise, and reduced sea ice protection is projected to 
damage or cause loss to many cultural heritage sites, settlements 
and livelihoods across the Arctic (very high confidence).  Deltaic 
cities and settlements characterised by high inequality and informal 
settlements are especially vulnerable (high confidence). Although 
risks are distributed across cities and settlements at all levels of 
economic development, wealthier and more urbanised coastal cities 
and settlements are more likely to be able to limit impacts and risk 
in the near- to mid-term through infrastructure resilience and coastal 
protection interventions, with highly uncertain prospects in many of 
these locations beyond 2100 (high confidence). Prospects for enabling 
and contributing to climate resilient development thus vary markedly 
within and between coastal cities and settlements (high confidence).

Health and well-being
TS.C.6  Climate change will increase the number of deaths and 
the global burden of non-communicable and infectious diseases 
(high confidence). Over nine million climate-related deaths per 
year are projected by the end of the century, under a high 
emissions scenario and accounting for population growth, 
economic development and adaptation. Health risks will be 
differentiated by gender, age, income, social status and region 
(high confidence). {3.5.5, 3.6.2, 4.5.3, 5.12.4, Box  5.10, 6.2.2,

TS.C.6.1 Future global burdens of climate-sensitive diseases and 
conditions will depend on emissions and adaptation pathways 
and the efficacy of public health systems, interventions and 
sanitation (very high confidence). Projections under mid-range 
emissions scenarios show an additional 250,000 deaths per year 
by 2050 (compared to 1961–1990) due to malaria, heat, childhood 
undernutrition and diarrhoea (high confidence). Overall, more than half 
of this excess mortality is projected for Africa. Mortality and morbidity 
will continue to escalate as exposures become more frequent and 
intense, putting additional strain on health and economic systems (high 
confidence), reducing capacity to respond, particularly in resource-
poor regions. Vulnerable groups include young children (<5 years old), 
the elderly (>65  years old), pregnant women, Indigenous Peoples, 
those with pre-existing diseases, physical labourers and those in low 
socioeconomic conditions (high confidence). {4.5.3, 7.3.1, 9.10.2,

TS.C.6.2 Climate change is expected to have adverse impacts 
on well-being and to further threaten mental health (very 
high confidence). Children and adolescents, particularly girls, as 
well as people with existing mental, physical and medical challenges, 
are particularly at risk (high confidence). Mental health impacts 
are expected to arise from exposure to extreme weather events, 
displacement, migration, famine, malnutrition, degradation or 
destruction of health and social care systems, climate-related economic 
and social losses and anxiety and distress associated with worry about 
climate change (very high confidence). {7.3.1, 11.3.6, 14.5.6, CCP6.2.6, 
Box CCP6.2, CCB COVID}
TS.C.6.3 Increased heat-related mortality and morbidity are 
projected globally (very high confidence). Globally, temperature-
related mortality is projected to increase under RCP4.5 to RCP8.5, even 
with adaptation (very high confidence). Tens of thousands of additional 
deaths are projected under moderate and high global warming 
scenarios, particularly in north, west and central Africa, with up to 
year-round exceedance of deadly heat thresholds by 2100 (RCP8.5) 
(high agreement, robust evidence). In Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, 
urban heat-related excess deaths are projected to increase by about 
300 yr-1 (low emission pathway) to 600 yr-1 (high emission pathway) 
during 2031–2080 relative to 142 yr-1 during 1971–2020 (high

TS.C.6.4 Climate impacts on food systems are projected to 
increase undernutrition and diet-related mortality and risks 
globally (high confidence). Reduced marine and freshwater fisheries 
catch potential is projected to increase malnutrition in East, West 
and Central Africa (medium to high confidence) and in subsistence-
dependent communities across North America (high confidence). 
By 2050, disability-adjusted life years due to undernutrition and 
micronutrient deficiencies are projected to increase by 10% under 
RCP8.5 (medium evidence, high agreement). These projected changes 
will increase diet-related risk factors and related non-communicable 
diseases globally and increase undernutrition, stunting and related 
childhood mortality, particularly in Africa and Asia (high confidence). 
Near-term projections (2030) of undernutrition are the highest for 
children (confidence), which can have lifelong adverse consequences 
for physiological and neurological development as well as for earnings 
capacity. Climate change is projected to put 8  million (SSP1-6.0) 
to 80  million people (SSP3-6.0) at risk of hunger in mid-century, 
concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Central America 
(high confidence). These climate change impacts on nutrition could 
undermine progress towards the eradication of child undernutrition 
(high confidence). {4.5.3, 5.2.2, 5.12.4, Box 5.10, 7.3.1, 9.8.5, 9.10.2,

TS.C.6.5 Vector-borne disease transmission is projected to 
expand to higher latitudes and altitudes, and the duration 
of seasonal transmission risk is projected to increase (high 
confidence), with the greatest risk under high emissions 
scenarios. Dengue vector ranges will increase in North America, Asia, 
Europe and sub-Saharan Africa under RCP6 and RCP8.5, potentially 
putting another 2.25 billion people at risk (high confidence). Higher 
incidence rates of Lyme disease are projected for the Northern 
Hemisphere (high confidence). Climate change is projected to increase 
malaria’s geographic distribution in endemic areas of sub-Saharan 
and southern Africa, Asia and South America (high confidence), 
exposing tens of millions more people to malaria, predominately 
in east and southern Africa, and up to hundreds of millions more 
exposed under RCP8.5 (high confidence). {7.3.1, 9.10.2, Figure 9.32,

TS.C.6.6 Higher temperatures and heavy rainfall events are 
projected to increase rates of water-borne and food-borne 
diseases in many regions (high confidence). At 2.1°C, thousands 
to tens of thousands of additional cases of diarrhoeal disease are 
projected, mainly in central and east Africa (medium confidence). 
Morbidity from cholera will increase in central and east Africa (medium 
confidence), and increased schistosomiasis risk is projected for eastern 
Africa (high confidence). In Asia and Africa, 1°C warming can cause 
a 7% increase in diarrhoea, an 8% increase in E. coli and a 3% to 
11% increase in deaths (medium confidence). Warming increases 
the risk of food-borne disease outbreaks, including Salmonella and 
Campylobacter infections (medium confidence). Warming supports 
the growth and geographical expansion of toxigenic fungi in crops 
(medium confidence) and potentially toxic marine and freshwater algae 
(medium confidence). Food safety risks in fisheries and aquaculture 
are projected through harmful algal blooms (high confidence), 
pathogens (e.g., Vibrio) (high confidence), and human exposure to 
elevated bioaccumulation of persistent organic pollutants and mercury 
(medium confidence). {3.5.5, 3.6.2, 4.5.3, 5.12.4, Box  5.10, 7.3.1,

TS.C.6.7 The burden of several non-communicable diseases is 
projected to increase under climate change (high confidence). 
Cardiovascular disease mortality could increase by 18.4%, 47.8% and 
69.0% in the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s respectively under RCP4.5, and 
by 16.6%, 73.8% and 134% under RCP8.5 compared to the 1980s 
(high confidence). Future risks of respiratory disease associated with 
aeroallergens and ozone exposure are expected to increase (high 
confidence). {7.3.1, 10.4.7, 11.3.6, 12.3.4, 13.7.1}
Migration and displacement
TS.C.7  Migration patterns due to climate change are difficult 
to project as they depend on patterns of population growth, 
adaptive capacity of exposed populations and socioeconomic 
development and migration policies (high confidence). In many 
regions, the frequency and/or severity of floods, extreme storms 
and droughts is projected to increase in coming decades, es-
pecially under high emissions scenarios, raising future risk of 
displacement in the most exposed areas (high confidence). 
Under all global warming levels, some regions that are pres-
ently densely populated will become unsafe or uninhabitable, 
with movement from these regions occurring autonomously 
or through planned relocation (high confidence). {4.5.7, 7.3.2, 
Box 9.8, 15.3.4, CCB MIGRATE}
TS.C.7.1 Future climate-related migration is expected to vary 
by region and over time, according to future climatic drivers, 
patterns of population growth, adaptive capacity of exposed 
populations and international development and migration 
policies (high confidence). Future migration and displacement 
patterns in a changing climate will depend not only on the physical 
impacts of climate change, but also on future policies and planning at 
all scales of governance (high confidence). Projecting the number of 
people migrating due to slow onset events is difficult due to the multi-
causal nature of migration and the dominant role that socioeconomic 
factors have in determining migration responses (high confidence). 
Increased frequency of extreme heat events and long-term increases 
in average temperatures pose future risks to the habitability of 
settlements in low latitudes; this, combined with the urban heat island 
effect, may in the long term affect migration patterns in exposed areas, 
especially under high emissions scenarios, but more evidence is needed. 
High emissions/low development scenarios raise the potential for both 
increased rates of migration and displacement and larger involuntary 
immobile populations that are highly exposed to climatic risks but lack 
the means of moving to other locations (medium confidence). {4.5.7,

Box 9.8, CCP 6.3.2, CCB MIGRATE}
TS.C.7.2 Estimates of displacement from rapid-onset extreme 
events exist; however, the range of estimates is large as they 
largely depend on assumptions made about future emissions 
and socioeconomic development trajectories (high confidence). 
Uncertainties about socioeconomic development are reflected in the 
wide range of projected population displacements by 2050 in Central 
and South America, sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia due to climate 
change, ranging from 31 million to 143 million people (high confidence). 
Projections of the number of people at risk of future displacement 
by sea level rise range from tens of millions to hundreds of millions 
by the end of this century, depending on the level of warmings and 
assumptions about exposure (high confidence). (Figure TS.9 URBAN)

CCB SLR, Figure AI.42}
TS.C.7.3 As climate risk intensifies, the need for planned 
relocations will increase to support those who are unable to 
move voluntarily (medium confidence). Planned relocation will 
be increasingly required as climate change undermines livelihoods, 
safety and overall habitability, especially for coastal areas and small 
islands (medium confidence). This will have implications for traditional 
livelihood practices, social cohesion and knowledge systems that have 
inherent value as intangible culture as well as introduce new risks for 
communities by amplifying existing and generating new vulnerabilities 
(high confidence). {4.6.8, 15.3.4, 14.4, CCP2.3.5, CCB FEASIB, CCB

Human vulnerability
TS.C.8  Under an inequality scenario (SSP4) by 2030, the number 
of people living in extreme poverty will increase by 122 million 
from currently around 700 million (medium confidence). Future 
climate change may increase involuntary displacement, but 
severe impacts also undermine the capacity of households to use 
mobility as a coping strategy, causing high exposure to climate 
risks, with consequences for basic survival, health and well-
being (high confidence). The COVID-19 pandemic is expected 
to increase the adverse consequences of climate change since 
the financial consequences have led to a shift in priorities and 
constrain vulnerability reduction (medium confidence). {7.3.2,

TS.C.8.1 Even with current, moderate climate change, vulnerable 
people will experience a further erosion of livelihood security 
that can interact with humanitarian crises, such as displacement 
and involuntary migration (high confidence) and violence and 
armed conflict, and lead to social tipping points (medium 
confidence). Under higher emissions scenarios and increasing 
climate hazards, the potential for societal risks also increases 
(medium confidence). Lessons from COVID-19 risk management have 
implications for managing urban climate change risk (limited evidence, 
high agreement). {4.5.1, 4.5.3, 4.5.4, 4.5.7, 4.5.8, 6.1.1, 6.3, 6.4, 8.2.1,

TS.C.8.2 Indigenous Peoples and local communities will 
experience changes in cultural opportunities (low to medium 
confidence). Cultural heritage is already being impacted by climate 
change and variability, for example in Africa, Small Island Developing 
States and the Arctic, where heritage sites are exposed to future 
climate change risk (high confidence). Coastal erosion and sea level 
rise are projected to affect natural and cultural coastal heritage sites 
spread across 36 African countries and all Arctic nations. Frequent 
drought episodes will lower groundwater tables and gradually expose 
highly valued archaeological sites to salt weathering and degradation. 
Coastal inundation and ocean acidification will intensify impacts on 
sacred sites, including burial grounds, and the corrosion of shipwrecks 
and underwater ruins. {3.5.3, 3.5.4, 3.5.5, 3.5.6, 4.5.8, 9.12., 2.1.2,

TS.C.8.3 Climate change increases risks of violent conflict, 
primarily intrastate conflicts, by strengthening climate-sensitive 
drivers (medium confidence). Climate change may produce severe 
risks to peace within this century through climate variability and extremes, 
especially in contexts marked by low economic development, high 
economic dependence on climate-sensitive activities, high or increasing 
social marginalisation and fragile governance (medium confidence). The 
largest impacts are expected in weather-sensitive communities with 
low resilience to climate extremes and high prevalence of underlying 
risk factors (medium confidence). Trajectories that prioritise economic 
growth, political rights and sustainability are associated with lower 
conflict risk (medium confidence). {4.5.6, 7.3.3, 16.5.2}
Cities, settlements and infrastructure
TS.C.9  Climate change increases risks for a larger number of 
growing cities and settlements across wider areas, especially in 
coastal and mountain regions, affecting an additional 2.5 billion 
people residing in cities mainly in Africa and Asia by 2050 (high 
confidence). In all cities and urban areas, projected risks faced 
by people from climate-driven impacts has increased (high 
confidence). Many risks will not be felt evenly across cities and 
settlements or within cities. Communities in informal settlements 
will have higher exposure and lower capacity to adapt (high 
confidence). Most at risk are women and children who make up 
the majority populations of these settlements (high confidence). 
Risks to critical physical infrastructure in cities can be severe 
and pervasive under higher warming levels, potentially resulting 
in compound and cascading risks, and can disrupt livelihoods 
both within and across cities (high confidence). In coastal cities 
and settlements, risks to people and infrastructure will get 
progressively worse in a changing climate, sea level rise and with 
ongoing coastal development (very high confidence). {2.6.5, 6.1, 
6.1.4, 6.2, 9.9.4, 16.5, 14.5.5, Box 14.4, CCP2.2}
TS.C.9.1 An additional 2.5  billion people are projected to 
live in urban areas by 2050, with up to 90% of this increase 
concentrated in the regions of Asia and Africa (high confidence). 
By 2050, 64% and 60% of Asia’s and Africa’s population respectively 
will be urban. Growth is most pronounced in smaller and medium-
sized urban settlements of up to one million people (high confidence).

Technical Summary
TS
TS.C.9.2 Asian and African urban areas are considered high-risk 
locations from projected climate, extreme events, unplanned 
urbanisation and rapid land use change (high confidence). These 
could amplify pre-existing stresses related to poverty, informality, 
exclusion and governance, such as in African cities (high confidence). 
Climate change increases heat stress risks in cities (high confidence) 
and amplifies the urban heat island across Asian cities at 1.5°C and 
2°C warming levels, both substantially larger than under present 
climates (medium confidence). Urban population exposure to extreme 
heat in Africa is projected to increase from 2 billion person-days per 
year in 1985–2005 to 45  billion person-days by the 2060s (1.7°C 
global warming with low population growth) and to 95 billion person-
days (2.8°C global warming with medium-high population growth) 
(medium confidence). Risks driven by flooding and droughts will also 
increase in cities (high confidence). Urban populations exposed to 
severe droughts in West Africa will increase (65.3±34.1 million) at 
1.5°C warming and increase further at 2°C (medium confidence). 
Urban land in flood zones and drylands exposed to high-frequency 
floods is expected to increase by as much as 2600% and 627% 
respectively across East, West and Central Africa by 2030. Higher 
risks from temperature and precipitation extremes are projected for 
almost all Asian cities under RCP8.5 (medium confidence), impacting 
on freshwater availability, regional food security, human health and 
industrial outputs. {4.3.4, 4.3.5, 4.5.4, 6.1, 6.2, Table 6.3, Table 6.4,

URBAN}
TS.C.9.3 Globally, urban key infrastructure systems are 
increasingly sites of risk creation that potentially drive 
compounding and cascading risks (high confidence). Unplanned 
rapid urbanisation is a major driver of risk, particularly where 
increasing climate-driven risks affect key infrastructure and potentially 
result in compounding and cascading risks as cities expand into 
coastal and mountain regions prone to flooding or landslides that 
disrupt transportation networks, or where water and energy resources 
are inadequate to meet the needs of growing settlements (high 
confidence). These infrastructure risks expand beyond city boundaries; 
climate-related transport and energy infrastructure damage is 
projected to be a significant financial burden for African countries, 
reaching tens to hundreds of billions of US dollars under moderate 
and high emissions scenarios (high confidence). Projected changes 
in both the hydrological cycle and the cryosphere will threaten urban 
water infrastructure and resource management in most regions 
(very high confidence). South and Southeast Asian coastal cities can 
experience significant increases in average annual economic losses 
between 2005 and 2050 due to flooding, with very high losses in 
east Asian cities under RCP8.5 (high confidence). By 2050, permafrost 
thaw in the pan-Arctic is projected to impact 69% of infrastructure, 
more than 1200 settlements, 36,000 buildings, and 4 million people 
in Europe under RCP4.5. In small islands, degraded terrestrial 
ecosystems decrease resource provision (e.g., potable water) and 
amplify the vulnerability of island inhabitants (high confidence). 
Projections suggest that 350 million (± 158.8 million) more people in 
urban areas will be exposed to water scarcity from severe droughts 
at 1.5°C warming and 410.7 million (± 213.5) at 2°C warming (low 
confidence). {6.2.2, 9.9.4, 10.4.6, 13.6.1, 13.6.2, 13.11.3, 14.5.5, 
CCP2.2, SMCCP2.1}
TS.C.9.4 The characteristics of coastal cities and settlements 
means that climate-driven risks to people and infrastructure 
in many of them are already high and will get progressively 
worse over the 21st century and beyond (high confidence). 
These risks are driven by disproportionately high exposure of multiple 
assets, economic activities and large coastal populations concentrated 
in narrow coastal zones. Climate change risks, including sea level rise, 
interact in intricate ways with non-climatic drivers of coastal change, 
such as land subsidence, continued infrastructure development in 
coastal floodplains, the rise of asset values and landward development 
adversely impacting coastal ecosystems, to shape future risk in coastal 
settlements (high confidence). (Figure TS.9 URBAN) {3.4.2, 6.2, 6.3, 7.4,

Economic sectors
TS.C.10 Across sectors and regions, market and non-market 
damage and adaptation costs will be lower at 1.5°C compared 
to 3°C or higher global warming levels (high confidence). 
Some recent estimates of projected global economic damage 
from climate impacts are higher than previous estimates and 
generally increase with global average temperature (high 
confidence). However, the spread in the estimates of the 
magnitude of this damage is substantial and does not allow for 
robust range to be established (high confidence). Non-market, 
non-economic damage and adverse impacts on livelihoods will 
be concentrated in regions and populations that are already 
more vulnerable (high confidence). Socioeconomic drivers and 
more inclusive development will largely determine the extent 
of this damage (high confidence). {4.4.4, 4.7.5, 9.11.2, 10.4.6, 
11.5.2, 13.10.2, 13.10.3, 14.5.8, Box 14.6, 16.5.2, 16.5.3}
TS.C.10.1 Without limiting warming to 1.5°C global warming 
level, many key risks are projected to intensify rapidly in 
almost all regions of the world, causing damage to assets and 
infrastructure and losses to economic sectors and entailing high 
recovery and adaptation costs (high confidence). Severe risks are 
more likely in developing regions that are already hotter and in regions 
and communities with a large portion of the workforce employed 
in highly exposed industries (e.g., agriculture, fisheries, forestry, 
tourism, outdoor labour). In addition to market damage and disaster 
management costs, substantial costs of climate inaction are projected 
for human health (high confidence). At higher levels of warming, climate 
impacts will pose risks to financial and insurance markets, especially if 
climate risks are incompletely internalised (medium confidence), with 
adverse implications for the stability of markets (low confidence). While 
the overall economic consequences are clearly negative, opportunities 
may arise for a few economic sectors and regions, such as from longer 
growing seasons or reduced sea ice, primarily in northern latitudes 
(medium to high confidence). {4.4.4, 4.7.5, 9.11.2, 10.4.6, 11.6, 13.9.2,

increased relative to the range reported in AR5, though there is low 
agreement and significant spread within and across methodology types 
(e.g., statistical, structural, meta-analysis), resulting in an inability to 
identify a best estimate or robust range (high confidence). Under high 
warming (>4°C) and limited adaptation, the magnitude of decline in 
annual global GDP in 2100 relative to a non-global-warming scenario 
could exceed economic losses during the Great Recession in 2008–
2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Much smaller effects are 
estimated for less warming, lower vulnerability and more adaptation 
(medium confidence). Regional estimates of GDP damage vary (high 
confidence). Severe risks are more likely in (typically hotter) developing 
countries (medium confidence). For Africa, GDP damage is projected to 
be negative across models and approaches (high confidence). {4.4.4, 
4.7.5, 9.11.2, 10.4.6, 13.10.2, 13.10.3, 14.5.8, Box 14.6, 16.5.2, 16.6.3, 
CWGB ECONOMIC}
TS.C.10.3 Even at low levels of warming, climate change will 
disrupt the livelihoods of tens to hundreds of millions of 
additional people in regions with high exposure and vulnerability 
and low adaptation in climate-sensitive regions, ecosystems and 
economic sectors (high confidence). If future climate change under 
high emissions scenarios continues and increases risks, without strong 
adaptation measures, losses and damage will likely be concentrated 
among the poorest vulnerable populations (high confidence). {8.4.5, 
9.11.4, Box 15.2, 16.5.3}
TS.C.10.4 Potential socioeconomic futures, in terms of 
population, economic development and orientation towards 
growth, vary widely and these drivers have a large influence on 
the economic costs of climate change (high confidence). Higher 
growth scenarios along higher warming levels increase exposure to 
hazards and assets at risk, such as sea level rise for coastal regions, 
which will have large implications for economic activities, including 
shipping and ports (high confidence). The high sensitivity of developing 
economies to climate impacts will pose increasing challenges to 
economic growth and performance, although projections depend as 
much or more on future socioeconomic development pathways and 
mitigation policies as on warming levels (medium confidence). {9.11.2, 
11.4, 13.2.1, 16.5.3, CCB SLR, CWGB ECONOMIC}
TS.C.10.5 Large non-market and non-economic losses are 
projected, especially at higher warming levels (high confidence). 
This wide range of effects underscore the impact of climate change on 
welfare and the adverse effects on vulnerable populations (medium 
confidence). Including as many of these impacts in decision-making 
as possible, and as part of the social cost of carbon, will improve 
evaluation of the overall and distributional effects of climate 
mitigation and adaptation actions as well as in more comprehensively 
internalising climate impacts. {1.5.1, 4.5.8, 4.7.5, 8.4.1, 8.4.5, Map 8.8,

Compound, cascading and transboundary risks
TS.C.11 Compound, cascading risks and transboundary risks give 
rise to new and unexpected types of risks (high confidence). 
They exacerbate existing stressors and constrain adaptation 
options (medium confidence). They are projected to become 
major threats for many areas, such as coastal cities (medium to 
high confidence). Some compound and cascading impacts occur 
locally, some spread across sectors and socioeconomic and 
natural systems, while others can be driven by events in other 
regions, for instance through trade and flows of commodities 
and goods through supply chain linkages (high confidence).

TS.C.11.1 Escalating impacts of climate change on terrestrial, 
freshwater and marine life will further alter the biomass of 
animals (medium confidence), the timing of seasonal ecological 
events (high confidence) and the geographic ranges of 
terrestrial, coastal and ocean taxa (high confidence), disrupting 
life cycles (medium confidence), food webs (medium confidence) 
and ecological connectivity throughout the water column 
(medium confidence). For example, cascading effects on food webs 
have been reported in the Baltic due to detrimental oxygen levels 
(high confidence). (Figure TS.5 ECOSYSTEMS, Figure TS.10 COMPLEX

CCP5.3.2, WGI AR6 2.3.4}
TS.C.11.2 Climate hazards cause multiple impacts, interacting 
to compound risks to food security, nutrition and human health 
(high confidence). Compound risks to health and food systems 
(especially in tropical regions) are projected from simultaneous 
reductions in food production across crops, livestock and fisheries 
(high confidence), heat-related loss of labour productivity in 
agriculture (high confidence), increased heat-related mortality (high 
confidence), contamination of seafood (high confidence), malnutrition 
(high confidence) and flooding from sea level rise (high confidence). 
Malnourished populations will increase through direct impacts on 
food production with cascading impacts on food prices and household 
incomes, reducing access to safe and nutritious food (high confidence). 
Food safety will be undermined from increased food contamination 
for seafood with marine toxins from harmful algal blooms and 
chemical contaminants, worsening health risks (high confidence).

TS.C.11.3 Compound hazards increasing with global warming 
include increased frequency of concurrent heatwaves and 
droughts (high confidence), dangerous fire weather (medium 
confidence) and floods (medium confidence), resulting in 
increased and more complex risks to agriculture, water 
resources, human health, mortality, livelihoods, settlements 
and infrastructure. Extreme weather events result in cascading and 
compounding risks that affect health and are expected to increase 
with warming (very high confidence). Compound climate hazards 
can overwhelm adaptive capacity and substantially increase damage 
(high confidence); for example, heat and drought are  projected to 
substantially reduce agricultural production, and although irrigation 
can reduce this risk, its feasibility is limited by drought. (Figure TS.10

TS.C.11.4 Interacting climatic and non-climatic drivers when 
coupled with coastal development and urbanisation  are 
projected to lead to losses for coastal ecosystems and their 
services under all scenarios in the near to mid-term (medium to 
high confidence). The compound impacts of warming, acidification 
and sea level rise are projected to lead to losses for coastal ecosystems 
(medium to high confidence). Fewer habitats, less biodiversity, lower 
coastal protection (medium confidence) and decreased food and water 
security will result (medium confidence), reducing the habitability of 
some small islands (high confidence). (Figure TS.10 COMPLEX RISK)

TS.C.11.5 Observed human and economic losses have increased 
since AR5 for urban areas and human settlements arising from 
compound, cascading and systemic events (medium evidence, 
high agreement). Urban areas and their infrastructure are susceptible 
to both compounding and cascading risks arising from interactions 
between severe weather from climate change and increasing 
urbanisation (medium evidence, high agreement). Compound risks 
to key infrastructure in cities have increased from extreme weather 
(medium evidence, high agreement). Losses become systemic when 
they affect entire systems and can even jump from one system to 
another (e.g., drought impacting rural food production contributing to 
urban food insecurity) (medium confidence). (Figure TS.10 COMPLEX

TS.C.11.6 Interconnectedness and globalisation establish 
pathways for the transmission of climate-related risks 
across sectors and borders, through trade, finance, food and 
ecosystems (high confidence). Flows of commodities and goods, 
as well as people, finance and innovation, can be driven or disrupted 
by distant climate change impacts on rural populations, transport 
networks and commodity speculation (high confidence). For example, 
Europe faces climate risks from outside the area due to global supply 
chain positioning and shared resources (high confidence). Climate risks 
in Europe also impact finance, food production and marine resources 
beyond Europe (medium confidence). (Figure TS.10 COMPLEX RISK)

to economic activities (very high confidence) as direct and 
cascading impacts of climate change continue to occur at a 
magnitude and pace unprecedented in recent history and much 
faster than projected for other regions (very high confidence). 
Impacts and risks include reduced access to and productivity of future 
fisheries, regional and global food and nutritional security (high 
confidence), local livelihoods, health and well-being (high confidence) 
and loss to sociocultural assets, including heritage sites in all Arctic 
regions (very high confidence). (Figure TS.10 COMPLEX RISK) {Box 7.1,

TS.C.11.8 Indigenous Peoples, traditional communities, small-
holder farmers, urban poor, children and elderly in Amazonia are 
burdened by cascading impacts and risks from the compound 
effects of climate and land use change on forest fires in the 
region (high confidence). Deforestation, fires and urbanisation have 
increased the exposure of Indigenous Peoples to respiratory problems, 
air pollution and diseases (high confidence). Amazonian forest fires are 
transboundary and increase systemic losses of wild crops, infrastructure 
and livelihoods, requiring a landscape governance approach (medium 
evidence, high agreement). (Figure TS.10 COMPLEX RISK) {2.4.3, 2.4.4,

TS.C.11.9 Population groups in most vulnerable and exposed 
regions to compound and cascading risks have the most urgent 
need for improved adaptive capacity (high confidence). Regions 
characterised by compound challenges of high levels of poverty, a 
significant number of people without access to basic services, such 
as water and sanitation and wealth and gender inequalities, and 
governance challenges are among the most vulnerable regions and 
are particularly located in East, Central and West Africa, South Asia, 
Micronesia and Melanesia and in Central America (high confidence). 
{8.3, 8.4, Box 8.6, CCP5.3.2}
TS.C.11.10 Emergent risks arise from responses to climate 
change, including maladaptation and unintended side effects 
of mitigation, including in the case of afforestation and 
hydropower (very high confidence). Solar radiation modification 
(SRM) approaches attempt to offset warming and ameliorate some 
climate risks but introduce a range of new risks to people and 
ecosystems, which are not well understood (high confidence). {1.3.1, 
3.6.3, 5.13.6, CWGB SRM}
Reasons for concern (RFC)
TS.C.12 More evidence now supports the five major RFCs about 
climate change, describing risks associated with unique and 
threatened systems (RFC1), extreme weather events (RFC2), 
distribution of impacts (RFC3), global aggregate impacts (RFC4) 
and   large-scale singular events (RFC5) (high confidence). 
(Figure TS.4, Table TS.1) {16.6.3, Figure 16.15}
TS.C.12.1 Compared to AR5 and SR15, risks increase to high 
and very high levels at lower global warming levels for all five 
RFCs (high confidence), and transition ranges are assigned with 
greater confidence. Transitions from high to very high risk emerge in 
all five RFCs, compared to just two RFCs in AR5 (high confidence). As 
in previous assessments, levels of concern at a given level of warming 
remain higher for RFC1 than for other RFCs. (Table TS.1, TS.AII) {16.6.3, 
Figure 16.15}
TS.C.12.2 Limiting global warming to 1.5°C would ensure risk 
levels remain moderate for RFC3, RFC4 and RFC5 (medium

confidence), but risk for RFC2 would have transitioned to a high 
risk at 1.5°C and RFC1 would be well into the transition to very 
high risk (high confidence). Remaining below 2°C warming (but 
above 1.5°C) would imply that risk for RFC3 through RFC5 would be 
transitioning to high, and risk for RFC1 and RFC2 would be transitioning 
to very high (high confidence). By 2.5°C warming, RFC1 will be at very 
high risk (high confidence), and all other RFCs will have begun their 
transitions to very high risk, with medium confidence for RFC2, RFC3 and 
RFC4, and low confidence for RFC5. (Table TS.1) {16.6.3, Figure 16.15}
TS.C.12.3 While the RFCs represent global risk levels for 
aggregated 
concerns 
about 
‘dangerous 
anthropogenic 
interference with the climate system’, they represent a great 
diversity of risks, and in reality, there is not one single dangerous 
climate threshold across sectors and regions.  RFC1, RFC2 and 
RFC5 include risks that are irreversible, such as species extinction, 
coral reef degradation, loss of cultural heritage or loss of a small island 
due to sea level rise. Once such risks materialise, the impacts would 
persist even if global temperatures subsequently declined to levels 
associated with lower levels of risk in an ‘overshooting’ scenario, for 
example where temperatures increase over ‘well below 2°C above 
pre-industrial’ for multi-decadal time spans before decreasing (high 
confidence). (Figure TS.4, see also TS.C.13) {16.6.3, Figure 16.15}
Temporary overshoot
TS.C.13 Warming pathways that imply a temporary temperature 
increase over ‘well below 2°C above pre-industrial’ for multi-
decadal time spans imply severe risks and irreversible impacts 
in many natural and human systems (e.g., glacier melt, loss 
of coral reefs, loss of human lives due to heat) even if the 
temperature goals are reached later (high confidence). {2.5.2, 
2.5.3, 4.6.1}
TS.C.13.1 Projected warming pathways may entail exceeding 
1.5°C or 2°C around mid-century. Even if the Paris temperature 
goal is still reached by 2100, this ‘overshoot’ entails severe risks 
and irreversible impacts on many natural and human systems (e.g., 
glacier melt, loss of coral reefs, loss of human life due to heat) (high 
confidence). {2.5, 3.4, 16.6, WGI AR6 SPM}
TS.C.13.2 Overshoot substantially increases risk of carbon 
stored in the biosphere being released into the atmosphere due 
to increases in processes such as wildfires, tree mortality, insect 
pest outbreaks, peatland drying and permafrost thaw  (high 
confidence). These phenomena exacerbate self-reinforcing feedbacks 
between emissions from high-carbon ecosystems (which currently store 
around 3030–4090 GtC) and increasing global temperatures. Complex 
interactions of climate change, land use change, carbon dioxide fluxes 
and vegetation changes, combined with insect outbreaks and other 
disturbances, will regulate the future carbon balance of the biosphere, 
processes incompletely represented in current Earth system models. 
The exact timing and magnitude of climate–biosphere feedbacks 
and potential tipping points of carbon loss are characterised by large 
uncertainty, but studies of feedbacks indicate increased ecosystem 
carbon losses can cause large future temperature increases (medium 
confidence). {2.5.2, 2.5.2, 2.5.3, Figure  2.10, Figure 2.11, Table 2.4, 
Table 2.5, Table 2.S. 2, Table 2.S. 4, Table 5.4, Figure 5.29, WGI AR6 5.4}
TS.C.13.3 Extinction of species is an irreversible impact of 
climate change whose risk increases sharply with rises in global 
temperature (high confidence). Even the lowest estimates of species 
extinctions (9% lost) are 1000  times the natural background rates 
(medium confidence). Projected species extinctions at future global 
warming levels are consistent with projections from AR4, but assessed 
on many more species with much greater geographic coverage and a 
broader range of climate models, giving higher confidence. (see also 
TS.C.1) {2.5.1, Figure 2.6, Figure 2.7, Figure 2.8, CCP1, CCB DEEP}
TS.C.13.4 Solar radiation modification (SRM) approaches have 
the potential to offset warming and ameliorate other climate 
hazards, but their potential to reduce risk or introduce novel 
risks to people and ecosystems is not well understood (high 
confidence). SRM effects on climate hazards are highly dependent 
on deployment scenarios, and substantial residual climate change or 
overcompensating change would occur at regional scales and seasonal 
time scales (high confidence). Due in part to limited research, there is 
low confidence in projected benefits or risks to crop yields, economies, 
human health or ecosystems. Large negative impacts are projected 
from rapid warming for a sudden and sustained termination of SRM 
in a high-CO2 scenario. SRM would not stop CO2 from increasing in the 
atmosphere or reduce resulting ocean acidification under continued 
anthropogenic emissions (high confidence). There is high agreement 
in the literature that for addressing climate change risks SRM is, at 
best, a supplement to achieving sustained net zero or net negative CO2 
emission levels globally. Co-evolution of SRM governance and research 
provides a chance for responsibly developing SRM technologies with 
broader public participation and political legitimacy, guarding against 
potential risks and harms relevant across a full range of scenarios.

Contribution of Adaptation to Solutions
This section covers climate change adaptation and explains how our 
knowledge of it has progressed since AR5. The section begins with 
an explanation of overall progress on adaptation and the adaptation 
gaps and then discusses limits to adaptation. Maladaptation and the 
underlying evidence base are explained together with the strategies 
available to strengthen the biosphere that can help ecosystems 
function in a changing climate. Different adaptation options across 
water, food, nutrition and ecosystem-based adaptation and other 
nature-based solutions are also discussed and, in particular, the ways 
in which urban systems and infrastructure are coping with adaptation. 
Adaptation to sea level rise is specifically discussed given its global 
impact on coastal areas, while health, well-being, migration and 
conflict are also explained as these warrant additional important 
considerations. Justice and equity have a significant impact as well on 
how effective adaptation can be and are discussed as key issues that 
relate to decision-making processes on adaptation and the range of 
enablers that can support adaptation. Lastly, the focus shifts to system 
transitions and transformational adaptation that are needed to move 
climate change adaptation forward in a rapidly warming world.
Adaptation progress and gaps
TS.D.1  Increasing adaptation is being observed in natural 
and human systems (very high confidence), yet the majority 
of climate risk management and adaptation currently being 
planned and implemented are incremental (high confidence). 
There are gaps between current adaptation and the adaptation 
needed to avoid the increase of climate impacts that can be 
observed across sectors and regions, especially under medium 
and high warming levels (high confidence). {4.6.1, 4.6.2, 4.6.3, 
4.6.4, 4.6.5, 4.6.6, 4.6.7, 4.6.8, 4.6.9, Box 4.3, Box 4.5, Box 4.6, 
7.4.1, Table 4.8, Figure 4.24, Figure 6.4.3, Figure 6.5, 9.3.1, 9.6.4, 
9.8.3, 9.11.4, 13.2, 13.11, 14.7.1, 16.3, 16.4, 17.2.2, CCP5.2.4, 
CCP5.2.7, CCP7.5.1, CCP7.5.2}
TS.D.1.1 Responses have accelerated in both developed and 
developing regions since AR5, with some examples of regression 
(high confidence). Growing adaptation knowledge in public and 
private sectors, increasing numbers of policy and legal frameworks 
and dedicated spending on adaptation are all clear indications that 
the availability of response options has expanded (high confidence). 
However, observed adaptation in human systems across all sectors 
and regions is dominated by small incremental, reactive changes to 
usual practices often after extreme weather events, while evidence 
of transformative adaptation in human systems is limited (high 
confidence). Droughts, pluvial, fluvial and coastal flooding are the 
most common hazards for which adaptation is being implemented, 
and many of these have physical, affordability and social limits (high 
confidence). There is some evidence of global vulnerability reduction, 
particularly for flood risk and extreme heat. {1.4.5, 2.4.2, 2.4.5, 
2.5.4, 2.6.1, 2.6.6, 3.4.2, 3.4.3, 3.6.3, 4.6.1, 4.6.2, 4.6.3, 4.6.4, 4.6.5, 
4.6.6, 4.6.7, 4.6.8, 4.6.9, Box 4.3, Box 4.5, Box 4.6, 7.4.1, Table 4.8, 
Figure 4.24, 11.6, Table 11.14, Box 11.2, 12.12.5, 13.2.2, 13.10, 13.11, 
14.7.1, 15.5.4, 16.3.2, 16.4.2, 12.3, CCB EXTREMES}
TS.D.1.2 Current adaptation in natural and managed ecosystems 
includes earlier planting and changes in crop varieties, soil 
improvement and water management for livestock and crops, 
aquaculture, restoration of coastal and hydrological processes, 
introduction of heat- and drought-adapted genotypes into high-
risk populations, increasing the size and connectivity of habitat 
patches, agroecological farming, agroforestry and managed 
relocations of high-risk species (medium confidence). These 
measures can increase the resilience, productivity and sustainability of 
both natural and food systems under climate change (high confidence). 
Financial barriers limit the implementation of adaptation options in 
natural ecosystems, agriculture, fisheries, aquaculture and forestry as 
financial strategies are stochastically deployed. Investment in climate 
service provision has benefited the agricultural sector in many regions, 
with limited uptake of climate service information into decision-
making frameworks (medium confidence). {2.6.2, 2.6.3, 2.6.4, 2.6.5, 
2.6.8, 3.6.3, 4.6.2, 4.7.1, Figure 4.23, 5.4.3, 5.5.3, 5.9.4, 5.10.3, 5.14.3, 
9.4, 9.4.4, 9.4.1, 12.5.4, 12.8, 13.5.2, 13.10.2, 14.5.4, 15.5.7, 17.2.1, 
17.5.1, CCP5.2.5, CCP 7.5, CCB NATURAL}
TS.D.1.3 The ambition, scope and progress on adaptation have 
risen among governments at the local, national and international 
levels, along with businesses, communities and civil society, but 
many funding, knowledge and practice gaps remain for effective 
implementation, monitoring and evaluation (high confidence). 
There are large gaps in risk management and risk transfer in low-
income contexts, and even larger gaps in conflict-affected contexts 
(high confidence). Adaptive capacity is highly uneven across and 
within regions (high confidence). Current adaptation efforts are not 
expected to meet existing goals (high confidence). {1.1.3, 1.2.1, 1.3.1, 
1.3.2, 1.4.5, 2.6.2, 2.6.3, 2.6.6, 2.6.8, 3.6.3, 4.7.1, 6.1, 6.4.3, Figure 6.5, 
9.1.5, 9.4.1, 9.4.5, 11.7.1, 11.7.2, 13.11.1, 14.7.1, 15.6, 17.2, 17.4.2, 
17.5.1, 17.5.2, CCP7.5, CCB DEEP, CCB NATURAL}
TS.D.1.4 Many cities and settlements have developed adaptation 
plans since AR5, but a limited number of these have been 
implemented so that urban adaptation gaps exist in all world 
regions and for all hazard types (high confidence). Many plans 
focus on climate risk reduction, missing opportunities to advance co-
benefits of climate mitigation and sustainable development and risking 
compounding inequality and reduced well-being (medium confidence). 
The largest adaptation gaps exist in projects that manage complex 
risks, for example in the food–energy–water–health nexus or the inter-
relationships of air quality and climate risk (high confidence). Most 
innovation in adaptation has occurred through advances in social 
and ecological infrastructures, including disaster risk management, 
social safety nets and green/blue infrastructure (medium confidence). 
However, most financial investment continues to be directed narrowly 
at large-scale hard engineering projects after climate events have 
caused harm (medium confidence). {4.6.5, 6.3.1, 6.3.2, Figure 6.4, 6.4.3, 
6.4.5, 10.3.7, Table 10.2, 11.3.5, 12.5.5, 13.11, 14.5.5, 14.7.1, 15.3.4,

Figure TS.7 VULNERABILITY | (a) The global map of vulnerability is based on two comprehensive global indicator systems, namely INFORM Risk Index and WorldRiskIndex 
(2019). Climate change hazards and exposure levels are not included in this figure. The relative level of average national vulnerability is shown by the colours. Vulnerability values 
are based on the average of the two indices, classified into 5 classes using the quantile method. A hexagon binning method was used to simplify the global map and enlarge small 
states. The map combines information about the level of vulnerability (independent of the population size) with two classes of population density (high density ≥ 20 people/km2 
and low density < 20 people/km2). The selected examples of local vulnerable populations underscore that there are also highly vulnerable populations in countries with overall low 
relative vulnerability {8.3.2, Figure 8.6}  (b) This figure shows regional averages for selected aspects of human vulnerability. The indicators are a selection of the indicator systems 
used within the global vulnerability map (panel a). The colours represent the average value of the respective indicator for the regional level; classified into three classes using natural 
breaks. This regional information reveals that within all regions challenges exist in terms of different aspects of vulnerability, however, in some regions these challenges are more 
severe and accumulate in multiple-dimensions. For example, the indicator “dependency ratio” measures the ratio of the number of children (0–14 years old) and older persons 
(65 years or over) to the working-age population (15–64 years old). {8.3.2, Figure 8.7}  (c) The pie charts show the number of deaths (mortality) per hazard (storm, flood, drought, 
heatwaves and wildfires) event per continental region based on Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) (Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, 2020). The size of the 
pie chart represents the average mortality per hazard event while slices of each pie chart show the absolute number of deaths from each hazard. This reveals that significantly more 
fatalities per hazard (storms, floods, droughts, heatwaves and wildfires) did occur in the past decade in more vulnerable regions, e.g. Africa and Asia. {Figure 8.6}  (d) The figure 
shows constraints that make it harder to plan and implement human adaptation. Across regions and sectors, the most significant challenges to human adaptation are financial, 
governance, institutional and policy constraints. The ability of actors to overcome these socio-economic constraints largely influences whether additional adaptation is able to be 
implemented and prevent limits to adaptation from being reached. Low: <20% of assessed literature identifies this constraint; Medium: 20–40% of assessed literature identifies 
this constraint; High: >40% of assessed literature identifies this constraint. {9.3, 16.4.3, Figure 16.8}

Figure TS.10 COMPLEX RISK | Compound, cascading and transboundary impacts for humans and ecosystems result from exposure to the complex interactions 
of (1) multiple climatic hazards, including with non-climatic stressors (as seen in panels a, b, c, d), (2) multiple vulnerabilities compounding the effect of risks 
(as seen in panel a, b, c), and (3) multiple impacts/risks that compound and cascade to spread across sectors and boundaries (panels b, c, d, e, f)
(a)  Climate and land use change result in cumulative impacts on traditional, semi-nomadic Sámi reindeer herding. Impacts cascade due to a lack of access to key ecosystems, 
lakes and rivers, thereby increasing costs and threatening traditional livelihoods, food security, cultural heritage, and mental health. {Box 7.1, Figure Box 9.7.1, 13.8.1.2, Box 13.2, 
Figure 13.14. Table SM13.7, Figure 16.2, Figure CCP6.7}
(b)  Risks compound from deforestation, wildfires, urbanization, and climate change in Amazonia impacts biodiversity, livelihoods, medicinal, spiritual, and cultural sites; increasing 
migration patterns, loss of place-based attachments, and culture, causing health problems and mental and emotional distress of vulnerable traditional communities and Indigenous 
People dependent on the forest ecosystem. {Box 8.7, Figure Box 9.7.1, 12.4, Figure 12.11, Table 12.6, Figure 16.2}
(c)  Complex pathways from climate hazards to malnutrition in subsistence farming households. The factors involved in and the probable impacts of weather variables on food 
yields and of production on malnutrition. {Figure 1.3, Figure 1.4, 5.2.1, 5.2.2, 5.12.3, 5.12.4, Box 5.10, Figure 5.2, 7.2.2, 7.3.1, Figure Box 9.7.1, 13.5.1, 13.5.2, 13.10.2, 16.5.2, 
16.5.3, Figure 16.2}
(d)  Risk compounds and amplifies through cascading effects due to interconnectedness of island systems. Loss of marine, coastal, terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystem services 
can cause submergence of reef islands, increase water insecurity, destroy settlements and infrastructure, degrade health and well-being, reduce economy and livelihoods, and result 
in loss of cultural resources and heritage. {15.3.4.9, Figure Box 15.1, Figure 15.5, Figure 16.2}
(e)  Climate impacts can cascade through interconnected infrastructure in cities and settlements impacting on social well-being and economic activities, spreading loss and risk 
through lost economic productivity disrupting the distribution of goods and provision of basic services, spreading widely, into rural places and across international borders as supply 
chains, financial investment and remittance flows are disrupted. {6.1.3, 6.2.2, 6.2.4, Figure 6.2, Figure 16.2, Figure CCB INTEREG.1}
(f)  Cascading, compounding and transboundary impacts on people’s mortality and physical and mental health, economic activity, built assets, ecosystems and mass species 
mortality and with smoke and ash transported to New Zealand affecting air quality and glaciers, arising from the “Black Summer” fires of 2019–2020 which burned over a 
five-month period in eastern and southern Australia. Fire weather is projected to worsen across Australasia. {Figure 1.3, Figure 1.4, 11.3.1.3, Box 11.1, Figure Box 11.1.2,

Technical Summary
TS
TS.D.1.5 Systemic barriers constrain the implementation of 
adaptation options in vulnerable sectors, regions and social 
groups (high confidence). Key barriers are limited resources, lack 
of private-sector and citizen engagement, insufficient mobilisation of 
finance (including for research), lack of political leadership, limited 
research and/or slow and low uptake of adaptation science and 
a low sense of urgency. Most of the adaptation options to the key 
risks depend on limited water and land resources (high confidence). 
Governance capacity, financial support and the legacy of past urban 
infrastructure investment constrain how cities and settlements 
are able to adapt (high confidence). Critical urban capacity gaps 
include limited ability to identify social vulnerability and community 
strengths, the absence of integrated planning to protect communities, 
the lack of access to innovative funding arrangements and a limited 
capability to manage finance and commercial insurance (medium 
confidence). Prioritisation of options and transitions from incremental 
to transformational adaptation are limited due to vested interests, 
economic lock-ins, institutional path dependencies and prevalent 
practices, cultures, norms and belief systems. For example, Africa faces 
severe climate data constraints and inequities in research funding and 
leadership that reduce adaptive capacity (very high confidence)—from 
1990 to 2019 research on Africa received just 3.8% of climate-related 
research funding globally, and 78% of this funding for Africa went 
to European Union- and North America–based institutions and only 
14.5% to African institutions. {3.6.3, 9.1.5, 9.5.1, 9.8.4, 12.5.1, 12.5.5, 
12.5.7, 12.8, 13.11, 14.7.2, 15.6.1, 15.7, CCP7.6, CCB FEASIB}
TS.D.1.6 Insufficient financing is a key driver of adaptation gaps 
(high confidence). Annual finance flows targeting adaptation 
for Africa, for example, are billions of US dollars less than the 
lowest adaptation cost estimates for near-term climate change 
(high confidence). Finance has not targeted more vulnerable countries 
and communities. From 2014 to 2018 a greater amount of financial 
commitments to developing countries was in the form of debt rather 
than grants, and—excluding multilateral development banks—only 
51% of commitments targeting adaptation were dispersed (compared 
to 85% for other development projects). Tracked private-sector finance 
for climate change action has grown substantially since 2015, but 
the proportion directed towards adaptation has remained small (high 
confidence); in 2018 contributions were 0.05% of total climate finance 
and 1% of adaptation finance. Globally, private-sector financing of 
adaptation has been limited, especially in developing countries (high 
confidence). {3.6.3, 4.7,4, 4.7.5, 4.8.2, 6.4.5, Table 6.10, 9.4.1, 12.5.4, 
12.5.8, 15.6.3, 17.4.3, CCB FINANCE}
TS.D.1.7 Closing the adaptation gap requires moving beyond 
short-term planning to develop long-term, concerted pathways 
and enabling conditions for ongoing adaptation to ensure 
timely and effective implementation (high confidence). Inclusive, 
equitable and just adaptation pathways are critical for climate resilient 
development. Such pathways require consideration of SDGs, gender 
and Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge and practices. The 
success of adaptation will depend on our understanding of which 
adaptation options are feasible and effective in their local context 
(high confidence). Long lead times for nature-based and infrastructure 
solutions or planned relocation will require implementation in the 
coming decade to reduce risks in time. To close the adaptation gap, 
political commitment, persistent and consistent action across scales of 
government and upfront mobilisation of human and financial capital 
are key (high confidence), even when the benefits are not immediately 
visible. {3.6.5, 4.8, 6.3.5, 11.7, 12.5.7, 13.2.2, 13.8, 13.11, 14.7.2, 15.7, 
CCP2.3, CCP2.4, CCP7.5, CCB DEEP, CCB FEASIB, CCB GENDER}
Limits to adaptation
TS.D.2  There is increasing evidence on limits to adaptation 
which result from the interaction of adaptation constraints 
and the speed of change (high confidence). In some natural 
systems, hard limits have been reached (high confidence) and 
more will be reached beyond 1.5°C (medium confidence). 
Surpassing such hard, evolutionary limits causes local species 
extinctions and displacements if suitable habitats exist (high 
confidence). Otherwise, species’ existence is at very high risk 
(high confidence). In human, managed and natural systems, soft 
limits are already being experienced (high confidence). Financial 
constraints are key determinants of adaptation limits in human 
and managed systems, particularly in low-income settings 
(high confidence), while in natural systems key determinants 
for limits are inherent traits of the species or ecosystem (very 
high confidence). (Figure TS.7 VULNERABILITY) {2.4.2, 2.6.1, 3.3, 
3.4.2, 3.4.3, 15.5.4, CCP5.3.2, CCP7.5.2, CCB EXTREMES}
TS.D.2.1 Adaptation limits can be differentiated into hard and 
soft limits. Soft limits are those for which no further adaptation 
options are feasible currently but might become available in the future. 
Hard limits are those for which existing adaptation options will cease 
to be effective and additional options are not possible. Hard limits will 
increasingly emerge at higher levels of warming (high confidence). 
Adaptation limits are shaped by constraints that can or cannot be 
overcome by adaptation actions and by the speed with which climate 
impacts unfold. Evidence and signals of the thresholds at which 
constraints result in limits is still sparse and, in human systems, are 
expected to remain contested even with increasing knowledge (high 
confidence). {2.4.2, 2.6.1, 4.7.4, Box  4.2, Box  4.3, 15.3.4, 15.5.4, 
16.4.1, 16.4.2, 16.4.3, CCB EXTREMES}
TS.D.2.2 Limits to adaptation have been observed for terrestrial 
and aquatic species and ecosystems and for some human and 
managed systems in specific geographies such as small island 
states and mountain regions (high confidence). Beginning at 
below 1.5°C, autonomous and evolutionary adaptation responses 
by more terrestrial and aquatic species and ecosystems will face hard 
limits, resulting in species extinctions, loss of ecosystem integrity and 
a resulting loss of livelihoods (high confidence). Examples of hard 
limits being exceeded include observed population losses and species 
extinctions and loss of whole ecosystems from certain locations (e.g., 
irrecoverable loss of tropical coral reefs locally). Large local population 
declines of wild species have already impacted human food sources 
and livelihoods (e.g., for Indigenous Arctic communities). Soft limits are 
currently being experienced in particular by individuals, households, cities 
and settlements along the coast and by small-scale farmers (medium 
confidence). As sea levels rise and extreme events intensify, coastal 
communities face limits due to financial, institutional and socioeconomic 
constraints and a short timeline for adaptation implementation, reducing 
85

the efficacy of coastal protection and accommodation approaches and 
resulting in loss of life and economic damages (medium confidence). 
{2.4.2, 2.5.4, 2.6.1, 3.4.2, 3.4.3, CCP1, CCP2, CCP6, 4.7.4, Box 4.2, 6.4.4, 
11.3.1, 11.3.2, 11.3.4, 11.3.5, 12.5.1, 13.3.1, 13.4.1, 13.10.2, 15.5.4, 
15.5.6, 16.4.2, 16.4.3, CCP5.2.7, CCP5.3.2}
TS.D.2.3 Limits to adaptation will be reached in more systems, 
including, for example, coastal communities, water security, 
agricultural production and human health, as global warming 
increases (medium confidence). Hard limits beginning at 1.5°C 
are also projected for coastal communities reliant on nature-based 
coastal protection (medium confidence). Adaptation to address the 
risks of heat stress, heat mortality and reduced capacities for outdoor 
work for humans face soft and hard limits across regions that become 
significantly more severe at 1.5°C and are particularly relevant for 
regions with warm climates (high confidence). Beginning at 3°C, 
hard limits are projected for water management measures, leading to 
decreased water quality and availability, negative impacts on health 
and well-being, economic losses in water and energy-dependent sectors 
and potential migration of communities (medium confidence). Soft and 
hard limits for agricultural production are related to water availability 
and the uptake and effectiveness of climate resilient crops, which 
are constrained by socioeconomic and political challenges (medium 
confidence). In terms of settlements, limits to adaptation are often most 
pronounced in smaller and rapidly growing towns and cities, including 
those without dedicated local government (medium confidence). At 
the same time, legacy infrastructure in large and mega cities, designed 
without taking climate change risk into account, constrains innovation, 
leading to stranded assets and with increasing numbers of people 
unable to avoid harm, including heat stress and flooding, without 
transformative adaptation (medium confidence). {2.4.2, 3.4.2, 3.5.5, 
3.6.3, 4.7.4, Box 4.2, Box 4.3, 4.7.2, 4.7.3, 6.4.3, 6.4.5, 6.4.5, 6.4.5, 
Figure 6.4, 16.4.2, 16.4.3, 3.4.3, 11.3.1, 11.3.2 11.3.4, 11.3.5, 11.3.6, 
12.5.1, 12.5.2, 12.5.3, 13.10.2, Box  11.6, Table  14.6, 15.3.3, 15.3.4, 
15.5.4, 16.4.2, 16.4.3, CCP2, CCB ILLNESS, CCB SLR}
TS.D.2.4 Across regions and sectors, the most significant 
determinants of soft limits are financial, governance, 
institutional and policy constraints (high confidence). The ability 
of actors to address these socioeconomic constraints largely influences 
whether additional adaptation can be implemented and prevent soft 
limits from becoming hard limits. Global and regional evidence shows 
that climate impacts may limit the availability of financial resources, 
stunt national economic growth, result in higher levels of losses 
and damage and thereby increase financial constraints (medium 
evidence). Information, awareness and technological constraints 
are also high in multiple regions (high confidence). For example, 
awareness of anthropogenic climate change ranges between 23% and 
66% of people across 33 African countries, with low climate literacy 
limiting potential for transformative adaptation (medium confidence). 
(Figure TS.7 VULNERABILITY) {2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.5.1, 2.6.8, 3.6.3, 4.7.4, 
6.4.4, 9.3.1, 9.4.1, 9.4.5, 12.8, 13.11.1, 14.7.2, 15.6.1, 15.6.3, 16.4.2, 
16.4.3, CCP2, CCP5.4.1, CCP7.5, CCP7.6, CCB EXTREMES}
TS.D.2.5 The potential for reaching adaptation limits fundamen-
tally depends on emissions reductions and mitigating global 
warming (high confidence). Under all emissions scenarios, climate 
change reduces capacity for adaptive responses and limits choices 
and opportunities for sustainable development. The ability of actors to 
overcome socioeconomic constraints determines whether additional 
adaptation can be implemented and prevent soft limits from becoming 
hard limits (medium confidence). Above 1.5°C of warming, limits to 
adaptation are reported for human and natural systems, including coral 
reefs (high confidence), regional water availability (medium evidence, 
high agreement) and outdoor labour and existing tourism-related 
activities. {1.1.3, 1.5.1, 2.6.0, 2.6.1, 2.6.2, 2.6.3, 2.6.4, 2.6.5, 2.6.8,

14.5.8, 15.3.3, 15.3.4, Box 15.1, 16.4, 16.5, 16.6, CCP5.3.2}
Maladaptation
TS.D.3  Evidence of maladaptation is increasing in some sectors 
and systems, highlighting how inappropriate responses to climate 
change create long-term lock-in of vulnerability, exposure 
and risks that are difficult and costly to change (very high 
confidence) and exacerbate existing inequalities for Indigenous 
Peoples and vulnerable groups, impeding achievement of SDGs, 
increasing adaptation needs and shrinking the solution space 
(high confidence). Decreasing maladaptation requires attention 
to justice and a shift in enabling conditions towards those that 
enable timely adjustments for avoiding or minimising damage 
and for seizing opportunities (high confidence). (Figure TS.11a)

TS.D.3.1 Maladaptation has been observed across many regions 
and systems and occurs  for many reasons, including  inade-
quate  knowledge and  short-term, fragmented, single-sector 
and/or non-inclusive governance planning and implementa-
tion (high confidence). Policy decisions that ignore the risks of 
adverse effects can be maladaptive by worsening the impacts of 
and vulnerabilities to climate change (high confidence). Examples 
include in coastal systems (e.g., sea walls that enable further exposure 
through intensification of developments in low-lying coastal areas), 
urban areas (e.g., inflexible infrastructure in cities and settlements that 
cannot be adjusted easily or affordably for increased heavy rainfall), 
agriculture (e.g., the use of high cost irrigation in areas that are projected 
to have more intense drought conditions), forestry (e.g., planting of 
unsuitable trees species which displace Indigenous Peoples and other 
forest-­dependent communities ) and human settlements (e.g., stranded 
assets and stranded vulnerable communities that cannot afford to shift 
away or adapt and require an increase in social safety nets) (high 
confidence). {Box 2.2, 2.6.6, 2.6.5, 3.6.3, Box 4.3, Box 4.5, 4.7.1, Figure 4.29,

them of food and livelihoods and reinforces and entrenches 
existing inequalities (high confidence). Rights-based approaches 
to adaptation, participatory methodologies and inclusion of local 
and Indigenous knowledge, combined with informed consent, deliver 
mechanisms to avoid these pitfalls (medium confidence). Adaptation 
solutions benefit from engagement with Indigenous and marginalised 
groups, solve past equity and justice issues and offer novel approaches 
(medium confidence). Indigenous knowledge is a powerful tool to 
assess interlinked ecosystem functions across terrestrial, marine and 
freshwater systems, bypassing siloed approaches and sectoral problems 
(high confidence). Lastly, engagement with Indigenous knowledge 
and marginalised groups often offers an intergenerational context for 
adaptation solutions needed to avoid maladaptation (high confidence). 
{2.6.5, 4.6.9, 8.4, 8.4.5, 5.12.8, 5.13.4, 11.4.1, 11.4.2, 12.5.8, 13.8.1, 
Box 13.2, 14.4, 14.5.9, 5.13.5, 15.6.5, 18.2.4, CCP5.4.2, Box CCP7.1}
TS.D.3.3 Reliance on hard protection against sea level rise can 
lead to development intensification, which compounds risk and 
locks in exposure of people and assets as socioeconomic and 
governance barriers and technical limits are reached. Avoiding 
maladaptive responses to sea level rise depends on immediate mitigation 
and application of adaptive planning that sets out near-term, low-regret 
actions while keeping open options to account for ongoing committed 
sea level rise (very high confidence). Such forward-looking adaptive 
pathway planning and iterative risk management can address the 
current path dependencies that lead to maladaptation and can enable 
timely adaptation alignment with long implementation lead times, as 
well as addressing uncertainty about rate and magnitude of local sea 
level rise, and ensuring that adaptation will be more effective (medium 
confidence). As sea level rise advances, only avoidance and relocation 
will eliminate coastal risks (high confidence). Other measures only 
delay impacts for a time, increasing residual risk, perpetuating risk and 
creating ongoing legacy effects and inevitable property and ecosystem 
losses (high confidence). While relocation may in the near term appear 
socially unacceptable, economically inefficient or technically infeasible, 
it may become the only feasible option as protection costs become 
unaffordable and technical limits are reached (medium confidence). 
{3.4.2, 3.5.5, 3.6.3, 11.7.3, Box  11.6, 12.5.7, 12.5.8, 13.10, 15.3.4, 
15.5.1, 15.5.2, 15.5.3, CCP2.2.3, CCP4, CCB DEEP, CCB SLR}
TS.D.3.4 Maladaptation can be reduced using the principles of 
recognitional, procedural and distributional justice in decision-
making, responsibly evaluating who is regarded as vulnerable 
and at risk, who is part of decision-making, who is the beneficiary 
of adaptation measures and integrated and flexible governance 
mechanisms that account for long-term goals (high confidence). 
Examples include selecting native and appropriate species in habitat 
restoration, monitoring key social and environmental indicators for 
adaptation progress, embedding strong monitoring and evaluation 
processes, considering measures of efficiency and social welfare, 
and social and political drivers and power relationships. Integrated 
approaches, such as the water–energy–food nexus and inter-regional 
considerations of risks can reduce the risk of maladaptation, building 
on existing adaptation strategies, increasing community participation 
and consultation, integration of Indigenous knowledge and local

knowledge, focusing on the most vulnerable small-scale producers, 
anticipating risks of maladaptation in decision-making for long-lived 
activities, including infrastructure decisions, and the impact of trade-
offs and co-benefits (high confidence). (Figure TS.11a) {2.6.5, 2.6.6,

Strengthening the biosphere
TS.D.4  Diverse, self-sustaining ecosystems with healthy bio­
diversity provide multiple contributions to people that are 
essential for climate change adaptation and mitigation, thereby 
reducing risk and increasing societal resilience to future climate 
change (high confidence). Better ecosystem protection and 
management is key to reduce the risks that climate change poses 
to biodiversity and ecosystem services and build resilience; it 
is also essential that climate change adaptation be integrated 
into the planning and implementation of conservation and 
environmental management if it is to be fully effective in future 
(high confidence). Risks to ecosystems from climate change can 
be reduced by protection and restoration and also by a range 
of targeted actions to adapt conservation practice to climate 
change (high confidence). Protected areas are key elements of 
adaptation but need to be planned and managed in ways that 
take account of climate change, including shifting species distri-
butions and changes in biological communities and ecosystem 
structure. Adaptation to protect ecosystem health and integrity 
is essential to maintain ecosystem services, including for climate 
change mitigation and the prevention of greenhouse gas 
emissions. (Figure TS.12, Figure TS.5 ECOSYSTEMS) {2.5.4, 2.6.2, 
2.6.3, 2.6.6, 2.6.7, 3.6.2, 3.6.3, 3.6.5, 4.6.6, Box  4.6, 5.14.1,

CCP5.4.2, CCB NATURAL}
TS.D.4.1 Ecosystem protection and restoration can build resil-
ience of ecosystems and generate opportunities to restore eco-
system services with substantial co-benefits (high confidence) 
and provision of ecosystem-based adaptation.7  Ecosystem-based 
adaptation includes protection and restoration of forests, grasslands, 
peatlands and other wetlands, blue carbon systems (mangroves, salt 
marshes and seagrass meadows), and agroecological farming practices. 
In coastal systems, nature-based solutions, including ecosystem-based 
adaptation, can reduce impacts for human settlements until sea level 
rise results in habitat loss. High rates of warming and drought may 
severely threaten the success of nature-based solutions such as forest 
expansion or peatland restoration. Ecosystem-based adaptation is 
being increasingly advocated in coastal defence against storm surges, 
terrestrial flood regulation, reducing urban heat and restoring natural 
fire regimes. Nature-based solutions, including ecosystem-based 
adaptation, can therefore reduce risks for ecosystems and benefit 
people, provided they are planned and implemented in the right way 
and in the right place. For example, coastal wetlands and ecosystems 
can also be seriously damaged by coastal defences designed to protect

NATURAL, CCB SLR}
TS.D.4.2 Increasing the resilience of biodiversity and ecosystem 
services to climate change includes minimising additional stresses 
or disturbances, reducing fragmentation, increasing natural 
habitat extent, connectivity and heterogeneity, maintaining 
taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity and redundancy 
and protecting small-scale refugia where microclimate conditions 
can allow species to persist (high confidence). In some cases, 
specific management interventions may be possible to reduce risks to 
individual species or biological communities, including translocation or 
manipulating microclimate or site hydrology. Adaptation also includes 
actions to prevent the impacts of extreme events or aid the recovery of 
ecosystems following extreme events, such as wildfire, drought or marine 
heatwaves. In some cases, recovery of ecosystems from extreme events 
can be facilitated by removing other human pressures. Understanding the 
characteristics of vulnerable species can assist in early warning systems 
to minimise negative impacts and inform management intervention. 
(Figure TS.5 ECOSYSTEMS) {2.3, 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.5.3, 2.5.4, 2.6.2, 2.6.5,

FEASIB}
TS.D.4.4 Available adaptation options can reduce risks to 
ecosystems and the services they provide, but they cannot 
prevent all changes and should not be regarded as a substitute 
for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions (high confidence). 
Ambitious and swift global mitigation offers more adaptation 
options and pathways to sustain ecosystems and their services (high 
confidence). Even under current climate change, it is necessary to take 
account of climate change impacts, which are already occurring or are 
inevitable, in environmental management to maintain biodiversity and 
ecosystem services (high confidence), and this will become increasingly 
important at higher levels of warming. (Figure TS.5 ECOSYSTEMS) {2.2, 
2.3, 2.4.5, 2.5.1, 2.5.2, 2.5.3, 2.5.4, 2.6.1, 2.6.2, 2.6.3, 2.6.4, 2.6.5,

TS.D.4.5 Ecosystem-based adaptation measures can reduce 
climatic risks to people, including from flood, drought, fire 
and overheating (high confidence). Ecosystem-based adaptation 
approaches are increasingly being used as part of strategies to manage 
flood risk, at the coast in the face of rising sea levels and inland in the 
context of more extreme rainfall events (high confidence). Flood-risk 
measures that work with nature by allowing flooding within coastal 
and wetland ecosystems and support sediment accretion can reduce 
costs and bring substantial co-benefits to ecosystems, liveability 
and livelihoods (high confidence). In urban areas, trees and natural 
areas can lower temperatures by providing shade and cooling from 
evapotranspiration (high confidence). Restoration of ecosystems in 
catchments can also support water supplies during periods of variable

biodiversity benefits.
rainfall and maintain water quality and, combined with inclusive 
water regimes that overcome social inequalities, provide disaster risk 
reduction and sustainable development (high confidence). Restoring 
natural vegetation cover and wildfire regimes can reduce risks to 
people from catastrophic fires. Restoration of wetlands could support 
livelihoods and help sequester carbon (medium confidence), provided 
they are allowed accommodation space. Ecosystem-based adaptation 
approaches can be cost effective and provide a wide range of additional 
co-benefits in terms of ecosystem services and biodiversity protection 
and enhancement. (Figure TS.9 URBAN, Figure TS.11a) {2.6.3, 2.6.5, 
2.6.7, Table 2.7, 3.6.2, 3.6.3, 3.6.5, Box 4.6, Box 4.7, 12.5.1, 12.5.3,

CCP5.4.2, CCB NATURAL, CCB SLR}
TS.D.4.6 Ecosystem-based adaptation and other nature-based 
solutions8 are themselves vulnerable to climate change impacts 
(very high confidence). Under higher emissions scenarios they will 
increasingly be under threat. Nature-based solutions cannot deliver the 
full range of benefits, unless they are based on functioning, resilient 
ecosystems and developed taking account of adaptation principles. 
There is a serious risk that high-carbon ecosystems will become sources 
of greenhouse gas emissions, which makes it increasingly difficult 
to halt anthropogenic climate change without prompt protection, 
restoration, adaptation and mitigation at a global scale. {2.5.2, 2.5.3, 
2.5.4, 2.6.3, 2.6.5, 2.6.6, 2.6.7, 3.6.2, 3.6.3, 3.6.5, Box  4.6, 13.4.2, 
15.3.3, 15.5.4, CCB NATURAL, CCB SLR}
TS.D.4.7 Potential benefits and avoidance of harm are maximised 
when nature-based solutions are deployed in the right places 
and with the right approaches for those areas, with inclusive 
governance (high confidence). Taking account of interdisciplinary 
scientific information, Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge and 
practical expertise is essential to effective ecosystem-based adaptation 
(high confidence). There is a large risk of maladaptation where this 
does not happen (medium confidence). For example, naturally treeless 
peatlands can be afforested if they are drained, but this leads to the loss 
of distinctive peatland species as well as high greenhouse gas emissions. 
It is important that nature-based solution approaches to climate change 
mitigation also take account of climate change adaptation if they are to 
remain effective. {1.4.2, 2.2, 2.4.3, 2.4.4, 2.5.2, 2.5.3, 2.6.2, 2.6.3, 2.6.5,

Water and food sectors
TS.D.5  Various adaptation options in the water, agriculture 
and food sectors are feasible with several co-benefits (high 
confidence), some of which are effective at reducing climate 
impacts (medium confidence). Adaptation responses reduce 
future climate risks at 1.5°C warming, but effectiveness decreases 
above 2°C (high confidence). Resilience is strengthened by eco-
system-based adaptation (high confidence) and sustainable 
resource management of terrestrial and aquatic species (medium 
confidence). Agricultural intensification strategies produce

benefits but with trade-offs and negative socioeconomic and 
environmental effects (high confidence). Competition, trade-offs 
and conflict between mitigation and adaptation priorities will in-
crease with climate change impacts (high confidence). Integrated, 
multi-sectoral, inclusive and systems-oriented solutions reinforce 
long-term resilience (high confidence), along with supportive 
public policies (medium confidence). (Figure TS.6 FOOD-WATER, 
Figure TS.11a) {2.6, 4.6.2, 4.7.1, 4.7.4, 4.8, Box 4.3, Figure 4.27,

TS.D.5.1 There are a range of options for water- and food-related 
adaptation in different sociocultural, economic and geographical 
contexts, with benefits across several dimensions across regions 
(high confidence), including climate risk reduction (medium 
confidence). Frequently documented options include rainwater 
harvesting, soil moisture conservation, cultivar improvements, 
community-based adaptation, agricultural diversification, climate 
services and adaptive eco-management in fisheries (high confidence). 
Roughly 25% of assessed water-related adaptations have co-benefits, 
while 33% of the assessed reported current or future maladaptive 
outcomes (high confidence). There is  limited evidence, medium 
agreement  on the institutional feasibility or cost effectiveness of 
adaptation activities or their limits. Integration of Indigenous knowledge 
and local knowledge increase their effectiveness (high confidence).

TS.D.5.2 The projected future effectiveness of available 
adaptation for agriculture and food systems decreases with 
increasing warming (high confidence). Currently known adaptation 
responses generally perform more effectively at 1.5°C than at 2°C or 
more, with increasing risks remaining after adaptation at higher warming 
levels (high confidence). Irrigation expansion will face increasing limits 
due to water availability beyond 1.5°C (medium confidence), with a 
potential doubling of regional risks to irrigation water availability 
between 2°C and 4°C (medium confidence). Negative risks even with 
adaptation will become greater beyond 2°C warming in an increasing

TS.D.5.3 Ecosystem-based approaches, agroecology and other 
nature-based solutions in agriculture and fisheries have the 
potential to strengthen resilience to climate change with 
multiple co-benefits (high confidence); trade-offs and benefits 
vary with socioecological context. Options such as ecosystem 
approaches to  fisheries, agricultural diversification,  agroforestry 
and other ecological practices support long-term productivity and 
ecosystem services such as pest control, soil health, pollination and 
buffering of temperature extremes (high confidence), but potential 
and trade-offs vary by socioeconomic context, ecosystem zone,

TS.D.5.4 Sustainable resource management in response to 
distribution shifts of terrestrial and aquatic species under 
climate change is an effective adaptation option to reduce food 
and nutritional risk, conflict and loss of livelihood (medium 
confidence). Adaptation options exist to reduce the vulnerability of 
fisheries through better management, governance and socioeconomic 
dimensions (medium confidence) to eliminate overexploitation 
and pollution (high confidence). Indigenous knowledge and local 
knowledge can facilitate adaptation in small-scale fisheries, especially 
when combined with scientific knowledge and utilised in management 
regimes (medium confidence).  Adaptive transboundary governance 
and ecosystem-based management, livelihood diversification, capacity 
development and improved knowledge-sharing will reduce conflict 
and promote the fair distribution of sustainably harvested wild 
products and revenues (medium confidence). {5.8.4, 5.14.3, CCP5.4.2,

TS.D.5.5 Adaptation options that promote intensification of 
production have been widely adopted in agriculture for climate 
change adaptation, but with potential negative effects (high 
confidence). Agricultural intensification addresses short-term food 
security and livelihood goals but has trade-offs in equity, biodiversity 
and ecosystem services (high confidence).  Irrigation is widely used 
and effective for yield stability, but with several negative outcomes, 
including water demand (high confidence), groundwater depletion (high 
confidence), alteration of local to regional climates (high confidence), 
increasing soil salinity (medium confidence), widening inequalities and 
loss of rural smallholder livelihoods with weak governance (medium

Figure TS.11 |  (a) Climate responses and adaptation options, organized by System Transitions and Representative Key Risks (RKRs), are assessed for their multidimensional 
feasibility at global scale, in the near term and up to 1.5°C global warming. As literature above 1.5°C is limited, feasibility at higher levels of warming may change, which is currently 
not possible to assess robustly. Climate responses and adaptation options at global scale are drawn from a set of options assessed in AR6 that have robust evidence across the 
feasibility dimensions. This figure shows the six feasibility dimensions (economic, technological, institutional, social, environmental and geophysical) that are used to calculate the 
potential feasibility of climate responses and adaptation options, along with their synergies with mitigation. For potential feasibility and feasibility dimensions, the figure shows high, 
medium, or low feasibility. Synergies with mitigation are identified as high, medium, and low. Insufficient evidence is denoted by a dash. {CCB FEASIB, Table SMCCB FEASIB.1.1,

assessed for observed benefits (+) to ecosystems and their services, ethnic groups, gender equity, and low-income groups, or observed dis-benefits (-) for these systems and groups. 
Where there is highly diverging evidence of benefits/ dis-benefits across the scientific literature, e.g., based on differences between regions, it is shown as not clear or mixed (•). 
Insufficient evidence is shown by a dash. The relation with the SDGs is assessed as having benefits (+), dis-benefits (-) or not clear or mixed (•) based on the impacts of the climate 
response and adaptation option on each SDG. Areas not coloured indicate there is no evidence of a relation or no interaction with the respective SDG. The climate responses and

TS.D.5.6 Integrated and systems-oriented solutions to alleviate 
competition and trade-offs between mitigation and adaptation 
will reinforce long-term resilience and equity in water and 
food systems (high confidence). Large-scale land deals for climate 
mitigation have trade-offs with livelihoods, water and food security (high 
confidence). Afforestation programmes without adequate safeguards 
adversely affect Indigenous Peoples’ rights, land tenure and adaptive 
capacity (high confidence). Some mitigation measures, such as carbon 
capture and storage, bio-energy and afforestation, have a high water 
footprint (high confidence). Increased demand for aquaculture, animal 
and marine foods and energy products will intensify competition and 
potential conflict over land and water resources, particularly in low- and 
medium-income countries (high confidence), with negative impacts 
on food security and deforestation (medium confidence). Integrated, 
systems-oriented solutions reduce competition and trade-offs and 
include inclusive governance, behavioural (e.g., healthier diets with 
lower carbon and water footprints) and technical (e.g., novel feeds) 
responses (high confidence).{1.4.2, 2.2, 2.3, 2.5. 2.6, 3.6.3, 4.7.1, 4.7.6,

TS.D.5.7 Integrated multi-sectoral strategies that address social 
inequities (e.g., gender, ethnicity) and social protection of low-
income groups will increase the effectiveness of adaptation 
responses for water and food security (high confidence). 
Multiple interacting factors help to ensure that adaptive communities 
have water and food security, including addressing poverty, social 
inequities, violent conflict, provision of social services such as water 
and sanitation, social safety nets and vital ecosystem services. 
Differentiated responses based on water and food security level 
and climate risk increase effectiveness, such as social protection 
programmes for extreme events, medium-term responses such as local 
food procurement for school meals, community seed banks or well 
construction to build adaptive capacity (medium confidence). Longer-
term responses include strengthening ecosystem services, local and 
regional markets, enhanced capacity and reducing systemic gender, 
land tenure and other social inequalities as part of a rights-based 
approach (medium confidence). In the urban context, policies that 
account for social inclusion in governance and rights to green urban 
spaces will enhance urban agriculture’s potential for food and water 
security and other ecosystem services. (Figure  TS.6 FOOD-WATER)

Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge, are a pre-condition

Cities, settlements and infrastructure
TS.D.6  Cities and settlements are crucial for delivering urgent 
climate action. The concentration and interconnection of people, 
infrastructure and assets within and across cities and into rural 
areas drives the creation of risks and solutions at a global scale 
(high confidence). Concentrated inequalities in risk are broken 
through prioritising affordable housing and upgrading of 
informal and precarious settlements, paying special attention 
to including marginalised groups and women (high confidence). 
Such actions are most effective when deployed across grey/
physical infrastructure, nature-based solutions and social policy 
and between local and city-wide or national actions (medium 
confidence). City and local governments remain key actors 
facilitating climate change adaptation in cities and settlements. 
Community-based action is also critical. Multi-level governance 
opens an inclusive and accountable adaptation space across 
scales of decision-making, improving development processes 
through an understanding of social and economic systems, 
planning, experimentation and embedded solutions, including 
processes of social learning. (Figure TS.9 URBAN, Figure TS.11a) 
{4.6.5, 4.7.1, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 8.5.2, 10.3.6, 10.4.6, 12.5.5, 
13.6.2, 13.11.1, 14.5.5, 15.7, 16.4.2, CWGB URBAN}
TS.D.6.1 Continuing rapid growth in urban populations and 
unmet needs for healthy, decent, affordable and sustainable 
housing and infrastructure represent a global opportunity to 
integrate inclusive adaptation strategies into development 
(high confidence). The urban adaptation gap shows that for all world 
regions, current adaptation is unable to resolve risks from current 
climate change associated hazards. Moreover, an additional 2.5 billion 
people are projected to be living in urban areas by 2050, with up to 
90% of this increase concentrated in the regions of Asia and Africa 
(high confidence). Retrofitting, upgrading and redesigning existing 
urban places and infrastructure combined with planning and design 
for new urban infrastructure can utilise existing knowledge on social 
policy, nature-based solutions and grey/physical infrastructure to build 
inclusive processes of adaptation into everyday urban planning and 
development. {4.6.5, 6.1, 6.3, 6.4, 9.9.5, 10.3.4, 12.5.5, 13.6.2, 13.11.3}
TS.D.6.2 Diverse adaptation responses to current and near-
term climate impacts are already under way in many cities and 
settlements in different world regions (very high confidence). 
These responses range from hard engineering interventions to 
nature-based solutions, social policy and social safety nets to disaster 
management and capacity building, raising or relocation of settlements 
and combinations of such measures sequenced over time. While many 
more cities have developed adaptation plans since AR5, few of these

TS.D.6.3 Globally, urban adaptation gaps exist for all climate 
change-driven risks, although the limits to adaptation are 
unevenly distributed (medium confidence). Governance capacity, 
financial support and the legacy of past urban infrastructure 
investment constrain how cities and settlements can adapt to key 
climate risks (medium confidence). The gap between what can be 
adapted to and what has been adapted to is uneven; it is larger for 
the poorest 20% of populations than for the wealthiest 20%. The 
adaptation gap is also geographically uneven; it is highest in Africa 
(medium confidence). Limits to adaptation are often most pronounced 
in rapidly growing urban areas and smaller settlements, including 
those without dedicated local government. At the same time, legacy 
infrastructure in large and mega cities, designed without taking 
climate change risk into account, and past adaptation decisions 
constrain innovation, leading to stranded assets and with increasing 
numbers of people unable to avoid harm, including heat stress and 
flooding, without transformative adaptation (medium confidence).

CCP2.3.6, CCP2.4, CCP2.5, CWGB URBAN}
TS.D.6.4 The greatest gaps between policy and action are in 
projects to integrate justice concerns into adaptation action, 
address complex interconnected risks where solutions lie 
outside as well as within a city, for example in the food–energy–
water–health nexus, and resolve compound risks such as the 
relationships between air quality and climate risk (medium 
confidence). The most critical capacity gaps at the city and community 
levels that hinder adaptation include an ability to identify social 
vulnerability and community strengths and to plan in integrated ways to 
protect communities, alongside the ability to access innovative funding 
arrangements and manage finance and commercial insurance, as well 
as locally accountable decision-making with sufficient access to science, 
technology and local knowledge to support application of adaptation 
solutions at scale. As ecosystems provide important additional benefits 
to human well-being and coastal livelihoods, urban adaptation 
strategies can be developed for settlements and nearby ecosystems; 
combining these with engineering solutions can extend their lifetime 
under high rates of sea level rise (medium confidence). In Central and 
South America, the adoption of nature-based solutions and hybrid 
(green-grey) infrastructure are still emerging. Monitoring and evaluation 
frameworks that incorporate questions of justice, ecological health and 
multi-sector considerations can help to move away from more narrow, 
static, indicator-based approaches to adaptation. (high confidence) 
{4.6.5, Box 4.8, 5.12.5, 6.1, 6.3, 6.4, 10.3.4, 12.5.5, 13.6.1, 13.6.2}
TS.D.6.5 Key innovations in adaptation in social policy and 
nature-based solutions have not been matched by innovation 
in adaptation finance, which tends to favour established 
mechanisms, often led by grey/physical infrastructure at the 
national scale. Social policy innovations include social safety nets, 
inclusive approaches to disaster risk reduction and the integration 
of climate adaptation into education. Nature-based solutions 
include green and blue infrastructure in and around cities, including 
hinterlands, that increase water access and reduce hazards for cities 
and settlements, for example reforestation of hill-slope and coastal 
areas. In Europe, many urban innovations are pilot tested, but their up-
scaling remains challenging. Where inclusive approaches to adaptation 
policy and action are supported, this can enable wider gains of more 
equitable urbanisation (medium confidence). (Figure  TS.9 URBAN)

FEASIB, CWGB URBAN}
TS.D.6.6 Many urban adaptation plans focus narrowly on climate 
risk reduction and specific climate-associated risks, missing 
opportunities to advance co-benefits with climate mitigation 
and sustainable development (high confidence). This narrow 
approach limits opportunity for urban and infrastructure adaptation 
to tackle the root causes of inequality and exclusion, especially 
among marginalised groups, including women. Urban adaptation 
measures have many opportunities to contribute to climate resilient 
development pathways (medium confidence). They can enhance 
social capital, livelihoods, human and ecological health and contribute 
to low-carbon futures. Urban planning, social policy and nature-
based solutions bring great flexibility with co-benefits for climate 
mitigation and sustainable development. Participatory planning for 
infrastructure provision and risk management in informal, precarious 
and underserved neighbourhoods, the inclusion of Indigenous 
knowledge and local knowledge, and communication and efforts 
to build local leadership especially among women and youth are 
examples of inclusive approaches with co-benefits for equity. Targeted 
development planning across the range of innovation and investment 
in social policy, nature-based solutions and grey/physical infrastructure 
can significantly increase the adaptive capacity of urban settlements 
and cities and their contribution to climate resilient development (high 
confidence). (Figure TS.9 URBAN) {4.6.5, 6.1, 6.3, 6.4, Box 6.6, 7.4.1,

Adaptation policy that focuses on informality and sub-serviced 
or inadequately serviced neighbourhoods and supports inclusive 
urbanisation by considering the social and economic root causes of 
unequal vulnerability and exposure can contribute to the broader goals 
of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and reduce vulnerability 
to non-climatic risks, including pandemic risk (high confidence). More 
comprehensive and clearly articulated global ambitions for city and 
community adaptation will contribute to inclusive urbanisation by 
addressing the root causes of social and economic inequalities that 
drive social exclusion and marginalisation, so that adaptation can 
directly support the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (high

Sea level rise
TS.D.7  The ability of societies and ecosystems to adapt to current 
coastal impacts to address present and future coastal risks under 
further acceleration of sea level rise depends on immediate and 
effective mitigation and adaptation actions that keep options 
open to further adapt (high confidence). Adaptation pathways 
break adaptation planning into manageable steps based on near-
term, low-regret actions and aligning adaptation choices with 
societal goals that account for changing risk, interests and values, 
uncertain futures and the long-term commitment to adapting to 
sea level rise (high confidence). In charting adaptation pathways, 
reconciling divergent  interests and values  is a priority (high 
confidence). (Figure TS.9 URBAN) {11.7.3, 13.10, 14.5.2, Box 14.4,

TS.D.7.1 As the scale and pace of sea level rise accelerates 
beyond 2050, long-term adjustments may in some locations be 
beyond the limits of current adaptation options and for some 
species and some locations could be an existential risk in the 
21st century (medium confidence). Nature-based interventions, 
for example wetlands and salt marshes, can reduce impacts and 
costs while supporting biodiversity and livelihoods but have limits 
under high warming levels and rapid sea level rise (high confidence). 
Ecological limits and socioeconomic, financial and governance barriers 
will be reached first and are determined by the type of coastline and 
city or settlement (medium confidence). Accommodation can reduce 
impacts on people and assets but can address only limited sea level 
rise. Considering the long term now will help to avoid maladaptive 
lock-in, to build capacity to act in a timely and pre-emptive manner 
and to reduce risks to ecosystems and people. {3.4.2, 3.6.3, 11.7.3, 
13.2, 14.5.2, 15.3.4, CCP2.3, CCB DEEP, CCB SLR}
TS.D.7.2 Adaptation for coastal ecosystems requires space, 
networks and sediment to keep up with sea level rise (high 
confidence). With higher warming, faster sea level rise and increasing 
human pressures due to coastal development, the ability to adapt 
decreases (high confidence). Adaptation options, such as providing 
sufficient space for a coastal system to migrate inland, when combined 
with ambitious and urgent mitigation measures, can reduce impacts, 
but they depend on the type of coastline and patterns of coastal 
development (high confidence). With rapid sea level rise, these options 
will become insufficient to limit risks for marine ecosystems and 
their services such as food provision, coastal protection and carbon 
sequestration (high confidence). (Figure TS.11a) {3.4.2, 3.5.5, 3.6.3, 
Box 3.4, 14.5.2, CCB SLR}
TS.D.7.3 A wide range of adaptation options exists for reducing 
the ongoing multi-faceted coastal risks in cities and settlements 
(very high confidence). A mix of infrastructure, nature-based, 
institutional and sociocultural interventions can best address the 
risks. The options include vulnerability-reducing measures, avoidance 
(e.g., disincentivising developments in high-risk areas and addressing 
existing social vulnerabilities), hard and soft protection (e.g., sea walls, 
coastal wetlands), accommodation (e.g., elevating houses), advance 
(e.g., building up and out to sea) and staged, managed retreat (e.g., 
landward movement of people and development) interventions (very 
high confidence). (Figure TS.9 URBAN) {3.6.2, 3.6.3, 11.3.5, Box 11.6,

CCP2.3, CCP2.4, CCB FEASIB, CCB SLR}
TS.D.7.4 Implementation of coastal adaptation can be delayed 
by competing public and private interests, trade-offs among 
development and conservation objectives, legacy development, 
policy inconsistencies, contradictory short- and long-term 
objectives and uncertainties on the timing and scale of impacts 
(high confidence). Local government barriers to coastal adaptation 
could lead to courts’ becoming de facto decision makers for local 
adaptation, and this could be compounded by legislative shortcomings 
and fragmentation, insufficient leadership, lack of coordination 
between governance levels and disagreement about financial 
responsibility (high confidence). {11.7.3, 15.5.6, CCP2.4}
TS.D.7.5 Adaptation is costly, but the benefit-to-cost ratio is high 
for urbanised coastal areas with high concentrations of assets 
(high confidence). Protection has a high benefit-cost ratio during the 
21st century but can become unaffordable and insufficient to reduce 
coastal risk (e.g., due to salinisation, drainage of rivers and excess 
water), reaching technical limits (high confidence). Hard protection 
sets up lock-in of assets and people to risks and reaches limits by the 
end of the century or sooner, depending on the scenario, local sea level 
rise effects and community tolerance thresholds (high confidence). 
Considering coastal retreat as part of the solution space could lower 
global adaptation costs but would result in large land losses and high 
levels of migration for South and Southeast Asia in particular and in 
relative terms, small island nations would suffer most (high confidence). 
Solutions include disincentivising developments in high-risk areas and 
addressing existing social vulnerabilities now (high confidence). {3.4.2,

Reconciling divergent worldviews, values and interests can unlock the 
productive potential of conflict for transitioning towards pathways 
that foster climate resilient development, generate equitable

TS.D.7.7 Experience in coastal cities and settlements highlights 
critical enablers for addressing coastal hazard risk compounded 
by sea level rise (high confidence). These enablers include building 
and strengthening governance capacity and capabilities to tackle 
complex problems; taking a long-term perspective in making short-
term decisions; enabling more effective coordination across scales, 
sectors and policy domains; reducing injustice, inequity and social 
vulnerability; and unlocking the productive potential of coastal 
conflict while strengthening local democracy (medium evidence, 
high agreement). Flexible options enable responses to be adjusted as 
climate risk escalates and circumstances change, which may increase 
exposure  (medium confidence). Legal and financial provisions can 
enable managed retreat from the most at-risk locations (medium 
confidence) but require coordination, trust and legitimate decisions by 
and across policy domains and sectors (high confidence) that prioritise 
vulnerability, justice and equity (medium confidence). Inclusive, 
informed and meaningful deliberation and collaborative problem-
solving depend on safe arenas for engagement by all stakeholders 
(high confidence). {CCP2.4, Table CCP2.1, Table CCP2.2, CCB SLR}
Health, well-being, migration and displacement
TS.D.8  With proactive, timely and effective adaptation, many 
risks for human health and well-being could be reduced and some 
potentially avoided (very high confidence). Building adaptive 
capacity through sustainable development and encouraging safe 
and orderly movements of people within and between states 
represent key adaptation responses to prevent climate-related 
involuntary migration (high confidence). Reducing poverty, 
inequity and food and water insecurity and strengthening 
institutions in particular reduce the risk of conflict and supports 
climate resilient peace (high confidence). (Figure TS.8 HEALTH) 
{2.6.4, 4.6.4, Box 4.4, 5.12.5, 5.14, Box 6.3, 7.4.1, 8.4.4, 9.10.3,

14.5.6, Table 14.5, CCB ILLNESS}
TS.D.8.1 National planning on health and climate change is 
advancing, but the comprehensiveness of strategies and plans 
need to be strengthened to reduce future risks, and implement-
ing action on key health and climate change priorities remains 
challenging (high confidence). The COVID-19 pandemic demon-
strated the value of coordinated planning across sectors, safety nets 
and other capacities in societies to cope with a range of shocks and 
stresses and to alleviate system-wide risks to health (high confidence). 
A significant adaptation gap exists for human health and well-being 
and for responses to disaster risks (very high confidence). Most Nation-
ally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement from low- and 
middle-income countries identify health as a priority concern (very high 
confidence). Effective governance institutions, arrangements, funding 
and mandates are key for adaptation to climate-related health risks 
(high confidence). {4.6.4, 5.12.5, 5.14, 7.4.1, 7.4.2, 7.4.3, Table  7.2, 
9.10.3, 10.4.7.3, 11.3.6, 12.5.6, 13.7.2, CCB ILLNESS, CCB COVID}
TS.D.8.2 Continued investment in general health systems and in 
systems enhancing health protection is an effective adaptation 
strategy in the short to medium term (high confidence). Although 
some mortality and morbidity from climate change are already 
unavoidable, targeted adaptation and mitigation actions can reduce 
risks and vulnerabilities (high confidence). The burden of diseases 
could be reduced and resilience increased through health systems, 
generating awareness of climate change impacts on health (medium 
confidence), strengthening access to water and sanitation (high 
confidence), integrating vector control management approaches (very 
high confidence), expanding existing early-warning monitoring systems 
(high confidence), increasing vaccine development and coverage 
(medium confidence), improving the heat resistance of the built 
environment (medium confidence) and building financial safety nets 
(medium confidence). {2.6.4, 4.6.4, 5.12.5, 5.14, 7.4.1, 7.4.2, Table 7.2,

Table 14.5, CCP6.2.6, CCB FEASIB, CCB ILLNESS}
TS.D.8.3 Many adaptation measures that benefit health and 
well-being are found in other sectors (e.g., food, livelihoods, 
social protection, water and sanitation, infrastructure) (high 
confidence). Such cross-sectoral solutions include improved air quality 
through renewable energy sources (very high confidence), active 
transport (e.g., walking and cycling) (high confidence) and sustainable 
food systems that lead to healthier diets (high confidence). Heat 
Action Plans have strong potential to prevent mortality from extreme 
heat events and elevated temperature (high confidence). Nature-
based solutions reduce a variety of risks to both physical and mental 
health and well-being (high confidence). For example, integrated 
agroecological food systems offer opportunities to improve dietary 
diversity while building climate-related local resilience to food insecurity 
(high confidence), especially when combined with gender equity and 
social justice. Social policy–based adaptation, including education and 
the adaptation of health systems, offers considerable future scope. The 
greatest gaps between policy and action are in failures to manage 
adaptation of social infrastructure (e.g., community facilities, services 
and networks) and failure to address complex interconnected risks 
for example in the food–energy–water–health nexus or the inter-
relationships of air quality and climate risk (medium confidence).

Table 14.5, CCB GENDER, CCB HEALTH, CCB NATURAL}
TS.D.8.4 Despite acknowledgement of the importance of 
health adaptation as a key component, action has been slow 
since AR5 (high confidence). Building climate resilient health 
systems will require multi-sectoral, multi-system and collaborative 
efforts at all governance scales (very high confidence). Globally,

Technical Summary
TS
health systems are poorly resourced in general, and their capacity to 
respond to climate change is weak, with mental health support being 
particularly inadequate (very high confidence). The health sectors in 
some countries have focused on implementing incremental changes 
to policies and measures to respond to impacts (very high confidence). 
As the likelihood of dangerous risks to human health continues to 
increase, there is a greater need for transformational changes to 
health and other systems (very high confidence). This highlights an 
urgent and immediate need to address the wider interactions between 
environmental change, socioeconomic development and human health 
and well-being (high confidence). {7.4.1, 7.4.2, 7.4.3, 9.10.3, Box 9.7, 
11.3.6.3, 13.7.2, 14.5.6, CCP6.2.6, Figure CCP6.3}
TS.D.8.5 Financial constraints are the most referenced barrier 
to health adaptation, and therefore scaling up financial 
investments remains a key international priority (very high 
confidence). Financial support for health adaptation is currently less 
than 0.5% of overall dispersed multilateral climate finance projects 
(high confidence). This level of investment is insufficient to protect 
human health and health systems from most climate-sensitive health 
risks (very high confidence). Adaptation financing often does not reach 
places where the climate sensitivity of the health sector is greatest 
(high confidence). {7.4.1, 7.4.2, 7.4.3, 9.10.3}
TS.D.8.6 Reducing future risks of involuntary migration and 
displacement due to climate change is possible by improving 
outcomes of existing migration patterns, addressing vulner-
abilities that pose barriers to in situ adaptation and livelihood 
strategies and meeting existing migration agreements and 
development objectives (medium confidence). Properly support-
ed and where levels of agency and assets are high, migration as an 
adaptation to climate change can reduce exposure and socioeconomic 
vulnerability (medium confidence). However, migration becomes a risk 
when climate hazards cause an individual, household or community 
to move involuntarily or with low agency (high confidence). Inability 
to migrate (i.e., involuntary immobility) in the face of climate hazards 
is also a potential risk to exposed populations (medium confidence). 
Broad-based institutional and cross-sectoral efforts to build adaptive 
capacity, including meeting the SDGs, reduce future risks of climate-
related involuntary displacement and immobility (medium confidence), 
while policies such as the Global Compact on Safe, Orderly and Reg-
ular Migration (medium confidence) that are aimed at ensuring safe 
and orderly movements of people within and between states are 
potential components of climate resilient development pathways that 
can improve migration as an adaptation. {4.6.8, 7.4.4, 9.3.1, 12.5.8, 
CCP5.4.2, CCB FEASIB, CCB MIGRATE}
TS.D.8.7 Improving the feasibility of planned relocation and 
resettlement is a high priority for managing climate risks (high 
confidence). Residents of small island states do not view relocation 
as an appropriate or desirable means of adapting to the impacts of 
climate change (high confidence). Previous disaster- and development-
related relocation has been expensive and contentious, posed multiple 
challenges for governments and amplified existing ones and generated 
new vulnerabilities for the people involved (high confidence).  In 
locations where permanent, government-assisted relocation becomes 
unavoidable, active involvement of local populations in planning and 
decision-making may lead to more successful outcomes (medium 
confidence). {4.6.8, 7.4.4, 9.3.1, 12.5.8, 15.5.3, CCP5.4.2, CCB FEASIB, 
CCB MIGRATE}
TS.D.8.8 Meeting SDGs supports adaptive capacity that in turn 
supports individuals, households and community manage climate 
risks and supports peace (high confidence). By addressing vulner-
ability, improving livelihoods and strengthening institutions, meeting 
the SDGs reduces the risks of armed conflict and violence (medium 
confidence). Formal institutional arrangements for natural resource 
management and environmental peacebuilding, conflict-sensitive 
adaptation and climate-sensitive peacebuilding and gender-sensitive 
approaches offer potential new avenues to build peace in conflict-
prone regions vulnerable to climate change (medium confidence). 
However, there is currently insufficient evidence on their success and 
further monitoring and evaluation is required. (Figure  TS.11b) {4.8, 
7.4.6, Box 9.9, 16.3.2, CCB GENDER}
Justice, equity and governance
TS.D.9  Adaptation actions consistent with climate justice address 
near- and long-term risks through decision-making processes 
that attend to moral and legal principles of fairness, equity and 
responsibility including to historically marginalised communities 
and that distribute benefits, burdens and risks equitably (high 
confidence). Concepts of justice, consent and rights-based deci-
sion-making, together with societal measures of well-being, are 
increasingly used to legitimate adaptation actions and evaluate 
the impacts on individuals and ecosystems, diverse communities 
and across generations (medium confidence). Applying these 
principles as part of monitoring and evaluating the outcomes 
of adaptation, particularly during system transitions, provide a 
basis for ensuring that the distribution of benefits and costs are 
identified (medium confidence). {1.4.1, 4.8, 5.10.4, 5.12.3, 6.1.5, 
6.3.6, 12.5.7, 14.7.2, 17.5.1, CCB FEASIB, CCB GENDER}
TS.D.9.1 Near-term adaptation responses influence future 
inequalities, poverty, livelihood security and well-being (high 
confidence). Adaptation and mitigation approaches that exacerbate 
inequitable access to resources and fail to address injustice increase 
suffering, including water and food insecurity and malnutrition rates for 
vulnerable groups that rely directly or indirectly on natural resources for 
their livelihoods (high confidence). {1.4.1, 5.12.3, 5.13.3, 6.3.6, 8.6.2, 
Box 9.3, 12.5.7, 18.1}
TS.D.9.2 Under an inequality scenario (SSP4), the number of 
people living in extreme poverty could increase by more than 
100  million (medium confidence). There is medium evidence 
and low agreement about the adaptation impacts of derivative-
based insurance products. Insurance solutions are difficult for low-
income groups to access (medium confidence). Formal insurance 
policies come with risks when implemented in a stand-alone manner, 
including risks of maladaptation (medium confidence). {5.13.5,

physical abilities (high confidence). Therefore, participation of 
historically excluded groups, such as women, youth and marginalised 
communities (e.g., Indigenous Peoples, ethnic minorities, the disabled 
and low-income households), contributes to more equitable and socially 
just adaptation actions. Adaptation actions do not automatically have 
positive outcomes for gender equality. Understanding the positive and 
negative links of adaptation actions with gender equality goals (i.e., 
SDG 5) is important to ensure that adaptive actions do not exacerbate 
existing gender-based and other social inequalities (high confidence). 
Climate literacy varies across diverse communities, compounding 
vulnerability {2.6.3, 2.6.7, 4.3, 4.6, 4.6.9, 5.12.5, 5.14, 6.4.4, Box 6.1, 
9.4.5, Box 9.1, 12.5.8, 16.1.4, CCB GENDER}
TS.D.9.4 Empowering marginalised communities in the co-pro-
duction of policy at all scales of decision-making advances equi-
table adaptation efforts and reduces the risks of maladaptation 
(high confidence). Recognising Indigenous rights and local knowledge 
in the design and implementation of climate change responses contrib-
utes to equitable adaptation outcomes (high confidence). Indigenous 
knowledge and local knowledge play an important role in finding solu-
tions and often creates critical linkages between cultures, policy frame-
works, economic systems and natural resource management (medium 
confidence). Intergenerational approaches to future climate planning 
and policy will become increasingly important in relation to the manage-
ment, use and valuation of social-ecological systems (high confidence). 
Many regions benefit from the significant diversity of local knowledge 
and systems of production, informed by long-standing experience with 
natural variability, providing a rich foundation for adaptation actions ef-
fective at local scales (high confidence). {2.6.3, 2.6.7, 4.8.3, 4.8.4, 4.8.5, 
5.12.5, 6.1, 6.4.1, 8.6.2, 8.6.3, 9.1, 9.12, 11.4.1, 11.4.2, 12.5.7, 12.5.8,

TS.D.9.5 Proactive partnerships of government with the 
community, private sector and national agencies to minimise 
negative social, environmental or economic impacts of economy-
wide transitions are emerging, but their implementation is 
uneven (medium confidence). The greatest gains are achieved 
by prioritising investment to reduce climate risk for low-income and 
marginalised residents, particularly in informal settlements and rural 
communities (high confidence). Some city and local governments 
invest directly in adaptation action and work in partnership with a 
range of agencies. Legislative frameworks will assist business and 
insurance sector investment in key infrastructure to drive adaptive 
action at scale for equitable outcomes (medium confidence). {Box 5.8, 
6.4, 6.4.1, 8.5.2, 8.6.3, 9.4.2, 17.4.3, CCP5.2.4, CCB FINANCE}
TS.D.9.6  Inter-sectional, gender-responsive and inclusive decision-
making can accelerate transformative adaptation over the long 
term to reduce vulnerability (high confidence). Approaches to 
adaptation that address the needs of the most disadvantaged, through 
co-production of knowledge, are more sensitive to diverse community 
priorities and can yield beneficial climate co-adaptation benefits. There 
are gender differences in climate literacy in many regions exacerbating 
vulnerability in agricultural contexts in access to resources and 
opportunities for climate resilient crops (high confidence) {3.6.4, 4.6.5, 
4.8.5, 5.4.4, 5.13.4, Table 5.6, 6.3.6, 9.4.2, 9.4.5, Box 9.2, CCB FEASIB, 
CCB MOVING PLATE}
TS.D.9.7 Local leadership, especially among women and youth, 
can advance equity within and between generations (medium 
confidence). Since AR5, social movements, including movements led 
by youth, Indigenous and ethnic communities, have heightened public 
awareness about the need for urgent, inclusive action to achieve 
adaptation that can also enhance well-being and advance climate 
justice. {4.8.3, Box 5.13, 6.1.5, 6.2, 6.3.5, 6.4, 6.4.1, 6.4.7, Box 6.6, 
Box 9.1, Box 9.2}
TS.D.9.8. Climate justice initiatives that explicitly address multi-
dimensional inequalities as part of a climate change adaptation 
strategy can reduce inequities in access to resources, assets and 
services as well as participation in decision-making and leadership, and 
are essential to achieving gender and climate justice (high confidence). 
{Box 6.1, Box 9.2, 13.7.2, 13.11.1, CCB GENDER}
Enabling implementation
TS.D.10. Various tools, measures and processes are available that 
can enable, accelerate and sustain adaptation implementation 
(high confidence), in particular when anticipating climate change 
impacts, and empower inclusive decision-making and action 
when they are supported by adaptation finance and leadership 
across all sectors and groups in society (high confidence). The 
actions and decisions taken today determine future impacts 
and play a critical role in expanding the solution space for 
future adaptation. Breaking adaptation down into manageable 
steps over time, while acknowledging potential long-term 
adaptation needs and options, can increase the prospect that 
effective adaptation plans will be actioned in timely and 
effective ways by stakeholders, sectors and institutions (high 
confidence). {2.6.7, 3.6.3, 3.6.5, 4.8, 11.7.3, 13.10, 15.3.4, 15.6,

TS.D.10.1 Institutional frameworks, policies and plans that set 
out adaptation goals, define responsibilities and commitment 
devices, coordinate among actors and build adaptive capacity 
will facilitate sustained adaptation actions (very high 
confidence). Adaptation is considered in the climate policies of 
at least 170  countries. Opportunities exist to integrate adaptation 
into institutionalised decision cycles (e.g., budget reforms, statutory 
monitoring and evaluation, election cycles) and during windows of 
opportunity (e.g., recovery after disastrous events, designing new or 
replacing existing critical infrastructure or developing COVID recovery 
projects) (high confidence). Appraisal of adaptation options for policy 
and implementation that considers the risks of adverse effects can 
help prevent maladaptive adaptation and take advantage of possible 
co-benefits (medium confidence). Instruments such as behavioural 
nudges, re-directing subsidies and taxes and the regulation of 
marketing and insurance schemes have proven useful to strengthening 
societal responses beyond governmental actors (medium confidence).

Technical Summary
TS
TS.D.10.2 Access to and mobilising adequate financial resources 
for vulnerable regions is an important catalysing factor 
for timely climate resilient development and climate risk 
management (high confidence). Total tracked climate finance has 
increased from USD364  billion yr-1 in 2010/2011 to USD579  billion 
in 2017/2018, with only 4–8% of this allocated to adaptation and 
more than 90% of adaptation finance coming from public sources. 
Developed-country climate finance leveraged for developing countries 
for mitigation and adaptation has shown an upward trend, but it has 
fallen short of the USD100 billion yr-1 2020 target of the Copenhagen 
commitment, and less than 20% has been for adaptation. Estimated 
global and regional costs of adaptation vary widely due to differences in 
assumptions, methods and data; the majority of more recent estimates 
are higher than the figures presented in AR5. Median (and ranges) 
estimated costs for developing country adaptation from recent studies 
are USD127 (15–411) and USD295 (47–1088) billion yr-1 for 2030 and 
2050 respectively. Examples of estimated regional adaptation include 
USD50 billion yr-1 in Africa for 1.5°C of warming in 2050, increasing to 
USD100–350 billion yr-1 for 4°C of global warming towards the end 
of the century. Increasing public and private finance flows by billions 
of dollars per year, increasing direct access to multilateral funds, 
strengthening project pipeline development and shifting finance 
from readiness activities to project implementation can enhance 
implementation of climate change adaptation and are fundamental 
to achieving climate justice for highly vulnerable countries, including 
small island states and African countries. {3.6.3, 4.8.2, 5.14.2, 9.1.1,

TS.D.10.3 Decision-support tools and decision-analytic methods 
are available and being applied for climate adaptation and climate 
risk management in different contexts (high confidence). 
Integrated adaptation frameworks and decision-support tools that 
anticipate multi-dimensional risks and accommodate community 
values are more effective than those with a narrow focus on single risks 
(medium confidence). Approaches that integrate the adaptation needs 
of multiple sectors such as disaster management, account for different 
risk perceptions and integrate multiple knowledge systems are better 
suited to addressing key risks (medium confidence). Reliable climate 
services, monitoring and early warning systems are the most commonly 
used strategies for managing the key risks, complementing long-term 
investments in risk reduction (high confidence). While these strategies 
are applicable to society as a whole, they need to be tailored to specific 
contexts in order to be adopted effectively. {2.6.7, 3.6.3, 3.6.5, 4.5.5, 5.14.1, 
7.2.2, 7.4.1, 7.4.2, 9.5.1, 9.4.3, 9.10.3, 9.11.4, Box 9.2, Box 9.7, 15.5.7,

TS.D.10.4 Effective management of climate risks is dependent 
on systematically integrating adaptations across interacting 
climate risks and across sectors (very high confidence). Integrated 
pathways for managing climate risks will be most suitable when so-
called ‘low-regret’ anticipatory options are established jointly across 
sectors in a timely manner and are feasible and effective in their local 
context, when path dependencies are avoided so as not to limit future 
options for climate resilient development and when maladaptations 
across sectors are avoided (high confidence). Integration of risks across 
sectors can be assisted by mainstreaming climate considerations 
across institutions and decision-making processes (high confidence). 
Many forms of climate adaptation are likely to be more effective, 
efficient and equitable when organised collectively and with multiple 
objectives. Using different assessment, modelling, monitoring and 
evaluation approaches can facilitate understanding of the societal 
implications of trade-offs. {1.4.2, 2.6, 4.5.1, 4.5.2. 11.3.11, 11.5.1, 
11.5.2, 11.7, 11.7.2, 11.7.3, 13.5.2, 13.10, 13.11.2, 13.11.3, 15.7; 
17.3.1, 17.6, CCP2.3.6, CCP5.4.2, CCB DEEP}
TS.D.10.5 Forward-looking adaptive planning and iterative risk 
management can avoid path dependencies and maladaptation 
and ensure timely action (high confidence). Approaches that break 
down adaptation into manageable steps over time and use pathway 
analyses to determine low-regret actions for the near-term and long-
term options are a useful starting point for adaptation (medium 
confidence). Decision frameworks that consider multiple objectives, 
scenarios, time frames and strategies can avoid privileging some views 
over others and help multiple actors to identify resilient and equitable 
solutions to complex, deeply uncertain challenges and explicitly deal 
with trade-offs. Considering socioeconomic developments and climatic 
changes beyond 2100 is particularly relevant for long-lived investment 
decisions such as new harbours, airports, urban expansions and flood 
defences to avoid lock-ins (medium confidence). Monitoring climate 
change, socioeconomic developments and progress on implementation 
is critical for learning about adaptation success and maladaptation 
and to assess whether, when and what further actions are needed for 
informing iterative risk management (high confidence). {1.5.2, 11.7, 
13.2.2, 13.11.1, 17.5.2, CCP2.3.6, CCB DEEP}
TS.D.10.6 Enhancing climate change literacy on impacts and 
possible solutions is necessary to ensure widespread, sustained 
implementation of adaptation by state and non-state actors 
(high confidence). Ways to enhance climate literacy and foster 
behavioural change include access to education and information, 
programmes involving the performing and visual arts, storytelling, 
training workshops, participatory three-dimensional modelling, 
climate services and community-based monitoring. The use of 
Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge represents and codifies 
actual experiences and autonomous adaptations and facilitates 
awareness, clarifies risk perception and enhances the understanding 
and adoption of solutions. Narratives can effectively communicate 
climate information and link this to societal goals and the actions 
needed to achieve them (high confidence). {1.2.2, 1.3.2, 1.3.3, 1.5.2, 
5.4.4, 5.5.4, 5.8.4, 5.13.2, 5.14.1, 5.14.2, 9.4.5, 14.3, 15.6.4, 15.6.5}
TS.D.10.7 Political commitment and follow-through across  all 
levels of government are important to accelerate the 
implementation of adequate and timely adaptation actions 
(high confidence). Implementing actions often requires large upfront 
investments of human and financial resources and political capital by 
public, private and societal actors, while the benefits of these actions 
may only become visible in the mid to long term (medium confidence). 
Examples that can accelerate adaptation action include accountability 
and transparency mechanisms, monitoring and evaluation of 
adaptation progress, social movements, climate litigation, building 
the economic case for adaptation and increased adaptation finance 
(medium evidence, high agreement). {3.6.3, 3.6.5, 4.8.5, 4.8.6, 4.8.7,

System transitions and transformational adaptation
TS.D.11 Deep-rooted transformational adaptation opens new 
options for adapting to the impacts and risks of climate change 
(high confidence) by changing the fundamental attributes of 
a system, including altered goals or values and addressing 
the root causes of vulnerability. AR6 focuses on five system 
transitions to a just and climate resilient future: societal, energy, 
land and ocean ecosystems, urban and infrastructure, and 
industrial. These transitions call for transformations in existing 
social and social-technological and environmental systems that 
include shifts in most aspects of society. Managing transition 
risk is a critical element of transforming society, increasingly 
acknowledging the importance of transparent, informed and 
inclusive decision-making and evaluation, including a role for 
Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge. (Figure TS.11a, b)

TS.D.11.1 A sub-set of adaptation options has been implemented 
that cuts across sectors to enable sector-specific adaptation 
responses. These options, such as disaster risk management, climate 
services and risk sharing, increase the feasibility and effectiveness 
of other options by expanding the solution space available (high 
confidence). For example, carefully designed and implemented disaster 
risk management and climate services can increase the feasibility 
and effectiveness of adaptation responses to improve agricultural 
practices, income diversification, urban and critical services and 
infrastructure planning (very high confidence). Risk insurance can be a 
feasible tool to adapt to transfer climate risks and support sustainable 
development (high confidence). They can reduce both vulnerability and 
exposure, support post-disaster recovery and reduce financial burden 
on governments, households and business. {3.6.3, 3.6.5, 4.6, 4.7.1, 
5.4.4, 5.6.3, 5.5.4, 5.8.4, 5.9.4, 5.12.4, 5.14.1, 5.14.2, 13.11.2, 14.7.2, 
15.5.7, CCB FEASIB, CCB GENDER, CCB MOVING PLATE}
TS.D.11.2 Transformations for energy include the options of 
efficient water use and water management, infrastructure 
resilience and reliable power systems, including the use of 
intermittent renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind 
energy, with the use of storage (very high confidence). These 
options are not sufficient for the far-reaching transformations required 
in the energy sector, which tend to focus on technological transitions 
from a fossil-based to a renewable energy regime. A resilient power 
infrastructure is considered for energy generation, transmission 
and distribution systems. Distributed generation utilities, such as 
microgrids, are increasingly being considered, with growing evidence 
of their role in reducing vulnerability, especially within underserved 
populations (high confidence). Infrastructure resilience and reliable 
power are particularly important in reducing risk in peri-urban and 
rural areas when they are supported by distributed generation of 
renewable energy by isolated systems (high confidence). The option 
for a resilient power infrastructure is considered for all types of 
power generation sources and transmission and distribution systems. 
Efficient water use and water management especially in hydropower 
and combined cycle power plants in drought-prone areas have a 
high feasibility (high confidence) with multiple co-benefits (medium 
confidence). Water-related adaptation in the energy sector is highly 
effective up to 1.5°C but declines with increasing warming (medium 
confidence). {4.6.2, 4.7.1, 4.7.2, 4.7.3, Figure 4.28, Figure 4.29, 13.6.2, 
15.7, 18.3, CCP5.4.2, CCB FEASIB}
TS.D.11.3 Adaptation options that are feasible and effective to the 
3.4 billion people living in rural areas around the world and who 
are especially vulnerable to climate change, include the provision 
of basic services, livelihood diversification and strengthening of 
food systems (high confidence). The vulnerability of rural areas to 
climate risks increases due to the long distances to urban centres and 
the lack of or deficient critical infrastructure such as roads, electricity 
and water. Providing critical infrastructure, including through distributed 
generation power systems through renewable energy, has provided many 
co-benefits (high confidence). Biodiversity management strategies have 
social co-benefits, including improved community health, recreational 
activities and ecotourism, which are co-produced by harnessing ecological 
and social capital to promote resilient ecosystems with high connectivity 
and functional diversity. Strengthening local and regional food systems 
through strategies such as collective trademarks, participatory guarantee 
systems and city–rural links build rural livelihoods, resilience and self-
reliance (medium confidence). Livelihood diversification is a key coping 
and adaptive strategy to climatic and non-climatic risks. There is high 
evidence (medium agreement) that diversifying livelihoods improves 
incomes and reduces socioeconomic vulnerability, but feasibility changes 
depending on livelihood type, opportunities and local context. Key 
barriers to livelihood diversification include sociocultural and institutional 
barriers as well as inadequate resources and livelihood opportunities that 
hinder the full adaptive possibilities of existing livelihood diversification 
practices (high confidence). (Figure TS.11b) {4.6.2, 4.7.1, 5, 8, 14.5.9, CCB 
FEASIB}
TS.D.11.4 Adaptation can require system-wide transformation 
of ways of knowing, acting and lesson-drawing to rebalance 
the relation between human and nature (high confidence). 
Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge, ecosystem-based 
adaptation and community-based adaptation are often found together 
in effective adaptation strategies and actions and together can generate 
transformative sustainable changes, but they need the resources, legal 
basis and an inclusive decision process to be most effective (medium 
confidence). Governance measures that transparently accommodate 
science and Indigenous knowledge can act as enablers of such co-­
production. {1.3.3, 2.6.5, 2.6.7, 5.14.1, 5.14.2, 6.4.7, 9.12, Box 9.1, 11.3.3,

15.5.4, 15.5.5, 17.2.2, 17.3.1, 17.4.4, CCP6.3.2, CCP 6.6, CCP6.4.3}
TS.D.11.5 Factors motivating transformative adaptation actions 
include risk perception, perceived efficacy, sociocultural norms 
and beliefs, previous experiences of impacts, levels of education 
and awareness (medium confidence). Risk responsibilities across 
the globe are unclear and unevenly defined (high confidence). In 
the face of climate change, assigning risk responsibilities facilitates 
upgrading and supporting adaptation efforts (risk governance). There 
are at least two contrasting approaches for pursuing deliberate 
transformation: one seeking rapid, system-wide change and the other a 
collection of incremental actions that together catalyse desired system 
changes (medium confidence). {1.5.2, 6.4.7, 17.2.1, 17.2.2, CCP5.4.2}

Climate Resilient Development
Sustainable development, equity and justice
TS.E.1  Climate resilient development implements greenhouse 
gas mitigation and adaptation options to support sustainable 
development. With accelerated warming and the intensification 
of cascading impacts and compounded risks above 1.5°C 
warming, there is a sharply increasing demand for adaptation 
and climate resilient development linked to achieving 
SDGs and equity and balancing societal  priorities. There is 
only limited ­opportunity to widen the remaining solution 
space and take advantage of  many potentially effective, yet 
unimplemented, options for reducing society and ecosystem 
vulnerability  (high  confidence).  (Figure  TS.2, Figure  TS.9 
URBAN, Figure TS.11a, Figure TS.13) {1.2.3, 1.5.1, 1.5.2, 1.5.3, 
2.6.7, 3.6.5, 4.8, Box 4.7, 7.1.5, 7.4.6, 13.10.2, 13.11, 17.2.1, 18.1, 
CCB COVID, CCB FINANCE, CCB HEALTH, CCB NATURAL}
TS.E.1.1  Prevailing development pathways do not advance 
climate resilient development (very high confidence). Societal 
choices in the near term will determine future pathways. There 
is no single pathway or climate that represents climate resilient 
development for all nations, actors or scales, as well as globally, 
and many solutions will emerge locally and regionally. Global trends 
including rising income inequality, urbanisation, migration, continued 
growth in greenhouse gas emissions, land use change, human 
displacement and reversals of long-term trends toward increased 
life expectancy run counter to the SDGs as well as efforts to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to a changing climate.  With 
progressive climate change,  enabling conditions  will diminish, and 
opportunities for successfully transitioning systems for both mitigation 
and adaptation will become more limited (high confidence). Investments 
in economic recovery from COVID-19 offer opportunities to promote 
climate resilient development (high confidence). (Figure TS.13) {16.6.1, 
17.2.1, 18.2, 18.4, CCP5.4.4, CCB COVID}
TS.E.1.2  System transitions can enable climate resilient devel-
opment when accompanied by appropriate enabling conditions 
and inclusive arenas of engagement (very high confidence). Five 
system transitions are considered: energy, industry, urban and infra-
structure, land and ecosystems, and society. Advancing climate resilient 
development in specific contexts may necessitate simultaneous progress 
on all five transitions. Collectively, these system transitions can widen 
the solution space and accelerate and deepen the implementation 
of sustainable development, adaptation and mitigation actions by 
equipping actors and decision makers with more effective options (high 
confidence). For example, urban ecological infrastructure linked to an 
appropriate land use mix, street connectivity, open and green spaces 
and job-housing proximity provides adaptation and mitigation benefits 
that can aid urban transformation (medium confidence). These system 
transitions are necessary precursors for more fundamental climate 
and sustainable-development transformations but can simultaneously 
be outcomes of transformative actions. Enhancing equity and agency 
are cross-cutting considerations for all five transitions. Such transitions 
can generate benefits across different sectors and regions, provided 
they are facilitated by appropriate enabling conditions, including ef-
fective governance, policy implementation, innovation and climate and 
development finance, which are currently insufficient (high confidence). 
{3.6.4, 15.7, 18.3, 18.4, Table 18.5, CCB FEASIB, CWGB URBAN}
TS.E.1.3 System transitions are highly feasible. For energy system 
transitions, there is medium confidence in the high feasibility 
of resilient infrastructure and efficient water use for power 
plants and high confidence in the synergies of this option with 
mitigation. For coastal ecosystem transitions, there is medium to high 
confidence that ecosystem conservation and biodiversity management 
are increasing adaptive and ecological capacity with socioeconomic 
co-benefits and positive synergies with carbon sequestration. However, 
opportunity costs can be a barrier. For land ecosystem transitions, there 
is high confidence in the role of agroforestry to increase ecological and 
adaptive capacity, once economic and cultural barriers and potential 
land use change trade-offs are overcome. There is high confidence in 
improved cropland management and its economic feasibility due to 
improved productivity. For efficient livestock systems, there is medium 
confidence  in the high technological and ecological feasibility. 
(Figure TS.11a) {CCB FEASIB}
TS.E.1.4 For urban and infrastructure system transitions, there 
is  medium confidence  for sustainable land use and urban 
planning. There is high confidence in the economic and ecological 
feasibility of green infrastructure and ecosystem services, as well as 
sustainable urban water management, once institutional barriers in 
the form of limited social and political acceptability are overcome. 
Social safety nets, disaster risk management and climate services and 
population health and health  systems are considered overarching 
adaptation options due to their applicability across all system 
transitions. There is medium to high confidence in the high feasibility of 
disaster risk management and the use of demand-driven and context-
specific climate services as well as in the socioeconomic feasibility of 
social safety nets. Improving health systems through enhancing access 
to medical services and developing or strengthening surveillance 
systems can have high feasibility when there is a robust institutional 
and regulatory framework (high confidence). (Figure  TS.8 HEALTH, 
Figure TS.9 URBAN, Figure TS.11a, Figure TS.13) {6.3, CCB FEASIB}
TS.E.1.5  There are multiple possible pathways by which 
communities, nations and the world can  pursue climate 
resilient development. Moving towards different pathways 
involves confronting complex synergies and trade-offs between 
development pathways and the options, contested values and 
interests that underpin climate mitigation and adaptation 
choices (very high confidence).  Climate resilient development 
pathways are trajectories for the pursuit of climate resilient development 
and navigating its complexities. Different actors, the private sector and 
civil society, influenced by science, local and Indigenous knowledges, 
and the media, are both active and passive in designing and navigating 
climate resilient development pathways. Increasing levels of warming 
may narrow the options and choices available for local survival and 
sustainable development for human societies and ecosystems. Limiting 
warming to Paris Agreement goals will reduce the magnitude of climate 
risks to which people, places, the economy and ecosystems will have 
to adapt. Reconciling the costs, benefits and trade-offs associated with 
101
Technical Summary
TS
adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development interventions 
and how they are distributed among different  populations and 
geographies is essential and challenging but also creates the potential 
to pursue synergies that benefit human and ecological well-being (high 
confidence). {1.2.1, 18.1, 18.4}
TS.E.1.6. Economic sectors and global regions are exposed to 
different opportunities and challenges in facilitating climate 
resilient development, suggesting adaptation and mitigation 
options should be aligned to local and regional context and 
development pathways (very high confidence). Given their current 
state of development, some regions may prioritise poverty and inequality 
reduction and economic development over the near term as a means 
of building capacity for climate action and low-carbon development 
over the long term. In contrast, developed economies with mature 
economies and high levels of resilience may prioritise climate action to 
transition their energy systems and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
Some interventions may be robust in that they are relevant to a broad 
range of potential development trajectories and could be deployed 
in a flexible manner. However, other types of interventions, such as 
those that  are dependent upon emerging technologies, may require 
a specific set of enhanced enabling conditions or factors, including 
infrastructure, supply chains, international cooperation and education 
and training that currently limit their implementation to certain settings. 
Notwithstanding national and regional differences, development 
practices that are aligned to people, prosperity, partnerships, peace 
and the planet as defined in Agenda 2030 could enable more climate 
resilient development. (high confidence) {18.5, Figure 18.1}
TS.E.1.7 Pursuing climate resilient development involves 
considering a broader range of sustainable development 
priorities, policies and practices, as well as enabling societal 
choices to accelerate and deepen their implementation  (very 
high confidence).  Scientific assessments of climate change have 
traditionally framed solutions around the implementation of specific 
adaptation and mitigation options as mechanisms for reducing 
climate-related risks. They have given less attention to a fuller set of 
societal priorities and  the role of non-climate policies, social norms, 
lifestyles, power relationships and worldviews in enabling climate action 
and sustainable development. Because climate resilient development 
involves different actors pursuing plural development trajectories  in 
diverse contexts, the pursuit of solutions that are equitable for all 
requires opening the space for engagement and action to a diversity 
of people, institutions, forms of knowledge and worldviews. Through 
inclusive modes of engagement that enhance knowledge sharing and 
realise the productive potential of diverse perspectives and worldviews, 
societies could alter institutional structures and arrangements, 
development processes, choices and actions that have precipitated 
dangerous climate change, constrained the achievement of SDGs and 
thus limited pathways to achieving climate resilient development. The 
current decade is critical to charting climate resilient development 
pathways that catalyse the transformation of prevailing development 
practices and offer the greatest promise and  potential for human 
well-being and planetary health (very high confidence). {18.4, Box 18.1}
TS.E.2  Climate action and sustainable development are 
interdependent. Pursued in an inclusive and integrated manner, 
they enhance human and ecological well-being. Sustainable 
development is fundamental to capacity for climate action, 
including reductions in greenhouse gas emissions as well as 
enhancing social and ecological resilience to climate change. 
Increasing social and gender equity is an integral part of the 
technological and social transitions and transformation towards 
climate resilient development. Such transitions in societal 
systems reduce poverty and enable greater equity and agency 
in decision-making. They often require rights-based approaches 
to protect the livelihoods, priorities and survival of marginalised 
groups including Indigenous Peoples, women, ethnic minorities 
and children (high confidence). {2.6.7, 4.8, 6.3.7, 6.4, 6.4.7, 18.2, 
18.4, CCB NATURAL}
TS.E.2.1 Conditions enabling rapid increases and innovative 
climate responses include experience of extreme events or 
climate education influencing perceptions of urgency, together 
with the actions of catalysing agents such as social movements 
and technological entrepreneurs. People who have experienced 
climate shocks are more likely to implement risk management 
measures (high confidence). Autonomous adaptation is very common 
in locations where people are more exposed to extreme events 
and have the resources and the temporal capacity to act on their 
own, for example in remote communities (high confidence).{3.5.2, 
4.2.1, 4.6, 4.7.1, 6.4.7, 8.5.2, 9.4.5, 17.4.5, 18.5}
TS.E.2.2 A range of policies, practices and enabling conditions 
accelerate efforts towards climate resilient development. 
Diverse actors including youth, women, Indigenous communities 
and business leaders are the agents of societal changes and 
transformations that enable climate resilient development 
(high confidence). Greater attention to which actors benefit, fail to 
benefit or are directly harmed by different types of interventions could 
significantly advance efforts to pursue climate resilient development. 
(medium to high confidence). {4.6,  4.7.1,  5.13, 5.14, 6.4.7, 8.4.5, 
9.4.5, 17.4, 18.5}
TS.E.2.3 Climate adaptation actions are grounded in local 
realities so understanding links with SDG 5 on gender 
equality ensures that adaptive actions do not worsen existing 
gender and other inequities within society (e.g., leading to 
maladaptation practices)  (high confidence). Adaptation actions 
do not automatically have positive outcomes for gender equality. 
Understanding the positive and negative links of adaptation actions 
with gender equality goals (i.e., SDG 5) is important to ensure that 
adaptive actions do not exacerbate existing gender-based and 
other social inequalities. Efforts are needed to change unequal 
power dynamics and to foster inclusive decision-making for climate 
adaptation to have a positive impact for gender equality  (high 
confidence).  There are very few examples of successful integration 
of gender and other social inequities in climate policies to address 
climate change vulnerabilities and questions of social justice (very 
high confidence). Yet inequities in climate change literacy compounds 
women’s vulnerability to climate change through its negative effect 
on climate risk perception {4.8.3, 9.4.5, 16.1.4, 17.5.1, CCB GENDER}

Technical Summary
TS
Figure TS.13 |  Climate resilient development is the process of implementing greenhouse gas mitigation and adaptation measures to support sustainable 
development. This figure builds on Figure SPM.9 in AR5 WGII (depicting climate resilient pathways) by describing how climate resilient development pathways are the result of 
cumulative societal choices and actions within multiple arenas.
Panel (a)  Societal choices towards higher climate resilient development (green cog) or lower climate resilient development (red cog) result from interacting decisions and actions 
by diverse government, private sector and civil society actors, in the context of climate risks, adaptation limits and development gaps. These actors engage with adaptation, 
mitigation and development actions in political, economic and financial, ecological, socio-cultural, knowledge and technology, and community arenas from local to international 
levels. Opportunities for climate resilient development are not equitably distributed around the world.
Panel (b)  Cumulatively, societal choices, which are made continuously, shift global development pathways towards higher (green) or lower (red) climate resilient development. 
Past conditions (past emissions, climate change and development) have already eliminated some development pathways towards higher climate resilient development (dashed 
green line).
Panel (c)  Higher climate resilient development is characterised by outcomes that advance sustainable development for all. Climate resilient development is progressively harder 
to achieve with global warming levels beyond 1.5°C. Inadequate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 reduces climate resilient development 
prospects. There is a narrowing window of opportunity to shift pathways towards more climate resilient development futures as reflected by the adaptation limits and increasing 
climate risks, considering the remaining carbon budgets. (Figure TS.3, Figure TS.4) {2.6, 3.6, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 16.4, 16.5, 17.3, 17.4, 17.5, 18.1, 18.2, 18.3, 18.4, Box 18.1,

Panel (d)  Appropriate choices for fostering climate resilient development pathways involve considering the portfolio of risks, the potential for adaptations to satisfactorily reduce 
risks and not exacerbate others, the potential for mitigation measures to interact with risks and adaptations within and across sectors, and how and whether adaptations can be 
enabled.  The graphic table illustrates a possible assembly (not exhaustive) of these considerations for four sectors (agriculture, water, built environments, ecosystems) in the region 
Africa, showing  (i) top panel: the potential for cascading and compounding effects amongst risks within sectors, between sectors and across boundaries and the possible constraints 
for adaptation (at what global warming level might risks become too great for adaptation – cell colour) and the adaptation gap to be filled (cell border) (risks are grouped by 
Representative Key Risks); (ii) second panel: the potential for adaptations to reduce risks, including their feasibility (cell border), their interaction with other adaptations addressing 
the same or interacting risks, and whether they are limited by global warming level (cell colour) (possible adaptations are identified for Representative Key Risks); (iii) third panel: 
the mitigation measures grouped into categories that might interact with risks and adaptations, including showing their importance (cell border) and whether the interaction would 
be potentially positive, negative or a mixture of both (cell colour) (note: ‘carbon’ refers to carbon sequestration); (iv) bottom panel: Enabling conditions for sectors grouped into 
categories of enablers common across many sectors, showing their importance (cell border) and how they may be suitable across a number of sectors, along with an assessment of 
the gap in the enabler for satisfactory adaptation (cell colour).  Confidence levels on each cell are indicated as *= low confidence, ** = medium confidence, *** = high confidence. 
(see also SMTS.4, Table SMTS.5) {16.5.2, Table SM16.4}
TS.E.2.4 Gender-sensitive, equity- and justice-based adaptation 
approaches, integration of Indigenous knowledge systems 
within legal frameworks and the promotion of Indigenous 
land tenure rights reduce vulnerability and increase resilience 
(high confidence).  Integrating adaptation into social protection 
programmes can build long-term resilience to climate change (high 
confidence). Nevertheless, social protection programmes can increase 
resilience to climate related shocks, even if they do not specifically 
address climate risks (high confidence). Climate adaptation actions 
are grounded in local realities so understanding links with SDGs is 
important to ensure that adaptive actions do not worsen existing 
gender and other inequities within society, leading to maladaptation 
practices  (high confidence).  {3.6.4,  4.8.3, 4.8.4,  9.4.5, Box  9.1, 
Box 9.2, Box 9.7, Box 9.8, Box 9.9, Box 9.10, Box 9.11, 14.4, Box 14.1, 
17.5.1, CCP6.3, Box CCP6.2 CCB GENDER}
TS.E.2.5 Water can be either an enabler or a hindrance to success-
ful adaptation and sustainable development. Central to equity 
issues about water is that it remains a public good (high con-
fidence). Overcoming institutional and financial constraints (govern-
ance, institutions, policies), including path dependency, is among the 
most important requirements enabling effective adaptation in the water 
sector (high confidence). Water-related challenges, despite reported 
adaptation efforts, indicate limits of adaptation in the absence of water 
neutral mitigation action (medium confidence). For some regions, such 
as small island states, coastal areas and mountainous regions, water 
availability already has the potential to become a hard limit on adapta-
tion (limited evidence, medium agreement). (Figure TS.6 FOOD-WATER) 
{4.5.3, 4.5.4, 4.5.5, 4.8, 4.6, 4.7.1, 4.7.2, 4.7.6, 6.4 case study 6.1, 15.3.4, 
CCP5.2.2}
TS.E.2.6 Procedural and distributional justice and flexible 
institutions facilitate successful adaptation and minimise 
maladaptive outcomes. Reorienting existing institutions to become 
more flexible (e.g., through capacity building and institutional reform) 
and inclusive is key to building adaptive governance systems that are 
equipped to take long-term decisions (medium confidence). Enhancing 
climate governance, institutional capacity and differentiated policies 
and regulation from the local to global scale enables and accelerates 
climate resilient development. Transforming financial systems to 
deliver the SDGs, while accelerating system transitions and addressing 
physical and transition risks, is a precondition. Changes in lifestyles, 
human behaviour and preferences can have a significant impact 
on adaptation implementation, demand and hence emissions and 
decision-making around climate action (high confidence). Additionally, 
the use of customary and traditional justice systems, such as those 
of Indigenous peoples, can enhance the equity of adaptation policy 
processes (high confidence). {4.8,  4.6,8, 5.2.3,  13.8,  15.6.1, 15.6.3, 
15.6.4, 15.6.5, 17.1, 18.4}
TS.E.2.7  Enabling environments for adaptation that support 
equitable sustainable development are essential for those 
with climate-sensitive livelihoods who are often least able to 
adapt and influence decision-making (high confidence). Enabling 
environments share common governance characteristics, including 
the meaningful involvement of multiple actors and assets, alongside 
multiple centres of power at different levels that are well integrated, 
vertically and horizontally (high confidence). Enabling conditions 
harness synergies, address moral and ethical choices and divergent 
values and interests and support just approaches to livelihood 
transitions that do not undermine human well-being (medium 
confidence). Climate solutions for health, well-being and the changing

Technical Summary
TS
structure of communities are complex and closely interconnected and 
call for new approaches to sustainable development that consider 
interactions between climate, human and socioecological systems 
to generate climate resilient development (high confidence). To 
address regionally specific adaptation and developmental needs, five 
key dimensions of climate resilient development are identified for 
Africa: climate finance, governance, cross-sectoral and transboundary 
solutions, adaptation law and climate services and climate change 
literacy  (high confidence). {4.6,  4.8,  6.4.7,  7.1.7,  8.5.1, 8.5.2, 
8.6.3, 9.4.1, 9.4.2, 9.4.3, 9.4.4, 9.4.5, 17.4}
TS.E.2.8 Prevailing ideologies or worldviews, institutions and 
sociopolitical relations influence development trajectories 
by framing climate narratives and possibilities for action 
(medium confidence). The interplay between worldviews and 
ethics, sociopolitical relations, institutions and human behaviour 
influence public engagement by individuals and communities. These 
open up opportunities for meaningful engagement and co-production 
of pathways towards climate resilient development. The urgency 
of climate action is a potential enabler of climate decision-making 
(medium confidence). Perceptions of urgency encourage communities, 
businesses and leaders to undertake climate adaptation and 
mitigation measures more quickly and to prioritise climate action (high 
confidence). {1.1.3, 6.4.3, 17.1, 17.4.5, 18.5}
Enablers of societal resilience
TS.E.3 A focus on climate risk alone does not enable effective 
climate resilience (high confidence).  The integration of 
consideration of non-climatic drivers into adaptation pathways 
can reduce climate impacts across food systems, human 
settlements, health, water, economies and livelihoods (high 
confidence). Strengthened health, education and basic social 
services are vital for improving population well-being and 
supporting climate resilient development (high confidence). The 
use of climate-smart agriculture technologies that strengthen 
synergies among productivity and mitigation is growing as 
an important adaptation strategy (high confidence). Pertinent 
information for farmers provided by climate information services 
is helping them to understand the role of climate  compared 
with other drivers in perceived productivity changes (medium 
confidence). Index insurance builds resilience and contributes 
to adaptation both by protecting farmers’ assets in the face 
of major climate shocks, by promoting access to credit and 
by adopting improved  farm technologies and practices (high 
confidence). {3.6.4, 4.6, 4.7.1, 7.4.6, Box 9.1, Box 9.7, Box 9.8, 
Box 9.9, Box 9.10, Box 9.11, 12.5.4}
TS.E.3.1  Societal resilience is strengthened by improving the 
management of environmental resources and ecosystem health, 
boosting adaptive capabilities of individuals and communities 
to anticipate future risks and minimise them and  removing 
drivers of vulnerability to bring together gender justice, equity, 
Indigenous and local knowledge systems and adaptation 
planning (very high confidence).  Societal resilience is  founded 
on  strengthening local democracy, empowering citizens to shape 
societal choices to support gender and equity inclusive climate resilient 
development (very high confidence). {7.4.1, 7.4.2, 7.4.3, 7.4.4, 7.4.5, 
7.4.6, 9.4.5, 13.11.3, 14.4, Box 14.1, 15.5.5, 17.5.1, CCP6.3, CCP6.4, 
Box CCP6.2, CCB GENDER}
TS.E.3.2 Some communities/regions are resilient with strong 
social safety nets and social capital that support responses 
and actions already occurring, but there is limited information 
on the effectiveness of adaptation practices and the scale of 
action needed (high confidence). Among island communities, 
greater insights into which drivers weaken local communities and 
Indigenous Peoples’ resilience, together with recognition of the 
sociopolitical contexts within which communities operate, can assist 
in identifying opportunities at all scales to enhance climate adaptation 
and enable action towards climate resilient development pathways 
(medium evidence, high agreement). Adaptation responses to climate-
driven impacts in mountain regions vary significantly in terms of goals 
and priorities, scope, depth and speed of implementation, governance 
and modes of decision-making and the extent of financial and other 
resources to implement them (high confidence). Adaptation in Africa 
has multiple benefits, and most assessed adaptation options have 
medium effectiveness at reducing risks for present-day global warming, 
but their efficacy at future warming levels is largely unknown (high 
confidence). In Australia and New Zealand, a range of incremental 
and transformative adaptation options and pathways is available as 
long as enablers are in place to implement them (high confidence). 
Several enablers can be used to improve adaptation outcomes and 
to build resilience (high confidence), including better governance and 
legal reforms; improving justice, equity and gender considerations; 
building human resource capacity; increased finance and risk transfer 
mechanisms; education and awareness programmes; increased access 
to climate information; adequately downscaled climate data; inclusion 
of Indigenous knowledge; and integrating cultural resources into 
decision-making (high confidence). {9.3, 9.6.4, 9.8.3, 9.11.4, 11.7.3, 
14.4, Box 14.1, 15.6.1, 15.6.5, 15.7, 15.6.3, 15.6.4, 15.6.5, CCP5.2.4, 
CCP5.2.7, CCP6.3, CCP6.4, Box CCP6.2, CCB GENDER}
TS.E.3.3 Identifying and advancing synergies and co-benefits of 
mitigation, adaptation and SDGs has occurred slowly and unevenly 
(high confidence). One area of sustained effort is community-based 
adaptation planning actions that have potential to be better integrated 
to enhance well-being and create synergies with the SDG ambitions 
of leaving no one behind (high confidence). Complex trade-offs and 
gaps in alignment between mitigation and adaptation over scale and 
across policy areas where sustainable development is hindered or 
reversed also remain (medium confidence). Globally, decisions about 
key infrastructure systems and urban expansion drive risk creation and 
potential action on climate change (high confidence). {4.7.6, 6.4.1, 6.4.3, 
6.4.4, 6.1, 6.2, 6.2.3, 6.3, 6.3.5.1, 6.4, 7.4.7, 9.3.2, CCB HEALTH, CWGB 
BIOECONOMY}
TS.E.3.4  Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge are 
crucial for social-ecological system resilience (high confidence). 
Indigenous Peoples have been faced with adaptation challenges for 
centuries and have developed strategies for resilience in changing 
environments that can enrich and strengthen other adaptation 
efforts (high confidence). Supporting indigenous self-determination, 
recognising Indigenous Peoples’ rights and supporting Indigenous 
109
Technical Summary
TS
knowledge-based adaptation can accelerate effective robust climate 
resilient development pathways (very high confidence). Indigenous 
knowledge underpins successful understanding of, responses to and 
governance of climate change risks (high confidence). For example, 
Indigenous knowledge contains resource-use practices and ecosystem 
stewardship strategies that conserve and enhance both wild and 
domestic biodiversity, resulting in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems 
and species that are often less degraded in Indigenous managed lands 
in other lands  (medium confidence). Valuing Indigenous  knowledge 
systems is a key component of climate justice (high confidence). {2.6.5, 
2.6.7, 4.8.3,  3.6.3, 3.6.4, 3.6.5,  4.8.4, 4.8.5, 4.8.6, 7.4.7, Box  7.1, 
Box  9.2,  12.5.1, 12.5.8, 12.6.2, 13.2.2,  13.8, 13.11, 14.4, 14.7.3,

TS.E.3.5 
Ecosystem-based 
adaptation 
reduces 
climate 
risk across sectors, providing social, economic, health and 
environmental co-benefits (high confidence).  Direct human 
dependence on ecosystem services, ecosystem health, and ecosystem 
protection and restoration, conservation agriculture, sustainable 
land management and integrated catchment management support 
climate resilience. Inclusion of interdisciplinary scientific information, 
Indigenous knowledge and practical expertise is essential to effective 
ecosystem-based adaptation (high confidence), and there is a large 
risk of maladaptation where this does not happen (high confidence). 
(Figure TS.9 URBAN) {1.4.2, 2.2, 2.3, 2.5. 2.6, Table 2.7, 3.6.2, 3.6.3,

9.12, CCP1, CCP6.3, CCP6.4, CCB NATURAL}
Ecosystem health and resilience
TS.E.4  Maintaining planetary health is essential for human 
and societal health and a pre-condition for climate resilient 
development (very high confidence). Effective ecosystem 
conservation on approximately 30% to 50% of Earth’s land, 
freshwater and ocean areas, including all remaining areas 
with a high degree of naturalness and ecosystem integrity, 
will help protect biodiversity, build ecosystem resilience and 
ensure essential ecosystem services (high confidence). In 
addition to this protection, sustainable management of the rest 
of the planet is also important. The protected area required 
to maintain ecosystem integrity varies by ecosystem type 
and region, and their placement will determine the quality 
and ecological representativeness of the resulting network. 
Ecosystem services that are under threat from a combination 
of climate change and other anthropogenic pressures include 
climate change mitigation, flood-risk management and water 
supply (high confidence). (Figure  TS.12) {2.5.4, 2.6.7, 3.4.2, 
3.4.3, 3.6.3, 3.6.5, 13.3.2, 13.5.2, 13.10.2, CCB NATURAL}
TS.E.4.1 Species conservation is an internationally recognised 
objective in its own right and is also important for human life 
and well-being: there is a strong positive association between 
species diversity and ecosystem health that is essential 
for providing critical regulating services, including climate 
regulation, water provisioning, pest and disease control and 
crop pollination (high confidence). The loss of species also lowers 
the resilience of the ecosystem as a whole, including its capacity to 
persist through climate change and recover from extreme events (high 
confidence). Species extinction levels that are more than 1000 times 
natural background rates as a result of anthropogenic pressures, and 
climate change will increasingly exacerbate this (high confidence). 
Conservation efforts are more effective when integrated into local 
spatial plans inclusive of adaptation responses, alongside sustainable 
food and fiber production systems (high confidence). Strong inclusive 
governance systems and participatory planning processes that support 
equitable and effective adaptation outcomes, are gender sensitive 
and reduce intergroup conflict are required for enhanced ecosystem 
protection and restoration (high confidence). {2.2, 2.5.2, 2.5.3, 2.5.4, 
2.6.1-3, 2.6.5, 2.6.7, Table  2.6, Table  2.7, 3.6.3, 3.6.4, 3.6.5, 5.8.4,

ILLNESS, CCB INDIG, , CCB MIGRATE, CCB NATURAL}
TS.E.4.2 Solutions that support biodiversity and the integrity of 
ecosystems deliver essential co-benefits for people including 
livelihoods, food and water security and human health and well-
being (high confidence). Limiting warming to 2°C and protecting 
30% of high-biodiversity regions in Africa, Asia and Latin America 
is estimated to reduce the risk of species extinctions by half (high 
confidence). Meeting the increasing needs of the human population 
for food and fibre production requires transformation in management 
regimes to recognise dependencies on local healthy ecosystems, with 
greater sustainability, including through increased use of agroecological 
farming approaches and adaptation to the changing climate (high 
confidence). People with higher levels of contact with nature have 
been found to be significantly happier, healthier and more satisfied 
with their lives (high confidence). Participatory, inclusive governance 
approaches such as adaptive co-management or community-based 
planning, which integrate those groups who rely on these ecosystems 
(e.g., Indigenous Peoples, local communities), support equitable and 
effective adaptation outcomes (high confidence). {2.5.4, 2.6.7, 3.4.2, 
3.4.3, 3.6.3, 3.6.4, 3.6.5, 4.8.5, 4.8.6, 5.8.4, 5.13.5, 5.14.1, 5.14.2, 
17.3.1, 17.3.2, 17.6, CCB NATURAL}
TS.E.4.3 Protecting and building the resilience of ecosystems 
through restoration, in ways which are consistent with sustainable 
development, are essential for effective climate change mitigation 
(high confidence). Degradation and loss of ecosystems is a major 
cause of greenhouse gas emissions, which is increasingly exacerbated by 
climate change (very high confidence). Globally, there is a 38% overlap 
between areas of high carbon storage and high intact biodiversity, 
but only 12% of that is protected (high confidence). Addressing this 
gap will require an approach which takes account of human needs, 
particularly food security. Tropical rainforests and global peatlands are 
particularly important carbon stores but are highly threatened by human 
disturbance, land conversion and fire. Climate resilient development 
will require strategies for land-based climate change mitigation to be 
integrated with adaptation, biodiversity and sustainable development 
objectives; there is good potential for positive synergies, but also the 
potential for conflict, including with afforestation and bioenergy crops, 
when these objectives are pursued in isolation (high confidence). {2.4.3, 
2.4.4, 2.5.3, 2.6.3, 2.6.5-7, 2.6.7, Box 2.2, 3.4.2, 3.5.5, Box 3.4, CCP7.3.2,

Technical Summary
TS
TS.E.4.4 Adaptive management in response to ecosystem 
change is increasingly necessary, and more so under higher 
emissions scenarios (high confidence). Feedback from monitoring 
and assessments of the changing state of planetary conditions and 
local ecosystems enables proactive adaptation to manage risks and 
minimise impacts (medium confidence). Integrated sectoral approaches 
promoting climate resilience, particularly for addressing the impacts 
of extreme events, are key to effective climate resilient development 
(medium confidence). {2.6.2, 2.6.3, 2.6.6, 2.6.7, 3.4.2, 3.4.3, 3.6.3, 
3.6.5, Box 3.4, 17.3.2, 17.6, CCB EXTREMES, SR1.5, SRCCL, SROCC}
TS.E.4.5 Adaptation cannot prevent all risks to biodiversity and 
ecosystem services (high confidence). Adaptation of conservation 
strategies, by building resilience and planning for unavoidable change, 
can reduce harm but will not be possible in all systems, for example, 
fragile ecosystems that reach critical thresholds or tipping points 
such as coral reefs, some forests, sea ice and permafrost systems. 
Conservation and restoration will alone be insufficient to protect 
coral reefs beyond 2030 (high confidence) and to protect mangroves 
beyond the 2040s (high confidence). Deep cuts in emissions will be 
necessary to minimise irreversible loss and damage (high confidence). 
(Figure TS.5 ECOSYSTEMS) {2.5.1, 2.5.2, 2.5.4, 2.6.1, 2.6.6, 3.4.2, 3.4.3, 
3.6.3, Figure 3.26, Table SM3.5, Table SM3.6}
Governance
TS.E.5  Governance arrangements and practices are presently 
ineffective to reduce risks, reverse path dependencies and 
maladaptation and facilitate climate resilient development (very 
high confidence). Governance for climate resilient development 
involves diverse societal actors, including the most vulnerable, 
who can work collectively, drawing upon local and Indigenous 
knowledges and science, and are supported by strong political will 
and climate change leadership (medium confidence). Governance 
practices will work best when they are coordinated within and 
between multiple scales and levels (institutional, geographical 
and temporal) and sectors, with supporting financial resources, 
are tailored for local conditions, are gender-responsive and 
gender-inclusive and are founded upon enduring institutional and 
social learning capabilities to address the complexity, dynamism, 
uncertainty and contestation that characterise escalating climate 
risk (medium confidence). {1.4.2, 3.6.2, 3.6.3, 4.8, 4.8.1, 4.8.2, 
4.8.3, 4.8.4, 4.8.5, 4.8.6, 4.8.7, 6.4.3, 6.4.4, 9.4.5, 17.4, 17.6}
TS.E.5.1 Prevailing governance efforts have not closed the 
adaptation gap (very high confidence), in part due to the 
complex interconnections between climate and non-climate risk 
and the limits of the predominant development and governance 
practices (high confidence). Institutional fragmentation, under- 
resourcing of services, inadequate adaptation funding, uneven 
capability to manage uncertainties and conflicting values and reactive 
governance across competing policy domains collectively lock in 
existing exposures and vulnerabilities, creating barriers and limits to 
adaptation, and undermine climate resilient development prospects 
(high confidence). This is amplified by inequity, poverty, population 
growth and high population density, land use change, especially 
deforestation, soil degradation, biodiversity loss, high dependence 
of national and local economies on natural resources for production 
of commodities, weak governance, unequal access to safe water and 
sanitation services and a lack of infrastructure and financing, which 
reduce adaptation capacity and deepen vulnerability (high confidence). 
{3.6.3, 3.6.5, 6.4.3, Figure 6.5, 9.4.1, 11.7, Table 11.14, Table 11.16, 
12.1.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.5.5, 12.5.7, Figure 12.2}
TS.E.5.2 Climate governance arrangements and practices are 
enabled when they are embedded in societal systems that advance 
human well-being and planetary health (very high confidence). 
Collective action and strengthened networked collaboration, more 
inclusive governance, spatial planning and risk-sensitive infrastructure 
delivery will contribute to reducing risks (medium confidence). Enablers 
for climate governance include better practices and legal reforms, 
improving justice, equity and gender considerations, building human 
resource capacity, increased finance and risk transfer mechanisms, 
education and climate change literacy programmes, increased access 
to climate information, adequately downscaled climate data and 
embedding Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge as well as 
integrating cultural resources into decision-making (high confidence). 
{4.8.7, 9.4.5, 15.6.1, 15.6.3, 15.6.4, 15.6.5, 17.4, 17.6}
TS.E.5.3 Climate governance will be most effective when it has 
meaningful and ongoing involvement of all societal actors from 
local to global levels (very high confidence). Actors, including 
individuals and households, communities, governments at all levels, 
private-sector businesses, non-governmental organisations, Indigenous 
Peoples, religious groups and social movements, at many scales and in 
many sectors, are adapting already and can take stronger adaptation 
and mitigation actions. Many forms of adaptation are more effective, 
more cost-efficient and more equitable when organised inclusively 
(high confidence). Greater coordination and engagement across levels 
of government, business and community serves to move from planning 
to action and from reactive to proactive adaptation (high confidence). 
Inclusion of all societal actors helps to secure credibility, relevance and 
legitimacy, while fostering commitment and social learning (medium to 
high confidence), as well as equity and well-being, and reduces long-
term vulnerability across scales (high evidence, medium agreement). 
Social movements in many cities, including those led by youth, have 
heightened public awareness about the need for urgent, inclusive 
adaptation that can enhance well-being, foster formal and informal 
cooperation and coherence between different institutions and build 
new adaptive capacities. City and local governments remain key actors 
facilitating climate change adaptation in cities and settlements (medium 
confidence). Private and business investment in key infrastructure, 
housing construction and insurance can drive adaptive action at 
scale but can exclude the priorities of the poor (medium confidence). 
Networked community actions can address neighbourhood-scale 
improvements and vulnerability at scale (very high confidence). {1.4.2, 
3.6.5, 6.1, 6.4, 9.4.5, Box 9.4, 11.4.1, 11.4.2, 14.6.3, Box 14.8, 17.2}
TS.E.5.4 Governance practices for climate resilient development 
will be most effective when supported by formal (e.g., the 
law) and informal (e.g., local customs and rituals) institutional 
arrangements providing for ongoing coordination between and 
alignment of local to international arrangements across sectors 
and policy domains (high confidence). Aligned national and 
111
Technical Summary
TS
international legal and policy instruments can support the development 
and implementation of adaptation and climate risk management 
(medium confidence) and reduce exposure to key risks (high confidence). 
Dedicated climate change acts can play a foundational and distinctive 
role in supporting effective climate governance, and are drivers of 
subsequent activity in both developing and developed countries (high 
confidence). The transboundary nature of many climate change risks 
and species responses will require transboundary solutions through

TS.E.5.5 Multi-lateral governance efforts can help reconcile 
contested interests, worldviews and values about how to 
address climate change (medium confidence). Policy responses 
and strategies that localise development and expand the adaptation 
and mobility options of populations exposed to climatic risks can also 
reduce risks of climate-related conflict and political instability (high 
agreement, medium evidence). Formal institutional arrangements for 
natural resource management can contribute to wider cooperation and 
peacebuilding (high confidence). Reducing vulnerability depends on 
the inclusive engagement of the most vulnerable, is gender-responsive 
and includes key societal actors from civil society, the private sector 
and government, with an especially important role played by local 
government in partnership with local communities. Strong governance 
and gender-sensitive approaches to natural resource management 
reduce the risk of intergroup conflict in climate-disrupted areas 
(medium confidence). {3.6.3, 3.6.4, 3.6.5, 4.8.5, 4.8.6, 4.8.7, 6.1, 7.4.4, 
7.4.5, CCB COVID, CCB GENDER, CCB HEALTH, CCB INDIG}
TS.E.5.6 A range of governance processes, practices and tools 
that are applicable across a range of temporal and spatial 
scales are available to support inclusive decision-making for 
adaptation and risk management in diverse settings (high 
confidence). National guidance and laws, policies and regulations, 
decision tools that can be tailored to local circumstances, innovative 
engagement processes and collaborative governance can motivate 
better understanding of climate risk and build climate resilient 
development (high confidence). Collaborative networks and 
institutions, including among local communities and their governing 
authorities, can help resolve conflicts (high confidence). A combination 
of robust climate information, adaptive decision-making under 
uncertainty, land use planning, public engagement and conflict 
resolution approaches can help to address governance constraints to 
prepare for climate risks and build adaptive capacity (high confidence). 
New modelling, monitoring and evaluation approaches, alongside 
disruptive technologies, can help understand the societal implications 
of trade-offs and build integrated pathways of low-regret anticipatory 
options, established jointly across sectors in a timely manner, to avoid 
locked-in development pathways (high confidence). {3.6.2, 3.6.3, 3.6.4,

Transformation towards climate resilient development
TS.E.6  Accelerating climate change and trends in exposure 
and vulnerability underscore  the need for rapid action on 
the range of transformational approaches  to expand the 
future set of effective, feasible and just solutions (very 
high confidence).  Transformation towards climate resilient 
development is advanced most effectively when actors work 
in inclusive and enabling ways to reconcile divergent interests, 
values and worldviews, building on information and knowledge 
on climate risk and adaptation options derived from different 
knowledge systems (high confidence).  Taking action now 
provides the foundation for adaptation to current and future 
risks, for large-scale mitigation measures and for effective 
outcomes for both.  (Figure  TS.13) {2.6.7, 3.4.2, 3.4.3, 3.6.5, 
7.2.1, 7.3.1, 8.3.3, 8.3.4, 8.4.5, Figure 8.12, 13.3.2, 13.4.2, 13.8, 
13.10.2, 18.3.2, Box 18.1, Figure 18.1, Table 18.5, CCB FEASIB, 
CCB FINANCE, CCB ILLNESS, CCB NATURAL}
TS.E.6.1 Large-scale, transformational adaptation necessitates 
enabling improved approaches to governance and coordination 
across sectors and jurisdictions to avoid overwhelming current 
adaptive capacities and to avoid future maladaptive actions 
(high confidence). Response options in one sector can become 
response risks that exacerbate impacts in other sectors. A deliberate 
shift from primarily technological adaptation strategies to those 
that additionally incorporate behavioural and institutional changes, 
adaptation finance, equity and environmental justice and that align 
policy with global sustainability goals will facilitate transformational 
adaptation (high confidence). Application and efficacy testing 
of climate resilient development, or adaptation pathways, show 
promise for implementing transformational approaches (medium 
confidence), including expansion of ecosystem-based adaptation 
approaches. Climate information services that are demand driven 
and context specific, combined with climate change literacy, have 
the potential to improve adaptation responses (high confidence). 
{5.14.3, 9.4.5, 14.7.2, 14.6, 17.6}
TS.E.6.2  Climate resilient development pathways depend on 
how contending societal interests, values and worldviews are 
reconciled through inclusive and  participatory interactions 
between governance actors in these arenas of engagement 
(high confidence). These interactions occur in many different arenas 
(e.g., governmental, economic and financial, political, knowledge, 
science and technology, community) that represent the settings, places 
and spaces in which societal actors interact to influence the nature 
and course of development. For instance, Agenda 2030 highlights 
the importance of multi-level adaptation governance, including non-
state actors from civil society and the private sector. This implies the 
need for wider arenas of engagement for diverse actors to collectively 
solve problems and to unlock the synergies between adaptation and 
mitigation and sustainable development (high confidence). {18.4.3}
TS.E.6.3 Managing transition risk is a critical element of 
transforming society (high confidence). System transitions 
towards climate resilient development pose potential risks 
to sectors and regions. This implies managing climate risk in the 
112

event that greenhouse gas mitigation efforts over- or underperform. 
In addition, decision makers should be aware of the financial risks 
associated with stranded assets, technology risks and the risks 
to social equity or ecosystem health. By acknowledging, assessing and 
managing such risks, actors will have a greater likelihood of achieving 
success in making development climate resilient. Opportunities exist 
to promote synergies between sustainable development, adaptation 
and mitigation, but trade-offs are likely unavoidable, and managing 
trade-offs and synergies will be important (high confidence). Climate 
resilient development risks and opportunities vary by location with 
uncertainty about global mitigation effort and future climates relevant 
to local planning (high confidence). {4.7.6, 4.8, 17.4, 17.6, 18.4, 18.5}
TS.E.6.4 Prospects for transformation towards climate resilient 
development increase when key governance actors work 
together in inclusive and constructive ways to create a set of 
appropriate enabling conditions (high confidence). These enabling 
conditions include effective governance and information flow, policy 
frameworks that incentivise sustainability solutions, adequate financing 
for adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development, institutional 
capacity, science, technology and innovation, monitoring and evaluation 
of climate resilient development policies, programmes and practices 
and international cooperation. Investment in social and technological 
innovation could generate the knowledge and entrepreneurship needed 
to catalyse system transitions and their transfer. The implementation 
of policies that incentivise the deployment of low-carbon technologies 
and  practices within specific sectors, such as energy, buildings 
and agriculture, could accelerate greenhouse gas mitigation and 
deployment of climate resilient infrastructure in both urban and rural 
areas. Civic engagement is an important element of building societal 
consensus and reducing barriers to action on adaptation, mitigation 
and sustainable development (very high confidence). {18.4}

Appendix TS.AII: Aggregated Climate Risk 
Assessments in WGII AR6
This supplementary material presents the various aggregated risk 
assessments applied in the WGII AR6. This includes the key risks 
identified by all the chapters and the way they can be clustered into 
Representative Key Risks (RKRs) (Section TS.AII.1), with a summary of 
the severity conditions for these RKRs across climate and development 
pathways, and the interactions among these risks (Section TS.AII.2). 
The assessment of the five Reasons for Concern (RFC), presented in the 
iconic ‘burning embers’, provides a complementary cross-cutting impact 
and risk assessment. This approach is described in Section TS.AII.3, along 
with a comparison with the RKRs (Section TS.AII.4). The burning embers 
for the global and cross-cutting RFCs are complemented by similar 
depictions for specific regional and thematic concerns (Section SMTS2.1).
TS.AII.1	 Key Risks and Representative Key Risks
Regional and sectoral chapters of this report identified 127 key 
risks that could become severe under particular conditions of 
climate hazards, exposure and vulnerability (Table SMTS.4). These 
key risks are assessed to be potentially severe, that is, relevant to the 
interpretation of dangerous anthropogenic interference (DAI) with the 
climate system, along levels for warming, exposure/vulnerability and 
adaptation. Severity has been assessed looking at the magnitude of 
adverse consequences, the likelihood of adverse consequences, the 
temporal characteristics of the risk and the ability to respond to the 
risks. Key risks cover scales from the local to the global, are especially 
prominent in particular regions or systems and are particularly large for 
vulnerable sub-groups, especially low-income populations, and already 
at-risk ecosystems (high confidence). {16.5, Table SM16.4}
These key risks can be represented in eight RKR clusters of 
key risks relating to low-lying coastal systems; terrestrial and 
ocean ecosystems; critical physical infrastructure, networks and 
services; living standards; human health; food security; water 
security; and peace and mobility (high confidence) (Table TS.
AII.1). The assessment of these RKRs, which is presented in detail in 
Chapter 16, has also been used to organise the synthetic assessment 
of adaptation options in Chapter 17 and is integrated across various 
sections in the TS and SPM. {16.5, SM16.2.1, 17.2.1, 17.5.1}
TS.AII.2	 Assessment of Severity Conditions for 
Representative Key Risks
Figure TS.AII.1 presents a synthesis of the severity conditions for RKRs 
by the end of this century. As an illustration of the more specific sets of 
conditions that result in severe risk for a particular RKR, Figure TS.AII.2 
provides examples from individual studies of risks to living standards 
and the conditions under which they could become severe in terms of 
aggregate economic output, poverty and livelihoods.
The assessment of RKRs demonstrates that severe risk is rarely driven 
by a single determinant (warming, exposure/vulnerability, adaptation), 
but rather by a combination of conditions that jointly produce the level 
of pervasiveness of consequences, irreversibility, thresholds, cascading 
effects, likelihood of consequences, temporal characteristics of risk 
and systems’ ability to respond (medium to high confidence). In other 
words, climate risk is not a matter of changing hazards (or climatic 
impact drivers) only but of the confrontation between changing 
hazards and changing socioecological conditions.
For most RKRs, potentially global and systemically pervasive risks 
become severe in the case of high levels of warming, combined with 
high exposure/vulnerability, low adaptation or both (high confidence). 
Under these conditions there would be severe and pervasive risks to 
critical infrastructure (high confidence), to human health from heat-
related mortality, to low-lying coastal areas, aggregate economic 
output and livelihoods (all medium confidence) from armed conflict 
(low confidence) and to various aspects of food security (with different 
114
Technical Summary
TS
levels of confidence). Severe risks interact through cascading effects, 
potentially causing amplification of RKRs over the course of this 
century (low evidence, high agreement). (Figure  TS.AII.1) {16.5.2, 
16.5.4, Figure 16.10}
For some RKRs, potentially global and systemically pervasive risks 
would become severe even with medium to low warming (i.e., 
1.5°C–2°C) if exposure/vulnerability is high and/or adaptation is low 
(medium to high confidence). Under these conditions there would be 
severe and pervasive risks associated with water scarcity and water-
related disasters (high confidence), poverty, involuntary mobility and 
insular ecosystems and biodiversity hotspots (all medium confidence). 
{16.5.2}
All potentially severe risks that apply to particular sectors or groups of 
people at more specific regional and local levels require high exposure/
vulnerability or low adaptation (or both), but they do not necessarily 
require high warming (high confidence). Under these conditions there 
would be severe, specific risks to low-lying coastal systems, to people 
and economies from critical infrastructure disruption, to economic 
output in developing countries and to livelihoods in climate-sensitive 
sectors from water-borne diseases, especially in children in low- and 
middle-income countries, water-related impacts on traditional ways of 
life and involuntary mobility, for example in small islands and low-
lying coastal areas (medium to high confidence). {16.5.2}
Some severe impacts are already occurring (high confidence) and 
will occur in many more systems before mid-century (medium 
confidence). Tropical and polar low-lying coastal human communities 
are experiencing severe impacts today (high confidence), and abrupt 
ecological changes resulting from mass population-level mortality 
are already being observed following climate extreme events. Some 
systems will experience severe risks before the end of the century 
(medium confidence), for example critical infrastructure affected by 
extreme events (medium confidence). Food security for millions of 
people, particularly low-income populations, also faces significant risks 
with moderate to high warming or high vulnerability, with a growing 
challenge by 2050 in terms of providing nutritious and affordable diets 
(high confidence). {16.5.2, 16.5.3}
In specific systems already marked by high exposure and vulnerability, 
intensive adaptation efforts will not be sufficient to prevent severe 
risks from occurring under high levels of warming (low evidence, 
medium agreement). This is particularly the case for some ecosystems 
and water-related risks (from water scarcity and to Indigenous and 
traditional cultures and ways of life). {16.5.2, 16.5.3}
Key risks increase the challenges in achieving global sustainability 
goals (high confidence). The greatest challenges will be from risks 
to water (RKR-G), living standards (RKR-D), coastal socioecological 
systems (RKR-A) and peace and human mobility (RKR-H). The most 
relevant goals are zero hunger (SDG 2), sustainable cities and 
communities (SDG 11), life below water (SDG 14), decent work and 
economic growth (SDG 8), and no poverty (SDG 1). Priority areas 
for regions are indicated by the intersection of hazards, risks and 
challenges, where, in the near term, challenges to SDGs indicate 
probable systemic vulnerabilities and issues in responding to climatic 
hazards (high confidence). {16.6.1}
Multiple feedbacks between individual risks exist that have the 
potential to create cascades and then to amplify systemic risks and 
impacts far beyond the level of individual RKRs (medium confidence), 
as also reflected in TS.C.11. These are illustrated in Figure TS.AII.3, 
panel A at the RKR level, and in Figure TS.AII.3, panel B at the key risk 
level.
TS.AII.3	 Framework and Approach for Assessment of 
Burning Embers for Reasons for Concern
The RFC framework communicates scientific understanding about 
accrual of risk in relation to varying levels of warming for five broad 
categories: risk associated with (a) unique and threatened systems, 
(b) extreme weather events, (c) distribution of impacts, (d) global 
aggregate impacts and (e) large-scale singular events. The RFC 
framework was first developed during the Third Assessment Report 
along with a visual representation of these risks as ‘burning embers’ 
figures, and this assessment framework has been further developed 
and updated in subsequent IPCC reports including AR5. RFCs reflect 
risks aggregated globally that together inform the interpretation 
of dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. 
(Figure TS.AII.1) {16.6.2}
The risk transition or ‘ember’ diagram illustrates the progression 
of socioecological risk from climate change as a function of 
global temperature change, taking into account the exposure and 
vulnerability of people and ecosystems, as assessed by literature-based 
expert judgement. The definitions of risk levels used to make the expert 
judgements are presented in Table TS.AII.2 {16.6.2}. Further details are 
provided in Section 16.6.3. (Figure TS.4)
TS.AII.4	 Relationship between Representative Key Risks 
and Reasons for Concern
The RKRs and RFCs are complementary methods that aggregate 
individual risks in different ways, as displayed in Figure  TS.AII.4. 
They have differences in scale, transitions, timing and treatment of 
vulnerability and adaptation {16.6.2}

Figure TS.AII.1 |  Synthesis of the severity conditions for Representative Key Risks (RKRs) by the end of this century. The figure does not aim to describe severity 
conditions exhaustively for each RKR, but rather to illustrate the risks highlighted in this report (Sections 16.5.2.3.1 to 16.5.2.3.8). Coloured circles represent the levels of warming 
(climate), exposure/vulnerability and adaptation that would lead to severe risks for particular key risks and RKRs. Each set of three circles represents a combination of conditions that 
would lead to severe risk with a particular level of confidence, indicated by the number of black dots to the right of the set, and for a particular scope, indicated by the number of 
stars to the left of the set. The two scopes are ‘broadly applicable’, meaning applicable pervasively and even globally, and ‘specific’, meaning applicable to particular areas, sectors 
or groups of people. Details of confidence levels and scopes can be found in Section 16.5.2.3. In terms of severity condition levels (Section 16.5.2.3), for warming levels (coloured 
circles labelled ‘C’ in the figure), high refers to climate outcomes consistent with RCP8.5 or higher, low refers to climate outcomes consistent with RCP2.6 or lower, and medium 
refers to intermediary climate scenarios. Exposure-vulnerability levels are determined relative to the range of future conditions considered in the literature. For adaptation, high 
refers to near maximum potential and low refers to the continuation of today’s trends. Despite being intertwined in reality, exposure-vulnerability and adaptation conditions are 
distinguished to help understand their respective contributions to risk severity. {Figure 16.10}

* CIDs are physical climate system conditions (e.g., means, events, extremes) that affect an element of society or ecosystems. lndiced changes are system-depend-
ent and can be detrimenlal, beneﬁcial, neutral, or a mixture of each. {WGI AR6 SPM}

Figure  TS.AII.3 |  Illustration of some connections across key risks. Panel A describes all the cross-RKR risk cascades that are described in RKR assessments 
(Sections 16.5.2.3.2 to 16.5.2.3.9). Panel B provides an illustration of such interactions at the key risk level, for example from ecological risk to key dimensions for human societies 
(building on Section 16.5.2.2 and Table 16.A.4). The arrows are representative of interactions as qualitatively identified; they do not result from any quantitative modelling exercise.

Table TS.AII.4 |  Definition of risk levels for reasons for concern. {Table 16.7}
Level
Definition
Undetectable (white)
No associated impacts are detectable and attributable to climate change
Moderate (yellow)
Associated impacts are both detectable and attributable to climate change with at least medium confidence, also accounting for the other specific criteria 
for key risks
High (red)
Severe and widespread impacts that are judged to be high on one or more criteria for assessing key risks
Very high (purple)
Very high risk of severe impacts and the presence of significant irreversibility or the persistence of climate-related hazards, combined with limited ability to 
adapt due to the nature of the hazard or impacts/risks
