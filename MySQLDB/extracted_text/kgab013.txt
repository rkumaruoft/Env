ABSTRACT
Adaptation to climate change, in terms of both academic and policy debates, has been treated predominantly as a local is-
sue. This scalar focus points towards local agency as well as the contested responsibilization of local actors and potential
disconnects with higher-level dynamics. While there are growing calls for individuals to take charge of their own lives
against mounting climatic forces, little is known about the day-to-day actions people take, the many hurdles, barriers, and
limits they encounter in their adaptation choices, and the trade-offs they consider envisaging the future. To address this
gap, this article draws on 80þ interviews with urban and rural residents in Western Australia to offer a nuanced analysis of
everyday climate adaptation and its limits. Our ﬁndings demonstrate that participants are facing signiﬁcant adaptation bar-
riers and that, for many, these barriers already constitute limits to what they can do to protect what they value most. They
also make visible how gender, age, and socioeconomic status shape individual preferences, choices, and impediments, re-
vealing compounding layers of disadvantage and differential vulnerability. We argue that slow and reﬂexive research is
needed to understand what adaptation limits matter and to whom and identify opportunities to harness and support local
action. Only then will we be able to surmount preconceived neoliberal ideals of the self-sufﬁcient, resilient subject, engage
meaningfully with ontological pluralism, and contribute to the re-politicization of adaptation decision-making.
Key words: climate change; values; loss and damage; resilience; inequality; justice.
INTRODUCTION
Adaptation to climate change, both in terms of academic and
policy debates, has been treated predominantly as a local issue.
On the one hand, such a focus, as Nalau et al. [1] have rightly
established, might obscure the shifting of responsibilities from
the state and the global community to local actors, despite real
constraints in terms of delivering compelling adaptation agen-
das. On the other hand, the promise of local agency to ‘change
the world’ can indeed be empowering, even if it fails to
acknowledge some of the politics of scale in adaptation [2]. An
explicit emphasis on everyday adaptation makes it possible to
examine nuances, tensions, barriers and limits at the local level
as well as how they shape and are shaped by possible discon-
nects with higher-level dynamics.
Against the backdrop of the ongoing climate emergency,
with extreme and devastating events such as the 2019/20 Black
Summer in Australia and the 2021 record-breaking floods in
Germany, citizens around the world can no longer ignore the
changing environmental and climatic conditions around them,

in their immediate proximity or brought home via (social) me-
dia. The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change [3] states that global temperatures will likely
reach 1.5C of warming above pre-industrial levels by 2040, with
higher temperature increases in specific land regions and both
slow- and rapid-onset events intensifying across the world [4].
In the Paris Agreement, climate adaptation is enshrined in
Article 7 as a global public goal [5]. The question for millions of
individuals and groups is when and how to act and which adap-
tive strategies to pursue, being increasingly aware of the im-
mensity of the challenge and the seeming futility of personal
sacrifices in their lived locales, even if aggregated.
Earlier scientific efforts drew attention to the limits of social–
ecological systems in adapting to climate change, encapsulated
in the notions of planetary boundaries [6] and safe and just oper-
ating spaces [7]. Preston et al. [8] warned of an ‘adaptation fron-
tier’ in natural and human systems due to the interaction of
climatic and non-climatic forces. Such a system perspective is
also evident in the increasingly popular distinction between ‘soft’
and ‘hard’ adaptation limits, with the former being reached when
options are not available or viable due to technological and socio-
economic constraints and the latter when adaptation is no longer
possible [9]. Beyond the ‘edge of the frontier’, or adaptation limit,
a system risks losing its form and function, leading to two possi-
ble outcomes: transformation or damages and losses [10, 11].
This system perspective has also been prevalent, for at least a
decade, in scientific debates around tipping points (e.g. [12]) and
is enshrined in IPCC reports through the Reasons for Concern
logic. It foresees tipping points or adaptation limits for ecological
systems (e.g. coral reefs), specific sectors (e.g. agriculture), and
entire social–ecological systems in specific world regions, partic-
ularly in the Arctic and Pacific Islands and atoll countries (see,
e.g. [13]). This particular scientific lens foregrounds the likelihood
of future risks in different greenhouse gas concentration scenar-
ios and degrees of warming (e.g. 1.5C, 2C and 4C), indicating
that adaptation will become more challenging, limits more pro-
nounced, and damages and losses more substantial, with every
additional half degree of global temperature rise [14].
Yet, this is not the only scientific approach to understand lim-
its to adaptation. A parallel body of literature has examined the
importance of the everyday as the scale at which individuals
make decisions to address climatic threats and at which con-
straints are encountered. This approach builds on an understand-
ing of adaptation as attempts to keep risks to the things people
value most at a tolerable level in the face of mounting climatic
challenges [15]. Limits emerge as points at which adaptation fails
to protect the things that stakeholders value and cannot imagine
living without, now and in the future [16]. Numerous typologies
for adaptation barriers and limits exist to date (see, e.g. [17–19]).
Besides the common financial, technical, social, ecological, cul-
tural and institutional constraints, these typologies also encom-
pass obstacles along the adaptation process [20] and eroding
‘lived values’ [21, 22] such as loss of sense of community and
identity that are vital to sustain people’s ways of living and well-
being [23]. Barriers and limits are often cumulative and inter-
twined and can trigger compounding and cascading effects; and
they also tend to unfold across scales. Together, these dynamics
complicate
assessments
of
trade-offs
in
people’s
decision-
making and conceal unequal outcomes in societies, with the
same obstacles constituting minor or temporary barriers to some
and devastating, irreversible limits to others [19, 24].
Such a people-centric rather than systems-based under-
standing of adaptation and limits, based on the things individu-
als and communities value and deem worth protecting in their
lives, has resulted in a growing scholarly literature on social
breaking points, for instance due to corroded dignity, and disori-
enting and dehumanizing experiences (e.g. [25, 26]). It has
proven helpful to conceptualize these breaking points or thresh-
olds as intersecting bundles or a ‘web of barriers’ [27] and limits
as insurmountable obstacles that emerge, evolve and accumu-
late on the ground across space and time.
These scholarly advances have gone hand in hand with
insights into loss and damage associated with climate change,
particularly intangible (non-market and non-economic) harms,
including a socially engaged science of loss (e.g. [28–32]). Most
importantly, paying attention to how adaptation unfolds in ev-
eryday spaces provides an entry point to understanding not only
‘where, when, and how barriers and limits to adaptation arise’
but also ‘how and for whom adaptation is constrained and lim-
ited’ to devise context-relevant adaptation efforts and just trade-
offs ([33], pp. 1–2). This remains vital as immediate and long-
term actions to prevent climatic devastation are constrained by
longstanding uneven development trajectories, past and ongoing
governance failures, and systemic marginalization and inequal-
ities, all of which produce differential effects for unevenly posi-
tioned individuals and societies (see also Refs. [34, 35]).
Nonetheless, the focus on everyday adaptation requires
more scrutiny to tease out crucial nuances and put observed
patterns into perspective. The literature often distinguishes ev-
eryday responses to climate change as longer-term adjustments
to gradual changes (adaptation) from short-term responses to
rapid-onset events (coping) (see Ref. [36]). Here, we reconcile
them under the broader adaptation umbrella as both represent
efforts individuals undertake to moderate harm. They have the
potential to (re)shape daily practices and habits and thus lives
and livelihoods in the long run.
For instance, Ferencuhova´ [37] examines ‘inconspicuous ad-
aptation’ to changing climatic and weather conditions in every-
day life in the Czech Republic. Many of these measures are
rather mundane which the author defines in analogy to incon-
spicuous consumption and inconspicuous sustainability, em-
phasizing
the
‘everyday,
routine,
hidden,
habitual
and
unreflexive’ acts of individuals and households ([37], p. 3).
These actions stand in contrast to conscious behavioural or
value changes, often recommended in the scientific literature
and governmental adaptation plans, as well as technological
fixes such as retrofitting a home in response to the climate cri-
sis. Such ordinary and inexpensive measures include grounded
ways of dealing with, for instance, extreme heat: airing bed-
sheets only during early morning and night hours, sleeping on
cool tiles on the floor, keeping one’s feet in a cold-water wash-
tub
while
working,
and
accommodating
daily
schedules.
Although
these
actions
may
seem
trivial,
the
everyday,
Ferencuhova´ [37] argues, is important because it makes visible
the ‘social aspects of daily practices’ (p. 5). Moreover, these prac-
tices often are simultaneously political as they form creative
responses outside of top-down adaptation policies, market sol-
utions and technocratic visions. Such practices may not always
be viable, suitable or even effective, as the author contends, but
they constitute critical elements of the everyday politics of cli-
mate adaptation and glimpses into the willingness of residents
to negotiate or contest possible alternative strategies.
Similar insights have been reported for Australia, including
everyday adaptations to hot and cold spells (e.g. [38, 39]; cited in
Ref. [37]). Lambert and Beilin [2] confirm adaptation as occurring
in the everyday—things people do as part of their ‘taskscape’ or
stewardship obligations to place; yet, the authors also expose
the dangers associated with hyper-localism when efforts local

actors undertake remain nothing else than performative practi-
ces rather than effective connections to other dynamics and
strategic imperatives at higher-level scales. Such an inward-
looking focus acts as an obstacle to adaptation itself as it makes
it exceedingly difficult for actors to ‘connect the dots’ ([2], p. 67).
It also undermines their agency and sense of power to drive
change, and, coupled with an inability to experience occur-
rences across time scales (‘temporal passivity’), diminishes the
potential for creative and transformative processes to be ignited
and to transcend power asymmetries.
While such recent scholarly insights, mainly from the global
North, demonstrate how everyday adaption unfolds within a
complex landscape of values, actions, advantages and disad-
vantages, the constraints and limitations of such everyday
actions remain poorly understood. Insights from a broader set
of literature on environmental politics and sustainability practi-
ces point towards the role of uneven domestic environmental
labour in limiting adaptive capacities and effectiveness, often
unpaid and unrecognized, mainly in high-income countries;
such disproportionate labouring is influenced by gender, class,
and spatial relations and other power dimensions beyond the
boundaries of households [40, 41]. In addition to such intersec-
tionality in everyday adaptation and its limits, little is known
still about trade-offs citizens make in their adaptation choices,
and the burdens associated with them, given today’s experien-
ces with climatic hazards in their daily lives and anticipating an
even worse future reality.
In this article, we aim to address this gap. We draw on 80þ
interviews conducted in Western Australia to examine what ad-
aptation strategies people undertake to protect what they value
from climatic hazards, the action trade-offs they envisage for the
future, and the barriers and limits encountered and anticipated
when implementing these actions. We first examine individual
adaptation actions to safeguard what participants value most, for
the present and the future. We then analyse the costs and side-
effects associated with these actions and investigate how people
navigate opportunities, constraints and limits to adaptation
according to how they are positioned in society (i.e. in relation to
gender, age and socioeconomic status). Our aims are four-fold: to
make visible how barriers and limits emerge within the spaces of
everyday life; to identify which limits matter and for whom; to il-
lustrate the advantages and pitfalls of slow and reflective re-
search on everyday adaptation; and to identify opportunities to
harness and support local action against the ongoing menace of
hyper-localism and the responsibilization of individuals under
the disguise of the neoliberal trope of the resilient citizen.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data collection
This article is part of a four-year project (2018–2022), funded by
the Australian Research Council, that aims to locate loss in ev-
eryday places in Western Australia. Here, we draw on face-to-
face interviews conducted with 83 participants during Year 3 of
the project along a 400 km-long urban–rural transect, across
eight communities with different socio-economic realities,
namely: Attadale, Willagee, Darlington, Kelmscott, Toodyay,
Northam, Merredin and Southern Cross. The participants had
already taken part in previous project activities—surveys, par-
ticipatory mapping, walking journeys and/or workshops on in-
dividual and community values and attachment to place—and
agreed, by email or phone, to also engage in this phase. Table 1
details the demographic composition of our Western Australian
sample,
with
<5%
self-declared
Aboriginal
participants.
Western Australians are already exposed to several climatic
threats (i.e. droughts, heatwaves, flooding, river erosion and
sea-level rise) that are expected to intensify in the future for
middle-of-the-road (RCP4.5) and worst-case (RCP8.5) scenarios
[42]. According to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, maxi-
mum and minimum temperatures will continue to rise, with
the number of hot days (>35C) and very hot days (>40C)
expected to double, or nearly double for every location between
2030 and 2090 considering a business-as-usual scenario. At the
same time, annual rainfall and winter rainfall will continue to
decline, with the extent of future drying also determined by fu-
ture greenhouse gas emissions.
The interviews were based on an innovative methodology
(see Ref. [28]) to elicit individual experiences and thoughts on
present
and
future
climate
change
and
decision-making
choices. Each interview involved two researchers: one inter-
viewer and one note-taker who recorded detailed participant
accounts and took pictures to capture the four stages of the
interview process undertaken on a large white board. We pro-
vided participants with 25 value cards representing place-
based value aspects, with 11 site-specific values identified by
participants in previous project activities (Years 1 and 2) and
complemented by 14 values commonly cited in the literature
(Table 2; [29]).
Using the board (Fig. 1), we asked participants to distribute
the 25 cards according to both their importance (horizontally)
and the perceived impact of climatic threats on them (verti-
cally). Once all cards had been positioned, we asked which

adaptive actions participants were already undertaking to pro-
tect their many values against climatic threats specific to the re-
gion. We invited participants to focus first on those in the
upper-right of the board (most valued and highly impacted) and
then explain other actions elsewhere on the board, if important
to them. We then asked them to consider how the positions of
their value cards might change in the future (from 2030 on-
wards), under more severe climatic scenarios, and which
actions they could foresee pursuing, given their stage in life at
that point.
Data analysis
Our data analysis focused on the 14 value-cards that were com-
mon across our eight study communities (Table 2). This allowed
us to compare adaptation choices and limits across the sample
size and draw linkages for coordinated action across communi-
ties. This deliberate focus on common values here comes at the
slight expense of some highly valued community-specific objec-
tives, and their adaptive actions, such as unique ecosystems—
for example ‘Swan River ecosystem health’ (Attadale and
Willagee); ‘Living in the Hills’ (Darlington); ‘Canning River and
ecosystem’ (Kelmscott); ‘Enjoying and producing from my own
garden’ (Toodyay); ‘Health of the Avon River’ (Northam) and
‘Farms and farming’ (Merredin and Southern Cross). While they
merit their own detailed investigation elsewhere, we note that,
in this analysis, these values often overlapped with common
value-cards (e.g. ‘Plants and animals around me’ and ‘Enjoying
protected areas and green spaces’).
The analysis was conducted in three steps. First, all data
collected were entered in Excel. We recorded the position of
the value cards on the board with different letters correspond-
ing to different quadrants to tabulate the values participants
considered
most/less
important
and
affected
by
climatic
threats. We then recorded actions related to all values as bina-
ries (1/0) to identify which values participants actively tried to
protect, both in the present and future. This allowed for a pre-
liminary understanding of individual priorities and potential
adaptation gaps.
We then used the qualitative software NVivo to analyse
our participants’ descriptions of the actions taken or foreseen
for the future, together with their diverse costs. The latter in-
volved not just costs in financial terms but also other costs
such as time spent and negative side effects such as mental
or emotional distress. Responses were coded according to 15
different actions, described in Table 3 and the ‘Adaptive ac-
tion’ section, and 10 different costs presented in detail in the
‘Costs
and
limits’
section.
Such
nuanced
examination
allowed us to illustrate the options available to our partici-
pants in their everyday spaces. Equally important was to
tease out which of these actions came with the highest costs
to identify potential barriers and limits to adaptation and
areas where external support might be needed, within and
beyond
the
capacities
and
resources
available
to
communities.
Finally, we examined how actions and costs are distributed
along gender, age and socio-economic status to shed light on
how barriers and limits may emerge along multiple axes of in-
equality. Our aim was also to make visible the opportunities
and constraints experienced by unevenly positioned groups
within society and discuss their implications for fair and just
climate adaptation.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Our findings show that participants see climate-related hazards
predominantly threaten their surrounding ecosystems (the plants
and animals around them and protected areas, including green
spaces, parks and natural reserves), their mental, emotional and
physical health, their sense of community and their families (Fig. 2).
To counteract or minimize these present impacts and future risks,
they take several actions that protect many of the things they cher-
ish within their everyday lives and communities (Table 3).
Given the prominent position of plants and animals, mental
and emotional health, physical health and sense of community
in the upper-right quadrant of our board (i.e. highly valued and
highly impacted), it is not surprising that most participants fo-
cus on these values in their adaptive efforts, both now and in
the future (Fig. 2). Many, however, see their current actions as
insufficient, particularly in relation to their efforts to protect
natural environments, as relayed by one participant: ‘[My actions
to protect plants and animals] might make a little bit of difference but,
overall, this is not enough’ (K14). Such perceived insufficiency is
often identified with and compounded by failures at higher lev-
els of governance as well as the uneven distribution of resour-
ces among communities, as captured in the following quote:
‘The Shire is not doing enough. There are inequalities between Toodyay
and Perth; support is not coming’ (T5).
Interestingly, our participants’ actions do not always
correspond to the importance and level of risk they ascribe
to a given value. This is evident, for example, in the case of
protected areas such as parks and state forests that, albeit
often described as highly valued and affected by climatic
hazards, received less attention in everyday adaptation
efforts. This suggests that individual action is perhaps
more closely aligned with perceived individual spheres of
influence—that is, an actor’s ability to do something within
their means and direct control and to make a difference—as
well as everyday adaptation costs and side effects, priori-
ties, and trade-offs. We explore these aspects in detail
below.
Adaptive action
Participants are strongly invested in protecting plants and ani-
mals within their properties and neighbourhoods, with most
(80.7%) already taking on new responsibilities to care for their
natural surroundings (Fig. 2). This involves helping plants and
animals cope with extreme conditions, particularly heat above
35C or 40C, and drought. Several describe how they are be-
coming more attentive to the needs of both animals and native
species, often reflected in the act of making water available for
them (32.5%):

I rescue animals, walk my dogs at different times, put water out for birds,
soak the trees so birds can have a cool place, hold water fountain for
birds. I have seen crows sticking their beaks in the ground for moisture
and to keep cool. (K12)
We give water to the animals and provide bird baths twice a day. (T17)
Others water their gardens more copiously and frequently
(13.3%), spend more time nourishing green areas (26.5%) and are
replacing existing vegetation with natives and water-resistant
plants (21.7%).
Efforts to protect plants and animals to warming and drying
conditions are seldom practiced in isolation and many partici-
pants undertake both actions simultaneously:
I am proactive in the parkland and have native, bird-friendly, wa-
ter-smart plants in my garden. I do see a fair amount of birds and
put water out for them. I am also watering the lawn more although
that is more of a subconscious action. (K2)
I put out water for the bees and fruit for the bobtails but refrain from
feeding the kangaroos. I’ve tried making my garden safe and attractive,
don’t use poison and keep fallen wood in place. I own a cat which I keep
inside to protect native animals. (T16)
Concerted action is also taken to protect one’s mental and
emotional health, by more than half of all participants (61.4%).
While some seek counselling, meditate or turn to spirituality
(16%), others nurture connections with family and friends and
find some respite by voicing their concerns over climate-related
issues (11%). Others still focus on improving their physical
health (12%), with several insisting that mental and physical
health cannot be disassociated.
Yet, it is important to highlight that people’s efforts to
maintain their mental and emotional health are not limited to
ensuring their psychological well-being. In fact, most partici-
pants experiment with strategies to remain mentally and emo-
tional healthy in the face of real and potentially intensifying
climate challenges through actions directed at other valued
objectives (Fig. 3). These include, for example, actions to defend
plants and animals (such as those described above) as well as
visiting protected areas to guarantee they are cared for, donat-
ing and supporting environmental groups and actions, and
adopting more sustainable measures to curtail emissions and
global warming:
We are doing our bit, using the right recycling bin, having solar panels, col-
lecting water, donating, supporting groups. We also try not to have the air-
con on all the time and conserving things. We talk about it during family
dinners, but we are not watching the news every night because we are
aware that kids are vulnerable (but they get them anyway). We have also
donated to the bushfire appeal. This is connected to our mental and emo-
tional health. (A3)
Figure 3 depicts how a single action can have positive ripple
effects and simultaneously protect several valued aspects at
once. In other words, an adaptive strategy should not be com-
partmentalized into just one effort, with one single purpose. For
example, engagement with family, friends and neighbours
allows residents to not only invest in their sense of community
(which is something highly valued across all eight study areas)
but also strengthen their mental and emotional health, assert
their agency, and shield others (both human and non-human)
from the adverse effects of a changing climate, as captured in
the following quotes:
Community engagement helps me dealing with anxiety. . . Talking/con-
versations help me to sustain my identity, dignity, and agency. (A17)
I established the community garden. It is about meeting people in the
community and educating people about the environment. (K16)
I try to know people and make sure they are ok. We must keep an eye on
each other. I also make sure my neighbours’ dogs have water and watch
their plants. (A12)
Costs and limits
For a small number of participants, adaptive efforts have no fi-
nancial or other costs. Yet, for many others, they come at a
price. The relationship between present actions and costs is
depicted in Fig. 4. Unsurprisingly, several initiatives are associ-
ated with high financial burdens. For example, increasing water
usage to protect the garden leads to higher monthly expenses:
‘I’m watering my plants and vegetables more. It costs money’ (W14).
Efforts to engage with family and community also come with
predictable costs: ‘We are becoming more engaged in community
projects. It takes time and energy’ (D18).
More interestingly and less well understood are additional
layers of side effects. For instance, attending to cherished yet
deteriorating places, sometimes to no avail, can also be distress-
ing and met with disbelief and ridicule from other community
members:
I strategically water the plants, provide water for animals, plant to pro-
vide future shade protection. This takes time and causes emotional stress;
it breaks my heart. (T5)
I can’t do a lot, but I take injured animals to the vet and I water my plants
with cold water that is not used while I wait for the water to heat up in
the shower. I am ridiculed for my water management. [It is] sheer nasti-
ness. (N6)
The same is true for sharing climate concerns with friends
and family to safeguard mental and emotional health, which
can sometimes lead to a slippery downward trajectory:
By talking about it, I feel temporarily better. I feel angry and depressed
about government inaction, and the community feels similarly. It can
make you unpopular. People think you are trying to be better than every-
one else. You become a bore. The costs are push back from family, ten-
sion, nagging, not being heard, being mocked, feeling angry, depressed.
(W13)
Equally noteworthy is the mental toll associated with
actions to maintain one’s physical health, which often involves
avoiding the outdoors during extremely hot days:
My mental health has been impacted more than my physical health. If it
gets a bit hot, you can still exercise the same way. But being inside with
the aircon on makes me feel like I am back in the office, it affects my men-
tal health. (A1)
Similarly, adopting sustainable measures can also be a
source of stress fuelled by one’s awareness of environmental
challenges, anxiety about making the ‘right choice’, and frustra-
tion over others’ resistance to adopt more environmentally con-
scious lifestyles:
We installed solar panels; we did that for the environment. We upgraded
the stove for one of wood combustion, which is sufficient to warm the
house. We have changed what we grow in the garden (e.g., succulents).
Solar panels might not be so good as you think (their manufacturing isn’t
very green). You think you are making the right decision, but it might not
be the right one. (D13)

I practice self-sufficiency. I grow my own food, I go to op shops, I recycle,
and I try to get better informed. It is all consuming, overwhelming. How
can I scream it out to others? (W12)
Without any doubt, many individual adaptive actions come
with equal costs, several actions are considered insufficient
(Fig. 2), and some harbour new challenges and undesirable fu-
ture consequences (Fig. 5). Nevertheless, participants conveyed
that they would expand several current strategies to preserve
the many things they value in the face of further harm (Fig. 2).
Besides anticipated financial costs, additional mental and
emotional strain, and time commitments, many described how
their ability to act in the future would also be conditioned by
regulations (e.g. providing water for plants and animals will be
contingent on government-imposed limits on water usage).
This signals the importance of coordinated state action to en-
hance residents’ capacities to protect what matters most to
them. Still, some can imagine a future where they will not be
able to protect what they care about in place and already con-
template the possibility of relocating. As conveyed by one par-
ticipant: ‘Things will be much harder. I will most likely move and will
be sad to leave the area’ (M5).

The costs identified for the different actions point to certain
barriers and potential limits to adaptation, now and in the fu-
ture. This is in line with existing literature on adaptation con-
straints. If an action becomes too costly or comes at the
expense of something else, individuals might drop it and focus
their limited resources to protect another value they consider
equally or more important. In the next section, we discuss how
these barriers and barriers-turned-limits materialize differently
for key population groups.
Navigating climate adaptation across difference
Our analysis reveals that different adaptation choices and meth-
ods are undeniably linked to gender, age and socio-economic sta-
tus, signalling not only a diversity of preferences but also the
range of options available (or not) across difference (Fig. 6).
For example, while the men in our sample were more likely
to
exercise
and
ensure
bodily
safety
(63%),
our
female
participants appear to more frequently attend to their psycho-
logical health (23.4%), implement sustainable measures (51.1%),
tend to plants (53.2%) and animals (59.6%), and engage with
family and neighbours (70.2%) (Fig. 6). In fact, women’s commit-
ment to nurturing their sense of community stands in rather
stark contrast to that of their male counterparts (48.2%).
Interestingly, sometimes the women we talked to drew on their
professions and past work experiences to engage with those
around them:
I provide a space and service to the community to alleviate their cli-
mate stress through massages. I am encountering loss and grief in
the community due to local climatic changes as well as global climate
change commentary. . . I am a sounding block for the community. (D2)
We try to get people locally to be aware of the neighbours. We are also
members of clubs like Save Toodyay. I was previously a nurse with a
wide area to cover and therefore got to know the community better. (T17)

These and other actions, however, often engender mental
and emotional distress and demand time, both costs dispropor-
tionately borne by women in our study (38.3% and 40.4%, re-
spectively). As a result, many are acutely aware of the need to
negotiate priorities and consider difficult present and future
trade-offs:
You need to spread the load; you need to be smart about it. If you take on
too many issues, you lose your family. (D13)
I will have my degree and then can influence community projects at a
higher level, through realistic awareness raising, not radical unrealis-
tic solutions. I will have less time for family. Family will become less
important than local involvement. (W12)
I will focus more on my family, on providing for them. I will do-
nate less. (A17)
With respect to age, such difficult trade-offs are also already
a reality for our older participants for whom adaptation is in-
creasingly delineated by their own physical limitations. Such
inability to act, in turn, might trigger cascading effects, as evi-
denced in this account from an older participant in a low-
income community: ‘I closed my fishpond because of my health. I
miss my fish and the sound of water’ (W1).
Moreover, both younger (55 years of age) and older (>55) resi-
dents described similar adaptive actions, with the younger group
slightly more involved in engaging with community (Fig. 6). The dif-
ferential costs they face in relation to these actions, however, are
noteworthy. For younger community members, adaptation takes
time (58.6%) and energy (20.7%) and leads to significant mental and
emotional strain (44.8%). At the same time, older men and women
relayed how climate action adversely affected their relationship
with family and community (24%). Even so, older citizens do not
shy away from potentially divisive actions, such as being politically
engaged through lobbying and participating in local councils, which
many take on amid dwindling work and family commitments.
Socioeconomic gradients of privilege and disadvantage are
also at play. Nuanced accounts of people’s efforts and associ-
ated costs shed light on differential power and ability to adapt

within individual decision-making spaces and across communi-
ties. For instance, being prepared (26.4%) and exercising and en-
suring bodily safety (56.6%) are actions more often undertaken
by higher socioeconomic groups. Although participants across
all demographics described how these and other actions were
associated with monetary costs, these are likely to be more sig-
nificant for lower-income residents whose decisions are con-
strained by several other, intersecting forces, as described by
one destitute white Australian:
I am working on my physical and mental health. I am changing my
diet. . . trying to be healthier, looking to go back to work and study.
Changing my diet will cost more in financial and mental terms (men-
tal cost of picking the right foods at the store). I will spend more
money to drive to places and do things (e.g., membership of the pool).
I have changed bedrooms to stay away from the sun and the ceiling is
starting to come down and that will cost money. I will also spend
money when I go back to study. (M5)
Nonetheless, as the results in Fig. 6 suggest, participants
with lower socioeconomic status do undertake actions fre-
quently associated with financial costs (e.g. using more water to
protect plants and animals around them), just as the rest of the
sample, and caring for plants and animals which also takes
time. For some, this may come at the expense of other income-
earning
activities
while
others
are
not
or
only
partially
employed. Yet, less affluent citizens still take action because it
is imperative to them, as a personification of life itself:
There was a financial impact. . . when I moved from full to part-time em-
ployment to build community power and maintain my health. . . Building
collective power has a positive impact on things [I value], but it has a time
cost. I hear from people ‘You choose to do this.’ I don’t choose to do it. I
choose to live. (K12)
Attention to how people navigate adaptation in their every-
day lives and across difference not only conveys often con-
cealed layers of vulnerability and disadvantage but also entry
points for building or reinforcing communal action. A close
reading of the many actions the three core demographic groups
adopt or refrain from reveals opportunities for webs or bundles
of actions that build upon potentially synergistic interests and
capacities that might amount to broader trajectories of change
at the local level. Yet, care is needed when developing these
bundles to avoid reproducing, exacerbating or creating new
forms of disadvantage that trap particular groups and commu-
nities within a downward maladaptation spiral.
Discussion
Close attention to the effects of climate change in everyday
spaces reveals a complex adaptation landscape as well as a
multifaceted ‘taskscape’. Individual lived values, risks, actions
and costs interact with socioeconomic dis/advantage to produce
everyday adaptation opportunities and barriers. They also cre-
ate limits beyond which people may well be unable to sustain
desirable lives and livelihoods, as defined by local communities
themselves. A better understanding of constraints in everyday
adaptation is paramount for the co-production of top-down and
bottom-up adaptation pathways and planning processes that
take seriously the rhetoric on just and equitable adaptation.
Our findings demonstrate that, in Western Australian—a re-
gion purposefully chosen over arguably more iconic climate
change hotspots such as Pacific atolls or the Arctic—urban and
rural residents too are already facing numerous challenges and
obstacles that impinge on what they can do to protect the many
things they value and simultaneously equip themselves with
practical tools for the unfolding climate crisis. These blockages
and hurdles mirror the shrinking action spaces people consider
available to them as well as negative side effects tied to chosen
adaptive strategies, both of which compel residents to make dif-
ficult choices, today and into the future.
Such difficult choices and trade-offs are consistent with
insights about making sacrifices and ‘giving things up’, as
revealed through adaptation practitioners on Australia’s East
Coast, suggesting that ‘no-regret’, ‘win-win’ or ‘pain-free’ adap-
tive actions are a myth [44]. Sacrifices, then, become unavoid-
able as not everything can be saved; this is because individuals
will set priorities between protecting a specific object or objec-
tive that seems more urgent in the present while accepting to
let go off another valued aspect of their lives, or because this
valued aspect becomes more important to them over time, in a
progressively worse climatic reality, or both. Understanding the
nuances of everyday adaptation, and the associated sacrifices
and struggles, allows us to question the seemingly clinical dis-
tinction between ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ limits as a rather incongruous
divide considering that lines between what is desirable, feasible
and endurable can shift quickly.
A slow and reflective research approach as the one used
here over three years of sustained engagement with participant
communities, taking seriously values and attachment to place,
brings to the fore both current and anticipated future impacts
and risks, and a suite of actions that citizens employ or are un-
able to mobilize. This approach has two key advantages. First, it
helps participants overcome the potential trap of succumbing
to what Lambert and Beilin [2] describe as ‘temporal passivity’,
the ‘disconnection between future or past events’ that tend to
trick people into believing ‘that things will just go on’ following
familiar, incremental and manageable patterns of change (p.
66). Our innovative approach with the whiteboard, the move-
able magnets, and the coloured sticky notes also makes it visu-
ally and viscerally tangible that both risks and values are likely
to shift when stepping into approaching futures.
Second, and contrary to methods that frame adaptation lim-
its predominantly as a future inevitability, our approach reveals
that, for many people, limits are already a reality. Many partici-
pants, out of the sample of 83, relay their inability to sustain
actions they perceive as necessary, often because they come at
the expense of something else—above all, their families—or be-
cause of unsurmountable costs. Some of the limits identified
here might not lead to the immediate or direct decimation of a
given value—for example if residents stop putting water out for
cockatoos and quendas, it does not mean that these species will
automatically become extinct. Yet, everyday limits to adapta-
tion undoubtedly affect people’s sense of purpose and control
over the things that matter to them, and consequently their
well-being (see Ref. [28]). As such, becoming more aware of
these obstacles creates temporary spaces in which residents ex-
perience how otherwise empowering notions that come with
values-based adaptation clash with the limits of their own
agency. Many of our participants become cognizant of this di-
lemma yet continue in their quest, as found elsewhere, holding
on to the importance of ‘at least doing something’ [44] and ‘just
daily routines’ that may not even be consciously linked to cli-
mate change [37].
Moreover, our findings make clear that adaptation barriers
and limits are not the same for everyone, even in a seemingly
homogeneous population of predominantly white Australians.
Adaptation brings differential side effects that become limits at
different stages for unequally positioned actors. For some of our

participants, these limits are already manifesting. For instance,
older residents are pressed to give up physically demanding ac-
tivities that bring them joy (e.g. taking care of their gardens),
and socio-economically disadvantaged denizens face multifari-
ous obstacles that prevent them from making healthier life
choices. At the same time, other participants who are better off
seem to accept adaptation limits only as a future possibility, if
at all. Besides age and class differences, it is the evidence re-
garding gendered patterns of doing environmental and social
labour, and the dissolving lines between the two of them, that is
most noteworthy. As Westman and Casta´n Broto [45], drawing
upon MacGregor [41], remind us, the psychological and affective
toll of simultaneously caring for human and non-human beings
and family around them is often distinctly higher on women
than on men. The fact that such emotional labour is both insuf-
ficiently recognized and, at times, also ridiculed unnecessarily
curtails crucial everyday adaptive actions. Both younger and
older women in our sample disclosed their struggles and anxi-
eties around navigating this persistent hindrance. More worri-
some still, this impasse may stifle transformative actions
needed
beyond
the
scale
of
households
and
close-knit
communities.
Although Aboriginal Australians have remained underrepre-
sented in our study, we underscore the additional dispropor-
tionate
burdens
born
by
Indigenous
individuals
and
communities due to legacies of colonialism, oppression and dis-
enfranchisement (e.g. [46]), with ramifications for their daily
experiences with climate change, adaptation options, limits
and blockages.
We want to offer two broader reflections regarding everyday
adaptation and the associated limits. First, taking us back to the
beginning of the article, an explicit focus on the everyday does
carry the risk of reinforcing what Nalau et al. [44] have exposed
as a dangerous heuristic, namely that adaptation is predomi-
nantly a local issue. While it is vital to recognize that citizens
are taking actions within their own spheres of influence, the
snare of ‘hyper-localism’ [2] is undeniable. Very few of our par-
ticipants were able to draw linkages between their individual
actions and adaptation initiatives undertaken by the Shire or
the State, or non-governmental organizations and lobbying
groups in their areas. Without spaces that allow individual resi-
dents to explore these differential obstacles and incorporate
them in locally grounded, desirable adaptation pathways, the
consequence would be that crucial opportunities for multi-
stakeholder expertise and transboundary thinking [44] are
missed. This, in turn, would further segregate local practices
while undermining the potential for creative, transformative
actions across scales of mattering [2].
Second, everyday adaptation inevitably foregrounds every-
day actors, what they value in their lives and the activities they
undertake to preserve what they cherish most. Such a focus, ad-
mittedly, feeds directly into the neoliberal logic of the resilient
subject. Much has been written to critique neoliberal discourse
and policy frameworks that bolster the imaginary of the resilient,
responsible, self-sufficient, competitive and entrepreneurial citi-
zen, able to continuously reinvent herself in the face of environ-
mental crises, disruptions and surprises [47–53]. Yet, resilience,
as a concept and domain of interest to both scholars and policy
makers, is enjoying unprecedented popularity. As Nalau and
Verrall [54] illustrate, resilience is now the top-ranked keyword
in literature on climate change adaptation, with related and
newly emergent critical concepts trailing far behind, including
climate justice and equity, limits to adaptation, loss and damage,
and adaptation pathways.
The peril of this trend is—and we agree here with Lambert
and Beilin [2]—that the unjust and perverse imperative of the
neoliberal resilience discourse becomes further amplified, co-
ercing individuals to be liable for their own welfare while
higher-level adaptive governance is aborted, even if they find
themselves trapped in performative tasks rather than driving
transformative dynamics. The growing popularity of the ‘neo-
liberal resilient subject’ makes it distinctly more difficult to
translate existing alternatives such as resourcefulness [53], situ-
ated resilience [55] or deliberated resilience [56] into everyday
adaptation. As Eriksen et al. [57] argue, the real danger is not
only that such apolitical ideals and practices of resilience, also
in the everyday, are ill suited to overcome structural vulnerabil-
ities. They also fail to provide the urgently needed space for
courageous and concerned citizens to reclaim their right to con-
test the crises they face, negotiate priorities and trade-offs, best
across scale, and take part in designing socially just visions for
their own and their children’s futures. Within this dominant
logic, particularly if not actively countered, limits to everyday
adaptation risk becoming the proverbial straw that broke the
neck of the most vulnerable. Breaking free from these discursive
and material shackles requires that adaptation scholars and
practitioners actively oppose entrenched vulnerabilities, by
supporting people’s priorities and abilities to enact change [58].
CONCLUSION
What then is the way forward for everyday adaptation in the cli-
mate crisis? We underscore the significance of everyday actions
citizens undertake to protect what they value most and navi-
gate their spheres of influence to overcome the slippery slope
towards social breaking points. Making visible these actions,
with the struggles and limits wrapped up in them, is vital, not
only because the Paris Agreement and its global stocktake re-
quire nations to assess and document progress on climate ad-
aptation. It is also urgently needed to populate otherwise often
disconnected higher-level adaptation plans and provide the
needed substance of what can, should and should not happen
when envisioning, co-designing and implementing trajectories
for just and resilient communities.
Moreover, on a more practical level, for our research, having
brought to the fore individual actions, struggles and impedi-
ments, across demographic groups, we feel well positioned to
contribute to building just resilience in place by tackling the
next and final stage of our four-year-long project with residents
in Western Australia. It will aim to design normative adaptation
pathways, backcasting from the future our participants have
laid out as desirable and dignified, despite barriers, loss and
grief along the way, and with location-specific climate scenar-
ios, mitigation options and community resilience skills super-
imposed
on
them.
This
entails
drawing
on
women’s
community involvement and care for the environment, the eld-
erly’s political engagement, and awareness raising advanced by
the youth. This is not to say that these groups should bear the
brunt of adaptation choices but rather to highlight how their re-
markable commitment can provide lessons for activities across
the eight communities and inspire others. To surmount the
menace of hyper-localism, we intend to tap into regional stake-

Everyday limits to adaptation

In order for this and other efforts on locally driven and just
adaptation to succeed, we offer one final insight. We are acutely
aware that, even though explicit attention to everyday adapta-
tion and limits exposes the micro-nuances of differential vul-
nerabilities and capacities, it cannot address their causes.
Numerous social, economic, cultural and political forces are at
play that prevent individuals and groups from escaping struc-
tural inequalities. Following Eriksen and colleagues [57], we ar-
gue that we need to remain vigilant to avoid reproducing
uneven power structures in our academic-activist work by exac-
erbating, even unconsciously, the very inequalities that we ob-
serve. Rather than chasing the archetypical resilient citizen and
buying into the responsibility of the weakest, our endeavours
are most meaningful and effective when they re-politicize adap-
tation and ensure abundant space for ontological pluralism—
that is a diversity of ways of understanding and being in the
world [57, 59]—when they facilitate diverse stewardship and
ownership, and when they comprehend social and environ-
mental well-being as one and the same.
