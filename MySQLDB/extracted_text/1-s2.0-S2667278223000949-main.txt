Climate literacy assesses general understanding of climate, climate change, and its effects on the environ-
ment as well as human health. Despite vast scientiﬁc evidence to support climate change and its associated
consequences, particularly with regards to vector-borne diseases, climate change knowledge, attitudes, and
behaviors among the general population is relatively poor. In this study, we conducted a thorough review of
the current literature to evaluate the scope of global climate and health literacy studies and identify key areas
for improvement. We found that very few climate and health literacy studies were based in low- and middle-
income countries, and those that were did not make mention of signiﬁcant regional climate change impacts
and speciﬁcally those that increase mosquito-borne disease transmission in high-risk areas. We also noted
that of the twenty-three studies included in our ﬁnal review, most focused their assessments on general cli-
mate and climate change knowledge, and not on literacy of the relationships between climate change and
environmental impacts or subsequent health outcomes. Our ﬁndings make it clear that moving forward,
there is a major need for climate and health literacy research to expand upon existing climate literature to
include additional assessments of the relationships between certain climate change impacts and infectious
diseases in particular, as well as to make available a more comprehensive overview of climate and health
information to the public in the future.

Introduction1
Climate literacy, in the simplest of terms, can be deﬁned as
“an understanding of human impacts on climate and the impacts
of climate on human systems” [1]. Despite long-standing evidence
among the scientiﬁc community that climate change is a real
phenomenon with lasting human-, animal- and environmental
health effects, skepticism surrounding climate change and climate
change impacts still exist in many countries around the world
[2]. Moreover, prior research has shown that most people among
the general population do not know much about climate change
principles, if at all [2−4]. In 2006, 85 % of Americans polled
believed that climate change was probably occurring, although
less than four out of ten were truly certain about it [5]. Prior
studies have also found that there is extensive ignorance within
the general population surrounding the causes and impacts of cli-
mate change, as well as the degree of consensus among the scien-
tiﬁc community concerning these issues [4,5]. One such study
conducted among American teens and adults revealed that over
half of American teens and 46 % of American adults have limited
and often inadequate knowledge and understanding of climate
change and its consequences [3]. These observations appear to be
reﬂected in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) as well. In
Africa in particular, country-wide climate literacy rates range
from as high as 62 % (Uganda) to 66 % (Mauritius) but are also as
low as 23 % (Tunisia) to 25 % (Mozambique) [6]. Across 394 sub-
national administrative units in Africa, thirty-seven had climate
literacy rates lower than 20 %, and only eight had climate literacy

rates over 80 % [6]. It is clear that climate education across the
world is insufﬁcient, and more needs to be done to increase these
numbers.
One major consequence of climate change is the increased spread
of mosquitoes and arboviral illnesses. Increases in global tempera-
tures threaten to expand the range of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the
primary vector of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses [7]. Precipi-
tation patterns are also likely to increase vector-borne disease (VBD)
transmission −increased rainfall is likely to create more abundant
vector breeding sites, while droughts are also predicted to provide
more suitable breeding sites due to increased rainwater collection
and storage [7]. Additionally, VBD transmission is incredibly complex,
and can be inﬂuenced by a variety of other factors as well, including
international travel, rapid urbanization, and socioeconomic factors
such as poor waste disposal [8]. VBDs create a large impact on global
disease burden [9], causing hundreds of millions of cases and over
700,000 deaths annually [10,11]. The effect of these diseases is felt
most strongly across tropical and subtropical regions, and often
poorer communities are overwhelmingly affected [7,11]. Dengue of
any serotype (I-IV) are some of the most prominent mosquito-borne
illnesses in the world, and accounts for up to 390 million infections
annually [7,12]. Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), a serious complica-
tion of dengue, manifests with additional symptoms such as abdomi-
nal pain and internal bleeding and is a leading cause of mortality in
children [12]. In the Americas, dengue is highly endemic, where
nearly 500 million people are currently at risk for dengue and dengue
incidence has dramatically increased over the last four decades [13].
Over three million cases of dengue were reported in the Americas in
2019, the highest annual number recorded [13]. Despite the preva-
lence of arboviral diseases in over 100 countries, previous research
has shown that VBD knowledge is limited, often among high-risk
communities [14]. Mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue, espe-
cially across the Americas, are known as neglected diseases because
they are largely and inaccurately perceived as low-risk and thus not
enough information is provided to communities to adequately pro-
tect themselves [14].
Additionally, research on climate and climate change literacy
seems to focus mainly on high-income countries (HICs), such as the
United States. To date, literature on climate or health literacy within
LMICs is sparse, especially with regards to assessing climate change
impacts on vulnerable communities. The Caribbean and South Amer-
ica in particular are highly susceptible to changing climate patterns
and extreme weather events [15], making them a major area of inter-
est moving forward. The purposes of this scoping review are to evalu-
ate the availability of current literature related to climate and health
literacy in countries of all income levels as well as to identify major
gaps in climate and health literacy among the general population.
Another major goal for completing this scoping review is to inform
the creation of a future comprehensive literacy scale to assess knowl-
edge, attitudes, and behaviors towards climate change and its
adverse health impacts, particularly with regards to mosquito-borne
diseases. This effort is essential for determining the level of current
knowledge and beliefs related to climate change and climate change
impacts among vulnerable populations, and for evaluating the need
for future community-based interventions to improve mosquito con-
trol in high-risk areas.
Material and methods
We followed PRISMA guidelines for scoping reviews to conduct
our literature search [16]. We searched two major open-access data-
bases, PubMed and Scopus (ScienceDirect) for articles relating to cli-
mate change or vector-borne disease literacy. We also scoped
ProQuest for articles but did not use it in our ﬁnal review because the
number of articles returned from our initial search was too large
(>600,000), even with limiting parameters. Other databases consid-
ered but not ultimately used to collect articles included GreenFile
and Global Health through EBSCOhost. A quick search of these
smaller databases using our search terms revealed that none of the
articles captured were relevant to our review and thus were not fur-
ther utilized. The timeline of interest for our article search spanned
from January 2012 to December 2022 to capture the most recent
articles to our subjects of interest. Search parameters set for each
database are outlined in Table 1. We used two separate search state-
ments to collect articles, the ﬁrst speciﬁc only to climate and climate
change literacy, the second speciﬁc to mosquito-borne disease liter-
acy, to capture articles that covered both ﬁelds as well as any overlap
between the two. We used terms and phrases for our statements that
were commonly found in other articles to assess climate or VBD liter-
acy to ensure that we could capture articles relevant to our search.
Statements were kept separate as a cursory search using only one
statement yielded much fewer papers for review. The search state-
ments used to query both PubMed and Scopus can be found in
Table 2. Using both search statements, we collected a total of 3,347
articles for title/abstract review. Forty-seven articles were removed
after title/abstract review as duplicates. A further 3,249 articles were
excluded from full text review based on the following criteria: no
relation to climate or vector-borne disease literacy, no mention of
any climate or vector-borne disease literacy topics, mentions of vec-
tors other than mosquitoes, being a non-scientiﬁc article or a pre-
print, having no available abstract, not being within the speciﬁed
timeline, or not being available in English.
Fifty-one articles were selected for full text review. An additional
article was chosen for full text review after being referenced regard-
ing vector-borne disease literacy in another selected article, with 52
being the ﬁnal number of articles evaluated during full text review.
Another 29 articles were excluded after full text review. Reasons for
excluded articles, as well as a detailed diagram of our review process,
can be found in Fig. 1. This left a total of 23 articles for our ﬁnal scop-
ing review. Two of the articles selected after full text review were in
English but only had questionnaires available in Spanish, which were
translated to English by a member of our research team and then
included. We then completed an annotated bibliography of these

Results
Limited knowledge of climate and VBD literacy in LMICs and focus on
niche populations
Our scoping review revealed that there are very few articles that
focus on climate and health literacy across the world, and that several
are restricted to high- or middle-income countries such as the United
States, European Member States and China. Many of the studies con-
ducted in HICs speciﬁcally focused on climate literacy within the con-
text of improving education in medical or nursing school curricula or
university education (United States, European Member States) or
improving knowledge of climate change and climate change effects
among government health ofﬁcials (China). Six of the studies
included in this review focused on climate and health knowledge of
medical or university students, which revealed that most students
are at least aware of the occurrence of climate change, but they are
uninformed about and unprepared to deal with the consequences of
climate change. Researchers from Sapienza University in Rome found
that medical students were able to correctly identify weather-related
climate change effects, but less than half identiﬁed an increase in vec-
tor-borne diseases as an effect of climate change [17]. In another
study conducted with students from the University of Granada in
Spain, researchers found that while students knew about climate
change and felt that it was a current phenomenon, many were
unaware of speciﬁc causes or consequences of climate change, and
several mentioned having little to no information provided on cli-
mate change during their studies [18]. Similarly, in infectious dis-

studies,
university students were aware of major mosquito-borne illnesses
(dengue, Zika, chikungunya), but were unable to correctly identify
symptoms, methods of transmission or mosquito biting periods and
had overall poor knowledge of VBDs [19,20].
Lack of climate and VBD literacy in the Caribbean
While there were articles in our scoping review that focused their
efforts on LMICs such as India and Bangladesh, there was a paucity of
studies that centered on either climate or VBD literacy within the
Caribbean. Out of the 23 articles that were included in our ﬁnal
review, only one was based in the Caribbean. In this study conducted
among Jamaican residents in Montego Bay, Alobuia et al. (2015)
found that nearly all participants (90 %) had heard of dengue or
malaria but less than 10 % had ever had the disease [21]. Though

malaria is not endemic to Jamaica [22], dengue is but is often asymp-
tomatic [22,23]. Attitudes towards VBDs among this group were
mixed, with many respondents holding the belief that while VBDs
were serious, they were not a major problem [21]. The authors of this
article also cite that poor VBD knowledge reﬂected in this paper was
in large part due to the lack of consistent VBD control and awareness
measures available in Jamaica [21].
Non-Standardized questionnaires and lack of informational materials
Inclusion of questionnaires used to collect participant responses
was inconsistent among the selected articles. Over half of the papers
selected for this scoping review only included selected questions
within tables, did not include all questions asked during participant
interviews, or did not reference a speciﬁc questionnaire used to col-
lect data. Only ten of 23 articles had complete questionnaires pro-
vided within their supplemental materials. There also seems to be no
standardized set of items or questionnaires available to assess climate
and health literacy. Large organizational websites, such as the United
States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World
Health Organization (WHO), and the Pan American Health Organiza-
tion (PAHO) all provide publicly available informational resources to
help inform users of climate and health topics but offer no resources
to help guide literacy assessments. A few papers that were selected
for full text review referred to WHO’s Zika resource pack that con-
tains relevant KAP items for questionnaire development [24], but
otherwise no other climate- or infectious disease-speciﬁc KAP resour-
ces existed for researchers to base their questionnaires on. Despite
the overall lack of supporting materials for climate literacy studies,
many of the included articles shared similar items among them.
Some of the most common statements used during literacy assess-
ments included variations of “Humans are responsible for climate
change/global warming” [25−27], “Climate change will inﬂuence
transmission of infectious diseases” [27−29] and “I have heard about
dengue/Zika/chikungunya” [30,31].
Limited understanding of relationships between climate change and vbd
transmission
We noted that while several of the participants interviewed in
these studies tended to have decent knowledge of climate change
overall, many of them were less conﬁdent in their understanding of
how climate change affects human health. Eighty-ﬁve percent of Chi-
na’s CDC health professionals interviewed by Tong et al. reported
needing more information for understanding climate change impacts
on health [28]. In a study among nurses surveyed in China, only 39 %
reported knowing the main cause of climate change, though 96 %
were willing to learn more about climate change and related health
impacts [32]. With regard to climate impacts on VBDs in particular,
van Wijk et al. found that only 30 % of all participants interviewed
among the general public reported that they were well informed on
climate change effects on infectious disease [27]. Of those partici-
pants with a science background, less than half (40 %) reported being
knowledgeable of the effects of climate change on infectious disease
[27]. Another study conducted in both Laos and Thailand revealed
that over 85 % of participants believed that changes to climate would
inﬂuence dengue fever risk but were limited in their understanding
of the speciﬁc impacts that would occur both locally and globally as a
consequence [33]. An investigation conducted in Punjab, Pakistan,
where dengue and DHF are endemic, found that out of the respond-
ents, approximately 71 % of those who did suffer from DHF and 83 %
of who did not suffer from DHF did not know or did not consider den-
gue to be an infectious or endemic disease despite having decent cli-
mate change knowledge [34]. Likewise, it appeared that many
participants also had lower general knowledge of vector-borne dis-
ease dynamics as well. Several reported at least hearing about major
mosquito-borne diseases and could identify the causes and symp-
toms of these illnesses, but very few were aware of speciﬁc vector
ecology or transmission processes. In a study completed by Bota et al.
in 2013, university students in interior Sindh, Pakistan, were sur-
veyed for their KAP of dengue fever [19]. Their results showed that
nearly all students (95 %) were aware of dengue, but only half could
correctly identify the Aedes mosquito as its transmission source [19].
In addition, many students were aware that water was important for
mosquito breeding, but only a third were able to correctly identify
stagnant water as an important breeding site [19].
Ignorance towards actions and preventive behaviors in response to
climate change and VBDs
In addition, several participants across the reviewed studies
showed general ignorance in implementing preventive measures
against infectious diseases when asked. Around 60 % of urban resi-
dents interviewed in Bangladesh reported that they were aware
keeping a clean home could help prevent Aedes mosquito breeding
but did not necessarily follow through [35]. Besides the use of bed
nets, some of the most commonly practiced prevention measures
were typically removal of standing water sources or use of mosquito
repellant, though the percentage of participants regularly imple-
menting these strategies was low [36]. In more rural areas, respond-
ents tended to have much lower knowledge of the most effective
VBD-prevention methods, contributing to their lack of reliable VBD
practices [37]. This review also highlighted conﬂicting views con-
cerning the role of government in VBD prevention. Approximately
40 % of people interviewed in one study believed that mosquito pre-
vention was solely the responsibility of the government [35]. How-
ever, other studies revealed many participants believed that they
personally were more responsible for preventing VBDs in their com-
munities [38].
Discussion
Summary of results
Our scoping review highlights the major lack of research studies
concerning climate change and infectious disease literacy around the
world. We found that several of the articles selected for this review
were based within HICs centered around providing better climate
education within medical or nursing curricula, versus providing cli-
mate education or materials to communities that may otherwise not
have access to these resources. The niche target audiences in these
types of articles make it difﬁcult to generalize ﬁndings to other popu-
lations, especially more vulnerable communities that are most likely
to experience the more extreme consequences of climate change.
These ﬁndings indicate that climate literacy is inadequate in many
areas of the world, and most particularly among LMICs where resour-
ces are already limited.
Lack of standardization in questionnaires and missing topics
We also found that there is currently no standardized climate or
infectious disease literacy questionnaires geared toward general pop-
ulations for use among researchers. Less than half of the articles had
attached copies of their questionnaires included as supplemental
materials, and those that did had several discrepancies between
what kinds of questions appeared in the surveys. In several of the
articles surrounding medical and nursing student knowledge and
perceptions of climate change, the major focus of discussion was cen-
tered around the inclusion of greater climate education within medi-
cal curricula and healthcare practices [25,26,39] versus assessment of
climate literacy among the general population. This was also
observed in articles focused on government and public health

4
ofﬁcials, where climate literacy was based speciﬁcally on knowledge
and perceptions of mitigation policies or capacity for climate change
induced infectious disease control [28,40]. The speciﬁcity of these
types of questions fails to assess the comprehension of climate
change and associated impacts within a generalized population and
thus cannot be used to effectively assess climate or infectious disease
literacy in any other community. Many of the articles reviewed also
failed to mention several important climate change topics. Only one
of the aforementioned articles focused efforts on a major implication
of climate change other than vector-borne diseases [41]. Important
climate change impacts such as sea level rise, warming of oceans,
droughts, hurricanes and cyclones, and food/agricultural production
were either vaguely referred to in surveys or not discussed at all. The
lack of access to complete questionnaires and the major disconnect
in climate change topics among articles makes it difﬁcult to truly
assess the scope of previous climate change literature and literacy
levels among the general population.
Lack of region-speciﬁc or culturally adapted questionnaires
More importantly, we noticed that nearly every article we
reviewed included basic climate change or VBD-associated KAP ques-
tions, but most did not include literacy items that assessed people’s
general knowledge or understanding of climate change impacts that
were speciﬁc to their countries or regions. This was particularly
apparent when reviewing articles centered around Southeast Asia
(India, Indonesia, Thailand, Bangladesh) as well as the single article
focused on Jamaica. Southeast Asia and small island states, like the
Caribbean, experience tropical and subtropical climates and are
much more susceptible to climate change effects, especially concern-
ing infectious disease transmission, compared to other regions of the
world [42−44]. However, there were very few questions within these
articles that addressed particular KAP centered around climate
change impacts such as increased rainfall patterns, hurricane or mon-
soon risks, heatwaves, and sea level rises that are more likely to occur
in these regions. These types of events can cause increases in ﬂooding
and create stagnant water sources, which can attract mosquitoes and
provide more suitable breeding grounds. In turn, increased mosquito
breeding areas and higher temperatures allow for greater numbers of
adult disease-carrying mosquitoes as well as shorter disease incuba-
tion periods and faster and more frequent rates of feeding [45−47].
The exclusion of region-speciﬁc literacy items such as the ones
described here thus largely ignores the relationships between speciﬁc
climate change impacts and increased infectious disease transmission
and does not sufﬁciently evaluate general knowledge of these topics.
Limited understanding of the relationships between climate change
effects and VBD transmission
As stated previously, many of the articles in this review revealed
that while people may be generally aware of climate change, they
may not be aware of the relationship between climate change and
increased mosquito-borne disease transmission, and thus typically
tend to avoid implementing preventive measures, especially if they
believe that they are not at risk. This was an interesting conclusion,
as it showed us that while most people have at least some level of cli-
mate change and/or infectious disease knowledge, there is a major
lack of urgency among both the public and the government in imple-
mentation of protective strategies, in addition to the low importance
placed on teaching preventive methods to vulnerable communities.
This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that many participants
from included studies reported that there was not enough being
done by their governments to mitigate increased spread of infectious
diseases. Additionally, many of the most commonly reported infor-
mation sources among participants were television, radio, and the
internet/social media (e.g., Facebook). Despite their wide reach
among the population, it is clear that these sources are not entirely
successful in circulating climate change or infectious disease informa-
tion to the public. In the included study by Darrow et al., 85 % of
respondents reported television or radio as their main sources of Zika
information, but few regarded this information as trustworthy [48].
This sentiment was also reﬂected in the study done by Mazzalai et al.,
who reported that most medical students surveyed cited television
as their main source of climate information, but that there is wide-
spread mistrust of the media among younger generations [17]. Trust-
worthy sources of information were typically reported to be
scientists, university professors, medical or community health pro-
fessionals, public health departments, environmental protection
agencies, or non-governmental organizations [26]. However, it
appears that these sources tend to be underutilized when dissemi-
nating critical climate change and infectious disease information. In
order to expand the scope of global climate change and infectious
disease literacy, it is necessary for local and state governments to
fund and provide more opportunities for reliable health communica-
tion programs and community outreach for improved climate
literacy.
Limitations
There were a few limitations to the extent of our review. Only two
major scientiﬁc databases were searched, and though these yielded
adequate results, we may have missed articles that would have oth-
erwise been included in our review from additional databases. More-
over, our parameters may not have yielded the exact results we
expected, and thus we potentially may have missed articles that
could have been relevant to our search. For example, climate change
is often used synonymously with global warming in spite of their dis-
tinct deﬁnitions [49], and there is a chance that articles could have
been missed if they referred to climate change as simply ‘global
warming’, which was not included in our search terms.
Future interventions and recommendations to improve knowledge gaps
Looking at current gaps in the literature, an important next step to
improving climate and infectious disease literacy is to create a more
generalizable scale that assesses public knowledge of the relationship
between climate change and infectious diseases, particularly in
LMICs, mainly in the Caribbean and South and Central America. It is
also important to provide a more standardized assessment tool for
climate and health literacy, as one currently does not exist. Based on
these knowledge gaps, we plan to expand on current KAP question-
naires by developing, implementing, and validating a combined cli-
mate and infectious disease literacy scale that will acknowledge a
wider range of climate change and VBD topics in order to better eval-
uate these associations, starting in Suriname. Based on the informa-
tion gained from this scoping review, we also recommend greater
emphasis on climate and infectious disease information dissemina-
tion in LMICs, as currently there is major disconnect between reliable
informational sources and effective community engagement. Finally,
CDC, PAHO, and WHO should help guide future climate and health lit-
eracy assessments by providing resources such as guided question-
naires for researchers as well as readily available climate and health
informational materials for target populations.
Conclusions
This scoping review has demonstrated that climate change liter-
acy is insufﬁcient around the world, especially among more vulnera-
ble communities. We particularly notice this discrepancy in the
Caribbean, where we could only ﬁnd one research study that focused
their efforts on this region despite being an area highly affected by
climate change, and consequently, the continued spread of VBDs. Our

review calls attention to the need for a more inclusive approach to
climate change literacy in order to better understand climate change-
induced infectious disease dynamics across the globe, and that more
reliable information needs to be made readily available to at-risk
communities moving forward.
