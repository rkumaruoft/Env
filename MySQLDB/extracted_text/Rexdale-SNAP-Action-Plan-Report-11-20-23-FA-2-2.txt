ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
We respectfully acknowledge the lands Toronto (and Rexdale) is situated on are Traditional Territories and 
Treaty Lands, in particular those of the Mississaugas of the Credit, as well as the Anishinaabeg of the Williams 
Treaty First Nations, and the Huron-Wendat and are now home to many diverse First Nations, Inuit and Métis 
peoples. 
The Rexdale SNAP is a comprehensive action plan for neighbourhood revitalization that integrates both local 
community interests and technical sustainability objectives. The Rexdale SNAP supports a future with a 
healthy Humber River Watershed, with valley and park lands that are accessible, fun, and safe for everyone’s 
enjoyment, and where Indigenous and global cultures are celebrated with pride. The action plan also supports 
a community where the suburban forest extends into the busiest, densest parts of the neighbourhood, 
bringing tranquility to residents. The Rexdale of the future will be net zero and its physical and social fabric 
will be adequately prepared for the imminent impacts of climate change. This state of preparedness will be 
achieved by training local youth in the green job sector. Everyone will be able to afford high quality housing. 
Neighbours will be connected to support each other and build their community. They will get together 
frequently in beautiful meeting spaces. Local art will be present on every corner, enriching life in the 
neighbourhood. Culturally relevant food will be grown in all land uses. The extraordinary culture of sharing in 
this community, will make this neighbourhood the first circular (and sharing) economy neighbourhood in 
Canada. Residents will share food, talents, and services. Household items will be reused, improving 
affordability, offering income, and reducing waste.

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
Through spirituality, multigenerational families, cultural heritage and diversity, the Rexdale SNAP community 
hopes to grow and thrive together in harmony with neighbours and the natural world around them -- and what 
a beautiful natural environment it is! Nestled between two branches of the Humber River, there is no shortage 
of ravines, parks, and trails to explore. Whether it’s trekking or biking the Humber Recreational Trail, spending a 
few tranquil moments at the Humber Arboretum, heading to a local park to start the day in contemplation and 
meditation, or taking in serene sunsets on evening strolls with friends, this community sees its greenspace as a 
treasure to enjoy, away from the hustle and bustle of suburban city life.  
Even though these treasured spaces are never far away, the complexities of living in the Rexdale neighbourhood 
are also ever-present. Faced with the challenges of increasingly unaffordable living costs, food insecurity, lack of 
jobs and training opportunities especially for youth and newcomers, and the threat of violent crime, this 
community works hard to thrive in the face of adversity and to creatively come up with collective solutions. 
Rexdale residents enthusiastically participated in co-developing the sustainability and resilience plans for the 
neighbourhood in conjunction with TRCA, Rexdale Community Hub (RCH), the City of Toronto, and many local 
agencies, groups, and institutions. 
The action planning process used a three phased approach: Phase 1 included baseline analysis and scoping of 
issues, stakeholders and interests; Phase 2 included the development of a vulnerability assessment and defining 
both motivational themes in the community as well as action planning concept areas; Phase 3 included the co-
development of the Action Plan. Throughout the action planning process, community members shared their 
dreams of improvements to local infrastructure and community services, the preservation and animation of 
greenspaces and streetscapes (to be greener, safer, and better for active transportation), and both increased 
and enhanced vibrant communal spaces for gatherings and celebrations. Residents identified ideas of how to 
address housing issues (for residents living in both single-family homes and high-rise buildings), how to tackle 
the threat of climate change, and how to deal with the high cost of living (through programming, collective 
action and developing a circular and sharing economy).  
This Action Plan outlines the recommendations that were generated though the consultation and co-design 
process and serves to inspire action to help the Rexdale SNAP neighbourhood achieve the vision of becoming a 
thriving community, growing in harmony with nature and neighbours.

What is SNAP?  
The Sustainable Neighbourhood Action Program (SNAP) of TRCA is a collaborative, neighbourhood-based 
approach for advancing sustainable urban renewal and climate action in older urban areas. SNAPs help 
municipalities and other community collaborators improve efficiencies, draw strong local support and build 
innovative partnerships for the implementation of a broad range of initiatives in the public and private realms. 
It uses both, a top-down and bottom-up approach, bringing together municipal and TRCA technical objectives, 
with residents’ dreams and priorities. 
There are 16 SNAP neighbourhoods in Ontario. The Black Creek SNAP in Toronto was one of the pioneers, 
which was implemented between 2012 and 2019. At the same time as this plan was being developed for 
Rexdale, a SNAP Action Plan was also being developed for the Pocket Neighbourhood, for a total of 3 SNAPs in 
Toronto. For more information go to: https://trca.ca/conservation/sustainable-neighbourhoods/.

3.0 NEIGHBOURHOOD SELECTION AND KEY DRIVERS 
In 2019, TRCA’s Sustainable Neighbourhood’s team worked with multiple divisions at the City of Toronto to 
conduct a neighbourhood screening process. This screening process identified new candidate communities 
within Toronto (in addition to the Black Creek SNAP, initiated in 2010), that would be well suited for the SNAP 
program. The screening process was designed to support a collective, proactive approach to a growing number 
of complex issues including but not limited to aging infrastructure, asset management and urban renewal needs, 
climate vulnerabilities and risks, environmental and watershed regeneration priorities, and socio-economic 
priorities. 
An important first step in the screening process was the development of a mapping framework in collaboration 
with the City of Toronto’s Transportation Services Division, created to organize partner priorities into a 
comprehensive set of service area themes reflecting sustainable community attributes. This framework applied 
the Green Streets Prioritization Methodology and guided a multi-objective analysis. Appendix A presents the 
framework of service areas and lists the data considered in the screening process. These layers represented 
planned projects, sustainability priorities, and known vulnerabilities across departments and organizations.  
The Geographic Information System (GIS) exercise consisted of mapping all the layers (shown in Appendix A) 
across the city, and highlighting areas where many partner projects or vulnerabilities were concentrated. 
Through this process several “areas of interest”, including the Rexdale SNAP area, were identified. Once the 
areas of interest were identified, a “deep dive” analysis of these areas was undertaken by various divisions from 
the City and TRCA to select the preferred neighbourhood. Through the “deep dive” process, the multi-divisional 
selection team discussed specific characteristics and needs in each area of interest, strategic opportunities for 
integrated initiatives, feasibility and demonstration potential. The Rexdale Neighbourhood was selected due to 
its overlapping vulnerabilities and urban renewal, environmental and socio-economic priorities. 
The Rexdale SNAP neighbourhood boundaries were refined based on technical and logistics considerations and 
public engagement results. A summary of the overlapping priorities that brought the SNAP program to the 
Rexdale Neighbourhood include (see Section 4.0 for more detail on the Neighbourhood’s baseline conditions): 
 
• 
Neighbourhood Improvement Area: An area with vulnerable populations, concentrated poverty, and 
serious food insecurity. 
• 
Residential Retrofit Needs: The Rexdale Neighbourhood has seen close to zero development or 
redevelopment in the last 60 years. The residential sector offers significant opportunities for climate 
mitigation and resilience, in addition to overall housing improvements. 
• 
Low Tree Canopy: This neighbourhood has low tree canopy cover, compared to the rest of Toronto. 
• 
Flooding: Areas of the neighbourhood are subject to riverine flooding, with some residences located within 
the regional/100-year flood plain. Some areas also experience basement flooding (medium).  
Rexdale SNAP Action Plan Report 
Toronto and Region Conservation Authority    |    5 
 
 
• 
Low Impact Development (LID) Priority Area: The neighbourhood’s location within the watershed, the 
presence of medium-high impervious soils, and a depth to water table (conducive to infiltration) make this 
area a high priority for LID retrofits. 
• 
Erosion: This neighbourhood has various erosion and restoration opportunity sites along branches of the 
Humber River.  
• 
Sensitive Target Fish Species: Sensitive target fish species have been identified in sections of the Humber 
River crossing through the neighbourhood.  
• 
Discharges to Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA): Neighbourhood stormwater system discharges to 
downstream ESA.  
• 
Urban Heat Stress: Areas within the neighbourhood are vulnerable to urban heat stress.  
• 
Aging Park Infrastructure and Changing Neighbourhood Demographics: Aging park infrastructure and 
changes in neighbourhood demographics present an opportunity for park revitalization. 
• 
Canadian Heritage River: This designation offers an opportunity to work with Indigenous communities and 
multiple levels of government to enhance nature-based and history education. 
• 
Planned Capital Projects: Through the SNAP program, a series of planned capital projects can be leveraged 
to achieve environmental resilience and social impacts. Planned capital projects in the community include 
the Finch Light Rail Transit (LRT) and associated cycling and pedestrian infrastructure, Rowntree Mills Park 
(identified as a priority action area through the Ravine Strategy), and various capital projects in roads from 
Transportation Services. 
• 
Existing Programs and Strategies: Community initiatives and great collaboration are already taking place in 
the neighbourhood, offering opportunities to join forces to achieve efficiencies and maximize impact in the 
community. Some of these initiatives are: 
• 
Northwest Toronto Neighbourhood Infrastructure Engagement Initiative: led by the RCH, this initiative 
looks at opportunities for open space rehabilitation and maps food access. 
• 
Previous Recipe for Community Area: through the City of Toronto’s Tower and Neighbourhood 
Revitalization Unit, relationships were developed and work advanced in MURBs. 
• 
North Etobicoke Africa Climate Action Initiative: Canadian and African leaders acting alongside African 
communities to tackle climate change and moving towards a resilient, sustainable, and regenerative future. 
• 
COVID-19 Cluster Table: Convened by United Way and the City of Toronto, this table brings together 
individuals from diverse organizations to rapidly identify local issues, troubleshoot, and then respond in a 
cohesive way.  
• 
Food Access Committee: Multi-agency and multi-sector group focused on facilitating access to food in the 
community. 
• 
Park People: Has facilitated park animation. 
• 
Queens Leveling Up: Urban agriculture initiatives led by a local grassroots agency.

4.0 ABOUT THE REXDALE NEIGHBOURHOOD 
Located in of the city of Toronto’s northwest, the Rexdale SNAP neighbourhood is bounded by Steeles Avenue to 
the north, the Martin Grove Hydro Corridor and the Humber Arboretum on the west, the Humber River to the 
south, and Kipling Avenue and another branch of the Humber River on the east.  
Figure 1: Rexdale SNAP Neighbourhood, Toronto: Study Area and Land Use

Toronto and Region Conservation Authority    |    7 
 
 
4.1 Population 
The study area is home to approximately 54,454 people with a diverse demographic: 89% of residents belong to 
a visible minority group, 64% identify as recent immigrants, and 52% have a mother tongue other than English or 
French. 
Rexdale has been identified as one of the City of Toronto’s Neighbourhood Improvement Areas (NIA), and the 
United Way identified the neighbourhood as an area of concentrated poverty and vulnerable populations. Food 
insecurity, physical and mental health, employment, housing, affordability, and gang violence are some of the 
key issues affecting the community. The average household income is $79,968 and 28% of residents are 
considered low income. Throughout the extensive public engagement process, many residents shared their 
struggles due to precarious immigration status. 
Despite the socio-economic pressures, Rexdale is blessed with great social assets. The neighbourhood has 
numerous dedicated resident leaders that collaborate constructively with local agencies, investing significant 
energy and time towards improving their community. There is also a culture of mutual aid, with many residents 
helping neighbours with groceries, sharing prepared food, overcoming language barriers, car sharing, and other 
supports. Rexdale also has an impressive artistic community that infuses vibrancy into the life of the 
neighbourhood. There is also a significant proportion of the population that practices and shares expertise on 
mind-body activities like yoga and meditation, brought from their countries of origin.

4.2 Parks and Nature 
Rexdale is bounded in the south and east by various branches and tributaries to the Humber River. There are 13 
parks and many open spaces around multi-unit residential buildings (MURBs) and institutional properties. While 
residents feel tremendously attracted to nature and outdoor activities, most of the parks are outdated and in 
need of community amenities that better respond to current demographics in the neighbourhood (i.e,. South 
Asian background, large families (or multi-families) living in apartments with inadequate meeting spaces, etc.).  
While the City’s Parks, Forestry and Recreation’s 10-year capital plan includes equitable state of good repair 
upgrades across the City, there has been very little additional investment through development charges or 
community benefit charges, as there has been minimal new development in the ward. Additionally, many of 
these parks are hard to access for those residents living in MURBs. For example, many of the MURBs properties 
adjacent to open spaces have been fenced. Open spaces around MURBs and institutional properties tend to be 
underutilized and mostly covered with grass. It should be noted, however, that several beautiful and well-
maintained pollinator gardens as well as several community gardens have been implemented across the 
neighbourhood.  
The Humber River trail system is equally difficult for the public to access from the Rexdale neighbourhood, with 
limited and poorly marked entrances. Residents also indicated that although many of the MURBs are adjacent to 
the valley, in most cases these spaces are fenced, feel unfriendly and unsightly, with garbage tangled amongst 
the dense vegetation. 
A recent tree planting opportunity analysis developed by TRCA’s GIS department showed that the 
neighbourhood has a tree canopy cover of 14%, which is lower than the city average (27%). 
Rexdale’s stormwater system drains to the Humber River. The Humber River Watershed Plan 2008 – Pathways 
to a Healthy Humber— identified the following key issues in the watershed from an aquatic ecosystem 
perspective: 
• 
Generally poor-quality aquatic habitats in most urban areas.  
• 
Sensitivity of many specialized aquatic species to impacts of urbanization.  
Rexdale SNAP Action Plan Report 
Toronto and Region Conservation Authority    |    9 
 
 
• 
Sustained loss, and risk of further loss, of native aquatic species due to declining habitat and competition 
with invasive species.  
• 
Fragmented stretches of riparian vegetation.  
• 
Numerous in-stream barriers.  
The stretch of the Humber River that crosses the neighbourhood provides habitat for sensitive target fish 
species. Some of the sensitive target fish species in the Lower Humber River include Rainbow Darter, 
Smallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass (ponds), Northern Pike (marshes), while in the in the West Humber River, 
Redside Dace, Rainbow Darter and Smallmouth Bass are of key importance. Sections of the Humber River Valley 
within Rexdale also have localized erosion.  
Left: Plowshare Park, Rexdale.  Right: Residential towers seen from the Humber River in Rexdale 
Due to location within the watershed, soil permeability, and the depth of the groundwater table, Rexdale is a 
key strategic area for stormwater management (for quality and quantity) within the Humber Watershed. 
Rexdale has opportunities to help combat the aforementioned factors through the implementation of Low 
Impact Development (LID) facilities to both retain and infiltrate stormwater on site.  
The Rexdale neighbourhood was mostly developed during the 1960’s and 1980’s. It has a mix of 6,148 houses 
and 36 post-war MURBs. Out of the of the 15,836 households, 61% of those are apartment or condominium 
units. The neighbourhood has a higher rate of subsidized housing compared to the City of Toronto average.

Single Family Homes in Rexdale 
4.3.1 MURBs 
During the action planning engagement process, local agencies and residents emphasized the impact of the 
housing crisis, which has disproportionately affected vulnerable residents in Neighbourhood Improvement Areas 
like Rexdale. Many of the aging MURBs in the neighbourhood are in desperate need of repair, offering poor 
living conditions to residents. Issues highlighted by residents include extremely hot units with no air conditioning 
and poor ventilation, uncomfortable drafts during the winter months, and bed bugs.  
City of Toronto staff also highlighted the energy resilience risks faced by aging residential towers in Rexdale. 
There have been incidents in Toronto in which entire buildings have had to be evacuated due to energy system 
failures, leaving vulnerable residents without housing for months. This situation could potentially happen in 
similar residential buildings in Rexdale if aging energy systems are not upgraded. 
The Humber River is the only Canadian Heritage River in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), and one of only 40 
such designated rivers across Canada. 
The Humber River was officially designated in 1999, under the Canadian Heritage Rivers System (CHRS) for its 
significant cultural and recreational values, thanks to the collaborative efforts of TRCA, the Humber Heritage 
Community, and dedicated community members. 
The Humber River has rich human history as a home for Indigenous peoples along its banks, as an ancient 
transportation route known as the Carrying Place Trail, and as a site for many of Toronto’s post-European 
settlement homes and industries. 
The Carrying Place Trail is one of the oldest established transportation routes in Canada and is the highlight of 
the Humber’s CHRS designation. 
Rexdale SNAP Action Plan Report 
Toronto and Region Conservation Authority    |    11 
 
 
The MURBs in Rexdale are densely populated, often with multi-generational families or multiple families living in 
apartment units, leaving little remaining living space. During the engagement process, residents expressed that 
MURBs lack spaces for socializing and gathering as a community. This is a particularly critical issue in Rexdale, 
which hosts a demographic where big gatherings with family and friends are key cultural activities. 
4.3.2 Single Family Homes 
In Rexdale, 59% of homes were constructed prior to 1980, suggesting that many homes do not meet the more 
stringent energy requirements of current building codes. TRCA’s staff observations during a home retrofit 
program delivered in Rexdale in 2016-2018 suggest that most of the houses in the neighbourhood have not had 
major renovations or redevelopment. However, TRCA found that there is a large group of do-it-yourselfers with 
construction skills that keep up with general maintenance and small repairs. There is still, however, substantial 
opportunities for greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction, flood risk prevention, tree planting, on site stormwater 
management, and other sustainability improvements. With many of the initial homeowners in the 
neighbourhood being from an Italian background, residents inherited a trend of investing time in caring for their 
front and backyards. Numerous homes have manicured landscaping, and many grow their own food through 
impressive gardens and fruit trees. 
According to the City of Toronto, 57% of the city’s GHG emissions are generated from buildings, of which 55% 
come directly from residential buildings. Environics reports that approximately 24% of households in the 
neighbourhood use natural gas to heat their home, which is the primary contributor of GHG emissions from this 
sector. Approximately 14% of households heat their home with electricity. Approximately 8% of homeowners in 
the neighbourhood have completed a home energy audit but only 2% have implemented recommendations 
received through the audit process.  
From 2016-2018, TRCA piloted scaling of the Harvest the Rain Home Retrofit Program in the Rexdale 
neighbourhood. Harvest the Rain was a program originally initiated in the Black Creek SNAP. 
The program offered free face-to-face home consultations and ongoing support, to help homeowners retrofit 
their homes and yards, through energy, water, stormwater management, flood prevention, urban agriculture, 
and eco-landscaping actions. The program also offered small incentives, and helped homeowners access 
existing government incentives and programs. 
It was a highly successful pilot, with 56 participating homes, out of which 96% implemented at least one 
significant sustainability or resilience action, such as insulation, basement flooding prevention, tree planting, 
and rainwater harvesting. 
During this period, TRCA also worked with the City of Toronto’s Urban Harvest Program and the RCH to bring 
the Surplus Harvest Donation Program to Rexdale and three other neighbourhoods in the city. The program, 
initially created by TRCA in the Black Creek SNAP, collects surplus harvest from the neighbourhood houses and 
brings it to meal programs and food banks within the community, helping to address food insecurity, while 
reducing waste and GHG related to food transportation.

4.3.3 Institutions 
Rexdale has 46 institutional properties, many of which are highly respected and valued by local residents. Of this 
total, there are 11 schools, 3 community centres, 14 faith-based institutions from diverse religions, as well as 
employment centres, emergency shelters, food banks, and health and social service agencies.  
There is great collaboration happening among the existing local agencies and institutions in the neighbourhood. 
These organizations have many resident leaders supporting their work and are dedicated to improving the 
neighbourhood community. These collaborations have been bolstered through the creation of multi-agency 
cluster tables and COVID-19 working groups. As Rexdale was one of the neighbourhoods impacted most by the 
COVID-19 pandemic, community leaders joined forces with local agencies to overcome the crises. 
The RCH is a much-loved community-based service agency that plays a foundational role in the neighbourhood. 
It brings diverse social service agencies together in one location, works closely with resident leaders, and holds 
deep community knowledge, with staff often being hired from within the neighbourhood. The various 
institutions in the neighbourhood, especially the RCH, played a fundamental role in the development of this 
Action Plan, generously sharing their knowledge, supporting community engagement, leading constructive 
discussions, and offering insightful solutions. 
Some of the local institutions, like the RCH and Albion Library, have comfortable facilities and beautiful 
architecture. The Hub has incorporated art from local artists within its building. Although some of the 
institutions are ageing, they are generally well maintained.  
The agencies’ stakeholders expressed, however, the need for more government resources to support them. 
Residents highlighted the need for more community services and improvements to the education system in the 
neighbourhood.

The neighbourhood also hosts Humber College and the impressive Humber Arboretum, a 250-acre area of 
botanical gardens and natural areas, managed through a three-party agreement between Humber College, the 
City of Toronto, and TRCA. TRCA has and continues to invest significant resources in the restoration of the 
Humber Valley and erosion control in the Arboretum. Through public engagement, Humber College expressed 
an interest in improving connections with the local community, by bringing more residents to the Arboretum, 
offering education and skills training, and bringing services to the community through their students and 
faculties, such as health and wellbeing (i.e., through nutrition, naturopaths, massage therapists, etc.).  
Humber College is also advancing interesting work with Indigenous leaders, including the current design of an 
Indigenous ceremonial space and outdoor classroom in the Arboretum, which is being supported by the City of 
Toronto and TRCA. 
4.3.4 The Commercial Sector 
The neighbourhood has a number of commercial properties. The Albion Mall is a focal point for the Rexdale 
community, as it has culturally significant retail shops and is frequently visited by residents. The architecture of 
the mall is representative from the 1960s-1980s, with oversized parking lots, and limited greenery.  
There is some interest from some local businesses to support the community. For example, one of the local 
supermarkets, which offers culturally significant food, has been a partner in helping to identify solutions to 
address food insecurity. 
The Rexdale Community Hub (RCH) is a resource for Rexdale residents, offering programming, 
connecting individuals and families to various social services and resources, and promoting community 
engagement. As a central focal point within the neighbourhood, the RCH is integral to neighbourhood 
stewardship and connection. Its mission is to provide an accessible, welcoming space with collaborative 
and integrated services and programs to enrich every aspect of the community.  
RCH’s services include, but are not limited to, career planning and job search support, family resource 
programs, children and youth programming, housing support, legal services, and women’s services. They 
also offer bookable multi-purpose community spaces for gathering, facilitate a collaborative food program 
offering weekly meals to children and youth, and run a STEM club.

4.4 Transportation 
Rexdale is serviced by several bus routes along Hwy 27, Martin Grove Road, Kipling Avenue, Albion Road, Finch 
Avenue, and Steeles Avenue. During the engagement process, residents expressed that transit service is 
infrequent and inconvenient. In many cases, residents have noted that they need to take several buses to get to 
work. This may explain why – even though affordability is one of the main issues affecting the community – 57% 
of residents still commute to work by car. Only 30% use transit, and only 4% travel using active transportation.  
According to the 2016 Transportation Tomorrow Survey conducted by the City of Toronto, approximately 18% of 
households in Ward 1 – where the Rexdale SNAP neighbourhood is located –do not own a car.  
The second largest contributor of GHG emissions within the City of Toronto is the transportation sector, which 
accounts for 36%. Of that 36%, 73% is generated by passenger vehicles. There are two public electric vehicle 
(EV) charging stations within the Rexdale neighbourhood, both located at Humber College. There are currently 
no Bike Share Toronto stations accessible to the neighbourhood. Community members are excited about the 
opportunities that the Finch LRT will bring but also highlighted the importance of improving active 
transportation connections (and the biker/ pedestrian experience) to access the LRT.  
There are three main multi-use trails that cross the neighbourhood from north to south: the West Humber Trail, 
the Humber River Recreational Trail, and the Kipling Avenue Bicycle Trail. During the engagement process 
residents expressed that many of the services and retail they use are within walking distance, and that there is 
the need to improve the pedestrian experience. This was of particular note along Kipling Avenue and its main 
intersections (i.e., Mount Olive Drive/ Panorama Court; Finch Avenue; John Garland Boulevard), where many of 
the bus stops are located. These intersections feel unsafe and congested, are noisy, have poor air quality, and 
lack greenery. 
The City of Toronto’s Transportation Services has capital projects planned in 2025-26 for Kipling Avenue 
(between Albion Rd. and Steeles Ave.) and John Garland Boulevard (between Martin Grove Rd. and Kipling Ave). 
Rexdale SNAP Action Plan Report 
Toronto and Region Conservation Authority    |    15 
 
 
It also has capital projects planned for 2026 for a number of smaller streets south of Steeles Avenue (between 
Martin Grove Rd. and Kipling Ave.). These projects offer opportunities for synergies and can potentially be 
leveraged to achieve the neighbourhood’s sustainability and resilience goals by adding green infrastructure, 
modern public amenities, active transportation, art and programming. 
4.5 Waste Management 
The waste sector contributes about 7% of GHG emissions in the city of Toronto; this includes both organic and 
inorganic waste. Further details about waste practices by City Ward, or postal code, were not available at the 
time of writing this report. The Conference Board of Canada (CBC) calculated national and provincial waste 
generation estimates from 2006 to 2012 which could be used as a surrogate for Rexdale. According to the CBC, 
in 2012, Canadians generated 720 kg of waste per capita, with Ontario residents generating slightly less than the 
national average at 673.4 kg/capita, or approximately four pounds of waste per day per person.1 Environics data 
provides a range of statistics related to residential behaviours related to specific waste activities, including 
composting of kitchen and yard waste, as well as disposal behaviours for a wide range of hazardous waste 
materials (e.g., medical waste, paints/solvents, batteries, electronics, etc.).  
With respect to composting habits, 64% of Rexdale residents compost kitchen waste and 24% compost yard 
waste. 91% of residents who have access to municipal composting programs regularly use them. For the 
hazardous waste materials tracked by Environics, the Rexdale neighbourhood performed below the city-wide 
average when it comes to using proper disposal methods for batteries, medication, and paints/solvents.  
4.6 A Look Back at the History of Rexdale 
As far back as time immemorial, the area along the Humber River, north of Lake Ontario, was an important 
travelling route to many Indigenous peoples and others. It was known as the Carrying Place Trail. This led to a 
variety of settlements on the banks of the Humber, and people lived and traded goods along the Carrying Place 
Trail until about 1790. This is when Yonge Street was built, connecting Lake Ontario to Lake Simcoe, thus 
providing a faster route for trade. The area we now know as Rexdale was established on the very lands that once 
were settlements supporting, and supported by, the Carrying Place Trail. 
According to the Etobicoke Historical Society, 1799 saw the first land grants in the Rexdale area. Because 
Rexdale was so far from the main city, and had very little infrastructure, it was not a very sought-after area. Due 
to the lack of roads, it was primarily used for cultivation, which worked well as the soil was great for agriculture. 
Very little housing was established in Rexdale until post-WWII, when the demand for housing and jobs 
increased. 
Rexdale proper was established in the early 1950’s, after Rex Wesley Heslop, a local real estate developer 
purchased farmland in what is now the Rexdale area for $110,000. He quickly began building roads, sewers, 
water mains, and houses. An astute businessman, he also took the opportunity to make an important deal with 
the Etobicoke City Council. He was granted permission to establish new industry in the area at a ratio of 35% 
industrial to 65% residential, in exchange for building houses for the neighbourhood. In 1952, Heslop sold the 
Rexdale SNAP Action Plan Report 
Toronto and Region Conservation Authority    |    16
first 40 homes in Rexdale to a group of employees from the AV Roe Aircraft Company in Malton. Within a year, 
the area’s first school – Elmlea Public School—was established, followed by Rexdale Public School two years 
later. In 1956, one of the first four plazas in Toronto was built by Heslop and his team, and was home to 
Dominion and various other retail stores. This plaza stood in the Rexdale neighbourhood for close to 50 years, 
before being demolished and replaced with what is now the Rexdale Plaza Outdoor Mall. – This includes a large 
Walmart Supercentre, and will soon be neighbours with a new Costco.  
Towards the late 1990s and into the early 2000s, the rapid growth seen by Rexdale over the first half of the 
century led to increasingly high crime rates, as compared with other areas of the GTA. For years, the area lacked 
funding and adequate services to accommodate the population. As a result, the area has been notorious for its 
history with gang activity, including turf wars, guns, and drugs. With this knowledge in the media spotlight, 
Rexdale has now evolved into a neighbourhood that is supported with ample community centres, services, and 
programs all working together to serve the needs of a growing and thriving multicultural community. 
Today, Rexdale is home to almost 55,000 residents, comprised primarily of those from the Indian subcontinent 
and the Caribbean. Notable institutions and landmarks in Rexdale today include the North Campus of Humber 
College, the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, as well as the Woodbine Racetrack, Mall, and Fantasy Fair.

5.0 THE SNAP GOVERNANCE MODEL 
The Rexdale SNAP was initiated and developed using a highly collaborative approach to foster co-design and co-
ownership of the Action Plan among key stakeholders and the community. Driven by a cross-section of priorities, 
the SNAP governance model allows for the identification, exploration, and implementation of shared solutions.  
The project was guided by a Project Management Team (PMT) comprised of staff from TRCA, City of Toronto 
(Environment and Energy, Toronto Water, Parks Forestry and Recreation, Transportation Services, Social 
Development, Finance and Administration, Toronto Public Health, Toronto Indigenous Affairs Office, and the 
Emergency Preparedness Office) and the Toronto Public Library (TPL).  
The RCH and resident leaders also played an integral role in PMT, given their knowledge of local issues and close 
connections with Rexdale residents, local groups, and agencies. A Climate Resilience Working Group was also 
created to guide the development of the neighbourhood-based Climate Resilience Strategy, and to integrate it 
into the Sustainable Neighbourhood Action Plan. This group was led by TRCA and included members from the 
Resilience Office, Emergency Preparedness Office, Toronto Public Health, Social Development, Finance and 
Administration, and the RCH. Figure 2 illustrates the project management and governance structure.

6.0 THE ACTION PLAN CO-DEVELOPMENT PROCESS 
The SNAP planning process brings together community members with technical staff for the co-creation of an 
Action Plan with shared outcomes, including measurable environmental improvements and climate adaptation 
strategies, as well as community health and well-being benefits. The three-phased approach has been well 
tested and proven through previous SNAP projects.  
Phase 1 
•
Conduct technical analyses of the neighbourhood’s baseline conditions.
•
Study climate trends and associated local risks.
Phase 2 
•
Identify the community’s motivational themes.
•
Develop high-level Action Areas using guiding principles and a framework of sustainability objectives and
indicators to measure success.
•
Conduct a vulnerability assessment which includes local knowledge of climate risks, assets, and adaptive
capacity gathered through the engagement process.
Phase 3 
•
Co-develop the final Action Plan.
•
Under each Action Area, identify integrated projects and programs.
•
Conduct an impact evaluation for climate adaptation measures.
•
Identify partnerships and resources to facilitate implementation.
SNAP’s process includes on the ground, quick-start projects, implemented while the Action Plan is developed. 
These projects build the community’s excitement and are a great venue to gather input towards the Action Plan 
while starting to identify community champions for future implementation. 
In the case of Rexdale, the SNAP planning process was coordinated with RCH’s Northwest Toronto 
Neighbourhood Engagement Initiative (NTNEI), which looked at opportunities to improve indoor and outdoor 
community spaces in addition to a food mapping analysis. For this purpose, the engagement workshops were 
co-led by the RCH and TRCA, with engagement activities designed to achieve both groups’ objectives. The 
recommendations from NTNEI were incorporated into this Action Plan and vice versa.

Meaningful community and stakeholder engagement has been central to the action planning co-design process, 
and was intended to accomplish the following objectives:  
• 
Understand local top of mind themes and motivating interests.  
• 
Apply local knowledge on climate risks and assets/resources in the community.  
• 
Identify shared plan objectives, projects, and recommendations.  
• 
Invite involvement in early on-the-ground projects and build longer term relationships.  
• 
Facilitate capacity building to help support the action plan implementation.  
A selection of the engagement highlights is presented below. Workshop summaries and detailed engagement 
results are available under separate cover.  
Key Engagement Highlights 
Three multi-stakeholder workshops were designed and hosted by TRCA in collaboration with the RCH. The intent 
of these workshops was to bring the community, technical staff, and local agencies together to co-design a shared 
Sustainable Action Plan and Climate Resilience Strategy for the Rexdale neighbourhood.  
The first workshop focused on exploring the past, present, and future of Rexdale, and identifying motivating 
themes and integrated project ideas. It also explored local knowledge on climate risks and assets in the community 
and identified potential adaptation directions. The second and third workshops were designed to confirm 
emerging directions, receive input, gain alignment, and identify next steps for a number of key initiatives.  
Highlights of the social innovation engagement activities are below: 
• 
Hidden Gems of Rexdale: designed to tap into residents’ emotional connections to their community and get 
participants in a constructive, creative state of mind. Residents were asked to submit photographs of their 
favorite places and they were presented through a virtual tour with a discussion of why these spaces are 
special. 
• 
Tour Through Time: designed to get residents to consider the past. A virtual tour of historically relevant 
features and events in the neighbourhood was presented. 
• 
Resilience Discussion: designed to get participants to consider learnings from the COVID-19 pandemic, to 
prepare for future emergencies related to climate impacts. Assets and supports used during COVID-19, 
including people, places, and programs, were explored through scenarios such as flooding, power outages, 
heat waves, etc. 
• 
Imagining Streets and Community Spaces: designed to get participants to think outside the box, they were 
asked to share their feelings and experiences in outstanding spaces that they really enjoyed (or saw in a 
video) anywhere in the world. These feelings were later grounded through specific recommendations for 
specific neighbourhood streets and community spaces.

Toronto and Region Conservation Authority    |    21
•
Wishing Trees: To continue with engagement during the COVID-19 lockdowns and in order to get input
specifically from children (and other residents that did not have access to technology): “Wishing Trees” were
installed at two local agencies that remained open, and one Elementary School. Residents and students
were asked to write their dreams on cardboard ornaments and hang them on the trees. Over 600 pieces of
feedback on priorities for their neighbourhood were shared.
Virtual co-design workshops brought together technical staff with the community. 
“Wishing Trees” encouraged residents to hang their dreams for the neighbourhood.
In addition to social innovation engagement activities, 21 one-on-one meetings were held with local 
organizations and resident leaders during Phase 1, to start identifying neighbourhood priorities and to customize 
a public engagement strategy. A resilience survey was also completed by local agencies, to identify criteria and 
potential locations for resilience hubs. 
Rexdale SNAP Action Plan Report 
Toronto and Region Conservation Authority    |    22
Besides the engagement activities led by TRCA, the Action Plan and Resilience Strategy also considered 
community input gathered through NTNEI’s engagement process, which included: 
•
Community Design Event Series (4 events, 50 participants total)
•
Place-Based Neighbourhood Infrastructure Committee (8 meetings, 9 active residents)
•
Community Conversations (11 meetings, 275 participants total)
•
Email Outreach (over 350 residents)
•
Focus Groups (4 meetings with 13 participants total)
Figure 4 provides a summary of all the engagement activities that contributed to this action plan, including those 
led by TRCA and those led by the RCH through the NTNEI.  
Figure 4: Engagement Activities That Guided the Development of the Rexdale SNAP Action Plan 
Rexdale is a complex neighbourhood, and many public agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), 
and local groups are working to address priorities in this area. Figure 5 provides a list of the stakeholders 
that were engaged as part of the planning process.

7.0 LOCAL SUSTAINABILITY THEMES 
Through the technical analyses completed as part of the action planning process and based on robust staff and 
community engagement, six local sustainability themes that reflect the “flavour” of the Rexdale community and 
the vision of the Action Plan were identified (Figure 6). These themes are based on local sustainability priorities, 
community interests, and technical objectives. Each theme characterizes a specific environmental or social 
focus.  
Within each theme, a set of guiding principles and domains have been identified (see Table 2). The principles 
provide the foundation and guidance for the design of integrated projects and programs. The domains are 
categories to track success. A series of key outcomes for each of the themes and domains has been identified in 
Section 11.0, Measuring Success, to measure impact over the life of the Action Plan.  
The sustainability themes, principles and domains will inform the design of specific projects and programs that 
are carried out under this plan moving forward, with each project or program striving to integrate as many 
themes and guiding principles as possible.  
Figure 6: Local Sustainability Themes 
Rexdale SNAP Action Plan Report 
Toronto and Region Conservation Authority    |    25 
 
 
Strong Infrastructure and Community Service 
The community feels that the infrastructure in the neighbourhood, including housing, is not as well maintained, 
safe, or beautiful as in other parts of Toronto. Residents want to improve user experience through partnerships 
with government and other sectors. Climate vulnerabilities from the built environment in this neighbourhood 
should also be promptly addressed. 
Healthy Environment for Outdoor Enjoyment 
The community loves to spend time in nature and is interested in improving access and offering nature-based 
education. Habitat and urban forest should be enhanced, and erosion in the Humber Valley must be addressed. 
On-site stormwater management, through LID measures, should be implemented across the neighbourhood. 
More programming should be delivered. 
Skills and Capacity for Jobs, and Affordability 
The community expressed its struggles with the cost of living in Toronto and is interested in approaches and 
supports to achieve cost savings and enhanced opportunities for income generation. 
Community Connections, Empowerment, and Pride 
The community strongly values unity and neighbourhood relationships, and therefore wants additional support 
to enhance and celebrate community cohesion. 
Community Health and Well-Being 
Mental and physical health, and food security, are very strong priorities for the community and should be 
addressed through all Action Areas in the Action Plan. The community has strong family values that should be 
supported and celebrated. 
Spiritual Values 
Rexdale is a spiritual community. Residents often mentioned how they translate their religious values into their 
day-to-day life. The community is especially interested in expanding its current mutual aid practices and 
facilitating mind-body activities for all ages. 
Table 2 outlines the guiding principles that were co-developed with the community for each sustainability 
theme, and domains to measure the success in addressing it.

Spotlight on the Climate Emergency and Need for Net Zero Emissions 
Source: Transform TO Net Zero Strategy, Attachment C Technical Report 
Climate change is the greatest long-term global challenge that human society is facing. It is 
particularly complex because it occurs over a long timescale, has variable impacts globally and 
spatially, and requires rapid and radical changes to our energy, society, and economic systems. 
Human-induced climate change poses risks to health, economic growth, public safety, 
infrastructure, livelihoods, and the world’s biodiversity and ecosystems. As local and global GHG 
emissions increase, the Earth continues to warm at an unprecedented rate. In December 2015, 
the Paris Agreement was adopted at the COP21 by 197 countries. This legally binding 
international treaty on climate change set a goal to limit global warming to well below a 2°C, 
and preferably to a 1.5°C increase, above pre-industrial levels (page 23). 
In October 2019 the City of Toronto declared a Climate Emergency “for the purpose of naming, 
framing, and deepening our commitment to protecting our economy, our ecosystems, and our 
community from climate change.” The Climate Emergency Declaration endorsed a new target to 
achieve net zero GHG emissions before 2050, in efforts to align with limiting global average 
temperature rise to 1.5°C (page 10). By declaring a climate emergency, governments at all levels 
are signaling that the situation is dire and urgent (page 28). 
Net zero carbon emissions are reached when GHG emissions released into the atmosphere are 
reduced nearly to zero, with any remaining emissions being removed from the atmosphere. 
Steps necessary to reach net zero will include measures to decrease energy consumption, 
changes to the makeup of supply to renewable resources, increase production of renewable 
energy, and offset any remaining emissions with sequestration or renewable exports (page 25). 
By 2050, cities are expected to comprise two-thirds of the global population. The way land-use, 
urban expansion, construction, buildings, and infrastructure are designed and built will be key 
determinants for reaching net zero and adapting to climate change. According to the 
International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global GHG emissions from buildings will need to 
be 80 to 90% lower, energy use for transportation will need to be reduced by about 30%, and 
renewables will need to supply 70% to 85% of electricity. In addition, improvement of green 
urban infrastructure, the use of nature-based solutions, and effective land-use planning 
regulations and policies will be required. Cities will be key implementers of climate action 
strategies (page 30).  
The Rexdale SNAP Action Plan supports direction set out by municipal strategies regarding 
reduced GHG emissions and climate resilient, low-carbon solutions through integrated projects 
on public and private lands.  
The Action Plan recommendations will focus on mitigation and adaptation initiatives to help 
address the impacts of climate change on the neighbourhood, its buildings and infrastructure, 
as well as its natural systems.

8.0 THE REXDALE SNAP ACTION PLAN 
The Rexdale SNAP is a comprehensive action plan for neighbourhood revitalization that integrates local 
community interests and sustainability objectives, under the overarching theme of a Thriving Community 
Growing in Harmony with Nature and Neighbours. 
As illustrated in Figure 7, the Action Plan is organized around four key Action Areas. For each, a number of 
emerging signature projects and opportunities have been identified, based on technical priorities, community 
and stakeholder needs and dreams, and timing associated with previously planned capital projects or initiatives. 
These initiatives will be multi-objective and integrated and will aim to achieve the six local sustainability themes 
and guiding principles listed in Section 7.0. 
This report represents a high-level summary of the recommended initiatives, and outlines the context, locally 
inspired objectives, and recommended actions identified during the action planning process. The proposed 
projects will be scoped at a more detailed implementation planning level and will involve further engagement 
with the community and local implementation groups. A summary of all Action Plan recommendations is 
included in Appendix B.

The Rexdale community immensely values spending time outdoors and connecting with nature and takes great 
pride in living in a neighbourhood situated within the Humber River system. As a spiritual community, residents 
enjoy contemplative and mind body activities in these areas (i.e., meditation, mindfulness, and yoga) as well as 
walking, biking, and other active pursuits. Apartment dwellers have limited spaces within their homes, and 
therefore rely on open spaces as important places to socialize and connect with neighbours and friends.  
With little new development in the last few decades in Etobicoke North, limited community benefit charges 
(CBC) have been available for investment in the parks and open space system within the neighbourhood. This 
system is out of date and needs to be upgraded and revitalized to address demographic needs, improve user 
experience, and ensure equitable access. Priorities identified by the community include increased and improved 
public amenities such as meeting spaces, and more opportunities for diverse active and passive activities for all 
ages. The parks and open space system also offers a great opportunity to support access to fresh food, through 
both urban agriculture and outdoor fresh food markets. 
The parks and open space system in the neighbourhood is an important asset to enhance the neighbourhood’s 
habitat, achieve urban forestry goals, and address heat stress. Soil permeability and depth of the ground water 
table in the neighbourhood make most of these spaces ideal locations to explore LID potential for stormwater 
management, which will contribute to achieving water quality and quantity objectives in the watershed. There is 
great interest from the community in job skills training, especially for youth, and income opportunities related to 
maintaining green infrastructure systems could be worth exploring. Some examples of how this could be 
achieved include GreenForce TO, TRCA’s Conservation Youth Corps, or the Horticulture Skills Training Programs 
offered in the Black Creek SNAP neighbourhood.

TRCA has identified priority ecological restoration opportunities within the Humber Valley system, which are, 
and will continue to be addressed over the next few years. There is significant local interest in increasing the 
opportunities to enjoy nature in the Humber Valley system more broadly and implementing educational 
programming. To ensure public enjoyment, access to the Humber Valley system must be enhanced. Access 
points are scarce and hard to locate. Particular attention needs to be provided to improving access to tower 
residents. Residents also mentioned their disappointment in seeing so much garbage tangled in the vegetation 
and uncontrolled invasive plant species along the ravine. 
As a designated Canadian Heritage River, the Humber River’s history should continue to be celebrated, including 
the involvement of Indigenous groups in the development of designs and the delivery of programs.

8.1.1 Recommendations for Action Area One – Open Space Revitalization and Green 
Infrastructure 
• 
Develop and implement master plans for the revitalization of Masseygrove Park, Highfield Park and 
Rowntree Mills Park, applying the principles listed in Section 7.0, to respond to residents’ priorities, and 
modernize amenities and animate smaller parks and open spaces across the neighbourhood. 
• 
Develop and implement a neighbourhood-wide urban agriculture strategy that provides recommendations 
to expand local food production and retain rainwater, while building skills and creating community. 
• 
Develop and implement a green infrastructure plan across public and privately owned open spaces and 
front/backyards, that includes habitat, biodiversity, and urban forest enhancements as well as LID facilities 
for stormwater management. Prioritize the Terrestrial Natural Heritage System (potential plateable areas 
and contributing areas) as well as erosion, ecological restoration and LID priority areas (see Figure 8). Apply 
equity tree planting and heat stress considerations in decision-making and consider family friendliness and 
educational opportunities in the design.  
• 
Prepare parks and open spaces for the impacts of climate change and install features and amenities such as 
splash pads, drinking water fountains and shade structures to help residents cool off during extreme heat 
events (see Appendix C for specific adaptation strategies). 
• 
Develop a formal skills training program on green infrastructure implementation and maintenance, 
prioritizing youth. The program should offer income opportunities while participants learn and have a goal 
of employing residents in the future. 
• 
Continue to implement ecological restoration activities and erosion management within the Humber 
Valley system and along the hydro corridor, getting the community involved, when possible. 
• 
Improve access, trails, and wayfinding for public enjoyment of the Humber Valley and create opportunities 
to connect and learn from nature, including nature walks and clean-ups. Support and grow existing walking 
groups. 
Emerging Signature Projects 
While most open spaces in the community have room for improvement, the community expressed special 
interest in the following projects: 
• 
Revitalization of Masseygrove Park, Highfield Park and Rowntree Mills Park (Rowntree Mills Park was 
used as a case study during the engagement process to develop recommendations for park 
revitalization).  
• 
Indigenous Ceremonial Space and Outdoor Classroom at the Humber Arboretum.  
• 
Indoor and outdoor urban agriculture throughout the neighbourhood and development of a food hub 
and or affordable supermarkets. 
Rexdale SNAP Action Plan Report 
Toronto and Region Conservation Authority    |    33
•
Work with private property owners to develop Privately Owned Open Spaces (POPs) and connect these
spaces through design to the city’s parks and ravines system (see specific opportunities in section 8.3.1)
•
Develop educational opportunities, and collaborations with Indigenous groups, for the Rexdale Community
to learn about the Humber River’s natural and historical heritage.
•
Continue to work with Humber College and the City of Toronto to improve access and educational
opportunities for the local community and Indigenous groups at the Humber Arboretum. Continue to
support the development of the Indigenous Ceremonial Space and Outdoor Classroom which is currently in
the planning phase.
Supporting COVID-19 Recovery Through a Greener, Healthier Neighbourhood 
The global COVID-19 pandemic has had far reaching impacts. The need to physically distance and isolate at 
times underscores the value of local green space in helping to provide physical and mental relief and the 
importance of neighbourhood connections. The SNAP Action Plan supports neighbourhood health and 
resilience, and together with City of Toronto, and local partners, TRCA seeks to support COVID-19 recovery 
through: 
•
Supporting physical and mental health through increased opportunity for active lifestyles.
•
Increasing local high-quality greenspace and opportunities to connect with nature.
•
Providing alternative outdoor transportation options through a safe and active transportation network.
•
Increasing opportunities for improved neighbourhood connections and relationships, check-ins, extra help.
•
Increasing opportunities to grow food.

8.2 Action Area Two – Boosting Rexdale’s Sharing and Circular Economies 
Sharing and reusing resources for affordability, income, and sustainability, and to strengthen the community 
fabric towards mutual aid.  
What We Learned 
The Action Plan leverages the culture of sharing that already occurs in the community. During public 
engagement process, Rexdale residents told us that they commonly share services and resources, like food, 
translation services or car sharing to go to the supermarket. Without the use of formal platforms or programs, 
neighbourhoods share in an organic way, mostly for mutual aid, and feel proud about it. When this theme was 
explored further with the community, residents expressed their desire to both grow and formalize their sharing 
practices and circularity to enjoy further economic benefits and a stronger community fabric.  
Examples of existing circular and sharing economy programs presented to the community by the SNAP team 
were received with great interest. Residents and other local stakeholders also contributed with creative ideas 
for new “Rexdale-made” sharing and circular economy initiatives that could help address their specific needs, 
utilizing the local assets in their community. Residents enthusiastically supported the goal of making Rexdale the 
first Sharing & Circular Economy Neighbourhood in Canada. 
Improving access to food and healthy living through a sharing economy came up as a very strong theme for both 
residents and stakeholders. Ideas offered by the community ranged from space sharing for the implementation 
of food hubs (with urban agriculture, kitchens, and food banks or affordable supermarkets), to sharing cooking 
services (or food prepared at home) for those in need, to getting local restaurants to donate or sell discounted 
food that would otherwise go to waste. Many residents offered to share their services and knowledge on yoga, 
meditation, and other mind-body activities, which are broadly practiced in the community.

Left: Little sharing library in Bedford Park, Toronto 
Another important theme was space sharing for community building and resource sharing. Meeting spaces in 
the community are limited, and many residents don’t have sufficient space within their own homes to meet 
neighbours, friends, and family. Ideas that were proposed included adapting and sharing community spaces 
within the MURBs to allow residents (including those not living in the buildings) to use the space to meet and 
to exchange or circulate used items like household items, books, and clothing. Another idea was for local 
institutions and businesses to share space for community building activities/ events and resource sharing. 
Other themes that are of interest to the community include: 
•
Technology circularity or sharing, including making Wi-Fi more accessible in the community, and lending
computers and tablets.
•
Transportation sharing, including car/ride sharing and bike sharing.
•
Sharing and selling/buying used household items like tools, appliances, and books.
•
Sharing of services and knowledge, including translation services, gardening, and trades.
•
Expanding mutual aid support for those in need.
•
Improving sharing of information in the community, through social media, but also using other creative tools
for those without access to technology.
•
Sharing expensive, seasonal items that typically take a lot of space to store, such as snowblowers,
barbeques, recreational equipment.
A neighbourhood-based model to advance a sharing and circular economy will help the City of Toronto achieve 
its waste reduction and GHG goals in addition to supporting socio-economic development in NIAs.

8.2.1 Recommendations for Action Area Two – Boosting Rexdale’s Sharing and Circular 
Economies 
• 
Develop a neighbourhood-based strategy with a goal of making Rexdale Canada’s first Sharing and 
Circular Economy Neighbourhood. The strategy will address residents’ priorities and needs (for affordability 
& income, skills training, health, and improved community fabric), while helping to achieve the City of 
Toronto’s ambitious targets for waste and GHG reduction:  
o Identify existing platforms and programs that could be brought to Rexdale.  
o For new “made in Rexdale programs”, identify local assets and resources that would facilitate 
implementation. 
o Develop a road map for strategy implementation.  
 
• 
Facilitate the implementation of Sharing and Circular Economy Initiatives, prioritizing: 
o Food access and healthy living.  
o Resource sharing (for affordability, income, by renting assets, waste and GHG reduction).  
o Space sharing (e.g., for community connections, work from home, sharing of food and items, 
etc.).  
o Sharing initiatives for mutual aid and to improve the community fabric.  
Sharing in the Global Context 
The “Sharing Economy” is an economic model based on sharing, swapping, or renting products and services 
in a way that enables access over ownership. It is growing exponentially world-wide, offering great 
opportunities to achieve environmental goals, like reduction in exploitation of natural resources, as well as 
waste and GHG reduction. It also holds great promise as a generator of economic opportunity and more 
democratic and affordable access to goods and services for the people that need them the most.  
Governments around the world are investing significant resources to promote the Sharing Economy.  
However, despite its potential, there has been limited participation by low-income and marginalized 
communities. Barriers include access to technology, lack of knowledge of existing services, lack of 
transportation to share or access goods, and discrimination. Trust is a critical element in the functioning of 
the Sharing Economy, and marginalized or low-income communities are often discriminated and “left out” 
in sharing transactions due to prejuidice.  
Achieving meaningful participation by underrepresented groups requires strategies that purposely mitigate 
these barriers. A neighbourhood-based Sharing & Circular Economy Strategy customized to the needs and 
assets in the Rexdale community will achieve this goal and will offer lessons to other low income 
communities.

• 
Explore opportunities for the Rexdale community to benefit from TRCA’s Partners in Project Green (PPG) 
Material Exchange Program 
Through TRCA’s Partners in Project Green (PPG) Material Exchange Program, the Rexdale Women’s 
Centre and the S.H.I.F.T Adult Shelter received 22 bunk beds to accommodate overnight service. The 
Rexdale Women’s Centre, the Rexdale Community Health Centre and other organizations serving people 
in need also received 40 pallets of PPE. Without a circular economy program, these products would 
have ended up in landfill.  
8.3 Action Area Three – Retrofits for Sustainable Housing 
Maximizing quality of life though functional, affordable, low carbon and resilient housing.  
What We Learned 
Access to housing and housing affordability are major concerns in the Rexdale community. As well, quality of 
housing came up as an important issue through public engagement. The neighbourhood has seen very little 
redevelopment, and many of the 6,148 houses and 36 MURBs, mostly built in the 1960’s, are aging and in need 
of repairs. 
Revitalization of these buildings, with a combination of building retrofits, outdoor improvements, and 
programming, offers a great opportunity to significantly improve the quality of life of residents living in them, 
but also to achieve ambitious environmental targets, prepare for climate impacts, and develop skills and green 
jobs in the local community.  
 
 
Rexdale SNAP Action Plan Report 
Toronto and Region Conservation Authority    |    39 
 
 
The residential sector in Rexdale can play an important role in reducing GHG and supporting the City’s climate 
goals. In December of 2021, Council adopted the TransformTO Net Zero Strategy with the aim of creating a 
future Toronto that is zero-carbon, equitable, healthy, prosperous and resilient. City Council set a target of net 
zero GHG emissions community-wide by 2040 and ambitious interim targets for 2030. TransformTO specifically 
identifies the following short-term milestones for buildings by 2030, which will support the achievement of 2040 
Net Zero Goals, and which are applicable to the Rexdale neighbourhood:  
• 
100 per cent of new buildings are designed and built (or redeveloped) to be near zero GHG emissions.  
• 
GHG emissions from existing buildings will be cut in half, from 2008 levels. 
• 
At least 50 per cent of energy used comes from renewable or low-carbon sources. 
The Rexdale SNAP Action Plan supports this direction through initiatives geared to MURBs and single-family 
homes in the neighbourhood. It also provides recommendations to explore community energy solutions that 
consider all buildings and land uses as a connected system. 
The front and backyards of houses, and open spaces around MURBs, are an important asset to achieving 
sustainable stormwater management and other watershed health-related goals. As Rexdale is a high priority 
area for LID for stormwater management, there are opportunities for the implementation of green 
infrastructure – such as rain gardens – to retain and manage rainwater on site.  
Through the Harvest the Rain Residential Retrofit Program piloted in Rexdale in 2016-2018, homeowners 
showed great willingness to install rain barrels to support their vegetable gardens. Rainwater harvesting could 
also be implemented in multi-unit residential towers to support urban agriculture initiatives. 
Through the engagement process, residents expressed a desire for more pollinator gardens in the 
neighbourhood as well as flowers and greenery. Eco-landscaping would support Humber Watershed habitat 
objectives. A tree planting opportunity analysis undertaken by TRCA showed that there is space available to 
plant 3,345 trees in single family homes and 847 around muti-unit residential buildings, plus 2,292 along right of 
ways in residential areas. 
Key actions will need to be implemented in the residential sector to improve its resilience to climate impacts, 
including flood risk reduction, access to fresh food, and measures to address both heat stress and power 
outages. Residential programs should also aim at strengthening emergency preparedness.  
8.3.1 Areas of Opportunity for the Revitalization of MURBS (Public and Privately-Owned) 
The Action Plan provides direction for the holistic revitalization of privately owned MURBs, and publicly owned 
Toronto Community Housing Corporation (TCHC) buildings. Key areas of opportunity were identified by technical 
staff, local agencies, and the community, which will help to achieve the neighbourhood’s environmental and 
socio-economic goals.  
 
 
Rexdale SNAP Action Plan Report 
Toronto and Region Conservation Authority    |    40 
 
 
These key areas include: 
Improvements to general building maintenance: Key elements that need to be addressed include temperature 
issues (too hot in the summer and drafty during the winter), malfunctioning elevators, cleanliness, aesthetics, 
and pests. With Rexdale being a neighbourhood vulnerable to heat stress, it is imperative that the buildings are 
prepared for heat waves with adequate air conditioning and ventilation, as well as cooling community areas. 
Improvement in relationships between property managers and tenants: Improved communication, capacity 
building, and programming can help to improve ongoing tensions between property managers and tenants. 
While property managers feel overwhelmed by the many issues to be resolved and constant complaints, tenants 
feel that they are not being listened to, and are not getting an appropriate level of housing quality. Improved 
relationships and collaboration could go a long way in improving living conditions. 
Energy retrofits: MURBs in Rexdale have enormous potential to reduce GHG emissions, through energy 
conservation and efficiency retrofits, changes in operations of HVAC systems, electrification, and the 
implementation of renewable sources of energy. In addition, it is imperative that energy resilience is addressed 
through energy retrofits such as combined heat and power and backup power to prevent potentially serious 
power outages.  
Waste, water, and energy behaviour change: Programming and education for tenants and property managers 
could support waste management and energy and water conservation. Initiatives such as the Green Champions 
program, piloted by City of Toronto’s Tower Renewal Office, could be scaled to more buildings. This initiative, 
which trains and hires resident champions to educate their neighbours, has been successful not only in changing 
behaviours related to water, waste, and energy, but also in building community connections and ownership, and 
improving relationships with property managers, while offering income opportunities for residents. 
Improving access to food and healthy living: While food security is a complex issue which will require significant 
policy changes to be resolved, MURBs can play a role in helping to improve access to food. Key actions include 
the implementation of urban agriculture initiatives and food hubs within MURBs (for food production, 
preparation, distribution, and donation to food banks). Continued partnerships such as the Urban Harvest 
Rexdale initiative – which facilitates backyard surplus harvest donation to MURBs –should continue. 
Programming for active living, improved nutrition, and food production and preparation should be offered on 
site.  
Meeting spaces and climate resilience hubs: One of the main issues that came up during the public engagement 
process was the lack of spaces for residents to meet with friends and neighbours. MURBs offer an opportunity to 
generate fantastic indoor and outdoor community spaces. These spaces would not only play a fundamental role 
in mental health and community building but could also be designed as climate resilience hubs (i.e., as cooling 
centres to respond to heat waves, communication/ meeting hubs during power outages and storms, etc.). These 
spaces could also be used to facilitate sharing and circular economies, enabling residents to share household 
items, toys, and small appliances. 
Rexdale SNAP Action Plan Report 
Toronto and Region Conservation Authority    |    41 
 
 
Outdoor improvements: Many of the buildings in Rexdale have underutilized open spaces that, if revitalized, 
could have a significant impact on both the environment and community life. Tenants support the idea of more 
trees, pollinator gardens, and greenery that have an aesthetic role element. Outdoor spaces, with the 
appropriate community amenities, will play an important role in facilitating active living, contact with nature, 
education, and the development of community connections. Additionally, actions should be implemented to 
improve the connection between MURBs and their residents, and adjacent ravines. These include improving 
physical access through gates and trail entrances, nature-based programming, and the removal of invasive 
species and garbage to improve the visitor experience. Finally, outdoor areas can be retrofitted with shade and 
water fountains to help residents keep cool during extreme heat events. 
Skills training and income opportunities: To support resident priorities, any initiative offered at the MURBs 
should aim at including skills training and income opportunities for residents. For example, for outdoor 
revitalization, residents could be trained in horticulture or urban agriculture, and could be hired to help maintain 
the outdoor areas. For energy retrofits, partnerships could be developed with groups such as Buildingup & 
Toronto Community Benefits Network’s NexGen Builders Mentoring Program, to recruit, train, and hire 
marginalized or underrepresented youth. 
Sustainable and active transportation: To support sustainable and active transportation, buildings should offer 
infrastructure to park and store bicycles and to connect to trails and sidewalks. Car and/or bike sharing options 
as well as EV charging stations should also be explored. 
Increased access to quality affordable housing: While improving access to quality affordable housing is beyond 
the scope of this Action Plan, it should be highlighted that it was one of the strongest themes that came out of 
the engagement process. It is imperative that various levels of government continue working together to 
develop policy that addresses the housing crisis. 
Multi-sector collaboration and partnerships will be required to achieve the holistic revitalization of MURBs, as 
described above. Funding will not only need to come from diverse sources, but also various experts and key 
organizations will need to work together. A backbone organization will be required to coordinate the various 
partners. The San Romanoway Towers Revival Project, led by TRCA through SNAP, is a great example of 
innovative funding and multi-sector collaboration. The privately-owned tower complex was revitalized using 
funding from private foundations. For its implementation, TRCA, as the backbone organization, partnered with 
the City of Toronto, the property owners, and various environmental, food and social-based NGOs and 
businesses to make the project happen. 
More recently, the Rexdale SNAP’s Growing Healthy Towers initiative brought together stakeholders from the 
public, private, not for profit, and academic sectors to develop solutions to address social determinants of 
health for residents living in multi-unit residential towers, through multi-sectoral partnerships.

objectives.  Right: San Romanoway Revival Project 
8.3.2 Areas of Opportunity to Advance Home Retrofits 
Efforts to address GHG emissions from the single-family residential sector are critical given that 31% of the City’s 
GHG emissions from buildings are generated by the 422,000 single family homes across Toronto. To achieve the 
City’s Net Zero Goals by 2040, approximately 385 houses will need to be fully retrofitted in the Rexdale 
neighbourhood per year. 
Despite Toronto’s aggressive targets and financing supports to achieve net zero, basement flooding prevention, 
urban forest cover, and watershed objectives, the existing government incentives and supports will not be 
enough to achieve these goals. Further work is needed to address homeowners’ barriers to implement required 
actions. 
The Harvest the Rain Residential Retrofit Program Pilot, implemented in 2016-2018 in Rexdale, proved to be an 
effective approach to achieve sustainable and climate resilience action in Rexdale’s single family homes. An 
internal program evaluation undertaken by TRCA showed that the program was significantly more cost-effective 
than other similar programs in North America.  
The program was successful in: 
• 
Increasing home actions towards energy conservation and efficiency, flood risk prevention, urban forest 
enhancement, stormwater management, water conservation, waste reduction, and food security. 
• 
Increasing uptake of government incentive programs (compared to other similar neighbourhoods). 
• 
Achieving other socio-economic benefits, such as community connections, education, volunteerism, and 
financial co-benefits. 
Rexdale SNAP Action Plan Report 
Toronto and Region Conservation Authority    |    43 
 
 
In addition, 90% of participating homeowners said they were “very satisfied” with the program. While the 
Rexdale Action Plan recommends continued application of similar elements of SNAP’s Home Retrofit Program 
Model used in Harvest the Rain (see Figure 9), additional resources will have to be invested to achieve the 
neighbourhood’s ambitious targets. These targets respond to recent City of Toronto (TransformTO) strategies, 
and the Humber Watershed Plan.

SNAP’s home retrofit programs across 10 neighbourhoods in TRCA’s jurisdiction have helped homeowners 
implement a diverse actions to address stormwater management, basement flood prevention, energy, urban 
forest enhancement, urban agriculture and habitat. (Left) Low Impact Development for Stormwater 
Management, as part of the Lake Wilcox SNAP Home Retrofit Program. (Right) A Do it Yourself energy party 
hosted in the County Court SNAP. 
In order to achieve these deeper retrofits, the following barriers will need to be addressed:  
Financial Obstacles – Deep retrofits represent a significant investment, especially for seniors with fixed income 
and lower income homeowners. Existing financing programs and incentives from the government and utilities 
are not sufficient to make the business case to most homeowners in Rexdale. With the cost of living in Toronto, 
in relation to basic salaries, Rexdale residents do not have sufficient disposable income to invest in their homes 
to respond to environmental considerations.  
Many homeowners in Rexdale’s demographic also have difficulty getting required approvals from the banks to 
access loans through the Toronto’s Home Energy Loan Program (HELP) program.  
Homeowners in Rexdale are less likely to participate in low-income incentive programs due to lack of knowledge 
about, or trust in, the programs. In addition, the prevalence of multi-generational families is a barrier to 
participation, as having multiple breadwinners disqualifies households. Better financial incentives that make the 
business case to homeowners will be needed in Rexdale in order to achieve the desired neighbourhood and City 
goals. 
Process Complexity – The process of undertaking a home retrofit to 1) significantly reduce GHGs, 2) implement 
eco-landscaping, and 3) floodproof and manage stormwater sustainably, is extremely complicated. While the 
Harvest the Rain Program was able to offer homeowners support throughout the decision-making phase, 
implementation of simple retrofits, and to access government incentives, significantly more support is required 
to achieve deeper, more ambitious retrofits like those listed above. Additional supports required by Rexdale 
homeowners include: 
Rexdale SNAP Action Plan Report 
Toronto and Region Conservation Authority    |    45 
 
 
• 
More expert knowledge and support in deciding details of desired deep retrofit (e.g., what type of air source 
heat pump or backwater valve, size of a raingarden, etc.) 
• 
Selection and management of contractors throughout the process 
• 
Prioritization and coordination of various retrofit needs  
The ideal approach would be similar to Ontario’s Energy Affordability Program (Save on Energy) or Enbridge’s 
Winterproofing program for low-income residents but with a reasonable cost to the homeowner with a short 
payback period. Homeowners would sign up with a trusted agency to get everything done for them and pay a 
fee with the energy or tax bill, equal, or below the energy savings.  
Lack of Capacity in the Industry – A third challenge for implementing deep home retrofits identified by 
homeowners in Rexdale and other neighbourhoods across Toronto and Canada, is lack of capacity of 
contractors. Very few contractors have the knowledge to offer holistic advice for sustainable home energy 
management. For example, furnace or air conditioner installers don’t necessarily know about air source heat 
pumps or renewable options or maybe more comfortable selling business as usual products. In terms of other 
actions, like the implementation of LID solutions for stormwater management or the development of habitat, 
there are very few knowledgeable landscape contractors, and the supply of native beneficial plants is very 
limited in local, easily accessible nurseries. Also, landscaping contractors prefer to push hardscaping retrofits, as 
opposed to plantings or softscaping, as these generate less profit. 
Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Opportunities – The Rexdale community is comprised of many homeowners that are DIYers. 
They enjoy implementing retrofits by themselves and do it for affordability reasons. In 2016-2018, DIY parties 
were successfully hosted by TRCA in the community, where a contractor came to a neighbourhood home to 
teach the homeowners how to implement weather stripping and other energy saving measures. The Action Plan 
recommends that an upgraded home retrofit program design considers support for DIYers, designed specifically 
for the Rexdale’s demographic and building stock needs. DIY support should not only be for energy actions but 
should also include other simple actions to achieve the neighbourhood’s sustainability goals. 
Accelerating Program Uptake – While the Harvest the Rain Program was very well received in the Rexdale 
community (93% were very satisfied with the program), and program uptake was excellent compared to similar 
programs, significantly more staff and marketing resources will need to be invested to achieve the 2040 Net 
Zero goals established by the City of Toronto. The program was only offered on a seasonal basis by part-time 
staff and was cross promoted through other neighbourhood events and programs, with minimum marketing and 
communication materials.  
Skills and Jobs for Underrepresented Groups – To respond to overall neighbourhood priorities highlighted 
during the Action Plan public engagement process, a new generation of the Harvest the Rain Program should 
include a component of skills training and jobs for underrepresented groups, ideally from within the 
neighbourhood.

8.3.3 Other Opportunities to Reduce GHG Emissions from Buildings 
District Energy 
District Energy is an approach for local energy production matched to local use, not only at a building level, but 
at a neighbourhood level. It is an approach to applying technologies that coordinate the production and supply 
of heating, cooling, domestic hot water, and power to optimize energy efficiency and local resource use. District 
Energy systems have been widely implemented in existing urban areas in Europe and are starting to be piloted 
in Canada, mostly in new development and redevelopment scenarios. From a technical perspective, climate-
resilient and low-carbon district energy systems have shown to be one of the most efficient solutions in reducing 
emissions and primary energy demand.  
In looking at the built environment in the Rexdale neighbourhood, there could be opportunities for geothermal 
energy generation under the neighbourhood open spaces. This energy could be shared to satisfy the demand in 
the neighbourhood’s MURBs, institutions and even homes. There are also a number of arenas as well as a No 
Frills supermarket that generate significant thermal energy waste which could be utilized. 
While the cost to society of implementing a district energy system to get the neighbourhood to net zero could 
be lower than the added cost of retrofitting all buildings (including the cost to the owner, plus government 
incentives and costs), the logistics of implementing the system in an existing urbanized area are complicated. 
Some of the tasks that would need to be addressed include recruiting property owners to switch to the new 
system, reconstructing streets and parks to install piping and other transmission infrastructure, updating 
legislation, negotiating financing models, and developing an entity to operate the system. Through exploratory 
discussions with the City of Toronto, energy utilities, and other experts in the field, it was understood that based 
An Upgraded Harvest the Rain Residential Retrofit Program 
Most of the actions implemented through the Harvest the Rain Program were simple actions such as 
insulation, weather proofing and window replacement, installation of rain barrels, grading, and crack 
sealing to reduce flooding, planting of fruit and shade trees, and surplus harvest donation. To address 
Toronto’s aggressive climate and urban forest targets and the Humber River Watershed goals, deeper 
retrofits will need to be implemented in neighbourhood homes. Some of the more ambitious actions that 
should be implemented at scale (in addition to the simpler ones) include: 
•
Air-source heat pumps
•
Renewable energy
•
EV chargers
•
LIDs such as rain gardens and pollinator gardens
•
Backwater valves
•
Circular and sharing economy programs
•
Power back-up solutions and other emergency preparedness measures

on the current landscape, it could take decades to get a district energy system up and running in an existing 
neighbourhood.  
However, Rexdale offers some opportunities that should be considered. It has high-density clusters of buildings, 
adjacent to public parks and privately owned open space. Many of these buildings have underutilized 
underground garages that could be used for the installation of required equipment. In addition, various 
neighbourhood streets have plans for reconstruction within the next 20 years. The Canadian District Energy 
Association (CDEA) estimates that 60% of the costs of implementing a community-scale geothermal system in an 
existing urban area are related to reconstructing streets to accommodate new infrastructure. It recommends 
that district energy systems are timed with planned road reconstruction projects.  
Energy Storage 
Neighbourhoods like Rexdale can play a role in energy storage which will be a necessary component to achieve 
the feasibility of system decarbonization with renewables. The CDEA has suggested that all types of buildings in 
neighbourhoods, including MURBs (e.g., in underutilized underground garages) and single-family homes, could 
offer opportunities for energy storage. 
8.3.4 Recommendations for Action Area Three – Retrofits for Sustainable Housing 
• 
Identify funding opportunities and advance multi-sector collaboration for the holistic revitalization of 
MURBs that achieve environmental objectives, climate resilience, and address social determinants of health, 
including the elements listed above. 
• 
Design and implement the next generation of the Harvest the Rain Residential Retrofit Program to achieve 
multiple environmental and climate resilience goals to accelerate both simple and deep retrofits in the 
neighbourhood homes. 
• 
Explore opportunities and partnerships to train and hire equity-deserving and underrepresented groups, 
ideally from within the neighbourhood, to advance indoor and outdoor residential retrofits across all 
sustainability themes both in single family homes and MURBs. 
• 
Deliver programming to help homeowners, tenants, and property managers prepare for the impacts of 
climate change (see specific strategies in Appendix C). 
• 
Consider the feasibility of district energy in the Rexdale neighbourhood towards the achievement of the 
City of Toronto’s Net Zero goals. In the meanwhile, the installation of air source heat pumps in single family 
homes will prepare homeowners for an easier connection to a future district energy system. 
• 
In the longer term, consider the role of the neighbourhood to achieve energy storage as a means of 
transitioning to net zero. Energy storage should be considered in the MURBs, institutional properties as well 
as neighbourhood homes.

Toronto and Region Conservation Authority    |    48 
 
 
8.3.5 System-Change Recommendations 
While the scope of this report is focused on actions within the Rexdale neighbourhood, the following system-
level recommendations were confirmed during the planning process and are fundamental to achieve 
sustainability goals in this neighbourhood and others in Toronto: 
• 
Better and more convenient financial supports will be necessary. This includes: 
o Increasing the number of available financial supports for home retrofits.  
o Covering the cost of hand-holding services to facilitate home retrofits.  
o Making the process of obtaining financial supports easier to navigate.  
o Offering financing options and incentives for a bundle of retrofits supporting both mitigation 
and adaptation.  
• 
More government regulations (from all levels of government) will be required. For example, the creation 
of a low carbon building code and requirements for on-site stormwater management for existing buildings. 
• 
Increased industry capacity/ specialized expertise, including energy auditors, landscape professionals, and 
contractors needs to be developed. Material supply issues will need to be addressed.  
• 
A streamlined process to undertake feasibility analyses, and the implementation and operation of district 
energy and energy storage systems needs to be developed to ensure faster and more efficient adoption. 
8.4 Action Area Four – Transformation of Streets and Intersections 
Developing vibrant community life through green, safe, and attractive streetscapes.  
What We Learned 
The Rexdale neighbourhood is crossed by Kipling Avenue and other busy streets and intersections, with heavy 
traffic and scarce greenery. Although residents acknowledge that services, businesses, and parks are generally 
located within walking distance from many residential areas in the neighbourhood, the noise, poor air quality, 
inadequate streetscapes, occasional crime, and speeding all significantly impact the pedestrian experience. This 
also applies to those taking transit or biking. Community members also highlighted the need for more bike lanes 
and better active transportation connections across the neighbourhood, particularly to the new LRT.  
There are several street resurfacing capital projects planned for Rexdale in the next 3-10 years, offering a great 
opportunity to implement green streets with active transportation infrastructure, which would help achieve 
environmental objectives including GHG emissions reduction increased habitat, and improved air and 
stormwater quality. Green streets should support urban habitat and biodiversity through pollinator gardens and 
tree planting, and should also consider incorporating LID. 
Following the community’s recommendations, the Action Plan also recommends beautification of streetscapes 
with greenery and flowers that stimulate the senses (for example, residents suggested adding aromatic and 
Rexdale SNAP Action Plan Report 
Toronto and Region Conservation Authority    |    49 
 
 
colourful plants), as well as enhanced litter removal. They would also like to see animation of the main streets to 
make them more vibrant, with street festivals, parades, and diverse art forms. In addition, the community would 
like to see more pedestrian crossings and speed bumps in strategic locations, to improve pedestrian safety. 
The recommended streetscape improvements, combined with a need for jobs and a love of nature by the 
community, offer a great opportunity to bring the City of Toronto’s GreenforceTO Program to the Rexdale 
Neighbourhood. The program offers skills training and income opportunities for residents to maintain 
greenspaces/greenery adjacent to streets within their communities. Through initial meetings, Humber College 
and TRCA’s Education and Training Division showed interest in playing a role in the skills training component. 
The Transportation Services Division also considered Rexdale as a good fit for the program, pending available 
resources.

8.4.1 Recommendations for Action Area Four – Transformation of Streets and Intersections 
• 
Advance Green Streets across the neighbourhood, based on opportunity (i.e., timing of capital works) and 
technical feasibility. Green Streets should aim to achieve sustainable stormwater management, urban 
forest, habitat, active transportation, and beautification objectives. 
• 
Develop and implement plans for the transformation of main intersections that achieve watershed goals 
and improve the pedestrian experience and community life (including safety from traffic and crime, 
beautification, meeting spaces, and art), following the guiding principles provided in Section 7.0.  
• 
The following main intersections should be prioritized: 
o Kipling Avenue and Mount Olive Drive/Panorama Court 
o Kipling Avenue and Finch Avenue 
o Kipling Avenue and John Garland Boulevard 
o Midblock crossing on Kipling Avenue, North of Stevenson Road (between Thistletown Baptist 
Church and St. Andrew Catholic School) 
• 
Prepare roads right of way for the impacts of climate change, by increasing the diversity of trees, reducing 
flood risk by redirecting water runoff away from sewers and into more pervious surfaces, and implementing 
bus shelters designed for year-round weather protection. 
• 
Deliver street festivals and programming to animate main intersections, prioritizing those listed above. 
• 
Improve cleanliness of main intersections, considering programming and income opportunities for the 
community to contribute towards this objective. 
• 
Enhance urban forest and habitat, and environmental educational signage on road right of ways, 
prioritizing areas of heat stress.  
• 
Consider delivering the GreenforceTO program in Rexdale, in collaboration with TRCA and local 
organizations.

9.0 CLIMATE VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT AND RESILIENCE 
STRATEGY 
A “High-Level Climate Resilience Strategy for Rexdale” was developed in parallel with the Sustainability Action 
Plan. The resilience strategy has been published under a separate report, and key climate adaptation 
recommendations have been incorporated into the four Action Areas of the Rexdale SNAP Action Plan. This 
section provides a summary of the “High-Level Climate Resilience Strategy for Rexdale”. 
9.1 Climate Trends 
This section presents a summary of climate trends under a high-emissions climate change scenario in which 
global GHG emissions continue to rise past the middle of the century, leading to approximately 3.2 to 5.4°C of 
global warming compared to 1986-2005 by the end of the century (Government of Canada, 2018). 
•
Under a high emissions scenario, air temperature in Toronto is expected to increase in all seasons and on
average across the year. Average annual air temperature in Toronto could warm by 5˚C by the end of the
century compared to the recent historical period (1971-2000). Warmer average temperatures are expected
across all seasons by the end of the century, bringing hotter summers, warmer winters, and greater
variability in temperatures. Warmer winter temperatures can lead to more precipitation falling as rain
instead of snow, which can lead to an increased risk of flooding during winter, as well as impacts on natural
systems and wildlife. Warmer temperatures can also increase the frequency, intensity, and severity of
storms as warmer air can hold more moisture to produce storms.
•
Projections also indicate an increase in the average number of extreme heat days in a year. By mid-century,
the average number of days in a year with maximum temperatures above 30°C in Toronto is anticipated to
increase by 31 days (from 6.9 days in the recent past to 37.5 days by the 2050s), which can pose significant
risks to human health. By the end of the century, the number of very hot days is expected to increase even
more to 65.3 days in a year, representing an eight-fold increase compared to 1971-2000.
•
As temperatures warm, the number of extreme cold days are expected to decrease. The average number
of days in a year with minimum temperatures below -15°C in Toronto could approach zero by the end of the
century compared to 1971-2000. As winters are expected to get warmer, the city will likely see less snow
and ice cover, which can impact traditional outdoor winter recreation as well as natural systems. This
decline also means that there will be fewer extreme cold days per year that put people at risk of extreme
cold-related illnesses such as hypothermia. However, wider variations in day-to-day temperatures may
provide less time for people to acclimatize or adapt to colder conditions when they do occur.
The “High-Level Climate Resilience Strategy for Rexdale” represents a key step towards the 
implementation of Priority Action 2.1 in the Toronto Resilience Strategy:  
“Enhance the capacity of neighbourhoods to prepare for and recover from shocks through grassroots 
action and network building”. 
Rexdale SNAP Action Plan Report 
Toronto and Region Conservation Authority    |    52
•
Precipitation is expected to increase on an annual basis in Toronto. Average annual total precipitation
could increase by 10 percent by the end of the century compared to the recent past under a high emissions
scenario. A high degree of variability is also found among projected seasonal total precipitation. Spring and
winter precipitation are expected to see the greatest percentage increase by the end of the century (by 24
percent and 26 percent, respectively). Such increases, coupled with warmer temperatures, can increase the
risk of flooding as more precipitation falls as rain instead of snow. On average, a slight decrease in summer
precipitation is anticipated, making hotter and drier summers possible. Extreme precipitation events are
also anticipated to increase, with increases in maximum 1-day, 3-day, and 5-day precipitation totals.
9.2 Vulnerability Assessment 
A vulnerability assessment conducted for the neighbourhood provided insight into the level of specific 
community risks posed by climate change, identified existing vulnerabilities within the neighbourhood, 
incorporated local knowledge on risks and assets, and was used to inform resilience strategies. 
The climate change vulnerability assessment recognizes climate change risk as a confluence of multiple factors 
including hazard, exposure, vulnerability, and adaptive capacity. 
Exposure refers to the degree to which a system is experiencing changing climate conditions and related 
impacts, such as flooding and the spread of vector-borne diseases. 
Sensitivity refers to the degree to which a system is affected by climate change which is influenced by factors, 
such as demographics, neighbourhood socio-economic characteristics, and perceptions of climate change risks. 
Adaptive Capacity refers to the ability to anticipate, cope with, respond to, and recover from the effects of 
climate change. 
Table 3 presents a breakdown of the vulnerability assessment results for Rexdale. A qualitative rating ranging 
from High to Low has been assessed for each indicator. For exposure and sensitivity, a high rating representing 
high exposure and high sensitivity is least desirable, while a low rating is most desirable. The opposite is true for 
adaptive capacity, where a high rating representing high adaptive capacity is most desirable, while a low rating is 
least desirable. In Table 3, the least desirable ratings are represented in darker shades of colour compared to 
more desirable ratings.

Key Vulnerabilities 
• 
Increases in heat stress: Many parts of the neighbourhood already experience high summer surface 
temperatures with surface temperatures recorded on a typical summer day in 2014 ranging from 27˚C to a 
high of 49˚C (some prominent “surface heat areas” include Albion Mall, Humbergrove Secondary School, 
Father Henry Carr Catholic School, and Humber College). Issues identified by the community included lack of 
shade/shelters for refuge along Kipling Avenue, lack of trees on HWY-27A, and apartments along Kipling 
Avenue lacking air conditioning. This urban heat island effect can exacerbate extreme heat events, which are 
anticipated to increase due to climate change. Extreme heat, which affects some people more than others 
(including seniors, children, and people with pre-existing conditions), is a key risk for Rexdale because it has 
a higher proportion of children (14 years and under) compared to the rest of the city.  
 
 
Rexdale SNAP Action Plan Report 
Toronto and Region Conservation Authority    |    54 
 
 
• 
Risk of flooding: The top climate risk perceived by residents within the neighbourhood is flooding. Based on 
available building footprint data, 58 buildings within Rexdale are located fully or partially within the flood 
plain, which are at greater risk of riverine flooding. Notably, two clusters of residential properties situated 
north of Stevenson Road and along Anabelle Drive may be particularly impacted and may present 
opportunities for flood risk outreach. Residents and stakeholders also reported past flooding issues in some 
areas that appear to be infrastructure related. These include flooding in houses on Kipling Avenue and 
Steeles Avenue, due in part to cracks and leaks, basement flooding on Stevenson Road and Seguin Court, 
and flooding events in several MURBs, including the community room at 2667 Kipling Avenue. These 
flooding events can be exacerbated by anticipated increases in precipitation.  
• 
Food security: Food security was identified as a major issue throughout community engagement. While 
Rexdale’s vulnerability assessment only assessed one aspect of food security (location of food outlets), it 
draws upon findings from a recent study by Another Axis Consulting (2022). It is clear that food security has 
been a long-standing issue in the community, which was exacerbated by COVID-19 in unprecedented ways 
(e.g., increased demand on food banks and rising unaffordability).  
• 
Housing: Most of the housing stock in the neighbourhood was constructed before 1980 and unlike the rest 
of the city, only a small proportion of housing was constructed after 2000. The majority of households are 
comprised of apartments. Household sizes also tend to be larger in Rexdale, which may suggest a greater 
risk of overcrowded and unsuitable housing. During the engagement process, community members 
highlighted housing affordability as one of the main issues in Rexdale, with many residents struggling to pay 
rent. 
• 
Access to transit: For people without access to a car, active transportation (e.g., walking and cycling) and 
access to public transit are important, especially during an event or disaster. Based on research by Farber 
and Allen (2019), transit accessibility is low in this northwest corner of the city. Residents highlighted that 
public transit is infrequent and that the routes are inconvenient.  
• 
Language barriers: While most residents are knowledgeable of either English or French, some Rexdale 
residents (approximately 7 percent) have no knowledge of English or French, which is higher than the rest of 
the city. To ensure that communications can be understood by all residents, it is important to develop 
translated products or communications that can be understood with few or no words.

9.3 Adaptation and Resilience Strategies 
The Disaster Management Cycle (see Figure 11) was used as a framework to guide the development of climate 
adaptation and resilience strategies, as it is action-oriented and represents a continuous cycle. This framework 
also aligns well with resilience thinking. At some point in time, sudden or chronic changes can lead to disruption 
in the community’s day-to-day lives. By looking at the full spectrum of actions over time, from prevention to 
response and recovery, this framework can help community stakeholders plan for disruption.  
A total of 32 strategies were identified across the five phases of the Disaster Management Cycle, based on 
technical analysis and public engagement. Each strategy was evaluated, based on 1) its impact addressing one or 
more climate impacts, and 2) the level of effort required to implement it. A potential implementation lead was 
also identified for each strategy. Key strategies were integrated into the four Action Areas of the Action Plan. A 
complete list of the 32 strategies is included in Appendix C.

9.4 Adaptation Opportunities 
Following is a summary of key opportunities for climate adaptation that were identified in Rexdale’s 
Neighbourhood Resilience Strategy. Many of these opportunities also address other sustainability goals, like 
GHG reduction. 
• 
Tower revitalization: most of the housing stock in Rexdale is comprised of apartments (61% of the housing 
stock) and most were constructed before 1980. Many have outdated, vulnerable energy systems, poor 
ventilation and air conditioning, drainage/ flooding issues and lack of spaces to meet. 
• 
Public transit accessibility and active transportation: currently, most people within the neighbourhood 
commute by car. Overall, transit accessibility is low in this northwest corner of the city, though some 
improvements are being made (e.g., Finch West LRT). There is a lack of cycling infrastructure in the 
neighbourhood, particularly in the East-West direction 
• 
Enhanced knowledge and awareness of climate change-related risks such as flooding, risks related to 
extreme heat, vector-borne diseases, and winter storms, while building on the lessons learned through the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 
A resilient Rexdale is a neighbourhood that can weather all odds, recover quickly, and thrive in the 
face of adversity. It is a neighbourhood where people look out for and support one another in the 
most difficult times; where residents’ needs are met; and where there is a strong sense of 
community and a tight-knit web of agencies, organizations, and groups working together to make 
Rexdale an even better place to live. 
Rexdale SNAP Action Plan Report 
Toronto and Region Conservation Authority    |    58 
 
 
• 
Flood risk reduction by encouraging site-level flood prevention and stormwater management measures, 
regularly inspecting SWM infrastructure, and relocating structures from the flood plain (where possible). 
• 
Tree canopy cover and access to greenspace, especially in the northern part of the neighbourhood and 
areas with heat stress. Improvements can also be made to improve pedestrian experience and wayfinding. 
• 
Sense of community, mutual aid, and the sharing economy by creating more opportunities for residents to 
meet one another and maintaining and strengthening the mutual support and sharing already in place. 
• 
Food access by growing and preserving food locally and increasing affordable (or free) food outlets. 
• 
Development of a resilience hub where residents can go for shelter and basic needs during an emergency, 
and on an ongoing basis during normal periods for increased community resilience.  
 
Source of graph: NPU-W’s blog post (2020) on Fulton County Community Resilience Hub 
 
Resilience Hub 
One of the strategies that received the most support from the City of Toronto as well as local stakeholders is 
the development of a Resilience/Food Hub where residents could go for shelter and basic needs in case of 
an emergency, but that also operates on an ongoing basis improving community resilience by: 
• 
Providing access to urban agriculture and affordable (or free) healthy food 
• 
Offering gathering spaces for residents and local agencies and organizations 
• 
Delivering community building, skills training, and climate programming 
Through the engagement process, potential suitable locations were identified, and key elements of the 
resilience hub were explored.

10.0 QUICK START PROJECTS 
Several quick-start projects were implemented during the Action Plan development phase to generate trust and 
enthusiasm from the community and to achieve further engagement for plan development. These projects 
include: 
COVID-19 Memorial Garden: Rexdale was one of the hardest hit communities by the COVID-19 pandemic, which 
was at its peak as this action plan was being developed. Responding to a dream expressed by the community 
during the engagement process, a COVID-19 Memorial Garden was implemented in Rowntree Mills Park, to 
remember the victims of the pandemic and commemorate the front-line workers and community leaders that 
stood up to support the Rexdale community. The garden includes pollinator friendly plants and native trees, a 
seating area and an interpretive sign. The background of the sign profiles a photograph of a mural created by a 
local artist.

11.0 MEASURING SUCCESS 
The Rexdale SNAP has been designed to address core environmental and socio-economic priorities, which 
support numerous municipal and TRCA plans and strategies. To measure impact and success over time, a 
framework of long-term neighbourhood-scale target outcomes has been identified based on the Action Plan’s 
shared objectives. These are outlined in Table 4 below are defined as observed changes anticipated over the 
long term (by 2040). Quantitative targets were included, when data or directions from higher level strategies 
were available. When not, qualitative or directional outcomes/ goals were established.

In support of the long-term target outcomes identified above, additional indicators can be used to track shorter-
term progress that moves the yardstick toward a desired outcome. These are referred to as ‘outputs’ and 
represent direct results of project or program activities. Achievement of these outputs should also be celebrated 
as a step in the right direction.  
Table 5 illustrates a selection of example measurable output indicators for each of the action areas, as well as a 
summary of the sustainability themes they collectively support.  
A Performance Monitoring Plan will be developed as projects and programs are designed, to confirm specific 
monitoring and evaluation strategies for the outputs and outcomes identified.

12.0 NEXT STEPS 
This shared Rexdale SNAP Action Plan was co-developed with a focus on collaborative implementation. Next 
steps include: 
• 
Establish Implementation Team – The Project Management Team will transition to an Implementation 
Team led by TRCA, in collaboration with City of Toronto, RCH and other stakeholders as appropriate. The 
team will identify priority projects and programs of focus and develop implementation plans. 
Implementation plans will include process, leads, roles and responsibilities, required approvals, funding 
requirements and opportunities, timing, phasing, etc. The Implementation Team will also consider a 
performance monitoring plan for each project/program that responds to neighbourhood goals and will 
maximize opportunities for cross-promotion of SNAP and stakeholder initiatives.  
• 
Advancement of Priority Projects – Advance partnership brokerage and identification of resources for the 
following projects which were identified through the planning process as a priority: 
o Development and implementation of master plans for the revitalization of Masseygrove Park, 
Highfield Park and Rowntree Mills Park.  
o Development and implementation of neighbourhood-wide urban agriculture and green 
infrastructure strategies.  
o Development and implementation of a neighbourhood-based circular and sharing economy 
strategy. 
o Design and implementation of projects and programs towards sustainable, resilient housing (for 
multi-unit residential and single-family homes) and exploration of community energy solutions. 
o Design and implementation of resilience and food hub(s) and a social supermarket. 
o Design and implementation of community meeting spaces across the neighbourhood. 
o Green Streets and transformation of the following intersections along Kipling: Mount Olive 
Drive/ Panorama Court, Finch Avenue, John Garland Boulevard. 
o Design and implementation of climate adaptation/ resilience programming for residents and 
other community members. 
• 
Support Existing Neighbourhood Initiatives – TRCA and the City of Toronto will work with the RCH to 
support existing neighbourhood initiatives in order to achieve Action Plan goals.  
• 
Seek Funding Opportunities in Support of Community-Based Projects – Where possible, the City and TRCA 
will identify internal resources and program alignments that could help support advancement of 
neighbourhood objectives. These agencies will also support the community to pursue external funding, 
opportunities that leverage public funding, and to help augment available resources for implementation.

Develop and implement master 
plans for the revitalization of 
Masseygrove Park, Highfield Park 
and Rowntree Mills Park, and 
modernize amenities and animate 
smaller parks and open spaces 
across the neighbourhood 
applying the principles listed in 
section 7.0. 
Develop a neighbourhood-
based strategy with a goal of 
making Rexdale Canada’s 
first Sharing & Circular 
Economy Neighbourhood by 
identifying existing platforms 
and programs that could be 
brought to Rexdale, 
identifying local assets and 
resources that would 
facilitate implementation, 
and developing a road map 
for strategy implementation.  
Identify funding opportunities 
and advance multi-sector 
collaboration for the wholistic 
revitalization of multi-unit 
residential towers that achieve 
environmental objectives, 
climate resilience and address 
social determinants of health, 
including the elements listed 
above. 
Advance Green Streets across 
the neighbourhood, based on 
opportunity (e.g., timing of 
capital works) and technical 
feasibility. Green Streets should 
aim to achieve sustainable 
stormwater management, 
urban forest and habitat, active 
transportation, and 
beautification objectives. 
Opportunity for tower 
revitalization given that most of 
the housing stock in Rexdale is 
comprised of apartments (61 
percent of the housing stock) 
and most were constructed 
before 1980. 
Develop and implement a 
neighbourhood-wide urban 
agriculture strategy that provides 
recommendations to expand local 
food production and retain 
rainwater, while building skills and 
community. 
Facilitate the 
implementation of Sharing 
and Circular Economy 
Initiatives, prioritizing food 
access and healthy living, 
resource sharing (for 
affordability, income and 
waste/ GHG reduction), 
space sharing (e.g., for 
community connections, 
work from home, sharing of 
food and items, etc.), and 
sharing initiatives for mutual 
aid and to improve the 
community fabric. 
Design and implement the next 
generation of the Harvest the 
Rain Residential Retrofit 
Program, to achieve multiple 
environmental and climate 
resilience goals, considering the 
factors listed above, to 
accelerate simple and deep 
retrofits in the neighbourhood 
homes. 
Develop and implement plans 
for the transformation of main 
intersections that achieve 
watershed goals and improve 
the pedestrian experience and 
community life (including safety 
from traffic and crime, 
beautification, meeting spaces, 
and art), following the guiding 
principles provided in section 
7.0. 
A need to improve public transit 
accessibility and active 
transportation. Currently, most 
people within the 
neighbourhood commute by 
car. Overall, transit accessibility 
is low in this northwest corner 
of the city, though some 
improvements are being made 
(e.g., Finch West LRT). There is a 
lack of cycling infrastructure in 
the neighbourhood, particularly 
in the East-West direction.

have access to the Internet. For example, encourage people to check on their 
neighbours, disseminate information in multiple languages or simple visuals that 
do not require much explanation, and leverage technology that may still be 
available during power outages (e.g., cell phones, radio, etc.).

Critical 
Infrastructure 
Resilience 
High 
Moderate 
Undertake a more in-depth critical infrastructure risk assessment, focusing on 
critical infrastructure systems such as transportation, food, water, and electricity 
to identify critical infrastructure vulnerabilities that can affect the 
neighbourhood and understand interdependent risks (i.e., if one system fails, 
how might this affect another system?). Systems that can affect the 
neighbourhood may be located outside of the neighbourhood (these systems 
were not included in the Rexdale neighbourhood vulnerability assessment).

Moderate 
Work with building owners and operators to identify buildings/units where 
indoor temperatures can get too high for human health and well-being and 
identify effective cooling solutions (active or passive). Through public 
engagements, stakeholders shared stories of people who have had to sleep on 
their balconies at night to keep cool.

Support for 
Vulnerable 
Residents 
High 
Moderate 
Establish a volunteer program where volunteers would go knocking on doors to 
check on vulnerable populations (e.g., seniors and people living alone) to bring 
food, water, medication and other necessary items during extreme weather 
events. Residents living in MURBs may not have access to elevators during 
power outage if the building does not have backup power.

Resilience/Food 
Hubs 
High 
Moderate 
Work with community partners to establish community resilience/food hubs - 
places where residents can go for shelter and basic needs in case of an 
emergency. These hubs would also operate on an ongoing basis with a goal of 
strengthening community resilience (e.g., by providing space for urban 
agriculture, access to affordable or free food, offer gathering spaces for 
residents and local organizations, and offer educational programs to enhance 
resilience). Through the SNAP Action Plan development process, residents and 
stakeholders identified potential locations for resilience/food hubs as well as 
components that would make a successful resilience/food hub.
