Great Lakes Water Quality Board Emerging Issues 
Work Group 
 
Climate Change and Adaptation in the Great Lakes  
 
Project Summary 
As outlined in the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (Agreement), the International Joint 
Commission is served in an advisory capacity by the Great Lakes Water Quality Board (WQB). The 
WQB includes an Emerging Issues Work Group that has identified the growing impact of climate 
change on the Great Lakes as a priority issue. 
 
The Board last examined the impacts of climate change in 2003 with its report, Climate Change 
and Water Quality in the Great Lakes Basin, in which it advised the Commission that there is a 
need for the development and implementation of an adaptation strategy. An understanding of the 
roles and actions that U.S. and Canadian jurisdictions are currently undertaking to support 
adaptive capacity and the identification of potential gaps in the regulatory and policy framework 
related to addressing climate change impacts would be useful tools in the development of such a 
strategy. 
 
This summary presents recommendations from the Emerging Issues Work Group on the topic of 
climate change adaptation and resilience as it relates to the goals of the Great Lakes Water Quality 
Agreement. The recommendations are based on three products or activities undertaken by the 
Work Group: 
 
• 
A commissioned report titled “Climate Change and Adaptation in the Great Lakes Basin.” 
This report provides an analysis of jurisdictional actions in Canada and the United States 
from local to federal and identifies gaps that may leave water quality vulnerable to climate 
change impacts. The report also makes valuable recommendations that the Work Group has 
further considered and refined. (The summary section of the report can in found in Appendix 
1. The full report is on file at the Great Lakes Regional Office (GLRO).) 
 
• 
An expert review of the commissioned report. 
The Work Group solicited comments on the report by climate change experts from 
academia, government and industry. The respondents were asked to pay particular 
attention to the strength and weaknesses of the jurisdictional analysis and the identified 
gaps. The participants were also asked to comment on and critique the recommendations 
provided in the report. 
 
• 
A workshop on climate change adaptation and resilience in the Great Lakes. 
A communications consultant was chosen by the Work Group to conduct a workshop that 
took place in Windsor, Ontario on July 12 – 13, 2016. Participants at the workshop included 
many of the experts involved in reviewing the Work Group’s commissioned report. The 
workshop consisted of presentations and group discussions designed to develop potential 
key elements of a binational approach to climate change adaptation and resilience, as well 
as to identify challenges and considerations in implementing such an approach. Key 
elements identified by participants included: 
 
• 
A common vision recognizing the importance of the Great Lakes and the impacts of 
climate change on the region; 
• 
A coordinating mechanism that might include a staffed coordinating network of existing 
and new networks (a “network of networks”); 
• 
An accountability framework to be built into the approach and adaptive management 
to be incorporated as a measurement of success; 
• 
Mechanisms to aggregate and share Great Lakes specific research as well as 
incorporate traditional ecological knowledge. 
 
The summary table from the workshop report can be found in Appendix II. Here, too, the 
full workshop report submitted by the workshop facilitator is on file at GLRO. 
 
The report and the expert workshop affirmed that a changing climate is already influencing Great 
Lakes water quality and further changes will likely have significant impacts on the Great Lakes and 
water quality in the lakes and their tributaries. Examples of impacts that are already occurring 
include the well- documented trend of increased water temperature in Lake Superior and the 
recent catastrophic flooding events in northern Wisconsin. While various communities as well as 
state/provincial and federal agencies are engaging in some aspects of adaptation planning and 
implementation, and are implementing strategies to enhance ecological resilience in the region, 
there is no coordinated regional perspective, approach or strategy. The report and the workshop 
participants concluded that a coordinated binational approach is needed to protect Great Lakes 
water quality to the extent possible in a rapidly changing climate. Moreover, they concluded that 
current regulatory frameworks are insufficient to address this challenge. 
 
Recommendation 1: The Federal Governments of Canada and the United States should 
demonstrate global leadership by jointly developing, in cooperation with other governments and 
organizations across the Great Lakes basin, a Binational Approach to Climate Change Adaptation 
and Resilience in the Great Lakes. Such an approach would include a shared vision, coordinated 
action, creation of a network to share science, information and knowledge, including Métis, First 
Nations and Tribal traditional ecological knowledge if offered, and the commitment of adequate 
funding to carry out these objectives. 
 
Action requested: The Water Quality Board asks that the IJC recommend to the Parties that 
they negotiate and develop a Binational Approach to coordinate and advance strategies that 
support climate change adaptation and increase ecological resilience in the Great Lakes 
ecosystem region, with a particular emphasis on safeguarding Great Lakes water quality. 
 
Recommendation 2: Investments in research, information sharing and knowledge 
management are needed to carry out a Vulnerability Assessment, to engage stakeholders and 
rights holders, and to identify priorities for responsive actions in the Great Lakes region. 
 
Action requested: The Water Quality Board further requests that the IJC urge the Parties to 
conduct a Great Lakes Climate Change Impacts Vulnerability Assessment as a first step in 
developing a regional approach. This assessment should address threats identified in the 
commissioned report noted above and the expert workshop and as summarized in the attached 
chart below. 
 
The assessment should include due consideration of the vulnerabilities to the chemical, 
physical and biological integrity (including biodiversity) of the Great Lakes in the context of 
water quality, and the related potential vulnerabilities for Great Lakes coastal communities, 
commerce and public health at small enough geographic scales that can  be of material use to 
communities and  local decision makers. 
 
Recommendation 3: The creation of a staff-supported Network of Networks (or 
augmentation of an existing network) to collect, aggregate and share information that can 
support climate adaptation response strategies at federal, regional, state/provincial, and 
local scales. 
 
Action Requested: The Water Quality Board asks the IJC to request that the Parties establish (or 
augment) a Great Lakes regional climate adaptation and resilience network, supported by staffed 
coordination within the IJC or through another appropriate binational or regional coordinating body. 
Its function would be to build on and amplify the work of the many scientific, regulatory, and 
regional structures and activities already addressing some aspects of climate adaptation and 
resilience in the region and within federal agencies. The network hub could serve as the 
coordinating point for knowledge management, communications, and potential for technical 
resources that could support community-level strategies and actions.

Appendix I:  Executive Summary from “Climate Change and Adaptation in the 
Great Lakes Basin,” prepared for the Great Lakes Water Quality Board 
Emerging Issues Task Force, March 28, 2016 by Innovolve 
 
The numbers are compelling: 20 percent of the world's surface fresh water by volume, providing 
drinking water to over 40 million Canadians and Americans, and contributing $180 billion to 
Canada-US trade on an annual basis. The Great Lakes Basin Ecosystem is an environmental, 
social and financial jewel. And climate change, among other stressors, is threatening its ability to 
continue to deliver these and other services to communities on both sides of the border. 
 
While there is a robust history of Canada-US cooperation on the Great Lakes dating back to 
decades, there are new complexities driving the need for increased cooperation and collaboration. 
Consider, for example, the varying degrees of jurisdictional authority across levels of 
government and aboriginal peoples in both countries, the increase of nongovernmental actors 
from civil society, academia and industry, as well as the cumulative nature of climate change 
impacts on water, and it becomes clear that concerted and coordinated action is a must. Together, 
these conditions afford the IJC an opportunity to build on its role as convener and advisor to 
governments. 
 
Impacts 
The Great Lakes Basin Ecosystem is complex. Water quality in the basin is dependent on many 
factors, some of them driven by natural processes and others by anthropogenic activities. Most of the 
impacts of climate change on water quality are indirect in nature. Climate change adds a 
compounding effect on already existing impacts in the Great Lakes basin related to human activities 
and land use. 
 
Projected changes in the Great Lakes basin climate and physical 
characteristics of the Great Lakes, with associated impacts on water quality 
 
Expected change in climate and in the physical 
characteristics of the Great Lakes 
Increase in total annual precipitation and in the 
frequency and intensity of storm events 
Potential droughts in certain areas; extreme swings 
between periods of flood and drought 
 
Rising air temperature and associated increase in water 
temperature in the Great Lakes and tributaries 
 
Effect on water quality 
 
Intensified runoff, erosion, sedimentation, and nutrient 
loading in the Great Lakes and their tributaries 
Loss of water supply and habitat, with related stresses 
on the ecosystem resilience 
Loss of cold and cool-water fish habitat, increased 
evaporation, decreased dissolved oxygen, shift in 
species range, algal bloom
Climate-related vectors for invasive species. 
Loss of biodiversity and habitat, new vectors for water- 
borne illnesses 
Declining water level; larger fluctuations between high 
and low water levels 
 
 
 
Declining ice cover 
 
Loss of wetlands and fish habitat 
 
Loss of whitefish spawning areas and loss of wetlands 
from erosion; changes in lake stratification and the 
timing of seasonal turnover, increasing the potential for 
oxygen depletion of bottom waters and nutrient 
regeneration 
Combination of multiple stressors 
Negative synergies and multiplier effects. 
 
Potential impacts are varied, significant and cumulative. Addressing them requires not only solid, 
evidence-based policy, but also communication, coordination and collaboration across jurisdictions.
Gaps 
The current study aims to identify capacity within existing policy frameworks of Great Lakes 
jurisdictions that can address these impacts. It also highlights significant policy gaps that may leave 
the Great Lakes water quality vulnerable to climate change impacts and make recommendations 
for building on the former and addressing the latter. 
 
Indeed, the survey of policy instruments across the various Great Lakes jurisdictions yielded a rich 
array of regulation, tools and knowledge products either directly or indirectly addressing water 
quality in the basin. As an example, several provinces and states have some sort of climate 
adaptation or resilience plan in place. All have a water quality strategy in place and most have 
measures for addressing nonpoint sources of pollution such as agriculture and urban runoff. 
 
Below is a summary of the gap analysis and key findings for different areas requiring 
attention.

Nongovernment Stakeholders 
Like most of society’s issues, it is clear that tackling the impacts of climate change in the Great 
Lakes basin under the current policy regimes will require updating those policies, addressing 
the gaps to introduce new ones and finding appropriate mechanisms to improve and facilitate 
their implementation. This needs to be a collective effort conducted with a plurality of perspective. 
 
While national and sub-national governments are the primary actors in protecting water quality in 
the basin, it is imperative to recognize and engage the myriad stakeholder groups across the region, 
including research groups producing climate models, Tribes, Métis and First Nations, 
environmental organizations, industry, local governments, as well as recreational groups such as 
anglers. In this stakeholder mix, industry represents one of the most important voices. And this 
voice is broad, if not fragmented, covering everything from farmers to multinational industrial 
water users to water technology innovators. Harnessing the perspectives of these actors and 
ensuring policy is developed with them is a key ingredient in ensuring effective implementation 
and ultimately, protection of the waters they all share. 
 
While by no means exhaustive, this report paints a picture of the stakeholder landscape across the 
basin with a view to building the argument for regular dialogue across jurisdictions and sectors in 
order to ensure sustainable shared value for all communities in the basin. 
 
Recommendations 
While several Great Lakes jurisdictions have developed climate adaptation plans, the lack of an 
integrated plan to deal with Great Lakes water issues is a significant gap in being able to mobilize 
action by sub-national jurisdictions and nongovernmental actors. There is a clear benefit in having 
leadership exercised by the two national governments to drive actions, especially over the longer 
term. Given the historical and institutional nature of collaborative planning between Canada and 
the United States on Great Lakes water quality, this is a natural and increasingly necessary step. 
The process of developing such an integrated plan would, in itself, prove a meaningful motivating 
signal across states, provinces, and communities. 
 
 
It is recommended that the IJC formally ask the two national governments to jointly develop a 
Great Lakes Climate Adaptation and Resilience Plan. 
 
 
The integrated climate adaptation plan for the Great Lakes Basin Ecosystem should be supported 
by the following four pillars: 
 
 
Leadership at top levels to advance the importance of the issue, enable policy frameworks 
and foster coordination/collaboration mechanisms to be established. 
 
Coordination/collaboration  of  activities  which  need  to  occur  between  governments,  
within governments, and with stakeholders. 
 
Data and information to drive the development of policy frameworks and program 
actions needed to confront the core issues. 
 
Resource and capacity weaknesses need to be addressed within jurisdictions to act on 
identified issues now and to undertake more complex future ones. 
 
As  mentioned  above,  we  encourage  the  IJC  to  leverage  its  ‘convening’  power  and  broad-
based international authority and expertise to table these topics with governments and 
stakeholders. It needs to consider how to make the problem clear and understandable to 
governments and stakeholders in order to animate action by them. Finally, given the incredible 
stakeholder landscape across the basin, the IJC needs to create constellations of networks within 
this landscape to prod action that is coordinated and strategic. 
 
Specific actions are recommended under each pillar of the proposed integrated plan: 
 
Leadership 
• 
Ensure that the next iteration of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement is developed in 
the context of observed climate change and give a more explicit and practical focus on climate 
change impacts, adaptation, and resilience allowing for more effective action by governments. 
• 
Engage the IJC during the drafting process to ensure meaningful consultation and engagement. 
• 
Fund an ongoing, dedicated climate change impacts and water resources research program of 
original academic and policy research to build knowledge and capacity in this area for future 
action. 
 
Coordination and Collaboration 
• 
Organize a forum with municipalities and state and provincial governments to foster greater 
collaboration and coordination with key municipal actors in addressing storm water runoff 
and other related climate impacts. Consider utilizing or leveraging the Great Lakes and St. 
Lawrence Cities Initiatives in this activity. 
• 
Use existing governance mechanisms (or create new ones) to ensure that climate change 
strategies are integrated into watershed management plans. 
• 
Enhance engagement with private industry on both sides of the border relying on Great Lakes 
water to: 
• 
Leverage their knowledge and expertise on climate impact solutions; 
• 
Foster greater awareness by governments of the impacts of climate change on industry 
and 
business  and  of  the  fact  that  industry  does  not  operate  on  the  same  timeframes  
than governments. 
 
Data and Information 
• 
Develop and publish a short, easy-to-follow climate change impacts report on the Great 
Lakes focused on IJC mandate area to ‘tell the story’ publicly of the importance of this issue 
and give a focus to ‘asks’ of government and others. Illustrate this with pictures, diagrams, 
and timelines to make the problem clear and easily understood. 
• 
Examine state of storm water infrastructure in region and prioritize investment in its 
modernization and renewal. 
• 
Update flood mapping for vulnerable zones. 
 
Resources and Capacity 
• 
Encourage all governments to develop broader, integrated climate change plans that highlight 
Great Lakes water quality issues. 
• 
Present the case to governments for the need to invest in climate-resilient infrastructure to 
address runoff issues from severe precipitation brought about by climate changing weather 
patterns via specific research and case studies. This needs to occur at the national, sub-
national, and municipal levels to capture all possible initiatives and areas of responsibility. 
• 
Analyze how the U.S. Farm Bill can be utilized more effectively to increase resilience and 
better support climate adaptation. 
• 
Protect/restore/create wetlands to improve water quality reduce erosion and mitigate water 
level fluctuations – in the U.S., the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program under the Farm 
Bill could be used to this effect, as well as Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
APPENDIX II – Executive Summary from “Climate Change Adaptation and 
Resilience in the Great Lakes” Workshop Report 
 
The Emerging Issues Work Group (EIWG or the Work Group) of the International Joint Commission’s 
(IJC) Great Lakes Water Quality Board (WQB) convened a workshop on July 12-13, 2016 in Windsor, 
Ontario, Canada. The purpose of the workshop was to draw on the knowledge and experience of 25-
30 experts to explore and more fully develop a recommendation that the WQB may present to the 
IJC for consideration: Namely that the IJC advise Canada and the United States to demonstrate 
global leadership by jointly developing a Binational Approach to Climate Change Adaptation and 
Resilience in the Great Lakes. 
 
The workshop consisted of presentations and group discussions designed to develop potential key 
elements of a binational approach to climate change adaptation and resilience, as well as to
