Introduction: Science communication research has increasingly explored what factors shape public opinion
around climate change policies. The public health consequences of climate change are becoming an increas-
ingly prominent focus of research and policy, and prior research has identiﬁed the importance of health mes-
saging for effective risk communication efforts. While prior research on communication appeals that
highlight the impact of climate change on public health has shown promise, evidence around the effective-
ness of such appeals remains thin, especially around health-related ﬁnancial costs related to climate hazards.
Materials: We explore how social media messages that describe the ramiﬁcations of climate-related health
problems may inﬂuence support for climate change policies. We ﬁelded an experiment embedded in an
online survey of 2,859 English-speaking U.S. adults to understand how health-cost climate messaging may
have a differential impact on distinct segments of the public. Treatment groups read a hypothetical social
media post about how a failure to invest in climate change mitigation and adaptation may result in ﬁnancial
burdens from either damaged property or healthcare costs due to worsening climate hazards quantiﬁed at
either a national or household scale. Following exposure to treatment stimuli, respondents were asked to
state to what extent they perceived climate change to be a threat to the US, supported policy responses, and
supported federal investments in mitigation and adaptation.
Results: While all messaging conditions were associated with signiﬁcantly higher perceptions that climate
change poses a threat, no differences were observed when comparing across the health- versus property-
related economic damage messages.
Conclusion: Communication of costs on a per household basis was associated with signiﬁcantly higher per-
ceptions that climate change is a threat compared to messages that emphasized costs at a national level.

1. Introduction
Climate change impacts are growing in frequency and intensity,
causing damage to physical infrastructure and human health [1]. Cli-
mate-sensitive extreme events are widely reported and public opin-
ion around climate is evolving in the direction of more awareness
and alarm [2]. However, studies show signiﬁcant segments of the U.S.
public remain skeptical of policy efforts designed to confront these
challenges [2] despite broad scientiﬁc consensus about the urgency
of doing so [3,4]. Over the past decade, science communication
research has increasingly explored what factors shape public opinion
around climate change policies at the federal, state, and local levels
[5−7], focusing especially on populations most resistant to these poli-
cies, their underlying beliefs, and the ideological factors that may fuel
persistent skepticism. Research has shown how discourse about the
subject has become politically polarized [8−10], contributing to a sta-
tus quo bias and greater distrust of scientiﬁc expertise [11−13].
The public health consequences of climate change are a relatively
under-studied and poorly communicated area relative to research
efforts quantifying climate impacts on ecosystems and infrastructure
[14,15] but research, communication, and policies focusing on the
health consequences of climate change are becoming increasingly
prominent [16,17]. Importantly, prior research has identiﬁed inclu-
sion of the health theme a key priority for effective climate change
campaigns and risk communication efforts [18].
National assessments such as the Billion Dollar Disaster Climate
and Weather Disasters list compiled by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration summarize the annual toll of the most
expensive climate and weather disasters on damage to property,
crops, and infrastructure [19]. While economic framing around cli-
mate impacts is widespread [20,21], the NOAA compendium and

other international climate impact assessments do not include
health-related costs, in part because such costs are difﬁcult to esti-
mate amongst distinct climate-sensitive exposure types, populations,
and geographies [22]. As an indication of the potential salience of this
focus of climate change damages, the Lancet Countdown on Health
and Climate Change has drawn attention to the need for more robust
evidence on the health costs of climate-sensitive events [23].
Existing evidence indicates that recent climate-sensitive events
experienced across the U.S., including extreme heat, coastal storms,
extreme precipitation, wildﬁres, and ozone air pollution episodes are
linked to substantial health problems and health-related ﬁnancial
costs. For example, our 2019 study identiﬁed 917 early deaths,
20,568 hospitalizations, and 17,857 emergency department visits
across a case study set of ten climate-sensitive events that affected
eleven U.S. states in 2012 [24]. The total economic toll associated
with the loss of life, illnesses, and injuries in that study was estimated
at $10 billion dollars (sensitivity range $2.7-$24.6 billion). Other stud-
ies have identiﬁed substantial economic damages associated with cli-
mate-sensitive exposures and health effects [25]. To date, climate
messages emphasizing health [26−28] or economic [29,7] dimen-
sions have been explored as separate topics. Prior work has found
that health messaging [26] can help to make climate communication
more personally relevant and intelligible to some members of the
public [27]; relatedly, a representative national online survey in 2010
found that a public health focus in climate messaging activated emo-
tional reactions consistent with support for climate change mitiga-
tion and adaptation policies [28]. Separately, a smaller experimental
study found that economic framing around climate activated higher
levels of concern and willingness to talk about the issue amongst
respondents already knowledgeable about the topic [29]. In another
meta-analysis analyzing the impact of different message frames on
engagement with the topic of climate change, an economic frame sig-
niﬁcantly outperformed public health frame, though the health fram-
ing did not include content on health costs [7].
Even as these lines of evidence continue to emerge, to our knowledge
no studies have explored the need or evaluated the effectiveness of inte-
grated human health and economic cost messaging in the U.S. popula-
tion. Such integrated messaging may be strategically valuable for climate
communications because it draws upon subject matter areas that have
been previously identiﬁed as effective approaches when deployed inde-
pendently. Moreover, reducing psychological distance helps to personal-
ize climate change communications and make it more relevant and
tangible [30]; climate and health cost messages lend themselves to ﬂexi-
ble application (e.g., this information is adaptable to a wide array of
health and economic metrics) and articulation of both localized and
broader geographical impacts. Social media platforms such as Facebook
and Twitter are widely used by U.S. adults as not only entertainment,
but also news sources; in a 2022 survey, 70% of U.S. adults reported using
Facebook, and 31% of U.S. adults reported regularly accessing news on
that site. For Twitter, 27% of adults reported using the site and 14% regu-
larly accessed news on the site [31]. Prior work has identiﬁed social
media sites as important platforms for assessing public awareness, opin-
ion, and engagement with climate change content [32−34].
This study adds to this growing body of research by examining the
effectiveness of health-economic climate change messages on differ-
ent segments of the public. While prior research on communication
appeals that highlight the impact of climate change on public health
has shown promise [35−38], particularly messaging that focuses on
speciﬁc, local threats rather than abstract hazards [30], evidence
around the effectiveness of such appeals for improving climate
change risk perception and support for climate policy and related
funding remains thin. It is not yet clear what type of health-related
messaging is most persuasive relative to alternatives (e.g., reporting
that emphasizes substantial health-related ﬁnancial costs shouldered
by people during climate disasters for medical care in hospitals and
emergency rooms versus reporting that focuses mainly on physical
and mental health harms). Nor have prior studies examined hetero-
geneous effects of such appeals on distinct sub-populations of inter-
est (e.g., political conservatives, men, retirees, and rural blue-collar
workers) who have been most resistant to federal climate change
policies.
This study begins to address this gap in the literature by exploring
how social media messages that describe the economic ramiﬁcations
of one set of climate-sensitive health problems (illness, injuries, and
deaths related to worsening wildﬁres) may inﬂuence risk perception
on climate change and support for federal climate change policies,
including support for public investment in climate change pollution
control and community preparedness. We focus on wildﬁre-related
messaging as ﬁre impacts on costs to human health, property, and
infrastructure are relatively better-studied climate-sensitive dam-
ages [39−41,24]; real-world cost estimates are deployed in our
experimental treatments. Our project involves collaboration between
the Science Ofﬁce of the Natural Resources Defense Council and
researchers at the University of Minnesota’s Hubbard School of Jour-
nalism and Mass Communication. NRDC collaborators have published
prior studies on the health harms of climate change and the ﬁnancial
costs of health problems worsened by climate-sensitive events
[22,24,42−44].
Building on prior studies, we explore two research questions in
the present work. We ask (Q1) whether there are differential effects
on support for mitigation and adaptation investments associated
with whether communication appeals focus on (Q1a) either health-
or property-related economic impacts of climate change, particularly
when (Q1b) those costs are quantiﬁed at either a per household or
national scale, which a previous study found affects the way the pub-
lic thinks about these costs [45,46]. We also ask (Q2) whether com-
munication appeals affect risk perception and support for climate
change response policies and funding within distinct segments of the
public in different ways. After all, one previous study found that an
economic frame was most persuasive amongst respondents who
were already most knowledgeable about climate change, but also
that the least knowledgeable respondents were most resistant to any
communication appeals [29].
Speciﬁcally, we consider heterogeneous effects among subgroups
currently most skeptical toward climate change policy. Previous stud-
ies have singled out education, partisanship [47] and geographic place
[48,49] as important lines of division for public opinion on the subject.
Therefore, we ask whether (Q2a) older, (Q2b) male, and (Q2c) less
educated respondents, as well as those who (Q2d) live in more rural
areas, are (Q2e) less politically interested, and identify as (Q2f) ideo-
logical conservative might also be more or less to certain types of
appeals [50]. Because earlier studies have also identiﬁed the important
role played by the news media, and Fox News in particular [51−53], in
shaping attitudes toward climate change, we also look at whether
(Q2g) viewers of Fox News respond differently to each type of appeal.
2. Material and methods
To examine these research questions, this study makes use of a
randomized experiment embedded in an online survey ﬁelded by the
research ﬁrm Civis Analytics (N = 2859). The sample of English-speak-
ing adult respondents was broadly balanced to be representative of
the American public using quotas and survey weights (see the appen-
dix for summary).
The full questionnaire took approximately ten minutes to com-
plete. Respondents were asked a series of questions about their dem-
ographics, media usage, and political attitudes. Each participant was
then randomly assigned to either a control group or one of four sepa-
rate treatment groups corresponding to panels a-d in Fig. 1. Those
assigned to treatment groups were asked to read a hypothetical social
media post created by the authors, with a health- or property-related
photo, headline, and descriptive text. Each post was designed to

highlight a hypothetical news article about a new scientiﬁc report
exploring how a failure to invest in climate change mitigation and
adaptation would result in ﬁnancial burdens from worsening climate
hazards. While these posts were not publicly visible to any audience
and were deployed only for this experiment, the climate damage sta-
tistics mentioned were adapted from real-world federal estimates,
including a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency study on health-
related ﬁnancial damages from wildﬁre smoke [41], NOAA estimates
wildﬁre-related damages to property [39], and Internal Revenue Ser-
vice statistics on the number of taxpaying U.S. households [54].
The posts described costs associated with climate change and
emphasized these costs in terms of public health or property
damages caused by climate change related wildﬁres (see each of
the four stimuli in Fig. 1). In developing our survey treatment
materials, we draw from prior work that has shown the impor-
tance of importance of visual storytelling methods around climate
and health [55] to test the efﬁcacy of health-related economic
messaging. Costs were quantiﬁed either in terms of a dollar ﬁgure
at the national level or on a per household basis. Those assigned
to a control group did not see any stimulus. A small number of

respondents were excluded who said they could not view the
stimuli materials (N = 59).
Immediately following exposure to these stimuli, respondents
were asked to state to what extent they (a) perceived climate change
to be a threat to the US, (b) supported a range of policy responses,
and (c) supported federal investments in climate change mitigation
and adaptation efforts. These outcome variables are summarized in
Table 1. To ease interpretation of our results, support for policy
responses were averaged in a composite variable (Cronbach’s
alpha = 0.87). We report results for each separate policy response in
Appendix Table A-2.
In the ﬁrst part of our analysis, we assess our ﬁrst research ques-
tions (Q1a and Q1b) by calculating average treatment effects by com-
paring responses to each of these dependent variables for the control
group to each treatment group associated with exposure to each type
of climate change message. To simplify interpretation of results and
to maximize statistical power, we analyze effects associated with
health- versus property-related costs and then separately, whether
these costs are quantiﬁed at a per household- versus national scale.
To evaluate our second set of research questions about heteroge-
neous treatment effects (Q2a-g), we estimated a series of ordinary
least squares models that include interactions between indicator var-
iables for each treatment condition and relevant respondent charac-
teristics. These included age, gender, level of educational attainment,
interest in politics, partisan identity, respondents’ self-reported per-
ception of whether they lived in a “rural,” “suburban,” or “urban”
community (which we dichotomized as “rural” or “non-rural” in
order to isolate the relevant category of interest), as well as news
consumption. This last variable was measured by asking respondents
how frequently they consumed different modes of news on a 4-point
scale from “never” to “often” including online, print newspapers,
broadcast, and cable television. For the latter category, because of the
unique status of Fox News in the American media system [56], we
asked respondents a follow-up question about whether they mainly
watched Fox News, MSNBC, CNN, or another channel, which we used
to create separate measures of how frequently respondents con-
sumed Fox News versus other cable news content. In addition to
these variables, we also measured respondent race and household
income, which are included as additional control variables to
improve model ﬁt.
3. Results
Overall we found limited evidence that health-economic messag-
ing on climate damages results in differential effects on support for
climate change mitigation and adaptation investments. When exam-
ining the statistical signiﬁcance of average treatment effects, which
we summarize visually in Fig. 2, we found some evidence of signiﬁ-
cant effects associated with both the health and property damage
messaging conditions but minimal difference between the message
treatments (Q1a). We found more consistent evidence that commu-
nication of climate change costs on a per household level was associ-
ated with larger treatment effects than when presenting costs at the
national level (Q1b).
While all four messaging conditions were associated with signiﬁ-
cantly higher perceptions that climate change is a threat, no differen-
ces were observed when comparing across the health versus
property damage messages. The message that emphasized costs on a
per household basis was associated with signiﬁcantly higher percep-
tions that climate change is a threat compared to messages that
described costs at a national level (t = 2.1, p < 0.05).
Fewer signiﬁcant effects were observed when it came to support
for policy responses or federal climate change funding. Support for
federal climate change funding was higher for both the health and
property conditions but only reached borderline signiﬁcance for the
property damage messaging (t = 1.8, p < 0.10). Likewise the house-
hold condition was associated with slightly higher levels of support
for policy responses when compared to the national condition
(t = 1.7, p < 0.10) and when it came to support for federal climate
change funding (t = 2.2, p < 0.05).
To explore our second set of research questions involving hetero-
geneous treatment effects speciﬁed above (Q2a-Q2g), we focus on
the signiﬁcance of interactions between indicators for each of our
treatment conditions and relevant respondent characteristics. To

simplify the presentation of our results, we limit our attention to only
our ﬁrst dependent variable (perceived threat of climate change)
where we observed the largest and most consistent overall effects,
but we report the full results in the appendix.
We ﬁnd evidence of signiﬁcant heterogeneous treatment effects
only for two variables: whether respondents live in rural areas (Q2d)
and the degree to which respondents regularly consume Fox News
(Q2g). As we illustrate in Fig. 3, effects are primarily concentrated
among rural respondents, perhaps in part because their baseline per-
ceptions about the threat from climate change tends to be lower.
There is no evidence, however, of differences in effectiveness
between the types of messaging conditions. Likewise, when examin-
ing heterogeneous treatment effects in relation to Fox News con-
sumption, we ﬁnd that exposure to climate change messages is
associated with increases in the perceived threat of climate change
mainly among those who rarely or never consume Fox News content
and indistinguishable from the control group for those who regularly
watch the cable news channel. The results suggest that watching Fox
News regularly may be associated with more crystallized views and
greater resistance to any type of communication appeal on the sub-
ject. Neither the health nor household condition were differentially
more effective with these subgroups.
In our Appendix material, we report the results of tests for
interactions
between
our
experimental
treatments
and
other
respondent characteristics, including age, gender, party afﬁliation,
educational attainment, rural/urban, sources of news, and level of
interest in politics.
4. Discussion
We found that health-related cost messaging was no more effec-
tive in our survey than cost messaging related to property-related cli-
mate change damages. Overall, the pattern of larger treatment effects
when describing climate change costs on a household level compared
to a national level indicates the importance of considering scale when
formulating communications that emphasize climate-related eco-
nomic damages.
Our ﬁndings align with studies analyzed in a recent systematic
review and meta-analysis, which found that communication that
reduces psychological distance (e.g., making climate hazards feel
closer and less abstract) hold promise, along with strategies that
relate to emotional and religious interventions [30]. However, the
effectiveness of personalized communication strategies may depend
on baseline levels of concern in different audiences [57]. While our

household-level social media messages offer closer psychological dis-
tance than national-level impacts, more can be done to further local-
ize these hazards and their harms to individual health (e.g.,
attribution of climate change to speciﬁc health problems in more pre-
cisely deﬁned populations) [58], and evaluate messaging that details
ﬁrst-person accounts of health harms endured during climate-sensi-
tive events [17]).
Currently, many assessments of climate change-linked economic
damages (to human health, but also property, crops, and infrastruc-
ture) are communicated in broad terms (e.g., state or national level in
the U.S.) due to lack of sufﬁcient spatial resolution in health data
[19,22]. Because of the prevalence of national-scale climate change
damage estimates, it is possible that some survey respondents were
not as receptive to additional messaging of this type. However, each
treatment message, while brief and inclusive of distinct visual com-
ponents, included textual elements spanning both climate content
(health or property damage in economic terms) and scale of impacts
(household or national).
Moreover, we did not test the effectiveness of locally-tailored cli-
mate change damage estimates in this study, though the adoption of
messaging to meet the needs of speciﬁc audiences has been identiﬁed
as an effective communications strategy in prior research [59].
Beyond property damage, crop failures, and health-related costs, cli-
mate change is affecting food prices and compounding inﬂationary
pressures [60], but messaging around these impacts has not been
tested in terms of effectiveness for motivating support of climate
change policies. Prior work on estimating climate-sensitive health
effects and costs indicates that these burdens are falling dispropor-
tionately on marginalized populations [24,43,61], and these popula-
tions have been found in prior studies to be especially concerned
about certain climate hazards [62].
We found some evidence of signiﬁcant effects associated with
both the health- and property damage-related communication condi-
tions, but minimal difference between these messages. To be sure the
stimuli used in this study involved a somewhat subtle manipulation
and both frame the issue in terms of economic costs. It is possible
that our use of a single climate-sensitive event type (wildﬁres)
reduced effectiveness amongst respondents who do not reside in
wildﬁre-vulnerable parts of the country or who are not as familiar
with the hazards associated with increasing wildﬁre severity. How-
ever, there may be limits to the effectiveness of household-level and
hazard-speciﬁc communications: personalized risk information may
not affect willingness to pay for regional climate adaptation [57].
Future work on this front could consider application of locally-tai-
lored climate hazard communications to assess their value as well as
the feasibility of reaching targeted communities using social media
channels, two factors that were not considered in this study.
The lack of signiﬁcant effects related to support for policy
responses or federal climate change funding suggests that the hypo-
thetical social media posts in our study did not affect underlying
views on the need for ﬁnancial investments to address climate
change; other research has found that even when scientiﬁc informa-
tion about climate change increases support for government action,
the effect can diminish over time and can be further weakened by
consumption of skeptical opinion content [63]. The fact that house-
hold-level messaging was associated with slightly higher levels of
support for policy responses when compared to national messaging
further suggests that documenting local climate harms could be
important for motivating support for local policy solution. Impor-
tantly, climate solutions offered were all presented as federal govern-
ment responses, which may have reduced support amongst more
conservative respondents; future work could explore support for cli-
mate policy investments at a more localized scale.
In considering other ways of communicating this information, we
note that communication on the health and economic beneﬁts of cli-
mate action, rather than costs of implementing climate change
mitigation actions, is on the rise [64]. Future investigations could
complement our work by testing the effectiveness of afﬁrmative,
beneﬁts-focused communications around avoided climate change
damages and the extent to which scale of the information presented
is an important factor.
More broadly, by assessing the effectiveness of messaging related
to scientiﬁc quantiﬁcation of climate change damages, we build on
prior research that has identiﬁed a need for communications experts
to inform scientiﬁc messaging to the public [36]. As the evidence of
climate change damages to human health continues to mount and
the climate problem itself intensiﬁes, effective translation of scientiﬁc
ﬁndings into communications that resonate to the public will be
increasingly urgent.
