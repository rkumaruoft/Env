Introduction
This Adaptation Handbook is part of The Climate Caucus Councillor’s Handbook - a
toolkit to provide local elected leaders with inspiration, resources, and tools to support
their communities’ climate action goals. The goal of this handbook is to provide policy
ideas and examples that local governments can replicate to promote climate resilience
in their community. This includes how to create an adaptation plan and how to respond
to the most pressing climate-related risks your individual community is facing, such as
flooding, drought, extreme heat, sea-level rise and more.
The latest research shows that Canada is warming at twice the global rate. Higher
temperatures, less snow and ice cover, earlier spring peak streamflows and rising sea
levels are predicted for much of the country. Increased overall precipitation and more
intense rainfall events are increasing urban flood risks, while prolonged drought
conditions are raising the risks of wildfire. These changes are already significantly
impacting municipalities (B.C heat dome in 2021; Lytton, B.C. wildfire; Red River Valley
flooding in 2022) and without substantial adaptation and risk management action,
these impacts will intensify.
This handbook compiles practical solutions, best practices, strategies, and tools that
will help local governments reduce climate-related harms through adaptation.
The Handbook is a living document, which means we’ll be adding your successful
policies and initiatives as they happen, and it provides an up-to-date, real-time guide to
the change being driven by Climate Caucus members from coast to coast to coast.

Context
Without action, the costs of climate change will be high
●
The Insurance Bureau of Canada indicates that the new normal for insurance
payouts from catastrophic climate events in Canada has risen to $2 billion per
year, up from around $400 million per year for the 26 years prior to 2009
●
Recent economic modeling from the Canadian Climate Institute (CCI) shows that
without action, climate impacts will cost households and governments billions,
making life less affordable for Canadians and increasing financial demands on
municipalities
But it doesn’t have to be that way, proactive adaptation measures can cut projected
costs of climate change in half.
“While we need to continue to work on reducing our greenhouse gas
emissions, we must also recognize that we are already locked into a
changing climate. As such, we need to simultaneously prepare for
warmer, wetter and wilder weather.” (City of Burlington, Climate
Adaptation Plan)
Key Resources
Canada’s National Adaptation Strategy - Building Strong and Resilient Communities
discusses how climate change is expected to affect Canadian Communities and provides
adaptation strategies
Municipalities looking for funding opportunities for adaptation efforts can consult our Climate
Caucus Municipal Grants List for a detailed list of active federal and provincial grants.
A list of exemplar motions, bylaws, council reports and briefing notes can be found at our
Policies and Resources Library.

Important Elements of Adaptation
Efforts
Embedding Equity Considerations
●
Climate damages further exacerbate inequality thus adaptation actions need to
be sensitive to social inequities and to address the needs of those who are most
vulnerable

Action Planning from C40
●

through an Equity Lens.
For more information on how to ensure an equitable approach to local
adaptation efforts, consult the Climate Justice Handbook.
Including Indigenous Peoples
●
Indigenous peoples must have a seat at the table when conducting adaptation
planning for several reasons:
○
Indigenous peoples and communities are disproportionately impacted by
the adverse effects of climate change.
○
Indigenous communities possess a wealth of traditional knowledge and
wisdom that has been accumulated over generations. Including
Indigenous perspectives ensures a more comprehensive understanding of
the local context, contributing valuable insights for effective adaptation
strategies.
○
Many Indigenous peoples have engaged in land stewardship since time
immemorial.
■
Although many indigenous land stewardship practices were
suppressed by Colonial governments, many of these practices have
continued on reserve lands or are being revitalized today.
○
Upholding the Indigenous Right to Self Determination requires including
Indigenous people in decision-making processes.

leaders of positive environmental change, using the best of Western and
Indigenous knowledge to create a world that is in balance and supports
the well-being of all living things.

Getting Started Tips and Initiatives
The impacts of climate change are broad and wide ranging and so climate change
adaptation action can be approached in many ways. The climate risks that are most
present in your community should inform where and how your community starts their
adaptation work. Once the case is made for acting on adaptation locally,
1.
Research what similar municipalities are doing (based on size of municipality,
staff capacity, municipal sources, region).
2.
Develop partnerships with neighboring municipalities, or regional actors such as
conservation authorities, public health units, community associations, local
environmental groups etc. to provide an integrated approach to adaptation, and
can alleviate some of the resource constraints that exist in smaller communities.
3.
Consider whether long-term planning for climate resiliency or incorporating
adaptation into local service delivery (e.g. stormwater management, parks and
recreation areas, transportation, public works, social services) is your focus
4.
Explore the five ‘entry-points’ outlined in ICLEI’s Getting Started Report: Asset
Management, Land Use Planning, Health & Well-being, Sustainability/Climate
Planning and Emergency Management (pg. 11 - 12).
There are several adaptation measures that are applicable to all climate hazards such as
vulnerability assessments, public engagement, and land use planning. These are often
good places to start local adaptation efforts. See page 9 for adaptation measures to
address specific risks.

⬚Conduct a Climate Change Vulnerability and
Impact Assessment
The Basics:
●
Vulnerability refers to the susceptibility of a given asset, service, or group to harm
arising from climate change impacts based on the sensitivity of the community
to a climate change impact, and its adaptive capacity.
●
A vulnerability assessment is necessary to address risks in a way that is tailored to
a municipality’s context, and build resiliency through climate change adaptation
planning and decision-making.
○
Vulnerability assessments are a crucial first step before implementing
adaptation measures for specific climate hazards
●
Community residents, groups, and stakeholders should be involved in identifying
the most significant climate risks
○
Indigenous people and nearby communities should be invited to
participate in identifying climate risks

⬚Create an adaptation plan
The Basics:
●
An adaptation plan is a strategic framework developed by local governments to
address and respond to the anticipated impacts of climate change on their
communities.
●
Adaptation plans outline specific actions, policies, and measures aimed at
enhancing resilience, reducing vulnerability, and ensuring the sustainable
development of the municipality in the face of changing climate conditions.
●
To create an adaptation plan, communities must first identify how climate
change will likely affect their community (likely through conducting a climate
change vulnerability and impact assessment).
●
Effective adaptation plans feature stakeholder engagement and community
collaboration, and goal identification and regular evaluation.
●
Adaptation plans can be integrated into existing community plans.
●
Smaller communities may want to consider partnering with communities nearby
to develop regional adaptation plans.

⬚Public Engagement & Raising Awareness
The Basics:
●
Increasing awareness about the climate hazards and vulnerabilities unique to
your community is crucial to successful municipal adaptation efforts.
●
Informed residents are more likely to take measures that reduce risk such as
“FireSmart-ing” their property to reduce risk of wildfire spreading to their home,
consulting a geo-techical expert before conducting development to reduce the
risk of slope failure on their property, or creating an extreme heat response plan
to ensure safety during extreme heat episodes.
○
Communication strategies can include sharing information at community events
and on public platforms such as bulletin boards, social media and websites
●
Involving residents in adaptation planning fosters a sense of ownership and
responsibility amongst the residents, thus residents are more likely to support
policy changes, infrastructure developments, and other measures taken to
decrease climate vulnerability.
●
Identifying community “champions” of adaptation measures can increase
support for these measures amongst residents.
Resources:
●
ICLEI Canada has a guide on Engaging Meaningfully that provides advice on how
to develop and leverage effective partnerships in the planning process.
●
Virtual engagement opportunities can broaden the reach of your planning
process
○
The Northeast Climate Resilience Network in B.C created a best practices
report on Virtual Community Engagement on Climate Adaptation and
piloted virtual engagement in the City of Dawson Creek
Examples:
●
City of Victoria includes a list of hazards and emergency preparedness
information on their website
●
The City of Burlington’s online community adaptation plan workshops - “Weather
and Climate: It’s Not What Our Grandparents Knew”
Case Study - The City of Colwood, BC
The City of Colwood, B.C (population approx. 17,000) implemented a Good
Neighbour program that encourages citizens to build resiliency in their community
through initiatives such as shared rainwater collection and distribution systems,
planning together to flood proof streets and mapping tree locations to identify
where new trees are needed.
Case Study - The City of Mississauga, ON
The City of Mississauga created outreach opportunities focused on engaging
equity-deserving groups, including hosting an Imagine 2050 Escape Room, an
After Dark Earth Market and a climate themed public art exhibit which helped to
engage populations that otherwise would not have commented on the climate plan.
⬚Land Use Planning
The Basics:
●
Land use planning is a process that guides development and land use within a
jurisdiction. It is crucial to reducing vulnerability to climate change hazards.
●
Municipalities should draw on their climate change vulnerability and impact
assessment to determine where risks exist in their communities and consult with
experts to develop plans that reduce those risks.
●
Municipalities should ensure that new development and infrastructure avoid
hazard prone areas and are built with resilience in mind.

⬚Create Development Permit Areas
The Basics:
●
Development Permit Areas (DPAs) are areas where special requirements and
guidelines for any development or alteration of the land are in effect.
●
DPAs may be established to protect environmentally sensitive areas (such as
wetlands, or wildlife habitats) or ensure safety in areas prone to hazards.
○
For example, DPAs can be established to manage development in flood
prone areas, areas prone to slope failure, the wildland-urban interface, and
more.
●
Municipal governments typically can establish DPAs through the creation of
by-laws or official community plans.ild
○
The term “Development Permit Area” is not explicitly used by every
province and territory and the mechanism in which municipalities can
manage development differs across provinces and territories, nevertheless,
the authority to manage development is generally granted to
municipalities and regional districts by all provincial or territorial authorities
in Canada.
○
Municipalities are advised to consult the relevant provincial and territorial
planning legislation, as well as local municipal bylaws and regulations, to
ensure a comprehensive understanding of the development management
framework in their respective jurisdictions.
Resources:
●
Development Permit Area Guidelines from the BC Climate Action Toolkit
●
Development Permit Area Information from the Government of British Columbia
Case Study - The District of North Vancouver
The DNV has also established Development Permit Areas (DPAs) to protect
development in hazardous areas. The Slope Hazard DPA is intended to minimize
the risk to people and property from building on slopes. Similarly, the Creek
Hazard DPA is intended to minimize the risk to people and property from creek
hazards, including debris flows (a type of landslide). Owners of properties within
the Slope Hazard DPA and Creek Hazard DPA require special permission before
developing their properties and must hire geotechnical engineers to conduct risk
assessments and offer safety recommendations.
Adaptation Initiatives for Major
Risks
The following initiatives are applicable to specific major risks. We organized these
initiatives by risk areas to make it easier to find information specific to the challenges
that are most relevant to your municipality. Each section includes examples of projects
that have been successfully implemented by local governments across Canada. Click on
