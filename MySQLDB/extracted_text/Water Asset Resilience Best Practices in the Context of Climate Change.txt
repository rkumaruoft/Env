CERIU
Founded in 1994, the Centre d’expertise et de recherche en infrastructures urbaines 
(CERIU) is a non-profit organization that arose from the need to rehabilitate municipal 
infrastructure in an efficient and cost-effective manner. 
Thanks to the wide-ranging expertise of its 185  organizational members, including 
municipalities, businesses, government departments, laboratories and educational 
institutions, and its unique approach based on partnership and consultation, CERIU is the 
only organization that provides an integrated perspective on urban infrastructure issues.
A true innovation hub, CERIU aims to change attitudes and habits in order to promote new, 
more efficient and cost-effective ways of doing things, and develop tools tailored to the 
needs of municipalities and utilities.

CERIU’S PERMANENT BOARD, ASSET MANAGEMENT
The Permanent Board, Asset Management, works to support the development 
of expertise and best practices in the sustainable development of municipal 
infrastructure through standardization, dissemination, training, research, 
monitoring and technology transfer.
CAUTIONARY NOTE
The CERIU assumes no responsibility with respect to how this handbook is used or the 
results it may yield. Understanding of the science underpinning climate change is constantly 
evolving. As such, it is the responsibility of municipalities to learn about the risks to which 
they may be exposed, depending on their geographical position and vulnerability.
The fact that a municipality has not yet been affected by climatic hazards does not mean 
that it is immune to all future climatic hazards.

GLOSSARY
Action plan
Tool that makes it possible to achieve the commitments, vision, specifications and 
objectives identified in previous stages of strategic planning. It identifies priority actions 
and establishes a timeline for their implementation, based on available human, financial 
and technical resources (Planifika, 2023).
AM policy 
Policy that outlines a municipality’s commitment and mandated requirements for asset 
management. A policy is linked to the municipality’s strategic objectives and is shaped 
by its values and priorities (FCM, 2023). 
Asset management plan
Detailed plan that outlines how assets will be managed in one or more service areas. 
It identifies how assets will be maintained and renewed, and the cost, level of service 
and risk considerations in each service area (FCM, 2023).
Awareness-raising strategy 
Development, planning and coordination of actions to raise awareness in people so 
that they become sensitive, receptive or attentive to something or a message for which 
no interest was previously expressed, with the objective of driving action or changing 
behaviours (Planifika, 2023).
Climate
Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the average weather, or more rigorously, 
as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities 
over a period of time ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical 
period for averaging these variables is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological 
Organization (IPCC, 2007).
Climate change
Change in the state of the climate that can be identified by changes in the mean and/or 
the variability of its properties, and that persists for an extended period, typically decades 
or longer. 
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in Article 2, 
defines climate change as: “a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly 
to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in 
addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods” (IPCC, 2015).
2
Climate change adaptation 
Process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects. In human systems, 
adaptation seeks to mitigate harmful effects and exploit beneficial opportunities. In some 
natural systems, human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and 
its effects (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2015).
Climate change adaptation plan
Planning tool used to examine climate change as a whole and in all areas of municipal 
government, to identify and prioritize the main risks, adopt a vision, and plan the short-, 
medium- and long-term implementation stages of climate change adaptation measures 
(Ville de Montréal, 2017).
Climate change mitigation
Human intervention to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases 
(GHG), or aimed at reducing the sources of other substances that may contribute directly 
or indirectly to limiting climate change (IPCC, 2015). 
Climate prediction 
Result of an attempt to produce an estimate of the actual evolution of the climate in the 
future, for example, on seasonal, interannual, or long-term time scales. Because the 
future evolution of the climate system may be highly sensitive to initial conditions, such 
predictions are usually probabilistic in nature (IPCC, 2007).
Criticality analysis
A technical methodology used to assess the impact of asset system failures on organi-
zational performance.  A criticality analysis objectively categorizes and prioritizes these 
different systems, enabling decision-making that is aligned with the organization’s 
objectives (Planifika, 2023).
Demographic projection 
A population projection provides a picture of what the future size and structure of the 
population might be by sex and age. It is based on knowledge of the past and, for the 
future, on assumptions about three components of population change, namely fertility, 
mortality and migration (Insee, 2023).
Drought 
Period of abnormally dry weather long enough to cause a serious hydrological imbalance. 
A period with an abnormal precipitation deficit is defined as a meteorological drought 
(IPCC, 2015).
Emergency action plan
Document outlining actions to be taken in the event of a disaster or serious crisis 
(Government of Quebec, 2023).

WATER ASSET RESILIENCE BEST PRACTICES IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CHANGE  |  03/2024 
_
Exposure
The presence of people, livelihoods, species or ecosystems, environmental functions, 
services, and resources, infrastructure, or economic, social, or cultural assets in places 
and settings that could be adversely affected (IPCC, 2015).
Functional status of assets
The functional status of assets refers to their “fitness for purpose.” It represents the 
asset’s ability to function relative to its expected performance.
Information on the functional status of an asset is useful in determining service levels 
and asset risks (MFOA, 2018). 
Hazard
Phenomenon, physical manifestation or human activity likely to cause loss of life or 
injury, damage to property, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation 
(Ouranos, 2020).
Physical status of assets
Physical condition of an infrastructure or component (Secrétariat du Conseil du trésor, 
2014).
Quebec’s Drinking Water Conservation Strategy
Strategy designed to provide municipalities with the necessary tools to acquire knowledge 
and make a clear, concrete diagnosis of their water use in relation to internationally 
recognized standards. To achieve this, several measures and commitments have been 
progressively implemented by municipalities and the government (MAMH, 2020).
Resilience
Ability of an organization or system to withstand and recover from a major disruption, 
shock or stress, ensuring continued operation and provision of service (adapted from 
Institute of Asset Management, n.d.).
Return period
Average time between two events with intensities equal to or greater than a given value 
(INRS, 2021).
Risk
Combination of the probability of occurrence of a climate event and its potential 
consequences on vulnerable elements of a given environment (ministère de la Sécurité 
publique, 2008).
4
Risk management
Plans, actions, or policies to reduce the likelihood and/or consequences of risks or 
to respond to consequences (IPCC, 2015).
Strategic planning
Management process designed to ensure, on an ongoing basis, that an organization 
is aligned with the internal and external circumstances that are favourable to its success. 
It is accomplished by adapting the mission, defining objectives, developing strategies 
and drawing up a comprehensive plan that identifies how resources will be used to 
meet the needs of stakeholders and environmental requirements (Ministère des Affaires 
Municipales et de l’Habitation, 2010). 
Vulnerability
Degree to which a system is susceptible to, or unable to cope with, adverse effects 
of climate change, including climate variability and extremes. It varies according to the 
nature, magnitude and pace of the evolution of the event as well as the variation in the 
climate to which the system is exposed, the sensitivity of this system and its capacity 
to adapt (Ville de Montréal, 2017). 
Vulnerability analysis
Process of identifying, quantifying and prioritizing (or classifying) system or asset 
vulnerabilities. A vulnerability analysis focuses on both the consequences for the object 
itself and the primary and secondary consequences for the surrounding environment. 
It also looks at ways of reducing these consequences and improving the ability to manage 
future incidents (Planifika, 2023).

INTRODUCTION
The fight against climate change is a major challenge. Its effects are felt in many areas, 
and it is important to act now. The increase in climate change-related events is observed 
throughout the world, and Quebec, where its municipalities and their infrastructure are no 
exception. 
Quebec municipalities therefore need to consider the good practices to put in place to best 
meet the challenges of the future. 
Resilience can be defined in different ways, one of which being “the ability of an organi-
zation or system to withstand and recover from a major disruption, shock or stress, 
ensuring continued operation and provision of service (Institute of Asset Management, 
n.d.). The idea of resilience is one that is becoming increasingly talked about. This handbook 
has been prepared by CERIU to support municipalities in their efforts to build resilience 
into their assets in order to best adapt to climate change.  
The handbook only examines water assets with respect to three hazards, namely heavy 
precipitation, drought and storms. 
The decision to narrow the focus stems from the fact that the issue of climate change is so 
vast that it cannot be addressed in a single handbook. It was therefore deemed preferable 
to focus on the most frequent hazards in examining asset resilience in Quebec.
This decision is also the result of consultations with professionals in the field. Because 
water assets are the most frequently cited assets in discussions with CERIU members 
about needs, they have naturally been prioritized for this project.

HANDBOOK DESCRIPTION 
1.1_ OBJECTIVES AND USER FLOW 
1.1.1_ OBJECTIVES 
The primary aim of this handbook is to support municipalities in their efforts to build 
resilience by helping them identify vulnerable assets and offering potential climate change 
adaptation solutions.  
This entails raising awareness of climate change among Quebec municipalities and 
encouraging strategic thinking on the various climate change issues that have an impact 
on the management of their assets. This handbook is therefore addressed to all Quebec 
municipalities as well as anyone working with municipal infrastructure. 
According to the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM), “communities are becoming 
increasingly vulnerable to the hazards and impacts posed by the changing climate” 
because “climate influences almost everything about how we design, build, and live in our 
cities” (FCM, 2023). It is therefore essential to integrate the notion of climate change into 
the management of municipal assets. 
This handbook comes with a self-assessment tool (Excel spreadsheet) to assess both 
asset vulnerability and resilience. The objective is to establish a link between the scores 
obtained following the assessment and potential solutions. 
1.0
It is important to remember that the scope of this handbook is limited to water assets 
in the context of climate change adaptation.

1.2_ PROJECT FRAMEWORK: WATER ASSETS AND HAZARDS
In order to limit research and focus on specific issues, only three climatic hazards have 
been selected, namely heavy precipitation, drought and storms. 
Each is represented in the handbook and tool by a specific colour and pictogram. 
These three hazards have been selected based on the scientific literature as well 
as on consultations with municipalities, which have identified them as the most urgent 
to address because they are the most frequent in Quebec (Ouranos, 2020). 
Regarding the assets selected, the most frequently cited in discussions about the needs 
of professionals working at the municipal level are water assets. 
The assets considered are therefore the following:
	
• Drinking water infrastructure 
	
	
- Supply and treatment 
	
	
- Distribution
	
• Wastewater infrastructure 
	
	
- Collection (sanitary, stormwater and combined sewer systems) 
	
	
- Treatment
Note: Flooding from overflowing watercourses is not considered in this project; 
only backup and flooding caused by sewer and stormwater system overflows are 
considered.

1.3_ DEFINITION OF RESILIENCE 
1.3.1_ RESILIENCE 
Resilience can be defined in different ways. For the purposes of this handbook, and to 
define “water asset resilience” in the context of climate change, CERIU uses the Institute 
of Asset Management’s definition. To best meet the needs of Quebec municipalities, the 
municipalities forming part of the working group were consulted to develop the ideal 
definition of “resilience.”
Knowing a municipality’s vulnerability to climatic hazards makes it easier to predict future 
hazards. It is important to assess it properly, as this assessment will determine the actions 
to be taken.
Vulnerability can be considered as the risk identification step. This step assesses past 
risks in order to anticipate and mitigate future ones.
1.3.2_ STEPS IN RESILIENCE
1.3.2.1_ Vulnerability assessment
Resilience: Ability of an organization or system to withstand and recover from a major 
disruption, shock or stress, ensuring continued operation and provision of service 
(adapted from the Institute of Asset Management, n.d.).
Vulnerability: Degree to which a system is susceptible to, or unable to cope with, 
adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes (Ville de 
Montréal, 2017).
10
The tool provides an assessment of resilience around five topics (see Figure  2). 
This breakdown corresponds to the various steps:
KNOWLEDGE OF RISK AND AWARENESS 
Questions to ask: 
• What are the different types of risks?
• What are the impacts of climate change on service levels?
—
Identifying the risks to which a municipality’s water assets are exposed is the first step 
in assessing its resilience to those risks. This includes hazards associated with known 
weather events, as well as predicted and projected hazards based on long-term trends 
associated with climate change.
PREVENTION AND ADAPTATION 
Question to ask:
• What preventive measures should be put in place? 
—
After identifying and understanding the risks to which it is exposed, a municipality can 
put in place practices to improve alertness to weather events that could put a huge strain 
on its system. Adjustments can also be made to the system to make it more resilient 
during an intense weather event.
REACTION TO AN EVENT 
Questions to ask:
• What measures should be implemented during and immediately after the event?
• Who is responsible for what?
—
When a weather event affecting water assets occurs, various measures can be put in place 
to mitigate the impact on these assets, the functions they perform, and the population 
that benefits from them. These include measures implemented in the very short term, 
either during the event, when conditions permit, or immediately afterwards.

_
RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION 
Questions to ask: 
• How can we recover after the event? 
• Is reinforcement or adaptation work also required?
—
Resilience also depends on the implementation of resources and solutions to recover 
the functions lost, suspended or affected by the event under study. The faster a munici-
pality is able to return its assets to normal operations, the more resilient it is. This involves 
implementing temporary measures and introducing practices that enable feedback 
on how the municipality reacted during the event, in order to learn from it.
STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT AND PLANNING
Questions to ask:
• How can we close the gaps, address risks and adapt to them? 
• How can we integrate actions into asset management plans? 
• How can we increase the long-term resilience of water infrastructure?  
—
Proper management of municipal infrastructure requires a methodical approach to 
planning and decision-making. In addition to short- and medium-term solutions that 
can be implemented in response to an event, a municipality can improve its long-term 
resilience by integrating measures into its asset management plan.

1.4_ RESILIENCE: ASSESSMENT AND BENEFITS  
These days, it is important to assess the resilience of municipal infrastructure in order 
to guard against the various climatic hazards. Knowing the resilience of its infrastructure 
enables a municipality to prioritize its most vulnerable assets.  
 
Following analysis of the questions for each topic, it is relevant to identify areas 
for improvement so that the municipality can implement or improve its regulations and 
policies.  
Water asset resilience is assessed using the Excel tool, as detailed in Section 2.

TOOL DESCRIPTION 
2.1_ TOOL FEATURES
The Resilience Self-Assessment Tool is an easy-to-use Excel tool. It consists of five tabs 
to be completed and eighteen tabs for reference. The objectives of each of these tabs are 
presented in Table 1 below.

Guidance sheets 3, 6, 9, 
12 and 13
Identifies potential solutions for Storms.
 A tab is dedicated to each of the hazards considered:
HEAVY PRECIPITATION
DROUGHT
STORMS
14
Each tab features a two-part multiple-choice questionnaire:
	
1. Vulnerability assessment (score)
	
2. Resilience assessment (score) 
The first part is designed to indicate to the municipality the extent to which it is vulnerable 
to the hazard, expressed as a score. 
The second part is designed to help the municipality identify their strengths and 
weaknesses with respect to the resilience of their water assets.
These tabs provide an overall view of the scores obtained in the five resilience topics.
The results are expressed using, among other things, pentagon graphs, which also display 
the acceptable threshold (see Section 2.4.2) for each topic, making it possible to identify 
priority actions. 
Once the three hazard tabs have been filled in, a summary of the results is displayed in the 
Assessment tab. The contents of this tab make it possible for the municipality to, among 
other things, start creating a roadmap, enabling it to draw up an initial list of actions to 
be taken. Relevant guidance sheets to refer to in order to adopt a new resilience strategy 
are also identified. 
To explore only one hazard, the user can fill in the relevant tab. However, the Assessment 
tab will remain incomplete. 
It should be noted that all the guidance sheets are available in this handbook in Section 3.2 
as well as in the tool’s dedicated tabs.
It is important to note that this tool is a frame of reference that can be adapted 
to different municipal assets using the same design.

It is strongly suggested to encourage consultation and exchanges between municipal 
staff when reflecting on the resilience of the municipality and when using this tool. 
2.2_ CONDITIONS FOR USING THE TOOL
You have to answer all questions for the tool to work properly. However, you may not have 
a response to one of the questions. In this situation, you can try to do the following:
If you don’t understand a question:
	
1. Refer to the glossary for definitions.
	
2. Consult other people who may better understand the question.
If you don’t know the response to a question:
	
1. Ask a colleague who may know the response, or set the response to the lowest 
score until you have an answer.
	
2. Consult other people (the information people from different fields have may help 
in understanding and answering the question).
2.3_ DESCRIPTION OF THE ASSESSMENT MECHANISM 
Each hazard is assessed using about 30  questions (see Table  2 for a breakdown of the 
questions). Responses to these questions are weighted on a scale of 1 to 10. Scores are 
obtained by topic (vulnerability, knowledge of risk and awareness, prevention and 
adaptation, reaction to an event, recovery and reconstruction, strategic management 
and planning) by averaging response weights.

explanations.
SCORE
INTERPRETATION  
EXPLANATIONS 
Vulnerability 
> 8 
Very High 
The municipality has already faced climatic hazards that 
have severely impacted its system. The municipality may 
be in a risk zone where its assets can no longer provide 
the initial service. 
Given that the municipality has already been affected 
by climatic hazards, and that trends are on the rise, it is 
important in this case to have action plans to better adapt.
5 > X ≥ 8 
High 
The municipality has already faced climatic hazards, 
which have had major consequences for the system. 
Given that the municipality has already been affected 
by climatic hazards, and that trends are on the rise, it is 
important in this case to have action plans to better adapt. 
2 > X ≥ 5
Moderate 
The municipality has already faced climatic hazards with 
consequences for the system and services. 
To avoid increasing vulnerability, it is advisable to 
implement a climate change adaptation plan. 
< 2 
Low 
The municipality has not faced many climatic hazards in 
the past.
It would appear that its geographic position and/or the 
quality of its infrastructure enables proper functioning 
of the services. However, the future can change these 
conditions and cause the municipality to be more 
impacted.
Resilience
> 7
Good score 
It is not necessary to prioritize these actions, but the user 
is invited to refer to the guidance sheets to learn more 
about the subject. 
4 ≤ X ≤ 7
Average score 
Decisions need to be taken to implement the necessary 
actions. The tool’s documentation can be used to learn 
more about the subject in question.
≤ 4
Poor score
Action to be prioritized. The guidance sheets refer to 
examples of solutions as well as documentation to 
implement new actions.

Regardless of the scores obtained, the user is invited to take a look at the potential solutions 
provided in the guidance sheets.
However, if the scores are average or poor, it is more than necessary to find out what 
best practices can be put in place to increase the resilience of the topic concerned. It is 
recommended that you refer to the guidance sheets where appropriate. 
2.5_ ASSESSMENT AND ROADMAP
The Assessment tab in the Excel tool has been designed so that it can be printed. It consists 
of four pages divided into three parts:
	
• Results by hazard 
	
• Results by resilience topic 
	
• Roadmap
2.5.1_ ASSESSMENT OF RESULTS 
The results by hazard are presented in the form of two summary tables, one for vulnerability 
and one for resilience (Figure 5), as well as a radar diagram highlighting the resilience 
scores for the three hazards (Figure 6).

Figure 8: Results by resilience topic
	
• If the results are in a red zone, then it is necessary to prioritize actions to be taken to 
reduce the vulnerability or increase the resilience of the municipality’s water assets.
	
• Results in an orange or yellow zone are considered average. Such situations are 
not a priority if there are worse results, but they may eventually deteriorate, so it is 
important to take them into account.
	
• Results in the green zones are quite good, and the actions to be taken are not 
necessarily priorities. 
The graphs (see Figure 8) on these pages represent the results of the three hazards for a 
given resilience topic.
They make it possible to establish a link between the scores obtained for the various 
topics and overall vulnerability. On these graphs, vulnerability is displayed on the x-axis, 
and resilience on the y-axis. 
The further the hazard is to the left, the more actions are required.
Note: It is very important to bear in mind that the evolution of climate change is rapid and 
non-linear. Results are valid for a limited period of time. It is recommended to update your 
answers annually.

2.5.2_ ROADMAP 
The roadmap (see Figure  9) summarizes the results obtained to encourage reflection 
about the actions to be taken and prioritized. Different sections provide a starting point 
for reflection. 
Some sections are already prefilled, such as “Suggested areas to work on” and “Suggested 
actions.”
Areas to work on correspond to a topic–hazard pair. The three pairs with the lowest scores 
are automatically displayed. The municipality can select additional areas from a drop-
down list in the “Other areas to work on” table.
To maintain realistic goals, it is preferable not to add too many areas to work on. 
Suggested actions are generated based on the results obtained. The first actions shown 
are those associated with the worse results obtained and are accompanied by a suggestion 
to look at the guidance sheets for potential solutions.
Figure 9: Results by resilience topic
STRATEGIC ROADMAP
Note: Results are valid for a limited period of time. It is recommended that you update 
your answers annually. This is why the deadline for the “follow-up” action is automatically 
populated with a date one year after the tool has been filled in.

The last section is left blank. This is where the municipality can fill in the actions it wants 
to prioritize (see Figure 10). 
The roadmap is designed to foster discussion between the various municipal actors. It 
is necessary to discuss with the team or committee in charge about whether the results 
are consistent and correspond to what is expected. This section also makes it possible to 
assign responsibilities for the actions to be taken. Regular meetings of the committee will 
ensure the proper course of the chosen actions.

POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS  
3.1_ HOW TO USE THIS SECTION 
In the previous step, the tool identified possible gaps in the resilience of water assets. The 
results refer to specific guidance sheets presenting potential solutions and guide you to 
documents or references that can address the problems encountered. 
Thirteen guidance sheets have been created, each addressing a hazard and a specific 
resilience topic. Only Guidance sheet #13 is common to all three hazards (see Table 5).
These sheets are divided into several sections (see Figure 11): 
	
• A description of the resilience step under consideration.
	
• A potential solution section includes general ideas for improving resilience based 
on the topic of the guidance sheet.
	
• A reference section introduces materials that can be consulted to implement 
actions to improve resilience. In this section, an overview of each reference is 
provided to guide the user. It should be noted that some references are repeated 
on several guidance sheets as they cover multiple topics and/or hazards. 
The guidance sheets are found in this handbook starting on page 27 as well as in the Excel 
tool associated with this handbook.

How can we close the gaps, address risks and adapt to them?
How can we integrate actions into asset management plans?
How can we increase the long-term resilience of water infrastructure?
—
Proper management of municipal infrastructure requires a methodical approach to planning and 
decision-making. This approach is all the more important in the context of climate change. In 
addition to short- and medium-term solutions that can be implemented in response to an event, 
how can a municipality improve its long-term resilience by integrating measures into its asset 
management plan?
The risks to be considered can be identified in different ways:
Policy, strategic plan and action plan
These documents play an important role in asset management. Policies make it possible to monitor 
the application of certain measures, while informing the residents and stakeholders of the reasons 
for their application.
Project funding: identify necessary projects and advocate for funding 
In addition to policies, it is important to identify a funding plan for projects covered by the strategic 
asset management plan.
Monitoring and continuous improvement
In the context of climate change, it is appropriate to adopt living plans both to reflect the changing 
climate itself, but also to promote the continuous improvement of practices within a municipality.
A guide developed by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities addressing actions to improve 
climate change resilience within a municipality’s water asset management plan.

3.2.1.1_ Potential solutions 
For the “Knowledge of risk and awareness” topic, there are three types of generic solutions:
A – History of events and consequences observed:
This section is related to the study of historical climate data to determine the exposure 
and potential vulnerabilities of the territory under study. 
As a result, it is possible to develop an overall climate picture allowing the design criteria 
for water assets to be adjusted based on the results obtained. 
B – Projected risk assessment: 
After assessing past and present risks, it is necessary to study climate projection data in 
order to gain a vision of the territory’s future. 
C – Vulnerability assessment:
It is important to know the condition of water assets to determine whether they can 
withstand large-scale events.

What are the different types of risk associated with climate change?
What are the impacts of these risks on water infrastructure service levels?
—
Identifying the risks to which a municipality’s water assets are exposed is the first step in assessing 
its resilience to those risks. In this case, the focus is on hazards associated with known weather 
events, as well as on predictions and projections based on long-term trends associated with 
climate change, particularly in terms of the increase in precipitation and heavy rainfall events.
The risks to be considered can be identified in different ways:
History of events and consequences observed
This category explores the history of precipitation and climate data of a given territory to draw 
up a portrait of major climate events, particularly in relation to the increase in heavy precipitation 
events. This will allow for the adjustment of, among other things, design criteria based on past 
observations.
Projected risk assessment
In addition to historical data, it is important to consider climate change projection data. A number of 
organizations at the national and provincial levels provide data to help provide an overview of the 
climate changes expected in the coming years for a given territory.
Vulnerability assessment
In addition to climate data, it is also important for a municipality to have full control of its water 
assets in order to be able to determine those that may be vulnerable to, and therefore impacted by, 
the risks identified in A and B.

Identifying the risks to which a municipality’s water assets are exposed is the first step in assessing 
its resilience to those risks. In this case, the focus is on hazards associated with known weather 
events, as well as on predictions and projections based on long-term trends associated with climate 
change, particularly in terms of the increase in intense heat and prolonged drought. These have an 
impact on many aspects of water management and water infrastructure, including drinking water.
Rising temperatures and longer drought periods are impacting water assets on several fronts, 
including drinking water management. The risks to be considered can be identified in different ways:
History of events and consequences observed
This first category explores the history of precipitation and climate data of a given territory to draw 
up a portrait of major climate events, particularly in relation to the increase in heavy precipitation

Projected risk assessment
In addition to historical data, it is important to consider climate change projection data. A number 
of organizations at the national and provincial levels provide data outlining the climate changes 
expected in the coming years for a given territory.

—
Identifying the risks to which a municipality is exposed is the first step in assessing its resilience to 
those risks. It is important to know about weather events in a given territory. 
In recent years, the frequency of storms with high winds has increased. Several municipalities, 
including their drinking water and wastewater systems, have been impacted to varying degrees by 
these events. In this case, the hazard mainly affects the power supply to water assets.
This guidance sheet presents the impacts of storms and high winds in terms of the power outages 
it can cause.
History of events and consequences observed
This first category explores the history of precipitation and climate data of a given territory to draw 
up a portrait of major climate events, particularly in relation to the increase in heavy precipitation 
events. This will allow for the adjustment of, among other things, design criteria based on past 
observations, particularly in terms of redundancy or the installation of emergency generators. 
Projected risk assessment
In addition to historical data, it is important to consider climate change projection data. A number 
of organizations at the national and provincial levels provide data outlining the climate changes 
expected in the coming years for a given territory.
Vulnerability study
In addition to climate data, it is also important for a municipality to have full control of its water 
assets in order to be able to determine those that may be vulnerable to, and therefore impacted by, 
the risks identified in A and B. Depending on how the municipality’s systems are built, this hazard 
may impact both drinking water and wastewater assets.

What measures should be put in place to reduce the vulnerability of water infrastructure and 
the resulting loss of associated functions following a weather event?
—
After identifying and understanding the risks to which it is exposed, a municipality can put in 
place practices to improve alertness to weather events that could put a huge strain on its system. 
Adjustments can also be made to the system to make it more resilient during a heavy precipitation 
event, for example.
Infrastructure configuration and condition to address risks
In order to improve the resilience of assets, solutions related to their configuration can be 
implemented. These involve both design elements to address greater (increased volumes, 
flows) and more frequent precipitation. This category includes, for example, optimal stormwater 
management practices.
Hazard and asset monitoring
In addition to a design better adapted to hazards, it is relevant to have a system to monitor and 
predict them in order to improve a municipality’s preparedness for weather events. The same is 
true for assets. Monitoring their status allows for intervention at the right time.
Prevention program and regulations
Solutions in line with the regulations in place to reduce the amount of rainwater being returned to 
the system.

3.2.3_ STEP 3: REACTION TO AN EVENT 
3.2.3.1_ Potential solutions 
A – Emergency response plan
A set of resources and procedures for a rapid response by operational intervention 
teams in the event of an emergency affecting water infrastructure service levels. These 
measures include resources that can be put in place to mitigate a short- or medium-term 
disruption (interruption or breakdown) in service. They can also include what residents 
should do to preserve their own safety during a major event affecting their quality of life. 
Often, the emergency response plan answers the question: Who does what?  This is about 
governance.
B – Alert and communication
Who needs to know about your municipality’s alert channel? What information should be 
communicated during a hazard event? These are examples of relevant questions that a 
municipality must answer in order to build an effective communication plan that will be 
used to complement the emergency response plan in the event of risks affecting water 
infrastructure service levels.

When a weather event affecting water assets occurs, various measures can be put in place to 
mitigate the impact on these assets, the functions they perform, and the population that benefits 
from them. These measures differ from those presented in Section 2, Prevention and adaptation, 
as they are measures implemented in the very short term, either during the event, when conditions 
permit, or immediately afterwards. These are included, among other things, in an emergency 
response plan that includes the roles and responsibilities of the authorities, as well as those of the

Various measures have been presented to prepare for and respond to an extreme event that 
disrupts a municipality’s water assets. However, resilience also depends on the implementation 
of resources and solutions to recover the functions lost, suspended or affected by the event under 
study. The faster a municipality is able to return its assets to normal operations, the more resilient 
it is. This involves not only implementing temporary measures, but also introducing practices that 
enable feedback on how the municipality reacted during the event in order to learn from it and 
adjust to better prepare for the next event.

3.2.5_ STEP 5: STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT AND PLANNING
3.2.5.1_ Potential solutions 
A – Policy, strategic plan and action plan
These documents play an important role in asset management. Policies make it possible to 
monitor the application of certain measures, while informing the residents and stakeholders 
of the reasons for the application. The strategic plan enables planned management that 
includes the development and implementation of action plans and programs for asset 
creation, operation, maintenance, rehabilitation or replacement.
B – Project funding: identify necessary projects and advocate for funding
In addition to policies, it is important to identify a funding plan for projects covered by the 
strategic asset management plan.
C – Monitoring and continuous improvement
In the context of climate change, it is appropriate to adopt living plans both to reflect the 
changing climate itself, but also to promote the continuous improvement of practices 
within a municipality.

How can we integrate actions into asset management plans?
How can we increase the long-term resilience of water infrastructure?
—
Proper management of municipal infrastructure requires a methodical approach to planning and 
decision-making. This approach is all the more important in the context of climate change. In 
addition to short- and medium-term solutions that can be implemented in response to an event, 
how can a municipality improve its long-term resilience by integrating measures into its asset 
management plan? High-level consideration of the approach is therefore needed to determine, 
among other things, how to characterize the risks that threaten a municipality and how to ensure 
that emergency and response plans are kept up to date. 
The risks to be considered can be identified in different ways:
Policy, strategic plan and action plan
These documents play an important role in asset management. Policies make it possible to 
monitor the application of certain measures, while informing the residents and stakeholders of 
the reasons for their application. The strategic plan enables planned management that includes 
the development and implementation of action plans and programs for asset creation, operation, 
maintenance, rehabilitation or replacement.
Project funding: identify necessary projects and advocate for funding 
In addition to policies, it is important to identify a funding plan for projects covered by the strategic 
asset management plan.
Monitoring and continuous improvement
In the context of climate change, it is appropriate to adopt living plans both to reflect the changing 
climate itself, but also to promote the continuous improvement of practices within a municipality.

CONCLUSION
The Water Asset Resilience Best Practices in the Context of Climate Change handbook 
provides a simplified approach to climate resilience adapted to water assets for 
municipalities. Together with the associated Excel spreadsheet, they provide all the 
information the user needs to implement a resilient approach to managing water assets.
The analysis of vulnerability and resilience scores is used to develop a roadmap for 
integrating climate change into the management of the municipality’s assets.
In order to implement best asset management practices, all initiatives aimed at resilience 
must be integrated into the municipality’s asset management planning documents.
There are benefits to using this handbook, but also challenges that each municipality 
would be well advised to take up, for example, through exchanges between peers and 
neighbouring municipalities, or by continuing to develop knowledge on the subject. Note 
that the handbook and tool are general support tools limited to certain hazards and assets. 
As each municipality has its own specific challenges, it is advisable to adapt as necessary 
the reflection on resilience and climate change, which is becoming increasingly frequent 
and violent.
