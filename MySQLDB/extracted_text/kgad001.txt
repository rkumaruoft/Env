Abstract
Political advocacy is arguably the most powerful form of action that citizens concerned about climate change can take. One motivator
for political advocacy is the perception that there is a social norm (i.e. inherently understood social rules and standards that serve to
guide social behaviors) for doing so. Using nationally representative survey data (N ¼ 1303), we examined the association of three
types of social norms—descriptive norms (i.e. perceptions about how many other people perform a behavior), retrospective and pro-
spective dynamic norms (i.e. perceptions that a behavior has become more or less common in the past or will in the future)—with
intentions to engage in political advocacy in the upcoming year and past advocacy. We found that descriptive norms and prospective
dynamic norms were positively related to advocacy intentions, while only prospective dynamic norms were positively related to past
advocacy (retrospective dynamic norms were negatively related to both outcomes, contrary to our theorized direction). Furthermore,
we examined whether the relationship between norms and intentions/behaviors differed based on political party identiﬁcation and
four potential mediators of this relationship: identiﬁcation with climate activists; collective efﬁcacy (i.e. the belief that people can en-
gage in climate advocacy and that it will make a difference); collective response efﬁcacy (i.e. beliefs about the results of advocacy);
and injunctive norms (i.e. perceptions of others’ approval of advocacy). In the moderated mediation models, we found that party
identiﬁcation moderated the relationships between descriptive norms and prospective dynamic norms and advocacy intention,
while retrospective dynamic norms were not related as theorized. These relationships were mediated by identiﬁcation with climate
activists and collective efﬁcacy as well as by injunctive norms in the case of descriptive norms. Party identiﬁcation also moderated
the relationship between descriptive norms and past advocacy; this relationship was mediated by identiﬁcation with climate acti-
vists and injunctive norms. Taken together, these ﬁndings underscore the potential importance of perceived descriptive norms and
prospective dynamic norms on political advocacy to address climate change, extending both well-established and emerging research
and providing insights useful for academics and practitioners alike.
Lay Summary
Political advocacy (e.g. contacting elected ofﬁcials via phone or email, attending a march or public demonstration, etc.) is a powerful
form of climate action available to citizens in democratic societies. A relationship may exist between various forms of perceived so-
cial norms (i.e. inherently understood social rules and standards that serve to guide social behaviors) about political advocacy and a
citizen’s likelihood of engaging in such advocacy. To investigate, we examined the association of descriptive norms (i.e. perceptions
about how many other people perform the behavior) and dynamic norms (i.e. perceptions about the behavior becoming more or less
common in the recent past or in the near future) with climate advocacy. We found that descriptive norms were associated with advo-
cacy intentions, and dynamic norms were associated with both advocacy intentions and behaviors although the dynamic norm
about past behaviors was in the opposite direction of what we expected. We also examined the roles of several theoretically relevant
beliefs—identiﬁcation with climate activists, collective efﬁcacy (i.e. the belief that people can engage in climate advocacy and that it
will make a difference), collective response efﬁcacy (i.e. beliefs about the results of advocacy) and injunctive norms (i.e. perceptions
of others’ approval of advocacy)—to determine if they help explain the relationship between perceived social norms and climate ad-
vocacy, and to determine if the relationships differ between Democrats and Republicans. We found that the relationships between
descriptive and dynamic norms about future changes and advocacy intentions differed by party identiﬁcation. Descriptive norms
were related to increased advocacy intentions for Independents and Republicans, while dynamic norms were related to increased ad-
vocacy intentions for Democrats. Identiﬁcation with climate activists, collective efﬁcacy and (for descriptive norms only) injunctive
norms helped explain these relationships. The relationship between descriptive norms and past advocacy behaviors was the only re-
lationship that differed by party identiﬁcation though we found other nuanced relationships. These ﬁndings indicate the potential
importance of different social norms on climate advocacy.

Introduction
Climate change is a complex issue with global implications.
Numerous scientific assessments have concluded that there is a
direct connection between the atmospheric warming resulting
from greenhouse gas emissions and the profound environmental
changes that follow [1, 2]. Furthermore, these changes are harm-
ing the lives, communities and livelihoods of people worldwide,
and are projected to worsen [2]. The extent to which these
impacts get worse depends greatly on whether or not actions to
combat climate change and adapt to its present and future risks
are taken.
In order to make progress on climate change mitigation and
adaptation, a stronger climate policy is needed [3]. Increased citi-
zen and interest group advocacy is one means to encourage gov-
ernment officials to enact stronger climate policies [4–6]. In the
USA, however, this is a relatively uncommon behavior; only 2%
of Americans say that they are currently participating in a cam-
paign to urge elected officials to do more on climate change [7].
Prior research has identified the importance of descriptive social
norms—beliefs about how many others are performing a behav-
ior—in predicting political advocacy on climate change [8, 9].
This study investigates how perceived descriptive and dy-
namic norms and several mediators are related to climate advo-
cacy. We extend previous research by examining dynamic
norms’ (beliefs about how other people’s behavior is changing
over time) and descriptive norms’ association with climate
change advocacy. Furthermore, we examine several potential
mechanisms by which descriptive and dynamic norms may pre-
dict political advocacy—specifically, through shifting injunctive
norms (the beliefs that others approve of climate advocacy), in-
creasing identification with climate activists and increasing col-
lective efficacy (both the beliefs that people are capable of
engaging in climate advocacy and that it will make a difference).
However, given the cross-sectional nature of the data, we do not
draw direct conclusions about causality. While past research has
investigated the influence of dynamic norms on conservation
behaviors, to our knowledge, this study is the first to examine
whether dynamic norms predict political advocacy on climate
change [10, 11]. Below, we review previous research on climate
change advocacy and social norms as well as several variables
that may mediate the relationship between them.
Literature review
Climate advocacy
Although the majority of Americans believe that climate change
is occurring and are worried about it, climate advocacy has not
been a commonplace in the USA [12]. Only 2% of Americans say
that they are currently participating in a campaign to encourage
elected officials to reduce climate change, and 13% of Americans
say that they have contacted their elected officials about taking
action on the issue of climate change over the course of the past
year [7]. Although most Americans are not currently engaged in
climate advocacy, there is significant potential for growth in such
advocacy. As of April 2020, nearly one-third of Americans stated
that they ‘definitely’ (8%) or ‘probably’ (24%) would be willing to
participate in a campaign to convince elected officials to reduce
climate change [7]. In this study, we operationalized climate ad-
vocacy in two ways: having contacted an elected official during
the past 12 months to urge them to take action on global warm-
ing and intent to contact an elected official for this reason in the
next 12 months. While contacting elected officials can be done
through a variety of different channels, operationalizing it
broadly (i.e. any type of contact) allows us to capture the small
subset of individuals who engage in this type of advocacy on any
level. The remainder of this literature review will describe varia-
bles we hypothesize to be related to climate advocacy, which is
the same for both past and intended climate advocacy.
Social norms
Social norms are the rules and standards that are inherently un-
derstood by members of a group and serve to guide social behav-
iors [13]. The ‘focus theory of normative conduct’ distinguishes
between two types of social norms: injunctive and descriptive
[14]. Injunctive norms demonstrate what is either approved or
disapproved of in a situation, while descriptive norms demon-
strate what is commonly done [15]. These norms inform and in-
fluence
the
actions
of
individuals
by
defining
and
communicating what is socially acceptable [15].
Previous studies have demonstrated that social norms are re-
lated to political behaviors and attitudes (such as general and
climate-related advocacy and voting intentions) [16–18]. Such
prior studies demonstrate both the need and opportunity to ex-
plore such relationships in the context of climate-specific advo-
cacy behaviors. Below, we outline our expectations about the
relationship between perceived descriptive norms and perceived
dynamic norms with climate advocacy.
Perceived descriptive norms
Perceived descriptive norms are beliefs about what is typical or
normal to do, believe, think or feel [19, 20]. Rather than referring
to what ought to be done, believed, thought or felt (i.e. injunctive
norms), descriptive norms refer to what is actually done, be-
lieved, thought or felt [19]. Individuals who are important to a
person, such as friends and family, coworkers, neighbors and
others in an individual’s socio-physical context, can influence
that person’s perceptions of what is commonly done [21].
Perceived descriptive norms exert powerful influences on
behaviors, beliefs and values because people tend not to want to
deviate from socially defined standards [22]. These norms show
what actions are likely to be effective and adaptive; if others are
doing, thinking or believing something, then it must be a reason-
able thing to do, think or believe [14]. This enables individuals to
create mental shortcuts for making behavioral decisions in any
given situation [14]. The availability, processing and communica-
tion of normative information are important influences in social
conformity. This allows perceived descriptive norms to influence
behaviors, values and beliefs [23].
Social norms have been shown to influence political advocacy
behaviors and may be a key component to closing the gap be-
tween those saying they ‘would participate’ and those who ‘are
actually participating’ in such behaviors. Gerber and Rogers [18]
experimentally tested several normative appeals around voting
behaviors, including both descriptive and dynamic norms. They
found that increasing perceived descriptive norms increased
respondents’ intentions to vote, thus demonstrating a causal re-
lationship. In a longitudinal study, Latkin et al. found that per-
ceived
social
norms
were
associated
with
an
individual’s
willingness to engage in climate change advocacy communica-
tions; however, the measure of social norms used by Latkin et al.
[17] combined both descriptive and injunctive norms, which we
distinguish from one another in the present study. Also using a
combined measure of social norms, another study found that
perceived social norms were significantly associated with percep-
tions of global warming’s importance as a voting issue [24]. Other

recent studies suggest that descriptive norms also predict climate
advocacy, such as contacting elected officials or attending a pro-
test about climate change [8, 9].
H1: The perceived descriptive norm related to engaging in cli-
mate advocacy will have a positive effect on climate advocacy
intention and behavior.
Dynamic norms
Unlike perceived descriptive norms that refer to current percep-
tions, perceived dynamic norms (sometimes referred to as ‘trend-
ing norms’) refer to the perception of how a behavior, attitude or
belief is changing over time [10, 11, 25, 26]. An example of a per-
ceived dynamic norm is an individual’s perception that recycling
is becoming more (or less) prevalent in their community, whereas
the perceived descriptive norm is their belief about the current
prevalence of the behavior.
While prior research has investigated the influence of descrip-
tive norms on behaviors, attitudes and beliefs, dynamic norms
have received little attention until recently [10, 11, 25, 27, 28].
These newer studies have found that dynamic norms can also in-
fluence behaviors. Previous studies suggest that if a behavior is
perceived to be increasing—even if still practiced only by a minor-
ity of people—then there is a higher likelihood that people will
adopt the behavior themselves. Mortensen et al. [10] conducted an
experiment on the influence of dynamic norms on donations to
environmental causes. They found that a message conveying a
trending minority norm produced a higher amount of conformity
to the behavior than both a control (no norm) condition and a cur-
rent descriptive norm condition [10]. Moreover, they found the ef-
fect was mediated by participants’ estimates about how the
performance of the behavior was expected to change in the future.
Sparkman and Walton [11] conducted a series of studies inves-
tigating the influence of dynamic norms on meat consumption.
Similar to Mortensen et al. [10], they found exposure to dynamic
norm messages influenced participants’ intent to consume less
meat as well as their actual meat consumption. Furthermore,
Loschelder et al. [29] found that using dynamic norms as an inter-
vention for sustainable consumption helped customers increase
their usage of reusable alternatives to disposable plastic cups. In
addition to perceived descriptive norms, Gerber and Rogers [18]
also investigated dynamic norms—though they were not named
as such—and found that communicating a positive dynamic
norm (i.e. more people are voting) about voter turnout increases
intentions to vote. Lastly, it has also been experimentally estab-
lished that demonstrating dynamic norms about anger surround-
ing political inaction can lead to increased policy support [30].
In addition to perceived descriptive norms, the present study
explores the relationship between perceived dynamic norms and
climate advocacy. We distinguish between two types of dynamic
norms: prospective and retrospective. We conceptualize retrospec-
tive dynamic norms as perceptions of how others’ behaviors ‘have
changed’ over a specified time in the recent past leading up to the
present. In contrast, prospective dynamic norms refer to percep-
tions of how others’ behaviors ‘will change’ in the future [11].
H2: The perceived retrospective dynamic norm related to en-
gaging in climate advocacy will have a positive effect on cli-
mate advocacy intention and behavior.
H3: The perceived prospective dynamic norm related to engag-
ing in climate advocacy will have a positive effect on climate
advocacy intention and behavior.
Potential mediators
Injunctive norms
As previously stated, injunctive norms are another form of social
norms. Injunctive norms refer to beliefs about the extent to
which an attitude or behavior is approved or disapproved of in a
given situation [15, 31]. Because people often infer others’ moti-
vation based on observing their behavior, descriptive norms can
sometimes shape injunctive norms [25, 32]. Moreover, when de-
scriptive and injunctive norms are aligned, they can work to-
gether to enforce a desired behavior [33]. In one recent study,
injunctive norms were found to mediate the effect of perceived
dynamic norms on behavioral intentions in the case of avoiding
screen use before going to bed [25]. Based on these findings, in-
junctive norms are hypothesized to serve as a mediator of the re-
lationship between retrospective and prospective dynamic norms
and the past and intended contacting of elected officials about
global warming.
Identification with climate activists
Social identity is an important part of the self-concept and has
proven to be a strong predictor of action when that behavior is
perceived to be consistent with one’s identity [34, 35]. Moreover,
identification plays a key role in advocacy behavior [36]; people
who identify as an activist are more likely to engage in future ad-
vocacy behavior, regardless of the issue [37]. This is an important
consideration when seeking to engage people in climate advo-
cacy. In November 2019, 38% of Americans identified with cli-
mate activists, and 53% of Americans said that they support
climate activists who are contacting elected officials [38]. How
people perceive activists may play a role in their own engage-
ment in advocacy as people’s willingness to even associate with
activists has been shown to be influenced by their perceptions of
such individuals [39]. Perceptions of descriptive and dynamic
norms may help shift peoples’ perceptions of who can be a cli-
mate activist by demonstrating that people like them engage in
the behavior; this may influence their own ability to identify with
such activists by eliminating common stereotypes associated
with climate activists [39]. One study found that dynamic norms
increased a variety of behaviors, such as avoiding sugary drinks,
by increasing identification with those who choose not to con-
sume them [25]. This indicates the potential for cultivating cli-
mate action through identification with climate activists. Thus,
we included identification with climate activists as a mediator in
our hypothesized models.
Efficacy
Efficacy beliefs—the belief that one is capable of planning and
performing a course of action—are a key antecedent to behavior
[40]. Here, we focus specifically on perceived collective efficacy
(perceptions that one’s group is capable of acting together to per-
form its tasks), and collective response efficacy1 (beliefs about
the outcome or results of the group’s work). Collective efficacy
has been shown to predict engagement in advocacy generally,
and in climate advocacy in particular [8, 9, 36, 41–43].
Of particular interest here, Doherty and Webler [9] found that
descriptive norms were a strong predictor of climate advocacy,
having both a direct and indirect effect on advocacy through in-
creased perceptions of collective efficacy and collective response
1
Bandura [40] terms this ‘outcome expectancy’ rather than ‘collective re-
sponse efficacy’ as we have here. While we recognize this overlapping
conceptualization, we have chosen to follow the categorization of forms
of efficacy presented by Doherty and Webler [9] and use the term collec-
tive response efficacy throughout this article.

efficacy. Another study found that dynamic norms have an indi-
rect effect on the avoidance of sugary drinks and smoking to-
bacco via an increased sense of self-efficacy—showcasing the
mediating role of self-efficacy in enacting behaviors [25]. We
hypothesize:
H4: A perceived descriptive norm will have a positive indirect
effect on climate advocacy via (a) an increased injunctive
norm about the importance of taking action to reduce global
warming, (b) increased identification with climate activists, (c)
increased perceived collective efficacy, and (d) increased col-
lective response efficacy.
H5: A retrospective dynamic norm will have a positive indirect
effect on climate advocacy via (a) an increased injunctive
norm about the importance of taking action to reduce global
warming, (b) increased identification with climate activists, (c)
increased perceived collective efficacy, and (d) increased col-
lective response efficacy.
H6: A prospective dynamic norm will have a positive indirect
effect on climate advocacy via (a) an increased injunctive
norm about the importance of taking action to reduce global
warming, (b) increased identification with climate activists, (c)
increased perceived collective efficacy, and (d) increased col-
lective response efficacy.

Democrats are more likely than Republicans to understand that
human-caused climate change is happening, express greater
worry about it, support policies to address the problem and en-
gage in advocacy around the issue [12, 38, 47]. Importantly, some
evidence suggests that Republicans may be more sensitive than
Democrats to normative information about others’ climate
change beliefs [48]. This may be due to the greater importance
the
political
conservatives
(who
comprise
the
majority
of
Republicans) place on ingroup loyalty and conformity [49, 50]. As
a result, we expected party identification to function as a moder-
ator in our study, specifically:
H7: Party identification will moderate the direct and indirect
effects of (a) perceived descriptive norms, (b) retrospective dy-
namic norms, and (c) prospective dynamic norms on climate
advocacy such that the direct and indirect effects will be
weaker among Democrats compared to Republicans.
We summarize our hypotheses in the conceptual framework
depicted in Fig. 1.
Methods
Participants
Data for this study were collected via a nationally representative
survey of American adults (N ¼ 1303) aged 18 years and older
from 8 November to 20 November 2019. The sample population
was drawn from the Ipsos Knowledge Panel, an online panel of
members chosen using probability sampling methods. The re-
cruitment procedures included a combination of address-based
sampling techniques and random digit dialing, which covered
nearly
all
(noninstitutional)
resident
phone
numbers
and
addresses in the USA. To ensure a representative cross-section of
American adults regardless of access to technology, participants
who chose to partake in the study but did not have access to the
Internet were loaned computers and provided with Internet so
that they could participate. The survey questionnaire took an av-
erage of 25 min to complete. Supplementary Table S1 reports the
demographic frequencies of the sample population in terms of
gender, generation, education level, income bracket, race and
location.
Measures
Independent variables
Perceived descriptive norms
To measure perceived descriptive norms, participants were asked
about their perception of the current degree to which Americans
contact their elected officials regarding global warming. The sur-
vey item read, ‘In your estimation, over the past 12 months what
percentage of adults (18 years and older) in the United States con-
tacted elected officials to urge them to take action to reduce
global warming? If you’re not sure, please provide your best esti-
mate.’ To respond, participants were asked to use a sliding bar to
indicate the percentage on a 0–100% scale, and, if the sliding bar
failed to work, participants were instructed to manually enter
their responses (M ¼ 26.8, SD ¼ 20.2). To match the range of the
retrospective and prospective dynamic norms scales—and so
make the results more easily and intuitively interpretable—we
rescaled this item by dividing participant responses by 20
(M ¼ 1.34, SD ¼ 1.0).
Retrospective dynamic norms
To measure retrospective dynamic norms, participants were
asked to express how much they thought the percentage of
American adults who contacted their elected officials had
changed. The survey item asked, ‘Do you think over the past 12
months that the percentage of adults in the United States who
contacted elected officials to urge them to take action to reduce
global warming increased, decreased, or stayed the same?’
Responses
were
provided
on
a
Likert-like
scale
with
1 ¼ Decreased a lot and 5 ¼ Increased a lot (M ¼ 3.4, SD ¼ 0.7).
Prospective dynamic norms
In measuring prospective dynamic norms, the survey instrument
asked respondents about how they anticipate the number of
American adults who contacted their elected officials regarding
global warming will shift in the future. The survey item asked,
‘Do you think that over the next 12 months, the percentage of
adults in the United States who will contact elected officials to
urge them to take action to reduce global warming will increase,
decrease, or stay about the same?’ Participants were prompted to
respond on a Likert-like scale with 1 ¼ Decreased a lot and
5 ¼ Increased a lot (M ¼ 3.4, SD ¼ 0.7).
Mediators
Identification with climate activists
Survey participants were asked to what extent they identify with
climate activists. The survey item read, ‘How much, if at all, do
you identify with climate activists who urge elected officials to
take action to reduce global warming?’ Response options were
provided on a Likert-like scale with 1 ¼ Not at all and 4 ¼ A great
deal (M ¼ 2.1, SD ¼ 1.1).
Injunctive norms
Injunctive norms were measured by asking participants, ‘How
important is it to your family and friends that you take action to
reduce global warming?’ Response options ranged from 1 ¼ Not
at
all
important
to
5 ¼ Extremely
important
and

98 ¼ Don’t know (M ¼ 2.5, SD ¼ 1.2). ‘Don’t know’ responses were
treated as missing data.
Perceived collective efficacy
The mediator—perceived collective efficacy—was computed us-
ing three items within a grid question. The question read, ‘How
confident are you that people like you, working together, can. . .?’
The grid questions compiled for this mediator were, ‘. . .affect
what the federal government does about global warming’,
‘. . .affect what your state government does about global warm-
ing’ and ‘. . .affect what your local government does about global
warming’. Response options ranged from 1 ¼ Not at all confident

the mediator of identiﬁcation with climate activists, but not for the other mediators (H6b partially supported; Supplementary Tables S10–S13). The
indirect effect of prospective dynamic norms via identiﬁcation with climate activists was positive and signiﬁcant for Democrats (b ¼ 0.08, SE ¼ 0.02,
95% CI 0.04–0.13) and Independents (b ¼ 0.05, SE ¼ 0.02, 95% CI 0.03–0.08) but was nonsigniﬁcant for Republicans (b ¼ 0.03, SE ¼ 0.02, 95% CI 0.002,
0.06). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.

to 5 ¼ Extremely confident. A score of perceived collective effi-
cacy was calculated using these items (a¼0.92, M ¼ 2.3, SD ¼ 0.9).
Collective response efficacy
Collective response efficacy was measured by asking respondents
to consider how much elected officials are influenced by civil ac-
tion. The survey item asked, ‘When elected officials are consider-
ing policies to reduce global warming, how much do you think
they are influenced by the actions of citizens (for example, rallies,
marches, petitions, phone calls, emails, and letters)?’ Response
options ranged from 1 ¼ Not at all to 4 ¼ A great deal and included
98 ¼ Don’t know (M ¼ 2.3, SD ¼ 0.9). ‘Don’t know’ responses were
treated as missing data.
Moderator
Party identification
Participants were asked to respond to the question, ‘Generally
speaking, do you think of yourself as a. . ..’ Respondents could
choose from Republican, Democrat, Independent, Other and No
party/not interested in politics. Those who selected Independent
or Other were prompted to identify, in a follow-up question,
which party they lean toward via the question, ‘Do you think of
yourself as closer to the. . .’, with the response options of the
Republican party, Democratic party or Neither. These two items
were combined and recoded into a new variable that sorted the
responses into one of the five response categories: 1¼ Democrat,
2 ¼ Lean Democrat, 3 ¼ Independent, 4 ¼ Lean Republican and
5 ¼ Republican. Those who indicated ‘No party/not interested in
politics’ were treated as missing (M ¼ 2.5, SD ¼ 2.0).
Covariate
Risk perception
Because risk perception is a strong predictor of climate change
advocacy, it was included as a covariate in the models [8]. The
participants were given an 8-item measure asking how much
they believe global warming will harm themselves, their families,
people in the USA, future generations of people and plant and an-
imal species. Response options were on the 4-point scale of
0 ¼ Don’t know, 1 ¼ Not at all, 2 ¼ Only a little, 3 ¼ A moderate
amount, and 4 ¼ A great deal. A score for risk perception was cal-
culated by averaging these items (a ¼ 0.97). ‘Don’t know’
responses were treated as missing. Only cases that answered one
or more out of the eight items were included. For example, if only
six out of eight questions were answered and ‘Don’t know’ was
chosen for the other two, the average risk perception score was
calculated using only the six questions that were answered
(M ¼ 2.9, SD ¼ 1.0).
Dependent variables
Intent to contact elected officials
To measure respondents’ likelihood to contact elected officials,
three survey items were combined to create an index. The first
asked participants, ‘How willing or unwilling would you be to join
a campaign to convince elected officials to take action to reduce
global warming?’ Answers were given on a Likert-like scale with
1 ¼ I definitely would not do it and 5 ¼ I am participating in a
campaign like this now. The response options 98 ¼ Not sure and
99 ¼ Prefer not to answer were also available. The second and
third items were a part of a matrix asking, ‘How likely would you
be to do each of the following things if a person you like and re-
spect asked you to?’ The participants were presented with a
Figure 3. Note: Moderated mediation results predicting past advocacy behaviors for perceived descriptive norms, retrospective dynamic norms and
prospective dynamic norms. The indirect effect of perceived descriptive norms via response efﬁcacy was moderated by party identiﬁcation such that it

matrix of actions and were asked to rate their response to those
actions
with
1 ¼ Definitely
would
not,
4 ¼ Definitely
would,
98 ¼ Don’t know and 99 ¼ Prefer not to answer. The two matrix
items used for computing our variable were, ‘Write letters,
emails, or phone government officials about global warming’ and
‘Meet with an elected official or their staff about global warming’.
A variable was computed using the z-scores of these three items
to account for the differences in scales (A¼0.91, M ¼ 0.0, SD ¼ 0.8).
‘Don’t know’, ‘Not sure’ and ‘Prefer not to answer’ responses
were treated as missing data.
Past contacting of elected officials
Using two survey items, a variable representing the past advo-
cacy behavior of contacting elected officials was computed. One
asked, ‘Over the past 12 months, how many times have you done
the following? Written letters, emailed, or phoned government
officials about global warming.’ The participants answered on a
scale with 1 ¼ Never, 2 ¼ Once, 3 ¼ A few times (2–3), 4 ¼ Several
times (4–5), 5 ¼ Many times (6þ) and 0 ¼ Don’t know. The partici-
pants who responded to the previous questions with a 2, 3, 4 or 5
were given a follow-up question: ‘When you contacted a govern-
ment official did you. . ..’. Response options included 1 ¼ Urged
them to take action to reduce global warming? 2 ¼ Urged them
not to take action to reduce global warming? and 3 ¼ Other
(please specify). The participants who chose ‘1’ in response to the
follow-up question were coded as ‘1’ (n ¼ 143) and all other
responses were coded as ‘0’ (n ¼ 1109). ‘Don’t know’ responses
were treated as missing data.
Analyses
All hypotheses were made prior to conducting any analyses. We
first analyzed the data by conducting simple and logistic regres-
sions to assess overall associations between the three norm per-
ceptions and advocacy intentions and past advocacy (total
effects in mediation terminology). Next, we used Model 59 in the
PROCESS macro for SPSS to test our hypothesized models, which
uses an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression path-analytical
framework to estimate the moderated direct and indirect effects
(n.b., we utilize the term ‘effects’ as it is the common terminology
in mediation analyses literature; however, it should be empha-
sized that our analysis is conducted by utilizing cross-sectional
data, and as such results should be interpreted as correlational
rather than causational) [51].
The Model 59 provides bootstrapped point estimates and 95%
confidence intervals for all indirect effects present in the model.
Five thousand iterations were used to calculate bias-corrected
bootstrap estimates. This allowed us to test for the direct and in-
direct effects of perceived descriptive norms, retrospective dy-
namic
norms
and
prospective
dynamic
norms
on
past
engagement in contacting elected officials as well as future
intentions to do so. Specifically, the models sought to see if these
relationships were mediated by identification with climate acti-
vists, perceived collective efficacy, collective response efficacy or
injunctive norms, and if any of the relationships in the models
were moderated by party identification (moderation of indirect
effects was assessed by the pairwise contrasts between the condi-
tional indirect effects reported in the Supplementary materials).
For simplicity, we report only the results from the model that
included the moderation; however, as reported below, not all
interactions were significant. For all effects that were not signifi-
cantly moderated by party identification, reported coefficients
represent the effect of the independent variable when party
identification
is
equal
to
the
mean
of
2.78
(closest
to
‘Independents’ on the party identification scale). The sociodemo-
graphic variables of age, education, gender, race, income and po-
litical ideology as well as risk perception were included as
controls in the model.
More than 5% of the data were missing on some of the varia-
bles used in the model, meaning that the data cannot be consid-
ered missing completely at random; these variables were risk
perception, advocacy intentions, collective response efficacy and
injunctive norms. Therefore, to account for this missing data,
Hot-deck imputation with the baseline variables of age, gender
and education was utilized [52]. Correlations between all varia-
bles in the model were examined to assess the potential influ-
ence
of
multicollinearity
on
the
analyses.
No
correlations
exceeded 0.70, and simple linear regressions were run to evaluate
variance inflation factors (VIFs) and tolerances, resulting in VIFs
less than five and tolerance values greater than the minimum
threshold of 0.20; therefore, multicollinearity is not a major
concern [53].
As the PROCESS macro utilizes OLS linear regression, we ran a
post hoc sensitivity test using G*Power for a single regression co-
efficient in a linear multiple regression (within the t-test family)
[54]. For this test, our model had 80% power to detect an effect
size of f2 ¼ 0.006 at an alpha level of 0.05 (two-tailed) for a model
with 20 predictors (the sum of all covariates, interaction terms
and predictors). These results indicate that our model was ade-
quately powered (as the result demonstrated our model could de-
tect an effect size substantially smaller than even a ‘small’ effect
f2 ¼ 0.20, as described in Cohen [55]).
The results of these analyses should be interpreted with cau-
tion as using cross-sectional data in mediational analyses cannot
establish causal claims and may falsely establish mediation [56,
57]. As such, no causal conclusions about the relationships ob-
served in this study can be made and alternative explanations for
the identified relationships may exist.
Results
Advocacy intent
To test H1–H3, we first conducted a linear regression to examine
if the three types of norms—descriptive, retrospective and pro-
spective—predicted intentions to engage in advocacy while con-
trolling
for
age,
gender,
education,
income,
race,
party
identification, political ideology and risk perception.2 The analy-
sis indicated that 49% of the variance in advocacy intentions
could be explained by variance in the predictors, F(11, 1053) ¼
94.04, P < 0.001. Descriptive norms (b ¼ 0.11, t ¼ 5.38, P < 0.001),
retrospective dynamic norms (b ¼ 0.09, t ¼ 2.35, P ¼ 0.019) and
prospective dynamic norms (b ¼ 0.16, t ¼ 4.35, P < 0.001) each
accounted for significant variance in advocacy intentions; how-
ever, retrospective dynamic norms and advocacy intentions were
not related as hypothesized (Table 1; H1 and H3 supported; H2
not supported).3 We next turn to the analyses that decompose
these overall effects of the predictors into their direct and indirect
effects.

A summary of the results in table format can be found in the
Supplementary materials.

To help further illustrate the overall effects of the three different types of
norms on advocacy intentions, we provide mean values for advocacy
intentions at low versus high levels of norm perceptions with 95% CIs in
the Supplementary materials.

Perceived descriptive norms
Our first full model investigated the relationship between per-
ceived descriptive norms, the mediators and moderators, and
individuals’ intent to contact elected officials regarding global
warming (Fig. 2). The direct effect4 was significant (b ¼ 0.057,
SE ¼ 0.022, P ¼ 0.008) and was moderated by party identification
(binteraction ¼ 0.027, SE ¼ 0.012, P ¼ 0.03) such that perceived de-
scriptive norms had no direct effect among Democrats but had a
positive direct effect among Independents and Republicans, with
the effect being strongest among Republicans (H7a partially sup-
ported; Table 2). We also found partial support for H4. There was
a positive and significant indirect effect of perceived descriptive
norms on advocacy intentions through injunctive norms (H4a
supported), identification with climate activists (H4b supported)
and perceived collective efficacy (H4c supported), but there was
no indirect effect through collective response efficacy (H4d not
supported; Table 3). We found no evidence that party identifica-
tion significantly moderated the indirect effect of perceived de-
scriptive norms on intent to contact elected officials through any
of the mediators (Supplementary Tables S2–S5).
Retrospective dynamic norms
Our second model investigated the relationship between retro-
spective dynamic norms and an individual’s intent to contact
elected officials regarding global warming (Fig. 2). The direct ef-
fect
of
retrospective
dynamic
norms
was
not
significant
(b ¼ 0.064, SE ¼ 0.036, P ¼ 0.074) and was not moderated (binterac-
tion ¼ 0.018, SE ¼ 0.017, P ¼ 0.285; H7b not supported).
Additionally,
retrospective
dynamic
norms
had
no
indirect
effects on advocacy intentions through any of our hypothesized
mediators (H5 not supported; Table 4). Party identification did
not moderate the indirect effects of perceived retrospective dy-
namic norms on intentions to contact elected officials (H7b not
supported; Supplementary Tables S6–S9).
Prospective dynamic norms
Our third model investigated the relationship between prospec-
tive dynamic norms and intentions to contact elected officials re-
garding global warming (Fig. 2). The direct effect was not
significant (b ¼ 0.065, SE ¼ 0.036, P ¼ 0.07) but was moderated by
party identification (binteraction ¼ 0.041, SE ¼ 0.02, P ¼ 0.02) such
that the effect was positive and significant for Democrats, but
not for Independents and Republicans (H7c not supported;
Table 5). We also found partial support for H6. Prospective dy-
namic norms had positive indirect effects on intent to contact
elected officials through identification with climate activists and
perceived collective efficacy, respectively (H6b and H6c sup-
ported; Table 6). Prospective dynamic norms did not have an indi-
rect effect on advocacy intentions via injunctive norms and
collective response efficacy (H6a and H6d not supported). Party
identification moderated the indirect effect of prospective dy-
namic norms on intent to contact elected officials for the media-
tor of identification with climate activists but not for the other
mediators (H7c not supported; Supplementary Tables S10–S13).
The indirect effect of prospective dynamic norms via identifica-
tion with climate activists was positive for Democrats (indirect ¼
0.08, SE ¼ 0.02, 95% CI 0.04–0.13) and Independents (indirect ¼
0.05, SE ¼ 0.02, 95% CI 0.03–0.08) but was nonsignificant for
Republicans (indirect ¼ 0.03, SE ¼ 0.02, 95% CI 0.002, 0.06); the
opposite of expectations.
Past advocacy
To examine H1–H3, a logistic regression was run to examine if de-
scriptive, retrospective and prospective norms predicted past ad-
vocacy behavior while controlling for age, gender, education,
income, race, party identification, political ideology and risk per-
ception. The logistic regression model was statistically signifi-
cant, v2(11) ¼ 145.65, P < 0.001. This model explained 23.7%
(Nagelkerke R2) of the variance in past advocacy and correctly
classified 88.3% of the cases. By a small margin, descriptive
norms did not predict significant variance in past advocacy
(b ¼ 0.19, odds ratio ¼ 1.22, P ¼ 0.054). Retrospective (b ¼ 0.428,
odds ratio ¼ 0.65, P ¼ 0.024) and prospective (b ¼ 0.486, odds
ratio ¼ 1.63, P ¼ 0.011) dynamic norms did predict significant vari-
ance in past advocacy although retrospective norms did so in the
opposite of the hypothesized direction (Table 7; H1 and H2 not
supported; H3 supported). These results demonstrate that these
social norms are likely important for understanding the past ad-
vocacy behaviors.5
Perceived descriptive norms
Next, we turn to our model that investigated the relationship be-
tween perceived descriptive norms, the mediators and modera-
tors, and individuals’ past advocacy behaviors regarding global
warming (Fig. 3). After including the mediators in the model, the
direct effect was not significant (b ¼ 0.23, SE ¼ 0.15,P ¼ 0.123) but
was moderated by party identification (binteraction ¼ 0.25, SE ¼
0.09, P ¼ 0.005) such that there was no effect on Democrats and
Independents but had a positive direct effect among Republicans
(H7a partially supported; Table 8). We also found partial support
for H4. There was a positive indirect effect of perceived descrip-
tive norms on past advocacy behaviors through injunctive norms
(H4a) and identification with climate activists (H4b; Table 9).
However, there was no indirect effect of perceived descriptive
norms on past advocacy via collective efficacy and a negative in-
direct effect via collective response efficacy (H4c and H4d not
supported; Table 9). This indirect effect via response efficacy was
moderated by party identification though in the opposite pattern
to expectations (Supplementary Table S16; H7a not supported). It

The terms ‘direct effect’ and ‘indirect effect’ used throughout the Results
section are commonly used terms in reporting mediation results.
However, such effects refer only to relationships between variables and
are not meant to imply a causal mechanism.

different types of norms on past advocacy, crosstabs and chi-squares of
low versus high norm perceptions and past advocacy demonstrated that

0.043, 95% CI 0.062, 0.108). Party identification did not moderate
any of the other hypothesized indirect effects (Supplementary
Tables S14, S15 and S17).
Retrospective dynamic norms
The following model investigated the relationship between retro-
spective dynamic norms and an individual’s past advocacy
behaviors (Fig. 3). The direct effect was significant but negative
(b ¼ 0.736, SE ¼ 0.28, P ¼ 0.009) and was not moderated by party
identification (binteraction ¼ 0.14, SE ¼ 0.16, P ¼ 0.36; H7b not
supported). Retrospective dynamic norms had no indirect effects
on past advocacy behaviors through any of our hypothesized
mediators (H5 not supported; Table 10). Additionally, party iden-
tification did not moderate the indirect effects of retrospective
dynamic
norms
on
past
advocacy
(H7b
not
supported;
Supplementary Tables S18–S21).
Prospective dynamic norms
Our final model investigated the relationship between prospec-
tive dynamic norms and individuals’ past advocacy behaviors
(Fig. 3). The direct effect was not significant (b ¼ 0.27, SE ¼ 0.27,

nor

(b ¼ 0.19, SE ¼ 0.16, P ¼ 0.23; H7c not supported). The results
indicated that H6 was partially supported as prospective dy-
namic norms had positive indirect effects on past advocacy
behaviors through identification with climate activists and per-
ceived collective efficacy (H6b and H6c supported), but no indi-
rect effects through response efficacy and injunctive norms
(H6a and H6d not supported; Table 11). Party identification mod-
erated the indirect effects of prospective dynamic norms on in-
tent to contact elected officials through identification with
climate activists. The indirect effect of prospective dynamic
norms via identification with climate activists was positive for
Democrats (indirect ¼ 0.25, SE ¼0.09, 95% CI 0.12–0.48) and
Independents (indirect ¼ 0.14, SE ¼ 0.07, 95% CI 0.05–0.31) but
was nonsignificant for Republicans (indirect ¼ 0.06, SE ¼ 0.07,
95% CI 0.02, 0.24); this pattern of results was the opposite of
expectations (H7c not supported). Party identification did not
moderate the indirect effects of prospective dynamic norms
through collective efficacy, response efficacy or injunctive
norms (Supplementary Tables S22–S25).
Discussion
This study aimed to test and extend theories about the relation-
ship between social norms and climate advocacy. By examining
three types of social norms, this study explored the extent to

which perceived descriptive norms, prospective dynamic norms
and retrospective dynamic norms predict climate advocacy in
the form of past contacting of and future intent to contact one’s
elected officials about climate change.
We found that perceived descriptive norms predicted advo-
cacy intentions but did not predict (by a small margin) past advo-
cacy, partially supporting our first hypothesis. This discrepancy
indicates that descriptive norms may be important for driving fu-
ture advocacy intentions but may have less of an impact on
someone’s decision to actually take the action though we cannot
make causal claims based on our data. In the moderated media-
tion model, we found that perceived descriptive norms had a pos-
itive direct effect on advocacy intentions among Independents
and Republicans. This finding is consistent with past research
that suggests Republicans are more positively influenced than
Democrats by social consensus about climate change [48]. The
fact that these results surfaced even with a national comparison
level, rather than specifically other Republicans and friends/fam-
ily, indicates the potential for descriptive norms to be useful for
Republican audiences. Future research should explore additional
mechanisms that may be responsible for this effect.
Consistent with our expectations, we found that perceived de-
scriptive norms had a positive indirect effect on both advocacy
intentions and past advocacy through identification with climate
activists and injunctive norms. This may suggest that as people
perceive advocacy to be practiced by a greater number of people,
they are more likely to identify with at least some members of
that group and to perceive climate advocacy to be important to
others, encouraging them to participate in climate advocacy
themselves. However, as causality cannot be inferred from cross-
sectional data, it is also possible that those who have engaged in
climate advocacy in the past may have already self-identified as
a climate activist or believed others thought advocacy was impor-
tant prior to believing others are engaging in advocacy.
Contrary to prior research [9], the effect of descriptive norms
on advocacy intentions was mediated by collective efficacy but

not mediated by collective response efficacy. Previous research
that found an indirect effect through collective efficacy and col-
lective response efficacy did not account for the identification
with climate activists and injunctive norms as mediators in their
model [9]. This difference in the model specification or sampling
may be responsible for the discrepant findings though future re-
search should examine this issue more closely. Surprisingly, we
found that among Independents and Republicans, descriptive
norms had a negative indirect effect on past advocacy behavior
via collective response efficacy. One possible explanation for this
is that people in these groups may believe that there are many
Americans demanding climate action from their elected officials
with relatively little to show for it in terms of policy progress or
reductions in emissions. For example, news coverage tends to
emphasize information about the growing threat of climate
change with relatively less attention to the success of govern-
ment policy or the actions of advocates [58, 59]. As a result, these
individuals may have drawn the conclusion that elected officials
are unresponsive to the demands of average citizens and that
such efforts are not worth their time. Future research should in-
vestigate this and other explanations for this relationship.
In line with our third hypothesis, we found that prospective
dynamic norms—expectations about how climate advocacy will
change in the near future (i.e. the next 12 months)—were related
to advocacy intentions and past advocacy behavior. This finding
indicates that prospective dynamic norms may be particularly
important for shaping people’s climate advocacy intentions and
behaviors though we cannot make causal claims based on our
data. Furthermore, in the moderated mediation model, prospec-
tive dynamic norms were indirectly related to both advocacy
intentions and past advocacy via identification with climate acti-
vists and collective efficacy. We found that partisanship moder-
ated the positive indirect effect on both advocacy intentions and
past advocacy through identification with climate activists such
that the effect only emerged for Democrats and Independents
contrary to our expectations that the effect would be stronger
among
Republicans.
Although
prior
research
suggests
that
Republicans
and
conservatives
are
more
sensitive
than
Democrats and liberals to normative information, those findings
were based on current norm perceptions, beliefs, attitudes and
policy preferences—rather than advocacy, specifically [48]. It is
possible that differential partisan sensitivity may follow a differ-
ent
pattern
for
dynamic
norms
and
advocacy
behaviors.
Alternatively, it may be related to Republican resistance to identi-
fying with climate activists, even when they perceive climate ad-
vocacy to be on the rise. The fact that the indirect effect of
prospective dynamic norms through collective efficacy was not
moderated by partisanship suggests that addressing concerns
about collective efficacy could be a useful strategy to encourage
Republicans to engage in climate advocacy. These and other
explanations should be explored in future research.
In contrast, retrospective dynamic norms—perceptions about
how climate advocacy has recently changed (i.e. over the past 12
months)—did not predict advocacy intentions and negatively pre-
dicted both advocacy intentions and past advocacy; the direction
of this relationship was the opposite of what we hypothesized.
The fact that prospective dynamic norms positively predicted cli-
mate advocacy but retrospective norms did not have important
practical implications. Past studies have operationalized dynamic
norm messages by using a retrospective dynamic norm—telling
recipients about how the adoption of behavior has increased in
the recent past [10, 11]. Those studies found that the message
effects
were
mediated
by
a
prospective
dynamic
norm
perception—the expectation that the adoption of the behavior
would continue to increase in the future. Though not experimen-
tal, our study may suggest that it is important to ensure that
messages demonstrate to recipients that recent growth in a be-
havior is not simply ephemeral, but that it will be sustained over
time. Future research might test whether message content that
explicitly states that a trend is expected to continue into the fu-
ture helps enhance persuasiveness.
Limitations
Although the data come from a nationally representative survey,
which provides more external validity than previous studies con-
ducted with convenience samples, this analysis is purely correla-
tional. Furthermore, mediational analyses—particularly those
using cross-sectional data—have been criticized for their inability
to establish causal claims [56, 57]. Hence, we cannot make any
causal conclusions about the relationships observed in this
study, and there may be alternative explanations for the relation-
ships demonstrated in this study beyond those explored in the
discussion section. Future research should employ experimental
methods to examine these relationships further and work toward
establishing causality, as such methods are most appropriate for
mediational analyses [56, 57]. There is, however, ample reason to
expect that the primary independent variables in this study—per-
ceived descriptive and dynamic norms—are responsive to strate-
gic communication given that the past research has successfully
influenced these constructs through experimental treatments
that ultimately result in behavior change [10, 11, 22]. That said,
this study provides limited evidence about the most effective
ways to operationalize descriptive and dynamic norms in mes-
sages designed to increase climate advocacy.
There are also several limitations associated with our meas-
ures. Namely, our measures of descriptive and dynamic norms
asked people to estimate the prevalence and trajectory of cli-
mate advocacy among Americans as a whole. While our find-
ings may suggest that this is an important referent group for
the relationships we sought to test, it is likely that normative
perceptions of closer, more familiar social groups such as fam-
ily and friends are more consequential. Future research might
examine which referent groups (e.g. one’s community, one’s po-
litical party, one’s religious congregation) are the most impor-
tant to activate when using descriptive and dynamic norms to
motivate climate advocacy. Furthermore, several of our meas-
ures consisted of only one item, potentially limiting their ability
to assess the broader underlying latent construct. These in-
cluded descriptive and dynamic norms, identification with cli-
mate
activists,
injunctive
norms
and
collective
response
efficacy. Future studies may benefit from including more indi-
cators of each construct.
Our measure of climate advocacy was limited to contacting
elected officials and did not specify the mode of such contact.
Future studies may seek to delineate between different chan-
nels of contacting elected officials, such as in person or via
phone or email. Furthermore, contacting elected officials is not
the
only
way
citizens
can
engage
in
climate
advocacy.
Additional studies could investigate how to use descriptive and
dynamic norms to attract people to other types of advocacy
behaviors such as donating money or attending protests, or
how to move people up the ladder of engagement to higher ef-
fort actions such as volunteering for leadership positions within
advocacy organizations [60].

The data for this study come from a single wave of a larger,
ongoing survey project that collects new cross-sectional data
twice a year to track various beliefs, attitudes, policy preferences
and behaviors in the USA with respect to climate change.6 Some
of the questions used in this analysis were originally written for
tracking purposes and were therefore written prior to the concep-
tualization of this specific manuscript. As a result, there are dis-
crepancies in the referent groups of some of our measures,
specifically descriptive and injunctive norms and collective and
response efficacy.
Lastly, behavioral intentions are not perfect predictors of
behaviors. While our analyses investigated two dependent varia-
bles to account for this, it is still an important limitation of this
study. Furthermore, given that most Americans are worried
about climate change, a social desirability bias may have been
present amongst respondents, introducing the potential that cli-
mate advocacy intentions and past behaviors were overreported.
However, other nationally representative surveys have found
similar rates to those described in this article, easing but not
eliminating this concern.
Conclusion
This study provides new insights into the relationship between
social norms and political advocacy, specifically that perceived
descriptive norms and prospective dynamic norms may have im-
portant relationships with climate advocacy. Beyond extending
social norms theory, the results of this article have important
practical implications by providing further insight into how peo-
ple can be motivated to engage in climate change advocacy.
Communicating social norms may be an important strategy to
accelerate the American and global response to climate change.
