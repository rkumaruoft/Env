A Roadmap for Municipalities
This toolkit provides a roadmap to support municipalities in adding accountability to their climate commitments and 
actions. Climate accountability is ultimately the state of being answerable and transparent about the actions required to 
effectively mitigate and adapt to climate change. To work  towards climate accountability, municipalities should consider 
the five “onramps” presented in this  toolkit. 
Executive Summary
1.	 Climate emergency declarations
2.	 Accountability in climate action planning
3.	 Climate lens
4.	 Carbon budgeting, and
5.	 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework.
These are:
4
A Roadmap for Municipalities
Each of these onramps play a crucial role in fostering climate accountability. Climate emergency declarations provide a 
powerful statement of intent, signaling the municipal commitment to addressing climate change urgently. Climate action 
plans offer a strategic roadmap, outlining specific goals, targets, and actions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and 
build climate resilience. Incorporating climate lenses into municipal decision-making processes ensures that climate 
considerations are systematically integrated into policy, planning, and infrastructure development, enabling more 
climate-conscious choices.
Carbon budgets offer a framework to limit emissions, encouraging municipalities to integrate climate into their regular 
financial budgeting processes. The TCFD framework, with its focus on financial risk disclosures related to climate change, 
enhances accountability by promoting transparency and aligning financial decision-making with climate goals.
While each onramp has its distinct purpose, they are most effective when implemented using a combined approach. 
There are numerous overlaps and synergies between these onramps that reinforce and amplify their impact. For 
example, climate emergency declarations and climate action plans inform and support the integration of climate lenses 
into decision-making processes. Carbon budgets provide a quantifiable basis for meeting targets outlined in climate 
action plans. TCFD enhances financial risk assessment and decision-making, aligning with the broader goals of climate 
action plans.
Many municipalities have already established a path towards climate action. Incorporating accountability can happen 
at any stage in this journey, regardless of how far along you are. This Guide provides an accountability framework 
that allows municipalities to initiate efforts, build on existing foundations, and continually improve their climate 
accountability processes.

A Roadmap for Municipalities
1.1 Importance of Municipal Climate Action
Municipalities play a crucial role in combatting climate change, with direct control over about 3 – 8% of total community 
energy use. In addition, through land use and transportation decisions, municipalities have influence over 40 – 60% 
of their community’s energy use and therefore have a significant opportunity to address community greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
By decarbonizing major sources of emissions such as buildings, transportation, and energy,municipalities can achieve 
multiple benefits. Reducing carbon contributes to the global effort of fightingclimate change and helps municipalities 
save money, create new employment opportunities, attract investment, and improve the quality of life in their 
communities.
The urgency for action is reinforced by the substantial cost of climate change on Canadian municipalities. Extreme 
weather events have become more frequent and intense, resulting in significant infrastructure damage and property 
loss. These events place an additional burden on municipal finances, increasing expenses for infrastructure investments, 
emergency response and recovery efforts. Moreover, the impacts of climate change disproportionately affect our most 
vulnerable community members, amplifying social and economic disparities.
1. Background
6
A Roadmap for Municipalities
This toolkit describes the concepts and benefits of these onramps, provides examples of how they are being 
implemented, outlines strategies for successful implementation, and identifies common challenges and mitigating 
actions to circumvent them.
Climate accountability refers to the need to take ownership of municipal decisions that affect climate (ex. energy 
and GHG emissions) and are affected by climate (ex. extreme weather impacts). For municipal governments, climate 
accountability also means being answerable and transparent aboutemission sources, the actions required to reach 
net-zero emissions, the actions that could work against climate commitments, and the mechanisms that will be used to 
monitor and report on progress. It also means being answerable and transparent about local climate risks and impacts, 
the actions required to be resilient to a changing climate, the actions that could work against this resilience, and the 
mechanisms that will be used to monitor and report on climate adaptation work.
Municipalities can demonstrate accountability by implementing governance structures, processes, and policies that 
directly connect long-term climate commitments to near-term policies and decision making. Climate accountability 
requires public commitments, detailed planning, and regular, transparent progress reporting.
1.3 Climate Accountability
1.	 Climate emergency declarations
2.	 Accountability in climate action planning
3.	 Climate lens
4.	 Carbon budgeting, and
5.	 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework.
Climate accountability can be achieved though the following five onramps:
Municipal governments across Canada are already taking significant steps to address climate change. Many 
municipalities have committed to reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Working towards this goal, municipalities 
are reducing GHGs from municipal buildings, rightsizing and electrifying municipal fleets, advancing green development 
standards and home energy retrofit programs, among other actions. 
To protect their communities from the effects of climate change, municipalities have also been investing in climate 
resilience measures. Some of these measures include enhancing infrastructure to improve flood protection and reduce 
heat island effects, updating storm water management practices, and improving emergency preparedness. 
Despite these actions, the reality is that most municipalities are currently not on track to meet their netzero targets and 
they are still at risk to climate change. The urgency of the climate crisis demands a stronger commitment and increased 
accountability.
1.2 Current State of Municipal Climate Action
The urgency to address the climate crisis is paramount, and municipalities have an important role to play in driving 
change. By taking concrete steps to reduce GHG emissions while building resilience against extreme weather events, 
municipalities can create a positive ripple effect, saving money, creating jobs, attracting investments, reducing risks, and 
improving the overall well-being of their communities.
7
A Roadmap for Municipalities
Climate emergency declarations are municipal council resolutions that acknowledge the urgency of theclimate crisis and 
commit to climate leadership. These declarations are a response to the growing recognition that climate change poses a 
threat to humanity and that it requires immediate and transformative action. 
The motivations behind climate emergency declarations are varied, but many of them cite the scientific consensus on the 
severity and urgency of the climate crisis, whereby the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned 
that the world is rapidly approaching a point of no return, beyond which it will become increasingly difficult to prevent 
the worst impacts of climate change.By declaring a climate emergency and committing to climate action, municipalities 
are taking the necessary first step to enhance and protect their communities. 
2.1 Introduction to Climate Emergency Declarations
2. Climate Emergency Declarations
8
A Roadmap for Municipalities
Over 650 Canadian municipalities have declared a climate emergency, representing communities both small and large, 
urban, and rural, across all provinces and some territories. Despite these differences, municipal climate emergency 
declarations have many common elements:
2.3 Review of Climate Emergency Declarations
Most climate emergency declarations follow the structure of municipal resolutions which are 
used to express the municipal position on an issue. They are typically made up of two parts:
2.3.1 Structure
2.3.1 Structure
•	
Preamble: Declarations often begin with a preamble or recitals section that provides 
background information and context for the declaration. This section may reference 
scientific reports, international agreements, or local climate data to support the 
declaration.
•	
Resolutions: Declarations typically provide a series of statements or resolutions 
outlining the municipal commitment to addressing the climate emergency. These 
declarations may express intent, set targets, or outline specific actions to be taken.
Many municipalities also establish interim targets on their path to net-zero emissions. It is common that alongside a 
commitment to reach net-zero by 2050, municipalities also commit to a 40-45% reduction in emissions by 2030.
While climate emergency declarations often mention local climate impacts and the importance ofadaptation, these 
declarations rarely include adaptation targets. This is because it is challenging to identify a single quantifiable metric that 
can be used to measure adaptation.
Climate emergency declarations commonly include targets and timelines for reducing community wide emissions. Many 
municipalities in Canada have committed to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 which corresponds with the IPCC’s 
recommended pathway to limit global warming to 1.5°C, though some have committed to earlier timelines. For example, 
the City of Toronto has committed to reaching carbon neutrality by 2040 and the Town of Halton Hills aims to reach net-
zero emissions by 2030 - making these some of the most ambitious targets in North America.
2.3.2 Targets
2.2 Benefits of a Climate Emergency Declarations
•	
Increased awareness and understanding of the urgency and severity of the climate 
crisis among municipal staff, elected officials, and the community.
•	
Increased municipal climate accountability through public and time-bound 
commitments.
•	
Greater political will to advance further climate actions or accelerate existing actions.

Some declarations go further, directing staff to:
Below are some examples that represent different community archetypes (e.g., rural, urban, small, large, upper-tier and 
single-tier municipalities), and that incorporate many of the common elements described above.
2.3.4 Example Climate Emergency Declarations
For more examples, see the CEDAMIA webpage on Canadian jurisdictions that have declared a climate emergency. 
These examples can serve as a starting point for drafting a municipal climate declaration.
•	
City of Nanaimo, BC
•	
Dufferin County, Ontario
•	
Durham Region, Ontario
•	
City of Peterborough, Ontario
•	
City of Hamilton, Ontario
Climate emergency declarations often outline actions that municipalities will take to work towards stated climate 
targets and commitments. These actions are typically written as motions to direct municipal staff to engage in research, 
planning, implementation, or reporting activities. They are often directed at specific departments and are often 
accompanied by timelines. Actions often found in climate emergency declarations include:
2.3.3 Actions
10
A Roadmap for Municipalities
The steps involved in passing a municipal climate emergency declaration can vary depending on the processes and 
protocols unique to each municipality. However, the following elements are common in most declarations:
2.4 Climate Emergency Declaration Implementation
1.	 Research and preparation: Council and/or staff may research and prepare content for the declaration that 
can include the impacts of climate change, climate targets and timelines of other jurisdictions, actions 
that could be taken by the municipality and the language and content of existing climate emergency 
declarations.
2.	 Drafting the declaration: Based on the research, council and/or staff may draft the declaration that outlines 
the commitment to act. The declaration may include:
•   A preamble to provide context and justification for the declaration.
•   A clause clearly declaring or acknowledging the climate emergency.
•   Climate targets and timelines.
•   A series of actions to work towards stated targets and timelines.
3.	 Council review, amendments, and vote: The draft declaration may be reviewed and debated by council, 
who may make changes to the language or content of the declaration. Once amendments are made and 
approved, the declaration is voted on. If the declaration passes, staff can implement the directions outlined 
in the declaration.
Municipal climate emergency declarations may be stalled or prevented by several challenges, including: 
To overcome these challenges, municipalities can take steps, such as:
2.5 Challenges
1.	 Political resistance: Elected officials or community members may be resistant to declaring a climate 
emergency. This could be due to a resistance to changes that may result from it, or a misinterpretation of 
the term “emergency”, which under certain provincial emergency management acts, has unrelated legal and 
financial implications.
2.	 Limited resources: Municipalities may have limited resources, knowledge, or staff capacity to implement 
the necessary actions that would likely result from a climate emergency declaration.
1.	 Building political support: By engaging with elected officials to address questions and concerns and 
building public support for climate action, municipalities can overcome political resistance and increase the 
likelihood of passing meaningful climate emergency declarations.
2.	 Building capacity and partnerships: Municipalities can support staff training, research, and partnerships 
with municipal peer networks (see Appendix A) to build the necessary expertise to develop strong climate 
emergency declarations.
11
A Roadmap for Municipalities
Addressing climate change is complex, and municipalities may need to navigate some challenges to successfully draft and 
pass climate emergency declarations. 
Guided by the need to demonstrate municipal and community accountability, and informed by the experience of 
over 650 Canadian municipal climate emergency declarations, municipalities can overcome these challenges and take 
one of the necessary first onramps in climate accountability. From here, they can advance other onramps to climate 
accountability which will help continue to demonstrate leadership in the fight against climate change. 
2.6 Conclusion
12
A Roadmap for Municipalities
3. Climate Action Plans
Municipal climate action plans serve as roadmaps that outline the necessary actions and resources needed to meet 
municipal climate commitments. For some municipalities, climate action plans are the primary relied-upon tool for 
achieving the targets and commitments often set out in climate emergency  declarations. This highlights the importance 
of developing climate action plans that are detailed, datadriven, and accountable.
Some municipal climate action plans focus solely on reducing GHG emissions or building resilience to climate impacts. 
Others integrate mitigation and adaptation into one plan. Integrated plans often recognize the synergies and efficiencies 
that can be achieved from actions that advance both mitigation and adaptation goals. Climate action plans may also 
differ based on the scope of actions they cover. Some plans concentrate on internal corporate actions while others 
encompass actions aimed at sectors within the wider community, outside the direct control of the municipality.
Regardless of focus and scope, all climate action plans should begin by creating a vision, terms of refence, and 
governance and accountability models to direct and manage the plan. They should then speak to relevant baseline data, 
and establish objectives and targets, describing the mechanism and policies that will accomplish the actions, the budget
3.1 Introduction
3.1.1 Focus and Scope of Climate Action Plans
13
A Roadmap for Municipalities
Municipal climate action plans become accountable the following key elements are included:
Clear governance structures and mechanisms for oversight build accountability. Establishing roles and responsibilities, 
assigning responsibility to specific entities or departments, and ensuring leadership support create a framework for 
effective implementation. A governance structure ensures plans are developed collaboratively, implemented effectively, 
and tracked transparently. 
The structure should include key internal and external groups and individuals with specific responsibilities to help 
formulate and manage the plan and keep it accountable.
Table 1 provides examples of groups and individuals that may be part of this governance structure, their
responsibilities, and benefits they provide to climate accountability. Appendix A provides further 
resources for establishing strong governance structures.

15
A Roadmap for Municipalities
Municipalities use different governance structures to reflect their local contexts. For example, the City of Toronto, 
through the Accountability and Management Framework for the TransformTO Net Zero Strategy creates relationships 
of advisement and accountability for implementation of the Strategy by establishing: a Climate Advisory Group made 
up of community members; a Joint TransformTO Implementation Committee made up of City staff and labour union 
organizations, and; a TransformTO Climate Leadership Table made up of internal, inter-divisional City senior management 
staff. Each advisory group has terms of reference which outline its purpose, management processes, members, and 
roles that will guide the City’s accountable and inclusive implementation of the Net Zero Strategy.
The City of Edmonton developed several committees over the course of their climate action planning. The City’s Office 
of Environment partnered with Alberta Climate Dialogue and the Centre for Public Involvement to create the Citizens’ 
Panel on Edmonton’s Energy and Climate Challenges. The 60-personpanel was provided with resource materials including 
Edmonton’s Energy Transition Discussion Paper to learn about climate change and energy vulnerabilities. They were then 
asked to provide feedback on the recommendations of the discussion paper: their acceptability, how far and how fast to 
implement them, and areas of common ground and divergence among citizens.
Edmonton also created the Energy Transition Climate Resilience Committee, made up of 15 Edmontonians who serve 
a 2-year term and help implement 2 strategic plans: Edmonton’s Community Energy Transition Strategy and Climate 
Resilient Edmonton: Adaptation Strategy and Action Plan. The Committee encourages and promotes the strategies, 
provides advice to Council regarding their implementation and assists Council in developing performance measures. It 
provides a wide and strategic perspective on issues relating to energy transition and climate resilience in Edmonton. The 
Committee’s establishment, mandate and terms of reference are outlined in Bylaw 18881.
All climate action plans should include regular and standardized data collection to assess baseline performance and track 
progress over time. Reporting on this data should be transparent, consistent, and accessible to stakeholders, providing 
evidence of achievements and areas that may require further action. For mitigation plans, a baseline greenhouse gas 
inventory is needed. For adaptation plans, a baseline climate risk and vulnerability assessment is needed.
3.2.2 Standardized Data and Reporting
Corporate and community mitigation plans require a GHG inventory, which provides a baseline understanding of the 
sources and magnitude of emissions generated within the municipal boundary and is essential for setting reduction 
targets, designing effective strategies, and tracking progress over time. To have an accountable climate action plan, the 
GHG inventory must be public, transparent, and reasonably current. There are three key elements of accountability for 
GHG inventories:
3.2.2.1 Greenhouse Gas Inventories
1.	 Alignment with Existing Protocols and Standards: Internationally recognized protocols and standards guide 
municipalities when creating emissions inventories. These protocols provide methodologies for inventories 
creation and target setting. Appendix B provides examples of key protocols.
2.	 Documentation and Transparency: Document all methodologies, assumptions, and data sources used in the 
inventory process.Maintain transparency by making the inventory report publicly available and accessible to 
stakeholders, allowing for review and questions.
3.	 Periodic Updates: Commit to regularly updating the inventory to reflect change over time. Municipalities 
may consider committing to GHG inventory updates annually, bi-annually or every five years, based on 
resource availability, and potential for temporal changes to emissions.
16
A Roadmap for Municipalities
A corporate or community adaptation plan will require a baseline assessment of the municipality’s risks and 
vulnerabilities to climate change and its capacity to adapt and build resilience. A climate risk and vulnerability 
assessment (CRVA) identifies hazards, risks, and impacts to municipal sectors and informs actions that increase resilience. 
To ensure the assessment is accountable, several key elements and steps should be considered:
3.2.2.2 Climate Risk and Vulnerability Assessments 
1.	 Alignment with Existing Standards and Guides: There are numerous resources available to support and 
guide CVRAs and adaptation planning more broadly, providing methodologies, tools, and guidance materials 
to assist municipalities in conducting robust and effective assessments and prioritizing resilience actions. 
Appendix C provides a series or resources to support municipal CVRAs.
2.	 Reporting and Communication: Clearly document the findings of the risk and vulnerability assessment in a 
comprehensive report. Communicate the results to stakeholders and the wider community using accessible 
language, visualizations, and engagement strategies. Foster transparency and accountability by sharing the 
methodology, assumptions, and data sources used in the assessment.
3.	 Review and Update: Regularly review and update the risk and vulnerability assessment to account for new 
data, changing climate conditions, and evolving knowledge. Incorporate feedback from stakeholders and 
use emerging best practices in climate risk assessment and adaptation planning.
Outputs refer to the tangible deliverables and results of specific actions or activities undertaken to address climate 
change, such as the implementation of renewable energy projects or the enhancement of green infrastructure. 
Outcomes, on the other hand, represent the broader impacts and changes resulting from these actions, such as reduced 
greenhouse gas emissions or enhanced community resilience. To be accountable, the desired outputs and outcomes of 
climate action plans must be clearly communicated. When developing outputs and outcomes, it is important to consider 
these principles. 
3.2.3 Clear Outputs and Outcomes
1.	 Specificity: Outputs and outcomes should be specific and well-defined. They should provide a sense of 
direction and purpose for the plan’s implementation. Avoid vague or ambiguous statements and provide 
clear details about what will be achieved.
2.	 Measurability: Ensure that outputs and outcomes can be quantified or measured. Use specific metrics or 
indicators to track progress and assess the extent to which the desired outputs and outcomes are being 
achieved. This allows for meaningful monitoring and evaluation.
3.	 Periodic Updates: Set timelines and deadlines for achieving outputs and outcomes. Breaking down 
the outputs and outcomes into short, medium, and long-term targets can provide a clear roadmap for 
implementation, and aid in resource allocation. These sub-targets provide steppingstones towards larger 
goals and enable municipalities to assess achievements and adjust plans as needed.
17
A Roadmap for Municipalities
Identifying and prioritizing climate actions in a transparent and accountable manner is crucial for effective municipal 
climate planning. Here are key steps that municipalities can take to achieve this:
A robust climate action plan outlines strategies and actions that will be taken to achieve the defined goals. The strategies 
should be feasible, realistic, and supported by evidence and best practices. Clear actions with assigned costs, budgets, 
and human resources increases accountability for implementation.
3.2.4.1 Identifying Actions
3.2.4 Detailed Action Planning
1.	 Stakeholder Engagement: Engage a diverse range of stakeholders, including staff, community members, 
businesses, organizations, and experts, throughout the process. Ensure that this stakeholder engagement 
process is clearly and widely communicated across multiple channels. Use multiple engagement methods 
that are inclusive and accessible for all to participate. For transparency and accountability, document the 
stakeholder engagement process and outcomes, including meeting summaries and participant feedback, 
and make this information publicly available.
2.	 Clear Evaluation Process: Establish clear criteria for evaluating potential climate actions. Consider factors 
such as emission reduction potential, cost-effectiveness, co-benefits, equity considerations, and community 
acceptance.
3.	 Clear Prioritization Process: Clearly define the criteria and rationale for prioritizing climate actions. This 
helps stakeholders understand how actions were selected and ensures transparency in decision making. 
Consider factors such as urgency, feasibility, impact, and alignment with community priorities which may be 
outlined in a municipality’s strategic plan.
Clearly identifying resource requirements, budgets, and funding sources increases accountability and improves the 
chance that actions will be sufficiently resourced. To ensure a robust and accountable cost estimation of a climate action 
plan, municipalities can follow these guidelines:
3.2.4.2 Financial Resources
1.	 Comprehensive Data Collection: Collect relevant data and information to estimate the costs associated with 
each climate action. This may include equipment and infrastructure costs, installation and implementation 
costs, operational and maintenance costs, and any other expenses related to the action.
2.	 Cost Breakdown: Provide a detailed breakdown of costs for each climate action, including capital costs, 
recurring costs, and any associated revenues or savings. Table 3 provides examples of climate action plan 
costing studies.
3.	 Financing Options and Funding Sources: Identify and evaluate various financing options and funding 
sources available to support the implementation of the climate action plan.
4.	 Public Reporting: Clearly present the cost estimation results for each the total costs, cost breakdowns, 
financing options, and funding sources. Provide clear references to the data sources used and ensure the 
document is easily accessible to stakeholders.
18
A Roadmap for Municipalities
Accountable climate action plans identify adequate human resourcing. Municipal staff possess valuable institutional 
knowledge, understanding of local contexts, and the ability to coordinate efforts internally. On the other hand, external 
partners, such as consultants, researchers, and community organizations, offer specialized skills, technical know-how, 
and can enhance the effectiveness and inclusivity of the  climate action plan by incorporating diverse perspectives and 
accessing additional resources. 
Many municipalities have created costing studies for their climate action plans. For example, the Zero Carbon Whitby 
Costing Study provides a schedule and costing analysis that details the financial resources and work required for the 
Town to become a net-zero corporation by 2045. The study details its methodology, assumptions, and data sources used. 
It also identifies how funding sources would be utilized to create a Zero Carbon Revolving Reserve Fund to finance plan 
implementation. A financial table is provided, detailing balances, payments out, and funding in for every year of the 
plan. These components make it an example of a detailed accountable costing study. Similarly, the City of Winnipeg has 
created a Community Energy Investment Roadmap (CEIR), which is a technical analysis identifyingthe investments and 
actions needed to be a net-zero community by 2050.
3.2.4.3 Human Resources (Staffing and Partnerships)
Monitoring, evaluation, and reporting (MER) are crucial for the success and accountability of municipal climate action 
plans. MER helps track progress, ensure accountability, facilitate learning, and support evidence-based decision making. 
Municipalities implement monitoring, evaluation, and reporting in various ways, and produce various types of reports 
and documents as part of their MER efforts. These may include quarterly community newsletters, annual or biennial 
progress reports, sustainability reports, case studies, data dashboards, or 5-year reviews and updates. 
3.2.5 Monitoring, Evaluation & Reporting
Here are some key takeaways for municipalities to have accountable climate action plans:
3.3 Conclusion
1.	 Stakeholder Engagement: Strong Governance and Oversight: Establish clear governance structures 
and mechanisms to provide oversight and accountability for the climate action plan. Define roles and 
responsibilities, assign authority, and ensure that decision-making processes are transparent and 
accountable.
2.	 Clear Outputs and Outcomes: Establish and communicate the outputs and outcomes that will be achieved 
by the climate action plan. These should be specific, time-bound, and measurable.
3.	 Comprehensive Stakeholder Engagement: Engage a wide range of stakeholders throughout the planning 
and implementation process. Ensure that stakeholder engagement is transparent, inclusive, and responsive 
to diverse perspectives.
4.	 Resource Planning and Accountability: Estimate costs of climate actions, identifying human resources, 
upfront investments, and long-term operational and maintenance costs. Identify funding sources, explore 
financing options, and ensure financial accountability by tracking and reporting on the allocation and use of 
funds.
19
A Roadmap for Municipalities
By incorporating these key elements, municipalities can ensure that their climate action plans are not only effective 
enough to reach desired climate goals but are also transparent and accountable to municipal decision-makers, the 
public, and other community stakeholders.
5.	 Robust Monitoring, Evaluation, and Reporting (MER): Develop a robust MER framework to track progress, 
evaluate the effectiveness of actions, and report outcomes to council and stakeholders. Regularly monitor 
and assess the implementation of the climate action plan, measure key performance indicators, and 
transparently communicate the results.
6.	 Documentation and Transparency: Document methodologies, assumptions, and decisions made 
throughout the development and implementation of the plan. Maintain clear records of data sources, 
analysis, stakeholder input, and decision-making processes to ensure transparency, accountability, and the 
ability to track progress over time.
20
A Roadmap for Municipalities
Beyond the actions outlined in climate action plans, municipalities have recognized the importance of addressing climate 
change across many other municipal areas. This requires a climate lens, which refers to the deliberate consideration of 
climate change across all municipal decision-making. A climate lens helps staff and Council identify potential positive and 
negative impacts a decision will have on emissions and climate risks.
Climate lenses can be applied by estimating a decision’s climate implications or through integration of climate change 
into municipal plans and policies. While they are not the only ways a municipality can integrate climate considerations 
into municipal decision-making, they are both tested and effective at identifying climate implications and opportunities. 
Climate lenses therefore play a crucial role in helping municipalities meet their climate commitments and enhance their 
climate accountability. Use of a climate lens often requires a degree of staff training or capacity building and serves as a 
useful opportunity to raise climate literacy in general municipal staff.

Long-Term Planning: Climate lenses encourage municipalities to consider the future impacts of their decisions 
and make informed choices that are resilient, adaptive, and sustainable. This approach helps avoid potential 
pitfalls and enhances their ability to navigate the challenges posed by climate change. This long-term thinking 
is illustrated by the Region of Halton’s Climate Change Discussion Paper – Regional Official Plan Review (2020) 
which compares the temporal scales of municipal planning decisions versus implications (Figure 1).
Coherence and Consistency: A climate lens provides a standardized framework to consider decisions and how 
they impact climate action plans and targets. By integrating climate considerations, municipalities can avoid 
conflicting strategies and promote a holistic climate action approach.
Cost Savings: Climate lenses can lead to cost savings by avoiding potential costs associated with retrofitting 
or adapting infrastructure, responding to climate-related emergencies, or dealing with the consequences of 
inadequate planning.
Climate Accountability: A climate lens helps identify opportunities to reduce emissions and improve resilience. 
The lens helps decision-makers evaluate the climate impact of various choices, and report transparently on the 
final decision, keeping municipalities accountable for decisions that could advance or hinder their climate goals.
Incorporating a climate lens into municipal decision-making and planning offers several benefits:

Municipal Climate
Lens Tool
This tool was designed to provide a preliminary, qualitative understanding of 
whether a municipal decision will affect climate (through emissions production) 
or be affected by climate (through increased exposure to temperature or 
precipitation). The Tool is designed to be used by all staff in a municipality and 
is designed to be broadly applicable to any decision. It is free to use for any 
municipality and produces a pdf output which can be appended to a staff report.
Climate Implications 
Repository
This repository provides municipal staff with a list of key municipal decisions and 
their potential climate implications. Decisions are searchable and are broken down 
by municipal sector.
Integrating Climate 
Considerations: Governance 
and Operations
This resource details key climate questions municipal staff should around specific 
decision points, and links to tools that can be used to integrate climate change 
considerations into municipal operations.
Table 2 provides examples of tools and resources that can be used to support the identification and potential 
quantification of climate implications for staff reports.
4.3.2 Tools and Resources
To adopt dedicated sections on climate change implications in staff reports to council, municipalities  typically follow 
several steps:
4.3.1 Steps to Adopt Climate Implications Reporting
1.	 Policy Development: Develop a policy outlining the requirement for dedicated sections on climate change 
implications in staff reports. This policy should define the purpose, scope, and expectations for integrating 
climate change considerations into decision-making.
2.	 Staff Training and Capacity Building: To ensure consistent application, those involved in preparing staff reports 
need a high-level understanding of climate change concepts and impacts.
3.	 Template Development: Use a standardized templates that provide clear guidance on the type of information 
to be included, such as potential emissions, climate risks, and recommended mitigation or adaptation 
measures. This template may also be generated by a climate lens toolwhich can also produce quantitative and/
or qualitative implications data and can be appended to staff reports.
4.	 Implementation and Monitoring: Once climate change implications sections are incorporated into staff 
reports, monitor their effectiveness, and adjust as needed. Evaluate the quality of the information provided, 
track the integration of climate considerations into decision-making, and seek feedback from council and staff.
Table 2: Climate Implications Resources
To integrate climate change considerations into decision-making, some municipalities include dedicated climate 
change implications sections in staff reports to council, providing an assessment of how proposed initiatives align with 
climate action goals. They outline the potential impacts of the decision at hand, specifically focusing on how it may 
impact the municipality’s climate adaptation and mitigation work. To support these climate implications sections, some 
municipalities have developed tools to describe or quantify metrics such as potential emissions. 
4.3 Climate Implications Reporting and Tools
23
A Roadmap for Municipalities
Municipalities are actively integrating climate change into many municipal plans. Climate change is already inherently 
integrated into some plans such as climate action plans and electric vehicle (EV) strategies. However, there is a need to 
explore additional plans where climate change implications are significant but traditionally have not been considered. 
These include official plans, strategic plans, asset management plans, water management plans and transportation plans. 
These plans should be given priority for climate change integration, considering the substantial influence of climate 
change on these plans and their potential impacts on climate change.
The direction and principles that govern local decisions about land use, development and infrastructure are laid out 
in OPs. By integrating climate change considerations into OPs, municipalities can encourage strategic decision-making 
that considers climate-related risks and opportunities over the plan’s duration. Incorporating climate change language 
into an OP identifies how the community’s growth and land use management will affect GHG emissions and climate 
change vulnerabilities to its service delivery, infrastructure, residents, and businesses, particularly those who are most 
vulnerable. Municipal OPs provide an opportunity for climate change education within the planning department, 
other municipal departments, and council. As OPs require public consultation, there is an opportunity for climate 
education within the community.
Municipal strategic plans provide an ideal framework for integrating climate change due to their longterm and strategic 
nature. Climate change affects various aspects of municipal operations, and a strategic plan allows for the systematic 
integration of climate considerations across all relevant areas, including policy development, infrastructure planning, 
community engagement, and resource allocation.
Integrating climate change into the strategic plan enhances integration and collaboration among different departments. 
It breaks down silos and facilitates cross-departmental coordination, ensuring that climate considerations are 
consistently addressed throughout the organization. 
The integration and consideration of climate change in strategic plans are only as effective and accountable as 
the strategic plans themselves. Strategic plans are ideal for climate change integration so long as key elements of 
accountability are committed to in the strategic plan, including:
4.4 Climate Integration in Municipal Plans
4.4.1 Official Plans
4.4.2 Strategic Plans
Examples:
For examples of how climate change is integrated into municipal OPs, see Clean Air Partnership’s report on 
Integrating Climate Change into Municipal Official Plans.

A Roadmap for Municipalities
Climate change significantly impacts the performance and lifespan of infrastructure assets. Increased temperatures, 
changing rainfall patterns, and more frequent extreme weather events accelerate asset deterioration and decrease their 
functionality. By considering climate change in asset management plans, municipalities can make informed decisions 
regarding asset design, materials, maintenance practices, and renewal strategies that account for projected climate 
conditions. This helps extend asset lifespans, reduce the risk of premature failures, and optimize asset performance in a 
changing climate.
Integrating climate change into asset management planning factors the costs of climate mitigation and adaptation 
measures, allowing municipalities to better prioritize investments, allocate resources, and develop financial plans that 
address both routine maintenance and climate change. This proactive approach helps optimize financial planning, avoids 
reactive or ad hoc asset upgrades, and achieves longterm cost-effectiveness in asset management.
4.4.3 Asset Management Plans
Examples:
Halton Region’s 2023-2026 Strategic Business Plan sets the strategic direction and priorities for Council’s four-year 
term of office and the region’s future. One of the four pillars of the plan is Climate Change and the Environment 
which identifies four key goals related to climate action.
Examples:
The City of Guelph’s Strategic Asset Management Policy (2018) provides a framework for managing risks in asset 
management plans, including climate change mitigation and adaptation. The policy promotes an integrated 
approach, considering asset vulnerabilities and costs across many areas including operations, levels of service 
and lifecycle management. The policies promote the consideration of adaptation opportunities to address these 
vulnerabilities, and integration with GHG reduction goals, disaster planning and contingency funding.
The City of Toronto’s Corporate Strategic Plan outlines four strategic priorities which will improve quality of life for 
its residents. These priorities were determined based on public engagement, directions and budget decisions from 
City Council, discussions among the City’s leadership teams, and in response to the challenges facing Toronto and 
other major urban areas.
The 2019-2023 Region of Waterloo Strategic Plan includes five focus areas, one of which is Environment and 
Climate Change. Under this focus area, the plan identifies five strategic objectives and 17 specific actions. The 
strategic plan also indicates how it aligns with other plans. 
Extensive and inclusive community and staff engagement
Transparent methodology for identification of strategic plan priorities, objectives, and indicators
Specific and measurable actions
Integration with municipal budgeting and departmental planning processes
Clear monitoring and reporting processes
25
A Roadmap for Municipalities
Water management plans can include stormwater plans, water and wastewater plans and watershed plans. Integrating 
climate change into water management plans supports long-term planning and resilience-building efforts. By considering 
climate projections, municipalities can anticipate future waterrelated challenges and develop adaptive strategies. This 
includes assessing the lifespan and capacity of existing infrastructure, integrating climate-sensitive design criteria into 
new projects, and promoting sustainable water management practices to enhance the resilience of water systems to 
climate change impacts.
Transportation plans typically address various transportation systems, including roadways, public transit, cycling, and 
pedestrian facilities. The importance of transportation as a climate action is typically recognized in climate action plans 
but not always considered in transportation plans. By incorporating climate change considerations into transportation 
plans, municipalities can prioritize strategies and actions that will help meet GHG reduction goals. This can include 
promoting the use of low-carbon transportation modes like public transit, cycling, and walking, as well as encouraging 
the adoption of electric vehicles.
Integrating climate change into transportation plans also encourages the design and development of resilient 
infrastructure. By incorporating climate resilience measures into infrastructure design and maintenance plans, 
municipalities can minimize disruptions, enhance safety, and ensure the continuity of transportation services in the face 
of climate-related challenges. 
4.4.4 Water Management Plans
4.4.5 Transportation Plans
Example:
The Region of Peel’s Stormwater Servicing Plan for Regional Road Infrastructure (2022) incorporated climate 
change considerations in several ways. The plan incorporates detail on expected changes in climate including 
temperature and precipitation into the 2080s for the Region. These projections inform updated Intensity-Duration-
Frequency (IDF) curves which describe the likelihood of future extreme rainfall events. It also recommends 
regular updates to this IDF curve as new climate data emerges. To ensure the financial ability to maintain critical 
infrastructure and plan for environmental factors such as climate change, the plan has initiated a discussion on 
cost-sharing policies and user rates.
Example:
In April 2023, the City of Ottawa updated its Transportation Master Plan (TMP) with new policies to guide 
decision-making on Ottawa’s transportation system over the next two decades. Under the theme of building 
“sustainable and resilient transportation system” the TMP identifies eight policy goals that deeply and significantly 
integrate with the goals of Ottawa’s Climate Change Master Plan. Under each policy goal, the TMP identifies key 
actions related to both climate mitigation and adaptation. 
In 2018, the City of Richmond Hill conducted a climate change risk scan to better understand the impacts of 
climate change on municipal operations. In response, the City committed to systematically consider the impacts 
of climate change on infrastructure through its asset management policy. Specific actions related to integrating 
climate change considerations into the City’s asset management planning approach can be found in the City’s 
2021 Asset Management Plan. 
26
A Roadmap for Municipalities
While every type of municipal plan will have its own focus and objectives, integrating climate change into each plan often 
involves the same key steps
When a plan reaches its next scheduled update, the staff responsible should assemble an interdepartmental team to 
ensure climate change is strategically and thoroughly integrated into the plan update. To help integrate climate change 
into most municipal plans, some common questions should be asked.
Public engagement helps ensure transparency and public accountability. The municipality should undertake this step as 
it normally would, ensuring that the same climate change integration questions are posed to the public in addition to 
internal staff. This can serve as an educational opportunity for describing how climate change impacts or is impacted by 
the plan, and a reference for how decisions will now be made as a result of integrating climate change into the plan.
Incorporating climate lenses into municipal decision-making is crucial for achieving climate commitments and 
demonstrating accountability. Two major approaches that facilitate this integration are the inclusion of climate 
implications sections in staff reports and the integration of climate considerations in municipal plans. 
Both approaches recognize the extended temporal scale of climate implications of municipal decisions. By instituting 
these approaches, decision-makers have access to all the relevant and necessary data and perspectives to make good 
long-term decisions for their communities and the climate.

A Roadmap for Municipalities
A carbon budget is the maximum quantity of emissions that can be released into the atmosphere while keeping global 
warming within a specific limit. On a global scale, to keep the Earth within 2°C of warming, the remaining carbon budget 
is approximately 994 gigatons (as of October 2023). This is according to the Carbon Clock which exclusively draws on data 
from the IPCC.
A municipal carbon budget scales down this global carbon budget to the community level based on population and other 
factors, producing an allocated maximum quantity of emissions that can released by that community. A municipality may 
spread this total budget over time, creating annual or multi-year carbon budgets which gradually decrease as emission 
reduction activities increase. This provides a limit within which a municipality can make operating and investment 
decisions.
There is no one correct or standardized approach to operationalize a carbon budget. However, two methods are most 
frequently used, the Cumulative Emissions Approach, or the Emissions Pathway Approach.
The Cumulative Emissions Approach considers the total emissions from human activities over a specified period. It is 
based on the principle that global temperatures are closely related to cumulative CO2 emissions. By calculating the 
remaining cumulative carbon budget from a starting year to a future target year this approach allows for setting limits on 
total allowable emissions to stay within a specific temperature target.
5.1 Introduction to Carbon Budgets
5. Carbon Budgets
28
A Roadmap for Municipalities
The Oslo Climate Budget informs Oslo’s plans to reduce emissions by 95% by 2030 compared to 2009 levels. Oslo 
fully integrates annual carbon budgets into the regular financial budgeting process and is managed by the finance 
department. It outlines emission limits, targets, and specific measures to be implemented, including estimated emission 
reductions and associated costs, which are used to support decision-making on each measure. 
The climate budget serves three key purposes: tracking emissions alongside finances, distributing responsibility for 
emission reduction across the city government, and ensuring transparency and accountability. To stay within budget, 
the city focuses on sectors with the highest emissions, such as road transport, waste incineration, and other sources like 
construction sites and industrial machinery. 
The Oslo climate budget exemplifies the city’s proactive approach to climate action, demonstrating a clear roadmap, 
financial commitment, and collaboration with various stakeholders to achieve ambitious emission reduction targets.
The City of Edmonton incorporates carbon considerations directly into the City’s standard financial budgeting process. 
During the budget cycle, all approved requests within the capital, operating and utility budgets are brought into one 
carbon budget document. The City then calculates the amount of carbon eliminated or added from each request using 
various carbon accounting methods. The City’s emissions forecast, and remaining carbon budget are then updated based 
on the total emissions for each budget request. This only includes requests that were approved by Council and could be 
quantified.
Establishing and operationalizing a carbon budget offers several benefits to municipalities:
5.3.1 Oslo, Norway
5.3.2 Edmonton, Alberta
5.2 Benefits of Carbon Budgets
Centralized and consistent decision-making: municipalities can consistently prioritize, implement,
and track annual emission reductions alongside existing municipal financial budgeting processes
“Whole of government” approach: climate action and accountability are spread throughout government, 
where all departments are accountable for their emissions.
Enhanced accountability and transparency: Setting specific emission caps and regularly reporting on progress 
enhances accountability and transparency.
Highlights importance of intergovernmental collaboration: emphasises how municipalities need to
be supported by higher levels of government to achieve their climate goals.
5.3 Examples of Carbon Budgets
The Emission Pathways Approach examines different trajectories of greenhouse gas emissions over time and the 
associated probabilities of staying within a specific temperature limit. Instead of focusing solely on a cumulative total, 
this approach examines the rate and timing of emissions reductions. Various scenarios, including business-as-usual, 
rapid reductions, or even negative emissions (through carbon capture and storage, reforestation, etc.), are modeled to 
determine the likelihood of meeting a temperature goal.
29
A Roadmap for Municipalities
The process for implementing and using a carbon budget varies depending on the selected approach. For this toolkit, the 
section below describes a process that closely resembles the Edmonton process. 
5.4 Carbon Budget Implementation
Determine the total global remaining carbon budget using the IPCC data on maximum allowable emissions 
between now and the end of the century for a maximum warming scenario of 1.5°C or 2°C. The Carbon Clock 
provides estimated figures based on IPCC data.
1.	 Establish the baseline emissions and time-period for the first carbon budget. Consider using existing 
emissions data from corporate and community GHG inventories. Carbon budgets may be produced annually 
or in multi-year periods. Methods, tools, and resources to support this initial GHG inventory are explored in 
Section 3 of this toolkit.
2.	 Consider how each subsequent budget fits into long-term emissions reduction planning. Many 
municipalities have developed scenarios or projection of emissions as part of their climate action planning 
process. As part of this, they may have identified long-term emission reduction targets for (e.g., net-zero by 
2050, or reducing a certain level of emissions by 2030).Municipalities should spread their carbon budget 
over time, creating annual or multi-year carbon budgets, and gradually decrease emissions to reach their 
target emissions, ideally to netzero by 2050 at the latest to align with the Paris Agreement.
Determine how much of this the global carbon budget should be allocated to the municipality. Methodologies 
for determining this figure may vary. A simple population-based methodology would allocate a municipality’s 
carbon budget based on the size of its population. For example, a city with the population of 1 million (0.0125% 
of the global population) would be allocated 0.0125% of the global carbon budget. Another method uses a “fair 
share” approach that ensures that municipalities that have historically benefited from a high-carbon economy 
have a greater responsibility for reducing emissions quicker than those that have not benefited (see The 
Climate Equity Reference Calculator, or 1000 Cities Carbon Calculator ).
5.4.1 Establish the Carbon Budget
5.4.2 Operationalize the Carbon Budget
In December 2022, Edmonton released Canada’s first municipal carbon budget report for the period of 2023-2026. The 
report indicated that Edmonton was on track to deplete its carbon budget of 176 Mt CO2e by 2037 and would fall short 
of its 2050 net-zero target.
Despite these findings, Edmonton’s commitment to the carbon budgeting process is still encouraging. It provides 
residents with access to up-to-date information on the climate impacts of all municipal capital and operating decisions. 
This transparency empowers residents and Council to hold the City accountable for its actions and serves as a catalyst for 
municipal decision-makers to reassess their strategies and make necessary corrections.

City Inventory Report­
ing and Information 
System (CIRIS)
CIRIS is an accessible and easy-to-use Excel-based tool for managing, calculating, and 
reporting city greenhouse gas emissions inventory data. CIRIS provides a systematic and 
templated way for cities to input
information and use it for a variety of processes. It is based on the Global Protocol for 
Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories standard, and facilitates a trans­
parent calculation and reporting of emissions
for all sectors.

3.	 During the regular budget cycle, assess the emissions of all budget requests. For each request,complete 
a qualitative and, where possible, quantitative assessment of both the direct and indirect GHG emissions 
impacts resulting from the request. See Table 5 for available quantification resources. Not every budget 
request will have emissions, and not all emissions can be easily quantified.
4.	 Delegate responsibility for implementing the requests to the relevant municipal entities and require them 
to report on its GHG impact in a similar manner to how they would report on finances.
5.	 Present carbon budget for Council review. In one document, assemble all financial and GHG impact 
information gathered on the budget requests, and prepare an updated forecast on GHG emissions and 
remaining carbon budget for the municipality.
6.	 Report on carbon budget. Publicly outline the entire carbon budgeting process and outcomes for each 
budgeting period, including methods and assumptions, GHG impacts of budget decisions, costs, carbon 
surpluses or deficits, and the remaining carbon budget for the municipality. For transparency and public 
accountability, the City of Edmonton provides all of this information in their 2023-2026 Carbon Budget 
report and corresponding news release.
31
A Roadmap for Municipalities
Municipal carbon budgets are a key onramp for municipal climate accountability, serving as centralized tools for 
climate-considerate decision making that works within or alongside financial budget processes. They encourage an 
“all of government” approach, fostering collaboration and coordination across departments to operationalize climate 
action effectively.
While the concept of carbon budgeting is relatively straightforward, operationalizing it is still a relatively new and 
challenging process. Data collection may be manual and uncoordinated, calculating GHG impacts of budget items is 
challenging, and municipalities may approach these in different ways. 
Despite these potential imperfections and complexities, it is essential to take the first steps and begin implementing 
carbon budgets, recognizing that even imperfect data and initial hurdles can pave the way for continuous 
improvement. As more municipalities undertake carbon budgeting and share their experiences, the process will 
become more refined and streamlined. By embracing carbon budgeting, municipalities can take significant strides 
towards achieving their climate goals and ensuring climate accountability.
5.5 Conclusion

A Roadmap for Municipalities
The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) is a global initiative established by the Financial Stability 
Board in 2015. TCFD aims to improve the understanding and disclosure of climaterelated financial risks and opportunities 
by organizations within their annual financial filings, enabling investors, lenders, and other stakeholders to make more 
informed decisions.
Municipalities face unique challenges related to climate change, including managing infrastructure, providing essential 
services, and ensuring community resilience. TCFD for municipalities provides a framework to assess and disclose 
climate-related information, helping municipal governments effectively manage these challenges and make informed 
decisions.TCFD provides a voluntary framework for organizations to disclose information on their climate-related 
risks, impacts, and strategies. These recommendations are organized around four core elements:
6.1 Introduction to TCFD
6. Taskforce on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD)
33
A Roadmap for Municipalities
•	
Enhanced understanding of climate risks: By following the TCFD recommendations,municipalities can assess 
both physical risks (such as extreme weather events and sea-level rise) and transition risks (such as policy 
changes and technological shifts), enabling them to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions.
•	
Improved risk management: TCFD reporting supports municipalities in integrating climaterelated risks into 
their existing risk management processes leading to improved resilience, reduced financial impacts, and 
better protection of municipal assets and infrastructure.
•	
Enhanced financial planning: The TCFD framework incorporates climate-related risks and opportunities into 
financial reporting processes allowing municipalities to assess the financial impacts of climate change, identify 
investment needs, and allocate resources accordingly. This can contribute to more effective budgeting, 
investment decision-making, and long-term financial sustainability.
•	
Stakeholder engagement and trust:  TCFD reporting helps municipalities communicate their climate-related 
risks, strategies, and progress to stakeholders, including residents, businesses, creditors, and regulatory 
bodies
•	
Alignment with global standards: TCFD reporting aligns municipal reporting with globally recognized 
standards and frameworks. As TCFD adoption continues to grow internationally, municipalities that report 
using the TCFD framework can benefit from consistency and comparability in reporting, making it easier 
for stakeholders to understand and compare their climate-related performance against peers and industry 
benchmarks.financial sustainability.
The adoption of TCFD recommendations into municipal financial reporting can bring about several benefits for 
municipalities. Here are some key benefits:
By following TCFD recommendations, municipalities can enhance transparency, improve risk management, and facilitate 
better decision-making. TCFD has gained significant support from various stakeholders, including governments, financial 
institutions, corporations, and creditors, as it helps align the private and public sectors with the goals of the Paris 
Agreement and promotes a more sustainable and resilient economy.
Governance: disclosure about governance structure and processes for overseeing climaterelated risks and 
opportunities.
Strategy: disclosure around climate-related risks and opportunities and how they impact the organization’s 
strategy, business model, and financial planning
Risk Management: disclosure around processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks.
Metrics and Targets: disclosure of metrics and targets related to climate change.

A Roadmap for Municipalities
Evaluate how your municipality’s current governance, risk-assessment, and risk-management practices align with TCFD. 
This can be done by using the TCFD Maturity Assessment Framework which is provided in the CPA’s Enhancing Climate-
related Disclosure by Cities Guide. The Assessment helps municipalities determine how far they has progressed towards 
alignment with each of the four core TCFD recommendations. Progress is generally categorized into three phases of 
maturity, getting started, evolving, and highly integrated.
The Enhancing Climate-related Disclosure by Cities Guide provides a further breakdown of the three major phases by 
each recommendation area. It is recommended that municipalities review these phases and conduct the self-assessment 
on TCFD Maturity before advancing to the next steps.
Conduct an assessment to identify and evaluate the climate-related risks and opportunities that could have financial 
implications for your municipality. If applicable, leverage existing assessments such as climate vulnerability and risk 
assessment (CVRA), which are typical in adaptation planning. An existing CVRA will identify relevant data sources, 
physical climate risks, and a methodology for assessing and organizing these risks. Similarly, risk management teams 
are likely to have previously  identified a range of other related risks around health and safety, cybersecurity, or human 
resources. 
In addition to leveraging existing assessments, the municipality may review and adapt risk assessments by other 
municipalities of a similar size and/or geography or collect new data. Regardless of the method, it must be documented 
under Risk Management, and how management participated must be documented under Governance. TCFD requires the 
assessment to identify and evaluate both thephysical and transitional risks that may impact municipal finances. Table 5 
provides descriptions of key of climate-related risks and opportunities.
Developing a comprehensive governance and implementation team is essential for municipalities to effectively identify, 
assess, and manage climate-related issues with financial implications. As such, municipalities should form a cross-
functional team within the municipality that includes representatives from asset management, finance, and climate 
action planning, with oversight from senior staff, executives, and Council. Establish roles and responsibilities for each 
member of this governance and implementation team. This importance is further emphasized by the TCFD requirement 
to disclose how municipalities are governing climate-related issues. Municipalities need to demonstrate that their 
governance framework is effective, transparent, and accountable.

6.3.4 Identify and Evaluate Climate-Related Financial Risks and Opportunities 
6.3.3 Develop a TCFD Governance and Implementation Team
37
A Roadmap for Municipalities
Once climate-related issues and their potential financial impacts are identified, the next step is to identify those that are 
material to the municipality. In determining whether information is material, the TCFD recommends that organizations 
determine materiality for climate-related issues consistent with how they determine the materiality of other information 
included in their financial filings, and that organizations do not prematurely conclude that climate-related risks and 
opportunities are not material based on perceptions of the longer-term nature of some climate-related risks. To support 
this determination, the International Accounting Standards Board and Chartered Professional Accountants Canada have 
developed definitions and guidance around materiality. 
Climate-related risks and opportunities with financial impacts that are deemed material must be disclosed in the 
municipality’s annual financial statement along with the processes for prioritizing climate-related risks, including how 
materiality determinations are made. 
6.3.5 Determine Materiality of the Climate-Related Issues
TRANSITIONAL RISKS
Policy and Legal Risks: There is growing climate policy aiming to constrain actions contributing to climate 
change and promote mitigation and adaptation activities. The increase in climate-related litigation may 
potentially pose legal risks for municipalities. Claims against corporations and higher levels of government 
have already arisen from failures to mitigate or adapt to climate change and inadequate disclosure of 
financial risks.
Technology Risk: Technological advancements that support the transition to a low-carbon economy can 
have a significant impact on municipalities.
Market Risk: Climate change and the shift towards the low-carbon economy is impacting the supply, 
demand and quality of commodities, products, and services.
Reputation Risk: Climate change is a potential source of reputational risk tied to community perceptions of 
a municipality’s contribution to climate change or resistance to the low-carbon economy.
PHYSICAL 
RISKS
Acute Risk: Physical risks that are event-driven, including increased severity of extreme weather events.
Chronic Risk: Physical risks that are longer-term shifts in climate patterns.
OPPORTUNITIES
Resource Efficiency: Municipalities can reduce operating costs by improving efficiency across their services, 
assets, and operations. This can be efficiency in relation to energy, water, materials, and waste.
Energy Source: The trend toward decentralized renewable energy sources and improved storage capabilities 
can present opportunities for municipalities to shift their energy sources and reduce costs.
Products and Services: Municipalities that innovate and develop new low-carbon services may improve 
their reputation and community participation.
Markets: Municipalities that pro-actively seek opportunities in new types of assets may be able to better 
position themselves for the transition to a lower-carbon economy.
Resilience: The concept of climate resilience involves municipalities developing adaptive capacity to 
respond to climate change to better manage the associated risks and seize opportunities, including the 
ability to respond to transition risks and physical risks.
Table 5: Descriptions of Climate-Related Physical and Transitional Risks and Opportunities
38
A Roadmap for Municipalities
Climate-related financial disclosures must be embedded into municipal financial reporting processes. Integrate 
climate-related information into annual reports, financial statements, and other relevant disclosures, ensuring that it 
is in accordance with relevant municipal financial reporting standards such as those established by the Public Sector 
Accounting Board. Provide clear and comprehensive information on the financial implications of climate risks and 
opportunities.
6.3.7 Integrate Climate Disclosures into Financial Reports
1. Disclosure should represent relevant information.
2. Disclosure should be specific and complete.
3. Disclosure should be clear, balanced, and understandable.
4. Disclosure should be consistent over time.
5. Disclosure should be comparable among companies within a sector industry or portfolio.
6. Disclosure should be reliable, verifiable, and objective.
7. Disclosure should be provided on a timely basis.
To help achieve high-quality disclosures that enable users to understand the impact of climate change on 
organizations, TCFD recommends that organizations consider seven principles for effective disclosure:
After identifying and evaluating climate-related risks and opportunities and determining those with material significance, 
develop a plan for managing them and targets and metrics to monitor progress.
This plan should be closely linked to existing climate action plans to ensure alignment with broader climate work and 
should also integrate with existing risk management plans where available. Through TCFD, the plan (and how it is 
integrated into general risk management) is disclosed in the municipality’s annual financial statement. Management’s 
role in plan creation must also be disclosed.
6.3.6 Develop a Plan to Manage Climate-Related Issues
1. GHG Emissions: Absolute Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3; emissions intensity.
2. Transition Risks: Amount and extent of assets or business activities vulnerable to transition risks.
3. Physical Risks: Amount and extent of assets or business activities vulnerable to physical risks.
4. Climate-Related Opportunities: Proportion of revenue, assets, or other business activities
aligned with climate-related opportunities.
5. Capital Deployment: Amount of capital expenditure, financing, or investment deployed toward
climate-related risks and opportunities.
6. Internal Carbon Prices: Price on each ton of GHG emissions used internally by an organization.
7. Remuneration: Proportion of executive management remuneration linked to climate considerations.
Along with the management plan, progress metrics must be identified and disclosed, consistent with the seven 
climate-related metric categories developed by TCFD:
For more information on metrics and targets, the TCFD has produced this guidance document.

6.4 Examples of Municipal TCFD Reporting
In 2018, Vancouver became the first municipality in Canada to integrate TCFD-recommended disclosures in its annual 
financial report, allowing for new and important conversations between sustainability, finance, and risk management 
departments.
Vancouver acknowledges where continuous improvement is required to meet the full set of TCFD recommendations. It 
has committed to further developing its reporting capability, improving risk assessments, developing better data sources 
and collection methods, and better identifying and quantifying transition risks. More information on Vancouver’s TCFD 
approach is available here.
The City of Vancouver’s 2021 Statement of Financial Information provides a 20-page report on TCFD, which provides the 
context and rationale behind the inclusion of TCFD, how the City plans to enhance its TCFD reporting capabilities, and 
disclosures related to the four elements: Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and Metrics and Targets.
Vancouver, BC
In 2018, the City began reporting climate-related information within its annual financial reports based on the TCFD 
framework. The City’s 2020 Annual Financial Report provides detail on key TCFDrecommended disclosures including the 
rationale and context for TCFD-alignment, results from its Maturity Assessment, and its disclosures for 2020 related to 
Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and Metrics and Targets.
The City has committed to ongoing work to improve its identification and management of climate risks and 
opportunities including performing a climate change vulnerability assessment and developing an enterprise risk 
management framework that includes climate change considerations. Based on the City’s Maturity Assessment, it 
identified that substantial future action was needed to reach Phase 3 – Highly Integrated in the disclosure categories of 
Strategy and Metrics and Targets.

A Roadmap for Municipalities
TCFD provides a valuable framework for municipalities to better understand, identify, and manage climate risks and 
opportunities with financial impacts. By incorporating TCFD recommendations, municipalities can enhance their risk 
management and demonstrate accountability on climate. 
The benefits of adopting the TCFD framework are numerous. It enables municipalities to gain a comprehensive 
understanding of climate risks, integrating them into existing risk management practices and allowing for informed 
decisions and development of strategies to mitigate and adapt to climaterelated challenges. Additionally, TCFD reporting 
improves stakeholder engagement by providing transparent and reliable information, fostering communication and trust 
between the municipality and its stakeholders. 
To implement the TCFD recommendations, municipalities can follow several key steps. These include familiarizing 
themselves with the core recommendation areas of governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. 
Assessing current reporting practices allows municipalities to identify gaps and areas for TCFD integration. Establishing a 
dedicated TCFD governance and implementation team ensures effective coordination and accountability. Conducting a 
climate risk and opportunity assessment helps identify material climate-related issues, which can then be managed 
through the development of a comprehensive plan. Finally, integrating climate disclosures into the municipality’s annual 
financial statement enhances transparency and aligns reporting with the TCFD framework.
While there are notable examples of municipalities implementing the TCFD recommendations, it’s important to 
remember that reporting practices continually evolve and improve through implementation and learning. By actively 
engaging with the TCFD framework and continuously refining their reporting processes, municipalities can effectively 
address climate-related financial risks and enhance their climate resilience. 
6.5 Conclusion
41
A Roadmap for Municipalities
7. Putting It All Together: A Combined 
Approach for Climate Accountability
Taking decisive action on climate change is a pressing concern for Canadian municipalities. To enhance climate 
accountability, municipalities can implement and combine a range of accountability onramps, including a climate 
emergency declaration, municipal climate action plan, climate lenses, carbon budgeting, and implementation of the 
Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework. This section explores how these actions can be 
implemented individually or in combination, identifies synergies between them, and highlights their collective impact in 
bolstering overall climate accountability.
42
A Roadmap for Municipalities
Overall, these onramps interact synergistically to enhance climate accountability. The climate emergency 
declaration sets the stage for action, while the municipal climate action plan provides a comprehensive roadmap 
for addressing climate challenges. Integrating a climate lens ensures that all municipal decisions align with climate 
goals, while carbon budgets establish clear emissions caps and tracking mechanisms. The TCFD framework 
enhances financial accountability, aligns financial strategies with climate objectives and provides reporting 
standards to support year-over-year progress tracking and comparison. Together, these actions create a cohesive 
framework that maximizes municipal effectiveness in tackling climate change and increasing overall accountability 
to climate action.
Figure 3 illustrates further how each of these onramps fit within this framework and create synergies within the 
stages of data, policy and tool development, planning, budgeting, and reporting.
1.	 Climate Emergency Declaration and Climate Action Plan: The climate emergency declaration and the 
municipal climate action plan are closely interconnected. The declaration serves as a catalyst, signaling 
the municipality’s commitment to urgent action. It creates a sense of responsibility and provides a 
strong foundation for the development and implementation of a climate action plan. The declaration’s 
acknowledgment of the climate crisis helps mobilize resources, support, and the political will necessary for 
effective climate action planning. The action plan, in turn, translates the declaration’s intent into specific 
strategies and measures for mitigating GHG emissions and adapting to climate change impacts. It identifies 
priority sectors, sets targets, selects climate actions and commits to a monitoring and reporting framework. 
The two actions work together to provide a clear vision and roadmap for the municipality’s climate efforts.
2.	 Carbon Budgets and Climate Action Plan: Carbon budgets provide a mechanism for capping and tracking 
GHG emissions over time and aligning municipal budget decisions with these caps. This supports the case to 
approve budget items that can help the municipality stay under these caps, which are typically outlined in 
the climate action plan. Both the carbon budgeting process and the climate action plan also require regular 
monitoring and reporting of emissions to track progress and identify areas of improvement.
3.	 Climate Action Plan and TCFD: Climate action plans and the TCFD framework both require that a climate 
risk assessment and GHG inventory be developed. Producing the relevant data and analysis for both 
onramps improves the value of this data and reduces potentially redundant data collection and analysis 
activities. Furthermore, the TCFD framework complements the climate action plan by identifying and 
addressing the financial implications of climate change, such as physical risks, transition risks, and 
opportunities. This understanding allows them to integrate financial considerations into climate action 
planning and prioritization.
4.	 Climate Lens and TCFD: Integrating a climate lens in staff reports and decision-making processes helps 
identify climate-related financial risks and opportunities associated with proposed projects or policies. 
The TCFD framework provides a structured approach to assess and disclose climaterelated financial risks, 
aligning financial strategies with climate objectives. The climate lens and TCFD complement each other 
by ensuring that climate risks and opportunities are considered from both operational and financial 
perspectives, leading to more informed decision-making, and enhanced financial accountability.

A Roadmap for Municipalities
When embarking on the journey to enhance climate accountability, a municipality can begin by undertaking the 
following ten actions:
1. Climate Emergency Declaration: Make an official declaration acknowledging the climate crisis and the municipality’s 
commitment to urgent action. This sets the tone and establishes the groundwork for comprehensive climate 
accountability. See Section 2.
2. Establish a Climate Accountability Governance System: Create a governance system dedicated to the development 
and implementation of climate accountability onramps within the municipality. This system should incorporate 
individuals and groups that can impact and be impacted by the municipalities response to climate change. See Section 3 
and Appendix A.
8. Key Takeaways
45
A Roadmap for Municipalities
8. Implement the TCFD Framework: Assess and disclose climate-related financial risks and opportunities. Align financial 
strategies with climate goals, ensuring that the municipality’s investments and procurement practices are consistent with 
its climate objectives. See Section 6.
9. Collaborate with Municipal Climate Networks: Engage in partnerships and collaborative efforts with neighbouring 
municipalities, regional organizations, and national climate networks. Sharing knowledge, resources, and best practices 
can enhance climate accountability and accelerate progress.
10. Establish Monitoring and Reporting Mechanisms: Develop a system to track and report progress on climate action. 
Regularly communicate updates, successes, and challenges to stakeholders, ensuring transparency and accountability 
throughout the process. See Section 3 and Appendix D
3. Conduct a Climate Vulnerability and Risk Assessment: Evaluate current and projected climate vulnerabilities and risks 
and identify their potential financial impacts using TCFD guidance. This assessment will provide a baseline understanding 
of the challenges the municipality faces and inform climate action and risk management planning. See section 3 and 
Appendix C.
4. Develop a Climate Action Plan: Create a comprehensive plan that outlines specific strategies and measures for both 
mitigation and adaptation. The plan should include clear targets, timelines, and responsible parties for each action item. 
See Section 3.
5. Integrate Climate Implications/Lens into Decision-Making Processes: Ensure that climate considerations are 
systematically incorporated into decision making processes. Establish guidelines and training programs to facilitate the 
integration of a climate lens across all departments. See Section 4.
6. Engage and Educate the Community: Conduct outreach and engagement initiatives to raise awareness about climate 
change, the municipality’s commitment, and the importance of collective action. Provide educational resources, 
workshops, and platforms for community input.
7. Establish Carbon Budgets: Implement a system for setting emission reduction targets and allocating carbon 
allowances to different sectors or departments. This provides a measurable framework for tracking progress and holding 
stakeholders accountable. See Section 5
