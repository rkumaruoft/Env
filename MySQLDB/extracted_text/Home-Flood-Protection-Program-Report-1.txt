EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Residential basement flooding is on the rise across much of Canada. Intense 
rainfall events combined with aging infrastructure, increased urbanization, loss of 
natural infrastructure, and a lack of flood protection measures at the household 
level have resulted in losses in the billions of dollars for the country’s insurance 
companies, governments, homeowners, landlords and tenants over the past 
decade. With an average price tag of $43,000 per flooded basement (Insurance 
Bureau of Canada, 2018), Canadian residents are increasingly seeking site-specific 
guidance to help them achieve practical, cost-effective means to reduce their 
household flood risk.
From 2016 to 2018, the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation (University of 
Waterloo) developed and tested the Home Flood Protection Program (HFPP), 
which is an initiative designed to provide homeowners with practical information 
necessary to identify and limit their risk of basement flooding.
A key lesson learned from the program was that there are 10 top actions that 
can be completed to significantly reduce the risk of basement flooding for 
most homes (see the top 10 actions listed on page 18). Many of these actions 
can be completed by residents themselves in less than 1 day, for under $250. 
Unfortunately, many residents are not completing these actions. Program results 
indicate that direct conversations, between homeowners and those trained in 
flood risk mitigation, are the most effective means to motivate residents to take 
action to reduce flood risk at the household level. 
Program Delivery
The Home Flood Protection Program was piloted in Toronto and Burlington, 
Ontario, as well as in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan (2016-2018). The HFPP delivery 
in each community included the following key elements:
1. Free Online Resources: Home flood protection fact sheets and video links were 
provided through the program’s webpage www.homefloodprotect.ca. Additional 
local resources were included for participating communities, featuring local 
flood protection subsidy program information and tips for selecting local flood 
risk mitigation contractors.
2. Home Flood Protection Assessment: A confidential, onsite, 60-90 minute flood 
risk assessment service was made available to owners of detached homes, 
semi-detached homes and townhomes. The service featured an easy-to-read 
summary report and an optional 15-minute follow-up conversation with the 
assessor. Depending on the resources available within each pilot community, 
the assessment was available to residents for a fee ranging from $0 to $125.
3. Customized Outreach Strategy: A unique outreach strategy was developed for 
each community based on its flood risk reduction goals, project timelines and 
the resources available. Program planning and promotions were developed in 
collaboration with local municipalities, conservation authorities, community 
groups and insurance providers to complement and enhance ongoing flood risk 
reduction efforts.
Program Results
A total of 510 HFPP assessments were completed. Ten flood risk assessors 
were trained in Ontario, delivering 397 flood risk assessments in 2017 and 2018. 
Fueled by the success of the Ontario program, an additional two assessors  
were trained in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, delivering 113 assessments in 2018.
In Ontario, 72% of program participants participated in a Home Flood Protection 
follow-up study. Its purpose was to determine the degree to which homeowners 
took action to limit flood risk based on information they received during their 
Home Flood Protection Assessment. Ninety-one participants completed a  
three-month follow-up survey and 24 participants completed a six-month 
follow-up survey. The flood risk data featured in this report summarizes the  
results of these assessment reports and follow-up surveys.

Flood Risks Outside the Home
Visual assessment of the lot grading, landscaping and exterior characteristics of participating Ontario homes  
revealed several key flood protection features that consistently did not meet best practice standards for reducing risk. 
These deficiencies increased the risk of overland and seepage flooding into the basement. Eighty-two percent of homes 
with window wells had wells that were not 10-15cm above the surface of the ground and sealed at the foundation. 
Seventy-eight percent of homes with downspouts and 68% of homes with sump pump discharge pipes discharged 
water less than 2m from the home’s foundation. Seventy-five percent of homes with doors below grade had drains 
and door seals in poor condition. Sixty-nine percent of homes had grading that did not direct water away from the 
foundation and 63% of homes with basement windows had cracks and gaps in the windows or frames (Figure 1A). When 
asked to report on maintenance efforts to limit flood risk outside of the home, residents stated that they were acting with 
commendable effort – however, such reporting stood in contrast to on-the-ground observations (Figure 1B).
Flood Risks Inside the Home
Visual assessment of basements revealed several key flood protection features that did not meet best practice standards 
for reducing risk. These deficiencies put homes at increased risk of sump pit overflow, sewer backup and damage to the 
basement’s structure and contents. Eighty-five percent of homes with sump pumps did not have a back-up sump pump 
and 84% did not have backup power in case of a power outage. Seventy-one percent of homes had furniture and 
electronics and 65% had stored valuables at risk of water damage during a flood. Sixty-one percent had improperly 
stored hazardous materials (e.g. paints, pesticides) that may increase damage during a flood (Figure 1C). Several key 
maintenance activities that were not completed twice a year put homes at increased risk of sump pit overflow and sewer 
backup. Fifty-three percent of homes with backwater valves never maintained them, 43% of homes with backup power 
for their sump pump never maintained the system, 40% with sump pumps never maintained them, and 26% of homes 
put fat, oil or grease down their drains (Figure 1D).

Actions Taken to Reduce Flood Risk
Each home flood risk assessment report featured a 
summary of the top actions that could be taken “outside” 
and “inside” the home to reduce risk. These summaries 
identified physical features and maintenance practices 
that ranked as “poor/needs further investigation.” 
Study participants were asked to report at 3 months 
and 6 months to identify which actions they had taken 
to address any of these top ranked deficiencies. At 3 
months, 79% of participants noted completing at least 
one new action to address flood risk, and at 6 months, 
71% of participants noted completing at least one 
additional action. As part of the 3-month follow-up 
survey, 59% of participants noted that they had 
completed the actions themselves or with the help of 
family and friends, 34% noted that the actions had been 
completed by a contractor, and 19% stated that actions 
were still in the process of being completed (Figure 2A).
Sixty percent of participants completed actions that 
cost under $500 and could be completed by a “handy-
person” homeowner generally within a day. Examples 
of these actions include: storing valuables in waterproof 
containers or removing them from the basement, 
cleaning out eaves troughs, installing window well covers, 
and extending downspouts and sump pump discharge 
pipes to a minimum of 2m away from the foundation. 
Forty percent of participants completed actions that 
were more complex, costly and often required the 
FIGURE 2: INSTALLATION AND REPAIRS COMPLETED TO REDUCE FLOOD RISK
support of qualified contractors. The cost of completing 
these actions ranged widely from $500 to over $10,000 
(Figure 2B). Some of these actions included installing a 
backwater valve, backup sump pump or backup battery, 
relining or replacing a sewer lateral, installing a sewer 
lateral cleanout, replacing basement windows, replacing 
eaves troughs, replacing a driveway and installing 
window wells.
Key Information Resources Cited
Participants used various resources to support their 
decision-making and to help them complete flood  
risk reduction actions. The powerful influence of one-
on-one conversations with trusted flood risk mitigation 
experts stands out as significant. Seventy-one percent  
of participants cited conversations with their Home Flood 
Protection Assessors and 68% cited their assessment 
report (which is a written record of the conversation 
with the assessor) as key resources used. Twenty-seven 
percent cited the importance of conversations with 
family, friends and neighbours, 23% cited conversations 
with local contractors and 10% cited advice from staff 
at local hardware stores as key decision-making sources 
of information. Participants also noted referring to 
educational materials they found online (24%), and in 
newspapers, books and magazines (9%) (Figure 2C).

Barriers to Taking Action to Reduce Flood Risk
The main barriers that homeowners identified to taking 
action can be divided into two main categories: barriers 
for those who wished to engage a contractor to do the 
work and barriers for those who wished to complete 
the work themselves. For those wishing to engage a 
contractor, 42% of surveyed participants noted that 
a lack of money was a barrier to action, 36% noted 
that there was a lack of time (many noted they were 
still waiting for a contractor to complete the work) and 
10% noted difficulty finding a qualified contractor. For 
those wishing to complete the work themselves, a lack 
of personal expertise (20%), and physical limitations on 
their properties to finding a workable solution (such as 
wanting to extend the downspout but realizing it would 
present a tripping hazard (18%)) were noted barriers. 
Additional top ranked barriers related to the perceived 
lack of urgency for completing the work. For example, 
32% noted that taking action was a low priority. A total of 
12% of participants noted that they received conflicting 
advice from various sources about how to tackle a 
problem, and therefore their project stalled (Figure 3A).
Opportunities to Increase Uptake of Flood 
Protection Actions by Residents
Participants identified that they would like increased 
access to financial support, improved access to qualified 
contractors and increased access to trustworthy, third-
party information resources to help improve their ability 
to protect their homes from flooding.
• Increased Access to Financial Support
Fifty percent of participants stated they would like 
a financial subsidy to help them complete flood risk 
reduction projects, 31% noted that they would like 
financial support to get access to qualified contractors 
for free, and 27% noted that they would like help 
accessing available subsidies (Figure 3B).
Participants support the provision of municipal flood 
protection subsidies, including subsidies to complete 
flood risk assessments. They also recommend a 
streamlined process for accessing subsidies such 
as instant rebates at retail stores for items such as 
downspout extensions and sump pump backup systems 
to simplify the process of accessing subsidies and 
to increase uptake. Participants are also in favour of 
receiving insurance discounts for taking action to  
reduce flood risk.
• Increased Access to Qualified Contractors
Fifty-four percent of participants noted that they would 
like increased access to trusted service providers and 
41% noted that they would like help selecting qualified 
contractors (Figure 3B).
Presently residents are experiencing challenges finding 
qualified contractors who can do flood protection work 
for them in a timely manner. Many participants noted 
long delays waiting for contractors and difficulties 
getting contractors to respond to requests for smaller 
jobs that they needed done.
A business opportunity exists in Ontario for trained 
home flood risk assessors to help residents identify 
their key opportunities to reduce risk. Additional 
opportunities exist for contractors to provide flood 
protection installation, maintenance and subsidy 
application services to residents. Increasing the number 
of contractors engaged in residential flood protection 
services will help address the demonstrated public 
demand for services and will drive local economic  
growth for contractors and suppliers.

• Trustworthy, Third-Party Information Resources
Residents want greater access to third-party information 
resources, particularly those residents who wish to 
complete actions on their own. Participants noted that 
they want trustworthy information from a source that is 
not trying to sell any one particular product or service, 
including those resources produced by government, 
academic, and non-governmental organizations.
Thirty percent of participants noted that they wanted 
greater access to third-party how-to videos and 22% 
noted that they wanted greater access to third-party fact 
sheets (Figure 3B).
Cost-effective opportunities exist for agencies to share 
clear and consistent third-party information with their 
networks. Opportunities also exist for training industry 
professionals (home inspectors, realtors, insurance 
brokers, retailers, and mortgage brokers), government 
and non-governmental organization staff about helping 
residents to reduce flood risk. Part of the training should 
include the provision of reputable, third-party resources 
that they can share with their networks, including how-
to-videos, flood protection subsidy information and 
seasonal maintenance reminders.
Supporting Residential Flood Risk Reduction 
Across Canada
Reducing residential basement flood risk at a national 
scale is a complex challenge that will involve building on 
the successful work already underway by governments, 
not-for-profits, academia, retailers, and insurance 
companies to educate residents and provide financial 
incentives where possible, to help homeowners take 
sustained action to reduce flood risk. It will also include 
bringing additional parties to the table, such as landlord 
and tenant organizations, to ensure that they are aware 
of their risks and can take action to reduce those risks. 
Basement apartments represent some of the most cost-
effective housing units in Canada, and it is critical that 
concerted efforts be made to ensure safe and reliable 
access to this form of housing.
The Intact Centre’s Support of Nation-Wide 
Basement Flood Risk Reduction Education 
Programs
The Home Flood Protection Program’s flood risk 
reduction educational innovations are now driving action 
to reduce residential flood risk nation-wide.
Two key training programs are in place, one creating a 
skilled workforce to assess residential flood risk, and 
the other training industry professionals as well as 
government and not-for-profit staff to help residents 
understand their flood risk, and how to take action to 
reduce that risk. The programs are described below:
Home Flood Risk Assessor Training
In 2018, the Intact Centre partnered with Seneca and 
Fleming Colleges to develop a 42-hour Home Flood Risk 
Assessment Training (HFRAT) course for home flood 
risk assessors. In September 2018, the first course was 
offered at Seneca College in Toronto. The course is 
available nationally in 2019 through the Ontario Colleges’ 
online training portal, OnLearn. Course graduates are 
granted access to the Home Flood Protection Program’s 
nationally applicable electronic residential flood risk 
assessment tool, thus enabling them to complete flood 
risk assessments for residential clients.
Registration is available at: https://fleming-
college.ca/continuing-education/courses/
home-flood-risk-assessment-training
Home Flood Risk Educator Training and Materials
In October 2018, a one-hour in-class flood risk educa-
tion training program was developed and accredited for 
registered insurance brokers in Ontario. This training 
program is now being adapted for in-person and online 
deployment to insurance brokers nationally and to 
facilitate training of additional groups nation-wide that 
provide front line flood risk reduction and educational 
support to homeowners. These groups include realtors, 
mortgage brokers, emergency service workers, retailers, 
municipal and conservation authority staff, not-for profits, 
landlords and tenant associations. The course provides 
learners with easily shareable and adaptable third-party 
resources that they can use to drive residential action to 
reduce basement flood risk.
Third Party Resources
A variety of free, third-party how-to resources are 
available to residents and organizations who would like 
to educate their residential networks. Resources are 
available through the Home Flood Protection Program 
website: www.homefloodprotect.ca

1. DEVELOPMENT OF THE HOME FLOOD 
PROTECTION PROGRAM (HFPP)
The Intact Centre developed the Home Flood Protection 
Program (HFPP) to help homeowners reduce their risk of 
basement flooding, and to minimize damage if flooding 
did occur.

About the Home Flood Protection Assessment
The HFPP offers homeowners a customized flood-
risk evaluation known as the “Home Flood Protection 
Assessment”. The assessment takes approximately 
1.5 hours to complete. The assessment begins with 
an assessor conducting a 5 minute interview with the 
homeowner to discuss their past flood experiences, 
actions taken to reduce flood risk, and key concerns that 
they would like the assessment to address. During the 
assessment, the homeowner accompanies the trained 
assessor in completing a visual assessment of 45 physical 
features inside and outside the home using simple tools 
such as measuring tapes, flashlights and audible moisture 
meters. The assessment also covers 35 maintenance 
practices, during which the homeowner is asked about 
how often they complete each flood risk reduction 
maintenance activity.
Using the Intact Centre’s nationally applicable flood 
risk assessment tool, all features are assigned a 
score of “good”, “intermediate” or “poor/needs 
further investigation”. Items that score “poor/needs 
further investigation” are itemized in inside and 
outside summary pages which also identify practical 
opportunities to reduce risk. In the Appendices, the 
report includes a record of all items scored during the 
assessment and a list of customized resources that 
residents can use to help them take action.
Residents receive the confidential report in the mail 
or through a password protected online portal. Upon 
receipt of the report, residents have the option to have  
a 15-minute follow-up conversation with the assessor.

HOME FLOOD PROTECTION PROGRAM
1.1 Development of the Assessment Tool and Report
The Home Flood Protection Assessment’s best practices 
and scoring system were developed from January to 
December 2016. To develop the content, the Intact 
Centre completed a review of literature on the following 
topics: residential flood vulnerability, best practices for 
reducing flood risk, and best practices for engaging 
residents in one-on-one conversations about flood risk 
reduction (see Appendix A for a list of assessment  
tools reviewed).
Once the best practices and the resident engagement 
script drafts were completed, feedback was sought from 
subject matter experts. The updated version of the tool 
and protocols were field-tested in March 2017 and minor 
updates were made based on feedback from assessors. 
In 2018, additional upgrades to the best practices in the 
Home Flood Protection Tool were made to ensure that 
they met the technical requirements of the Canadian 
Standards Association Z800-18 Guideline on Basement 
Flood Protection and Risk Reduction (published Fall 2018).
1.2 Development of the HFPP Outreach Strategy
Based on the national and international literature review 
on motivating homeowner action to reduce flood risk, 
a comprehensive outreach framework was developed 
and tested in 2017 in Burlington, Ontario. This resulted 
in the completion of 86 assessments in Burlington and 
18 in nearby communities. In 2018, the original outreach 
approach was adapted to meet the goals, project 
timelines and resources available in the participating 
communities of Toronto and Burlington, Ontario, as  
well as in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.
1.3 Development of the HFPP Training Program
Development of the HFPP’s training program, which 
included 30 hours of online and 20 hours of in-person 
training, was completed in 2017 and resulted in the 
training of 10 flood risk assessors in Ontario. An 
additional 2 assessors were trained in Saskatoon in 
2018 (see Appendix B for a list of stakeholders consulted 
during the development of the training program).
As part of a complementary project, in collaboration 
with Seneca and Fleming Colleges, the Intact Centre’s 
assessor training program was adapted into a 42-hour 
in-class course that featured the use of the home flood 
risk assessment tool. The first class was offered in 
September 2018 at Seneca College, Toronto. Students 
enrolled in the program were primarily from the fields 
of home inspection, insurance and engineering. 
An online version of the course is available across 
Canada in 2019 through the Ontario Colleges OnLearn 
training portal. Registration is available at https://

2. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION
2.1 Overview of Program Approaches and Results
A total of 510 Home Flood Protection Assessments 
were completed in 2017 and 2018: 120 in Burlington, 
168 in Toronto, 109 in areas within 150 km of the  
Greater Toronto Area (including Kitchener-Waterloo, 
Brantford, Guelph and Clarington), and 113 in 
Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.
2.2 Pillars of Program Development
The design, promotion and delivery of the HFPP were 
based on the internationally recognized program pillars 
for motivating homeowners to take action to reduce 
their flood risk. Necessity, responsibility, trust, ability, 
and return on investment were key elements that were 
highlighted in the development of all communications 
materials and communications approaches. These pillars 
are described in greater detail below.
Necessity – Is the risk real and urgent?
• Past Flood Experience: Studies note that experience 
with past floods (especially frequent or intense floods) 
leads to higher levels of action among homeowners 
(Owusu, 2015)
• Risk Mapping: Studies note that providing homeowners 
with urban or riverine flood risk maps can help 
increase uptake of actions but only if this information 
is delivered by trusted community leaders, family or 
friends (Owusu, 2015)
Responsibility – Is the resident responsible for 
taking action?
• Acknowledging Personal Responsibility: The realization 
that reducing flood risk is the homeowner’s 
responsibility and not that of an outside source (e.g. 
government or insurance company, or in the case of 
tenants, their landlord) has shown to result in higher 
levels of action (Maidl and Bruckheimer, 2015)
• Partners in Protection: Homeowners need to understand 
that they have a critical role to play in protecting their 
homes and that these efforts complement the efforts 
of governments and insurance companies (Maidl and 
Bruckheimer, 2015)
Trust – Is the information that is being provided 
trustworthy and worth one’s attention?
• Trustworthy Information: The belief that the measures 
recommended will work (e.g. personal experience 
or from trusted individuals) is positively correlated 
with higher levels of action among homeowners 
(Thistlethwaite et al., 2017)
• Basic Fact Checking: Residents look to governments, 
insurance companies and media personalities to 
receive high level guidance about what information is 
accurate and worthy of their attention (Johnson, 2012)
• Decision-Making Tipping Point: Residents consider the 
opinions of trusted individuals to make final decisions 
about taking action (e.g. help from family, friends, 
neighbours, contractors, retailers) (Johnson, 2012)
Ability – Does the resident have the information 
necessary to make informed decisions as well as the skills 
and the financial supports needed to take action?
• Self-Evaluated Ability: A homeowner’s self-evaluated 
ability to address the problem has an important 
influence on the level of action taken. Positive belief in 
their personal ability to act is positively correlated with 
higher levels of action
• Co-Creation: Flood Risk Assessments feature a 
problem-solving conversation between the trained 
flood risk assessor and the residents. Studies have 
shown that residents are much more likely to take 
action if they feel that they have made a well-informed 
decision themselves as opposed to if they are being 
told what they must do (Mackenzie-Mohr, 2011; 
Thistlethwaite et al., 2017)
• Access to Needed Funds: Financial subsidies can help 
to reduce the barriers to action, but if residents must 
initially self-finance, and subsequently get reimbursed, 
or if the application paperwork is lengthy/confusing, 
this reduces the likelihood that they will take advantage 
of these resources (Kreibich and Schwartze, 2011)
Return on Investment – Is it worth the time and money 
required to reduce risk?
• Reasonable Return On Investment: The perception that 
the cost of installing measures provides a reasonable 
return on investment relative to the risk of an event 
happening, and the associated cost is also an 
important factor in determining the level of action 
among homeowners (Kreibich and Schwartze, 2011)
See Appendix C for literature regarding motivating 
behavioural change to reduce risk.

2.3 Adapting a Communications Strategy for Each 
Pilot Community
The communications strategy for each pilot community 
was created using the five pillars for motivating action 
to reduce risk. However, each tactical plan was adapted 
based on the goals, timelines and resources available in 
each community. Broad-based and targeted outreach 
promotional tactics were employed in each community. 
2.3.1 Burlington, Ontario – 2017
Roughly 3,500 Burlington residents reported basement 
flooding during an extreme weather event in August 
2014. Following the flood, the Regional Municipality 
of Halton undertook a comprehensive educational 
program with residents to raise awareness about 
reducing flood risks. Educational efforts focused on 
means to reduce sewer backup risk and highlighting 
the availability of flood protection financial subsidies. 
Burlington completed a flood risk reduction study that 
identified areas at higher risk of overland flooding and 
priority infrastructure updates to help reduce this risk, 
demonstrating the need to increase awareness and 
action to reduce overland flood risk.
In 2017, Burlington engaged the Intact Centre to deliver 
the Home Flood Protection Program as part of its 
ongoing efforts to help residents reduce their risk of 
basement flooding. The City of Burlington, the Province 
of Ontario, the Intact Centre and participating residents 
(through program fees) provided funding support to 
deliver the program. Assessments were available to 
all residents at a subsidized cost of $125 paid by the 
homeowner. From July to October 2017, a two-pronged 
promotions strategy was used which featured broad-
based and targeted marketing. The promotions strategy 
proved to be successful resulting in the completion of 
86 assessments. Regional flood subsidy information 
was shared with residents through the HFPP program. 
HFPP staff worked collaboratively with the Regional and 
City governments to help identify areas for targeted 
outreach and to help promote the program. Burlington 
identified areas at higher risk of overland flooding. 
These areas had not been previously targeted by their 
Regional government’s outreach and subsidy programs 
(which focused on reducing sewer backup flooding). The 
University of Waterloo led the development of on-the-
ground promotional activities by running focus group 
sessions for residents in target neighbourhoods, tailoring 
program messaging and outreach to reflect the feedback 
of participating key influencers in the community (e.g., 
City councillor, realtor, neighbourhood association 
presidents, hardware store owner). 
2.3.2 Burlington, Ontario – 2018
In 2018, an outreach approach, fully funded by the 
Intact Centre, was deployed to test the impacts of a $0 
assessment price tag on Home Flood Protection Program 
uptake. The simplified promotions approach was tested 
to promote and deliver up to 100 assessments for free 
to residents. The only outreach that was completed 
was by the Mayor and councillors through newsletters 
and social media. As the program had already built a 
good reputation, community members were sharing 
information with their friends and family about the value 
of the service and the $0 fee. With minimal promotional 
efforts from April to September, an additional 34 
assessments were completed in 2018 for a total of 120 
assessments in Burlington.
Burlington’s 2017 broad-based outreach on Home Flood 
Protection included:
• Program launch with Mayor, City councillors, 
Provincial Government, Intact Centre and AET Group 
representatives appearing at a press conference 
covered by local media
• Program ads in community newspapers
• Mayor’s television, radio and public speaking 
appearances about the program
• Social media posts featuring success stories of local 
participants, developed by Intact Centre and shared 
by the City and councillors
Burlington’s 2017 targeted outreach tactics included:
• Newsletters from City councillors to their constituents
• Community meetings facilitated by City engineering 
staff and City councillors
• Intact Centre staff and assessors attending community 
events, completing community presentations
• Delivery of door hangers to target neighbourhoods 
by assessors (planned door-to-door program was 
cancelled due to City’s concern about being 
associated with a fraudulent door-to-door campaign 
operating in the City at the time)
• Front yard signs available for program participants  
to post in front of their homes to show program 
support and encourage

2.3.3 Toronto, Ontario – 2018 
In 2013, roughly 4,700 Toronto residential basements 
were flooded due to an extreme rainfall event. Following 
the flood, Toronto’s water management department, 
Toronto Water, completed outreach activities to raise 
awareness about how to reduce flood risk and about 
subsidies available through the City for installing flood 
protection measures. In 2018, the Intact Centre was 
engaged by the City of Toronto’s Resiliency Office to 
deliver the Home Flood Protection Program as well as 
Toronto-focused Emergency Preparedness information 
as part of their information resource package for 
residents. The program was rebranded as the Toronto 
Home Resilience Program to align with the branding of 
the Toronto Resilience Office. Funding and promotional 
support was provided by the Insurance Bureau of Canada 
and the Intact Centre, with additional promotional 
support provided by the City of Toronto and Intact 
Financial. The Toronto Home Resilience Program 
provided information about the flood protection subsidy 
programs offered by Toronto Water.
From July to September 2018, a simplified, broad-based 
and targeted marketing approach was applied. Up to 
200 assessments were offered to Toronto residents for a 
fee of $95. Broad-based promotions included a program 
launch event, paid and unpaid social media campaigns, 
and program staff appearances on local news stations 
and the Weather Network. Targeted promotions included 
emails to the City of Toronto, IBC and Intact Financial 
employees as well as insurance brokers and sustainability 
networks through direct email campaigns. A total of 168 
assessments were completed. See Appendix E for the 
program flyer, F for traditional media coverage, and G for 
a social media sample.  
2.3.4 Saskatoon, Saskatchewan – 2018 
In 2018, the City of Saskatoon engaged the Intact Centre 
to deliver the Home Flood Protection Program as part 
of its efforts to support residents who had experienced 
overland flooding during two extreme rainfall events that 
flooded hundreds of homes in 2017. Additional funding 
support was received from Saskatoon Government 
Insurance (SGI Canada) to help support program 
promotions. The Intact Centre provided financial and 
promotional support for the project. The City took the 
lead on program promotions.
The City offered up to 100 free assessments to residents 
in areas designated as being at higher risk of overland 
flooding. They used targeted marketing to engage 
residents, including flyers to select neighbourhoods, 
neighbourhood billboards, community meetings and 
a small door-to-door campaign. Up to 300 assessments 
were offered to all other areas in Saskatoon for $125. 
Broad-based tactics were used to engage these 
residents, primarily featuring utility bill inserts, traditional 
and social media. The program was promoted from 
March until September 2018. A total of 58 assessments 
were completed in areas that were offered free 
assessments and 55 assessments were completed in 
areas that required a $125 payment. See Appendix H 
for Public Service Announcement, I for Neighbourhood 
Billboard and J for City Councillor Newsletter.  
2.3.5 Comparing Effectiveness of Outreach 
Approaches 
Broad-based promotional methods that reached out 
to the entire community (e.g. social media, traditional 
media, utility bill inserts) resulted in higher numbers of 
requests for registrations in all cities because of their 
ability to engage large numbers of people, accounting 
for between 64% of registration requests in Toronto to 
as high as 74% of registration requests in Saskatoon. 
Targeted methods that focused on engaging smaller 
groups of people accounted for lower numbers of 
registration requests because they reached fewer 
residents, generating from 26% of requests in Saskatoon 
to 36% in Toronto. Of the targeted methods used, those 
that featured personal conversations accounted for 
significantly higher rates of registration requests than 
those using impersonal, group outreach methods such 
as door hangers. In Burlington and Saskatoon, personal 
engagement methods were 9 times as likely to result in 
registration requests than group methods. In Toronto 
the rate was roughly 4 to 1. See Appendix K. 
Not everyone completed their registration. When 
comparing conversions from registration requests to 
registration confirmations, free assessments showed 
consistently higher conversion rates ranging from 83% 
in Burlington in 2017 to 94% in Saskatoon in 2018. The 
assessments that carried a price tag for the homeowner 
demonstrated a lower conversion rate ranging from 
76% in Burlington in 2017 to 47% in Saskatoon in 2018. 
Program experience has shown that it is best to have 
one price that is charged to all residents to minimize 
confusion and maximize registration completion.

 2.4 Best Practices for Raising Awareness and 
Driving Action 
Several broad-based and targeted marketing approaches 
to promote flood risk protection were tested in various 
locations throughout 2017 and 2018. Based on a national 
and international review of best practices for raising 
awareness and driving action to reduce flood risk, a 
comprehensive outreach strategy was proposed by the 
Intact Centre for each participating municipality. This 
strategy was then adapted by each municipality to help 
them meet their program goals, timelines and to match 
the resources available.   
Despite the fact that the participating municipalities had 
different flood histories, some consistent best practices 
for raising awareness and driving action to reduce flood 
risk emerged. 
Flood risk reduction educational messages are most 
likely to be taken seriously by residents when they:
• Come from a trusted source (federal, provincial, 
municipal governments, conservation authorities) 
• Are simple and easy to understand
• Are repeated by a wide variety of trusted sources 
• Provide neighbourhood-specific flood risks  
(from rising river levels (riverine), rising lake levels and 
wave action (coastal) or urban flood risks (water flowing 
over the ground or backing up through sewer systems)
• Provide site-specific information about what can be 
done to reduce risk at the individual home (third-party 
assessments) 
• Are vetted by trusted local people (knowledgeable 
neighbourhood members, family or friends, local 
contractors or hardware store staff) 
• Provide opportunities for residents to participate 
in discussion and decision-making process (e.g., face-
to-face meetings and conversations) 
• Convey messages about actions that residents 
have control over (e.g., tenants can only control how 
valuables in their units are stored and what types of 
furnishings they select) 
Residents will maximize action to protect their homes 
from flooding when they have:
• Free access to third-party educational information 
about flood risk reduction best practices (e.g., fact 
sheets, how-to videos, self-assessment checklists,  
seasonal maintenance checklists, questions to ask  
insurance providers, tips for selecting contractors,  
and tips for accessing local subsidies)
• Financial support for key actions that reduce flood risks 
that are appropriate by municipality (e.g., installing 
backwater valves and alarms, installing sump pumps, 
backup sump pumps, backup batteries and alarms, 
disconnecting downspouts from foundation drains etc.) 
and consider providing subsidies to support third-party 
residential flood risk assessments
• A simple subsidy application process that requires little 
time to complete, provides instant rebates and provides 
application support services for residents 
•  Insurance rate adjustments to homeowners and tenants 
who have reduced their flood risk
Provide education and resources for groups that 
directly engage residents in flood risk reduction 
education:
•  Provide training for home inspectors so that they can 
integrate key flood risk considerations into their home 
inspection reports 
•  Provide training for realtors, insurance and mortgage 
brokers and not-for-profit staff members so they can 
encourage their clients to reduce flood risk 
•  Provide training for landlord and tenant organizations 
so they can encourage their members to reduce flood risk 
•  Engage contractors and local hardware stores directly 
in providing flood risk reduction and subsidy information 
to clients to increase uptake of actions to reduce risk
Remind residents about the importance of seasonal 
maintenance activities:
•  Consistent seasonal maintenance messaging should 
be made available community-wide by trusted 
sources (federal, provincial, municipal governments, 
conservation authorities, retailers, insurance companies 
and brokers, realtors, not-for-profits, and emergency 
response agencies) 
•  Direct reminders to residents who have installed flood 
risk reduction features in their homes (sump pump and 
backup power systems and alarms as well as backwater 
valves and alarm systems) should be provided by 
municipal governments, local contractors, insurance 
companies, and landlords where applicable 
•  Increase access to contracted services to complete 
seasonal maintenance activities for residents (e.g., 
cleaning out eaves troughs, maintenance of sump  
pump systems, and backwater valves)

3. FINDINGS OF THE HOME 
FLOOD PROTECTION STUDY
3.1 Study Characteristics
A total of 363 households agreed to participate in the 
Home Flood Protection Study. The results presented in 
this report reflect data from Ontario Study participants 
only, collected from the following: 285 assessment 
reports, 91 three-month follow-up surveys and 24 
six-month follow-up surveys. Study participation was 
focused geographically in southern Ontario, primarily 
in the Cites of Burlington and Toronto. Smaller numbers 
of study participants were from nearby communities 
including Oakville, Kitchener, Waterloo, Guelph, 
Hamilton, Brantford and Clarington. The condition of 
45 physical features was verified by a trained assessor 
using simple tools such as measuring tapes and audible 
moisture meters. The frequency of the completion of 35 
maintenance activities was reported by the resident and 
was recorded verbatim by the assessor. 
3.1.2 About the Homes Assessed
Eighty percent of homes that participated in the 
study were detached (Figure 4A). All participants were 
homeowners and almost all participants (99%) were 
owners of freehold units, while only 1% of participants 
were owners of condominium units (Figure 4B). Most 
homes were 2 storey (57%) (Figure 4C) and assessed 
homes were from a mix of development eras with 21% 
from between 1971 and 1990, 30% between 1940 and 
1970 and 34% from before 1940 (Figure 4D). Forty-
one percent of participating homes had fully finished 
basements, 43% had partly finished basements, and 
16% had unfinished basements (Figure 4E).

FIGURE 5: PARTICIPANTS’ PAST FLOOD 
EXPERIENCE
FIGURE 6: PARTICIPANTS’ SATISFACTION 
WITH ASSESSMENT SERVICE 
Past Flood Experience
A total of 69% of home flood risk assessment participants 
noted that they had experienced flooding in the past. 
This was defined as the sudden and accidental escape of 
any amount of water into the basement.
The most common causes of flooding that participants 
experienced were: seepage through the foundation 
(62% of participants) followed by sewer backup (24% of 
participants), leaks from plumbing and fixtures (22% of 
participants), and overland flooding through gaps or 
cracks in windows, doors and foundation cracks above 
ground (17% of participants) (Figure 5A).
The cost of completing flood repairs varied greatly. For 
example, 43% of participants completed repairs with no 
cost incurred, 30% of participants spent under $5,000 to 
complete repairs and the remaining 20% of participants 
spent over $5,000 to complete repairs (Figure 5B).
Satisfaction with the Service
Of the 64 people who responded to the customer 
service survey, 94% (58 participants) said that they would 
recommend the service to others. Participant satisfaction 
with the service was evident, as no participants scored 
the service 1 or 2 out of 5 (Figure 6).
Willingness to Pay for Assessments
The full cost of delivering a Home Flood Protection 
Assessment was $450. The maximum cost participants 
said they would be willing to pay for this service varied 
from $50 to $750, with the average willingness to pay 
being $150. Therefore, a subsidy would be required 
to support future assessments. Potential subsidies to 
support the program could come from municipalities 
and/or provincial governments. To reduce the cost 
of delivery, the key components of the Home Flood 
Protection Assessment could be integrated into a 
traditional home inspection.

Scoring of Assessed Features and Maintenance 
Practices Inside and Outside the Home 
Physical features were scored based on a visual 
assessment by the Home Flood Protection Assessor. 
Maintenance practices were scored based on the self-
reported practices of the participant. Using an electronic 
flood risk assessment questionnaire and scoring system, 
developed by the Intact Centre, each item assessed 
received a score of performing “well”, “intermediate”, 
or “poor/needs further investigation”.  
For each item an opportunity to reduce risk was 
identified, if applicable, and was entered into the  
Home Flood Protection Report. All items that scored 
“poor/needs further investigation” inside and outside  
the home were featured in summary pages that identified 
top risks and top opportunities to reduce risks. See 
Appendix L for a Summary or the Residential Flood  
Risk Reduction Best Practices referred to in the 
assessment tool, and Appendix M, for a Sample  
Home Flood Protection Assessment Report. 
Assessed Features 
Not all homes had the same number of flood protection 
features. For example, 98% of homes had basement 
windows, 62% of homes had window wells, 89% of homes 
had disconnected downspouts (that deposited water 
onto the surface of the ground), while 11% of homes 
had downspouts that were connected underground into 
foundation drains. Twenty-four percent of homes had 
sump pits and pumps, and 17% of homes had backwater 
valves (Figure 7). The risks expressed as percentages in 
the outside and inside flood risk figures were calculated 
by taking the number of items that did not meet flood 
protection best practice divided by the number of 
those particular items. For example, 144/175 homes 
with window wells did not meet best practices for flood 
protection so the number is represented as 82%  
(Figure 8A).
3.2 Summary of Top Flood Risks 
Program results indicated that the majority of 
participants were already completing a wide variety 
of simple and low-cost actions to reduce flood risks 
at their homes. Participants reported completing the 
following activities at least twice per year: maintenance 
of plumbing and fixtures to prevent leaks (91%), 
cleaning of eaves troughs to prevent overflow at the 
foundation (85%), removing blockages to water flow 
in their basement floor drain (83%), and filling of small 
cracks in the foundation (82%). Actions already taken 
may be attributed to the considerable ongoing efforts 
of municipal governments, not-for-profits, conservation 
authorities, retailers and insurance companies to raise 
awareness of flood risk and to support practical actions 
that homeowners can take to reduce risk.
3.2.1 Most Common Flood Risks Outside 
the Home 
Visual assessment of lot grading, landscaping and 
exterior characteristics of participating Ontario homes 
revealed several key flood protection features that 
consistently did not meet best practice standards for 
reducing risk. These deficiencies increased the risk of 
overland and seepage flooding into basements. Eighty-two 
percent of homes with window wells had wells that were 
not 10-15 cm above grade and sealed at the foundation. 
Seventy-eight percent of homes with downspouts 
and 68% of homes with sump pump discharge pipes 
discharged water less than 2m from the home’s 
foundation. Seventy-five percent of homes with doors 
below grade had drains and door seals in poor condition. 
Sixty-nine percent of homes had grading that did not direct 
water away from the foundation and 63% of homes with 
basement windows had cracks and gaps in the windows or 
frames (Figure 8A). When asked to report on maintenance 
efforts to limit flood risk outside of the home, residents 
stated that they were acting with commendable effort – 
however, such reporting stood in contrast to on-the-ground 
observations (Figure 8B).

3.2.2 Most Common Flood Risks Inside the Home
Visual assessment of basements revealed several flood protection features that did not meet best practice standards 
to limit risk. These deficiencies put homes at increased risk of sump pit overflow, sewer backup, and damage to 
structure/contents. Eighty-five percent of homes with sump pumps did not have a back-up sump pump, and 84% did 
not have backup power in case of a power outage. Sixty-five percent of homes had furniture and electronics, and 
65% had stored valuables, at risk of water damage. Sixty-one percent had improperly stored hazardous materials 
(e.g. paints, pesticides) that increased the risk of damage during a flood (Figure 8C). Several key maintenance activities 
that were not completed twice a year put homes at increased risk of sump pit overflow and sewer backup. Fifty-three 
percent of homes with backwater valves never maintained them, 43% of homes with backup power for their sump 
pump never maintained the system, 40% with sump pumps never maintained them and 26% of homes put fat, oil or 
grease down their drains (Figure 8D).

3.3 Actions Taken to Reduce Flood Risk
Each assessment report identified physical features and maintenance practices ranked as “poor/needs further 
investigation” and provided customized opportunities to reduce these risks. Study participants were asked to report 
at 3 months and at 6 months which actions they had taken to reduce risk. At 3 months, 79% of participants had 
completed at least one new action to address flood risk. Three months after that (a total of 6 months after having 
an assessment), 71% of these same participants indicated that they had taken at least one additional new action to 
reduce risk. Many participants (59%) completed the actions themselves (Figure 9A).
Sixty percent of participants completed actions which were simple, cost under $500 and could be completed  
by a homeowner in less than one day. Examples of these actions include: properly storing or removing valuables  
and hazardous materials (such as paint and pesticides) from the basement, cleaning out eaves troughs, installing 
window well covers, and extending downspouts and sump pump discharge pipes to a minimum of 2m away from  
the foundation. Forty percent of participants completed actions that were more complex, more costly and often 
required the support of qualified contractors. The cost of completing these actions ranged widely from $500 to 
over $10,000 (Figure 9B). Some of these more expensive actions included installing a backwater valve, backup sump 
pump or backup battery, relining or replacing a sewer lateral, installing a sewer lateral cleanout, replacing basement 
windows, replacing eaves troughs, replacing a driveway, or installing windows wells. See Appendices N and O for  
all outside risks assessed.
Key Resources Used to Make Decisions about Taking Flood Protection Action
Participants used various resources to support their decision-making and to help them complete flood risk reduction 
actions. The powerful influence of one-on-one conversations with trusted individuals stands out as significant. 
Seventy-one percent of participants cited conversations with their Home Flood Protection Assessors and 68% cited 
their assessment report (which is a written record of the conversation with the assessor) as key resources used, 27% 
cited the importance of conversations with family, friends and neighbours, and 23% with local contractors. To a lesser 
degree, participants noted referring to educational materials they found online (24%), and in newspapers, books and 
magazines (9%) (Figure 9C). See Appendices P and Q for all inside risks assessed.

3.4 Opportunities to Increase Residential Action 
to Protect Basements from Flooding
The main barriers that participants identified to 
taking action to limit flood risk can be divided into two 
categories: barriers for those who wished to engage a 
contractor to do the work and barriers for those who 
wished to complete the work themselves. For those 
wishing to engage a contractor, 42% of surveyed 
participants noted that a lack of funds was a barrier 
to action, 36% noted that there was a lack of time 
(many noted they were still waiting for a contractor 
to get to their job), and 10% noted difficulty finding a 
qualified contractor to complete the work. For those 
wishing to complete the work themselves, a lack of 
personal experience (20%), and physical limitations on 
their properties to finding a workable solution (such as 
wanting to extend the downspout but realizing it would 
present a tripping hazard) (18%), were noted barriers. 
Additional barriers related to the perceived lack of 
urgency for completing the work. For example, 32% 
noted that taking action was a low priority. A total of 12% 
of participants noted that they got conflicting advice 
from various sources about how to address a problem, 
thus their project stalled (Figure 10A).
Opportunities to Increase Residential Actions to Protect 
Basements from Flooding
Participants identified that they would like increased 
access to financial support, improved access to qualified 
contractors and increased access to trustworthy, third-
party information to make it easier for them to take 
action to reduce their flood risk.

FIGURE 10: BARRIERS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE ACTIONS
• Increased Access to Financial Support
Fifty percent of participants noted that they would like 
to have a financial subsidy to help them pay for flood 
risk reduction projects, 31% noted that they would like 
financial support to get access to qualified contractors 
for free, and 27% noted that they would like help 
accessing available subsidies (Figure 10B).
Participants support the provision of municipal flood 
protection subsidies, including subsidies to complete 
flood risk assessments. They also recommend a 
streamlined process for accessing subsidies, such 
as instant rebates at retail stores for items such as 
downspout extensions and sump pump backup systems. 
Participants were also supportive of receiving insurance 
discounts for taking actions to reduce flood risk.
• Increased Access to Qualified Contractors
Fifty-four percent of participants noted that they would 
like increased access to trusted service providers and 
41% noted that they would like help selecting qualified 
contractors (Figure 10B).
Residents also reported that they experienced challenges 
finding qualified contractors who could complete work 
to reduce flood risk in a timely manner. Many noted long 
delays waiting for contractors and difficulties getting 
contractors to respond to requests 
to complete smaller jobs.
Increasing the number of contractors engaged in 
residential flood protection services will help address the 
public demand for services and will drive local economic 
development for contractors and suppliers.
 18
TOP TEN ACTIONS TO 
REDUCE BASEMENT FLOOD RISK 
Intact Centre, 2018
• Trustworthy, Third-Party Information
Residents identified that they want greater access 
to third party information resources, particularly for 
those residents who wish to complete flood remediation 
actions on their own. Participants want trustworthy 
information from a source that is not trying to sell any one 
particular product or service, including those resources 
produced by government, not-for-profit, and academic 
organizations.
Thirty percent of participants noted that they wanted 
greater access to third party how-to videos and 22% 
noted that they wanted greater access to third party fact 
sheets (Figure 10B).
Cost-effective opportunities exist for agencies to share 
clear and consistent third-party information with their 
networks. Opportunities also exist for training industry 
professionals (home inspectors, realtors, insurance 
brokers, and mortgage brokers), and government and 
academic organizational staff regarding means to help 
residents to reduce flood risk. Part of the training should 
include the provision of reputable, third-party resources 
that they can share with their networks, including how-to-
videos, fact sheets, flood protection subsidy information 
and seasonal maintenance reminders (Figure 10B). 
Please see the “Top Ten Actions to Reduce Basement 
Flood Risk” in the adjacent column for an example of

4. REDUCING RESIDENTIAL 
BASEMENT FLOOD RISK ACROSS 
CANADA
With few, if any, geographic exceptions, reducing 
residential basement flooding is necessary to maintaining 
equity of the Canadian residential housing market. In 
the absence of mitigating risk of basement flooding, 
the insurability of Canada’s housing market will be 
compromised, and the consequent impacts may 
be manifested in an increase in mortgage defaults. 
Fortunately, as highlighted throughout this report, many 
easily deployable and affordable actions can be taken by 
homeowners to limit their flood risk exposure. However, 
many homeowners often do not realize such remedies 
exist…until it is too late. To increase awareness and  
drive action to limit otherwise pervasive flood risk,  
the following actions are recommended:
1. Governments, not-for-profits and insurance companies 
should use broad-based communications tactics 
to engage all residents and should use targeted 
communications tactics to engage residents in high 
risk flood zones.
2. Where possible, it is important to provide residents 
with accurate information about their neighbourhood 
and lot-level flood risks (flood risk mapping) so that 
they can use this information to make informed 
decisions about the level of urgency for taking action 
to reduce risk.
3. Concerted efforts must be made to engage landlords 
and tenants (who are often overlooked), to ensure 
that flood protection information and support and is 
being provided to them. This will help to ensure the 
availability of safe and reliable basement rental 
units in Canada.
4. Efforts must be made to increase the number of 
qualified contractors who are available to complete 
flood risk reduction assessment, installation and 
maintenance services.
5. A residential flood risk assessment training program 
and nationally applicable flood risk assessment tool 
must be made available to subject matter experts 
(particularly home inspectors) across Canada. This will 
ensure that all residents have access to third-party, 
cost-effective flood risk assessment services that 
meet national guidelines for flood risk reduction.
6. A flood risk reduction education training program 
must be made available to organizations that directly 
engage the public on topics that relate to flood risk 
reduction. These groups include realtors, mortgage 
brokers, emergency service workers, municipal and 
conservation authority staff, retailers, not-for-profits 
and landlord and tenant associations. The course must 
provide third-party resources that learners can use to 
effectively engage their networks.
4.1 National Flood Risk Reduction Educational 
Resources
Flood Risk Assessment Training
As of March 2019, Home Flood Risk Assessment  
Training (HFRAT) became nationally available online,  
to any interested party. Registration is available at  
https://flemingcollege.ca/continuing-education/courses/
home-flood-risk-assessment-training.
Although the course is primarily designed for home 
inspectors, municipal planners, builders, developers, and 
others that require in-depth understanding of residential 
flood protection, it is also of value to insurance and real 
estate brokers and mortgage lenders.
Third-Party Flood Protection Resources
For self-directed flood risk mitigation, a variety of  
free, third-party how-to resources are available through 
the Home Flood Protection Program website:  
www.homefloodprotect.ca.
 
Participant Testimonial
Toronto Home Resilience Program participant Lindsay Bunce shown in 
her basement shortly after her basement flood. Toronto, 2018.
The assessor spoke to us about several simple, low-cost 
measures that we can take to protect our home.  
“We finally learned how to use our sump pump!” 
Lindsay explained. “This is our first home and we didn’t 
know what the sump pump was, how it worked, where 
it drained to, or how to maintain it. Considering sump 
pump failure is a leading cause of basement flooding 
we were very happy to receive some professional 
guidance in this area.”
“Overall, the program is so informative and revealed 
many issues that did not come up during our standard 
home inspection. It has provided us with a road map to 
follow as we prioritize upgrades and repairs for our home. 
We now have peace of mind knowing that we are doing 
everything we can to protect our home from flooding.”

“After going through two devastating sewer back-up floods 
in 2014, my family and I wanted to learn what we could do to 
protect our new home from flooding. 
I would recommend having an assessment to anyone who 
wants to understand what they need to do to protect their 
home and their personal belongings. 
The program has provided us with peace of mind.”
– Carol Solis 
“A few years ago we experienced a flooded basement from sump pit 
overflow. We also have chronic dampness in parts of our basement. 
From our  assessment we learned we can upgrade our sump pump, 
install a backup battery and flood alarm and make some inexpensive 
changes to our downspouts to help us keep water out of our base-
ment even during the biggest storms.
The program is an investment that can save families thousands of 
dollars in the future.”

Appendix L: Residential Basement Flood Risk Reduction Best Practices
RESIDENTIAL BASEMENT FLOOD RISK REDUCTION BEST PRACTICES
Introduction 
This document provides a summary of the residential basement flood risk reduction best practices that were featured in 
the Home Flood Protection Program that delivered 510 Home Flood Protection Assessments to residences in Ontario and 
Saskatoon from 2016 to 2018. The best practices were developed by the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University 
of Waterloo and meet or exceed the Guideline on Basement Flood Protection and Risk Reduction (Z800-18) published by the 
Canadian Standards Association in 2018. Meeting all of the best practices reduces risk but 
does not guarantee basement flood prevention.
Assessment Methodology 
The best practices included in this document include a review of physical features that may be assessed at their surface using 
simple tools such as using measuring tapes, audible moisture meters and flashlights. This list does not include assessment of 
physical features that are behind walls, below ground or inside of pipes. The frequency of maintenance activities is recorded 
based on information provided by the resident. 
Scope of the Assessment
The assessment focuses on risks that are within the control of the resident and are on their private property. It focuses on 
“urban flood risks” including the risk of water flowing over the surface of the land and into the home through gaps, cracks 
and openings (overland flooding), seepage through foundation walls or gaps and cracks below ground (infiltration flooding) 
and backup of water into the home through sump pits or sewer pipes (sewer backup flooding). The assessment does not 
include an evaluation of risks related to the condition and configuration of municipal sewer infrastructure and overland flow 
routes. It also does not consider flood risks associated with high river levels (riverine flooding) or high lake levels and coastal 
wave action (coastal flooding).

the condition of your backwater valve. If 
you have a backwater valve or install one, 
consider installing an alarm to let you 
know when the valve is closed to prevent 
flooding from in-home sources. Note: 
Only a qualified professional can formally 
identify if a backwater valve would be 
right for your home and the condition

#47. Foundation drain  
Are foundation drain (weepers) present? Is founda-
tion drain functioning properly to drain water away 
from your foundation? Note: Foundation drains are 
not common before 1960. Depending on the age 
of your house it may or may not have a foundation 
drain or it may have a drain that is old and in poor 
condition.
Missing or clogged drains increase the 
risk of basement infiltration flooding. 
Foundation drains that are connected 
to sanitary or storm sewers increase the 
risk of sewer backup related flooding. 
Note: Only a qualified professional can 
formally identify the condition of this item 
or recommend if one would be right for 
your home. Note: Check with the govern-
ment department having jurisdictional 
authority to determine the availability of a

INTRODUCTION TO REPORT
What Does This Report Include?
This report includes an easy to read summary of top ranked items for priority action that have received a “poor/ needs 
further investigation” score or require specific mention based on questions asked by the homeowner. It also provides  
a record of all gathered information and provides additional helpful resources to help homeowners take action to  
reduce flood risk.
How Are Assessed Features Scored?
Assessors use the standardized assessment tool provided to guide them through a visual assessment of the property  
and to ask a list of preventative maintenance questions to homeowners. The information gathered is then compared  
to the tool’s scoring definitions, developed by the University in Waterloo in concert with a wide variety of national  
experts in the area of basement flood risk reduction. Assessed Features are assigned scores of “Good- Best Practice”, 
“Intermediate” or “Poor/ Needs Further Investigation” based on where they fall within these definitions. Any Assessed 
Features not accessible for observation and any preventative maintenance questions that are not completed by the 
homeowner are marked “Not Recorded.”
What Does This Report Not Include?
Beyond summarizing the report findings related to assessed items that received a score of “poor/needs further 
investigation” or require specific mention based on questions asked by the homeowner the report does not formally state 
a prioritized approach for addressing deficiencies. It is up to Homeowner to decide which actions they will take  
and in what order.
To ensure program impartiality the report does not recommend specific contractors, suppliers or products. The report 
also does not provide in-depth drawings or tailored step-by-step instructions to complete projects at the home to 
address deficiencies.
How Was Information for this Report Gathered?
The contents of this report have been gathered by examining the physical condition of a variety of features inside  
and outside the home using simple tools such as a moisture meter, humidity gauge, flashlight and measuring tape.  
A verbal preventative maintenance questionnaire has also been completed with the homeowner or their designate.
Reporting Time Frame
This report documents the observed condition of physical features of the home and the preventative maintenance 
information gathered from the Homeowner on the day of the Assessment only.

UNDERSTANDING DIFFERENT TYPES OF WATER DAMAGE 
RISKS AT YOUR HOME
The diagram and the definitions below are provided to help you understand the types of water damage that may affect 
any home due to deterioration of physical features, lack of preventative maintenance or water backup from municipal 
sewer systems during extreme weather events.
These water damage types are referenced in your Home Flood Protection Assessment Report to help you understand  
the types of water damage risks that have been identified at your home and your opportunities to reduce risk. Please 
see the customized list of maintenance best practices listed in your report to help you develop your preventative 
maintenance routine.
Insurance Coverage Considerations:
Sudden and accidental water damage is typically covered by insurers, however damage due to slow leaks or lack of 
preventative maintenance is typically not covered. Since there is no industry-wide, standard language used to define 
water damage types you may find using the terms and descriptions in this document helpful when working with your 
insurer to determine which coverage is best for you. Please note that not all insurance companies provide all types of 
coverages for all homes. See the “Questions for Your Insurance Provider” document in the Additional Resources section 
of the report for additional information.

Finished Walls and Floors
Finished walls – Are water 
stains or high moisture levels 
indicating source of water 
infiltration? Walls are free 
of water stains. There is no 
evidence of mold (smell or visual 
evidence). The audible moisture 
meter indicates no concerns.
GS
Walls show major evidence of water 
entry, clear evidence of mold (smell 
or visual evidence), moisture meter 
indicates higher concern OR Needs 
further investigation.
Major evidence of moisture has 
been noted on plywood walls 
inside cold room. Remove the 
source of water buildup at the 
foundation as needed (correct 
drainage, repair eaves troughs 
and/or remove snow in winter, 
seal foundation from outside 
in extreme cases). Remove and 
replace damaged materials. 
Consult a professional if you are 
concerned about mold. If you 
are considering refinishing your 
basement, refer to Water-Resistant 
Building Materials fact sheet.

pipes and water heaters for leaks 
and signs of wear. Repair or 
replace items with the assistance 
of a plumber as needed. Consider 
installing and maintaining flood 
alarms to reduce flood risk. Check 
with your insurance professional 
about discounts for installing 
alarm systems.
Additional Considerations for Limiting Risk of Water Damage, Mold and Mildew Growth
Furniture and electronics – Are 
furniture and electronics at risk 
of damage in the event of a 
flood? Furniture items have non-
absorbent surfaces up to 30cm 
(12”) and electronics are stored 
at least 30cm (12”) off the floor 
(or to exceed anticipated flood 
levels).
N/A
Furniture items have absorbent 
surfaces in contact with the 
floor and electronics are stored 
on the floor OR Needs further 
investigation.
Carpet on floors, couches with 
absorbent legs and electronics 
on the floor are at risk of damage 
in the event of a flood. Select 
furniture items that have non-
absorbent surfaces up to 30cm 
(12”) and store electronics at least 
30cm (12”) off the floor (or to 
exceed anticipated flood levels).
Stored valuables – Are your 
valuables at risk of damage 
during a flood or at risk of 
mold and mildew growth? 
Valuables are stored in sealed, 
non-absorbent containers at 
least 30cm (12”) off the floor 
(or to exceed anticipated flood 
levels), at least 15cm (6”) away 
from walls to provide good air 
circulation OR no valuables are 
stored in the basement.
N/A
Valuables are stored in sealed, non-
absorbent containers at least 15cm 
(6”) off the floor, at least 10cm 
(3”) away from walls that provide 
moderate air circulation.
Store items in sealed, non-
absorbent containers at least 30 
cm (12”) off the floor (or to exceed 
anticipated flood levels) and 15 
cm (6”) away from walls. Consider 
moving most valuable items above 
the basement.
Relative humidity, air movement 
and temperature – Are the 
moisture, humidity and 
temperature levels in your 
basement optimum to reduce 
mold and mildew risk? A 30-
50% relative humidity reading 
is taken in the basement. Air 
circulation is good. A minimum 
regular temperature above 15C 
(60F) is maintained.
N/A
Over 60% relative humidity 
reading is taken in basement OR 
Air movement is highly restricted 
OR The temperature is kept below 
10C (50F) OR Needs further 
investigation.
The relative humidity reading 
is 65. This exceeds the 
recommended maximum of 50%. 
Reduce sources of moisture and 
run one or more dehumidifiers to 
maintain 30-50% relative humidity. 
Improve air circulation. Maintain 
minimum temperature of 15C 
(60F).

 78
Indoor Sources of Moisture –Are 
indoor sources of moisture 
limited to reduce mold and 
mildew risk? If a bathroom with 
a shower is present, a fan is 
present and when it is running it 
is strong enough to hold a piece 
of tissue. Fan is run for 30-60 
minutes after a bath or shower. 
Furnace humidifiers do not 
operate in the summer. Wood is 
not stored, laundry is not hung, 
boots are not dried etc. in the 
basement.

No action required.
Hazardous Materials
Hazardous materials – Are 
hazardous materials stored 
in a way that represents a 
contamination risk during a 
flood? No hazardous materials 
are stored in the basement 
and/or materials are stored in 
waterproof containers at least 
30 cm (12”) off the floor (or to 
exceed anticipated flood levels). 
Heating fuel tanks are secured 
to the floor.
N/A
Hazardous materials are not sealed 
in waterproof containers and/
or are stored on the floor and/or 
heating fuel tanks are not secured 
to the floor OR Needs further 
investigation.
See G on Inside Assessment 
diagram. Remove paint, chemicals 
and other hazardous material 
from basement or seal hazardous 
materials in waterproof containers 
and store at least 30 cm (12”) off 
the floor (or to exceed anticipated 
flood levels).

Appendix R: Participant Testimonials 
“After going through two devastating sewer back- up 
floods in 2014, my family and I wanted to learn what we 
could do to protect our new home from flooding. I would 
recommend having an assessment to anyone who wants 
to understand what they need to do to protect their 
home and their personal belongings. The assessment  
is $125, a small price to pay to have peace of mind.” 
– Carol Solis (Burlington, Ontario)
“A few years ago we experienced a flooded basement 
from sump pit overflow. We also have chronic damp-
ness in parts of our basement. From our assessment we 
learned we can upgrade our sump pump, install a backup 
battery and flood alarm and make some inexpensive 
changes to our downspouts to help us keep water out  
of our basement even during the biggest storms.  
The $125 assessment fee is an investment that could  
save any family thousands of dollars in the future.” 
– Zainab & Patrick Moghal (Waterloo, Ontario)
