Direct effects of climate change on health, such as a rise in the incidence of heat strokes due to summer heat-
waves, and indirect health effects such as under-nutrition due to a rise in food prices because of climate
change, are mediated through the social and environmental determinants of health (SEDH), which include
but are not limited to potable water, clean air, adequate sanitation, safe shelter, and adequate food. Based on
a narrative review, this paper identiﬁes possible mechanisms through which human health is impacted by
climate change. Evidence has shown that climate change-induced effects such as high temperatures and heat
waves, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), vector-borne diseases and undernutrition lead to undesirable
health outcomes for the urban poor through unfavorable SEDH. Given that health of the urban poor is antici-
pated to be disproportionately affected by the risks of changing climate, this paper emphasizes the need for
focusing on the environmental justice approach to safeguard the health of the urban poor in developing
countries. It also argues for strengthening participatory and transparent urban governance to upgrade infor-
mal settlements and address factors that enhance health vulnerabilities of the urban poor. It contributes to
the limited literature on environmental justice in the context of developing countries and provides a ratio-
nale behind mainstreaming the environmental justice approach for reducing the climate change-induced
health risks for the urban poor.

Introduction
Climate change is expected to augment health risks, particularly
for inhabitants of the poorest sections in cities of the developing
world and it is widely argued that the urban poor face the brunt of
climate change-induced health risks [1]. Both the direct effects of cli-
mate change on health, such as a rise in the incidence of heat strokes
due to heatwaves, and the indirect health effects such as under-nutri-
tion due to rises in food prices as a result of climate change, are medi-
ated through the social and environmental determinants of health
(SEDH). Typically, the conceptual approaches to social determinants
of health (SDH) have drawn attention to social and political contexts
(such as labor markets, political systems) that create differential
socioeconomic positions. These hierarchies inﬂuence health status
via behavioral factors (such as physical activity and nutrition),
material (such as housing and working conditions) and psychosocial
circumstances (such as stress and social support systems). Environ-
mental determinants are linked to the SDH conceptualization
because differences in social hierarchies create differential exposure
to biophysical environments [2]. However, since the standard SDH
conceptualization does not explicitly recognize the role of biophysical
environments on health, we consider social and environmental
determinants as distinct in our analysis and use the term SEDH
throughout.
The urban poor are disproportionately vulnerable to both the
direct and indirect health effects of climate change via a number of
factors such as the precarious nature of their livelihoods, poor hous-
ing conditions, inadequate means to mitigate the impact of climate
change and limited access to health care sector resources. Given that
the global urban population is projected to witness an unprecedented
rise from 4.4 billion in 2020 to 6.3 billion in 2050, with the less devel-
oped regions accounting for almost 82 percent of the aggregate popu-
lation in urbanized regions of the world, health risks associated with
climate change are anticipated to be severe for the urban poor.
Importantly, Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa are expected to contribute
as much as 70 percent to the total urban population worldwide in
2050 [3,4]. By compounding existing health risks and urban social
inequities, climate change will further cause health inequities to
become more entrenched in urban areas of developing countries [5].
The concept of rural-urban migration is integral to the process of
urbanization. Rural migrants constitute a substantial percentage of
the urban poor in several cities of the world, which makes them par-
ticularly vulnerable to the adverse consequences posed by climate

change [6]. In developing countries, internal migration is often
regarded as a response to climate change. Since agricultural activities
are under constant jeopardy in rural areas due to land degradation
and persistent changes in temperature and rainfall patterns, pressure
to seek alternative avenues of employment spurs rural-urban migra-
tion [7,8].
Since those who are compelled to undertake distressed rural-
urban migration are typically marginal cultivators and agricultural
laborers who have limited access to social networks in cities where
they arrive, they have no option but to settle for low-paying and risky
jobs. They live in densely populated informal settlements, with inad-
equate or absent access to sanitation, drinking water, sufﬁcient food
and nutrition, and waste management services [6]. Therefore, due to
their socioeconomic status (SES), rural-urban migrants are doubly
exposed to the detrimental impacts of climate change −ﬁrst, by los-
ing their former source of agricultural livelihood that becomes unvia-
ble due to altered climate in rural areas, and second, by working and
living conditions in cities which further expose them to the adverse
impacts of climate change. Furthermore, the urban poor face denial
of basic citizenship rights even in their own countries and can seldom
access appropriate health care in cities, thereby becoming victims of
exclusionary policies [6]. Studies have indicated that even when the
urban poor have lived in cities of developing countries for decades,
they are largely regarded as migrants, and their alleged migrant sta-
tus deprives them of health care and other basic services in urban set-
tlements [9].
As rapid rates of urbanization are bound to cause further altera-
tions to land use patterns, the urban poor may be subjected to
increased frequency and intensity of deleterious health effects stem-
ming from climate change [3]. Using the notion of environmental jus-
tice is important in deliberations linked to the climate change-
induced impact on health of the urban poor. Since the urban poor are
exposed to insurmountable degrees of environmental disamenities
such as land degradation, toxic air, hazardous waste and contami-
nated water due to their low SES, the environmental justice approach
offers a framework for safeguarding the fundamental interests of the
most vulnerable communities, including the right to life [10,11].
Given that health of the urban poor is anticipated to be dispropor-
tionately impacted by the risks of a rapidly changing climate, this
paper emphasizes the need for focusing on environmental justice.
Despite a dearth of literature in the context of developing countries,
this paper provides a rationale behind introducing the environmental
justice approach. We restrict the scope of present analysis to devel-
oping countries and urban settings.
Section 2 of this paper details the methods used. Section 3 under-
takes an assessment of possible mechanisms through which health of
the urban population, particularly those living in informal settle-
ments, is affected as a result of climate change, enhancing urban

Methods
Search strategy
The literature referred to in this narrative review was ﬁrst identi-
ﬁed in May and June 2021 on Google Scholar and PubMed. A second
round of literature selection was conducted in December 2022 on the
same electronic databases. The literature search was performed using
combinations
of
keywords
including
‘climate
change’,
‘human
health’, ‘health’, ‘urban poor’, ‘cities’, ‘environmental justice’, ‘inequi-
ties’, ‘developing countries’, ‘social determinants of health’ and ‘envi-
ronmental determinants of health’. Only peer-reviewed, English
language articles published between 2000 and 2022 were shortlisted
in both rounds of the literature search.
The two rounds of literature search yielded 48 full-text references.
Additional literature was identiﬁed from the reference lists of the
shortlisted articles. This included gray literature encompassing cru-
cial reports on climate change and health. Empirical studies measur-
ing
ambient
pollutant
concentrations
in
urban
settings
were
eliminated from the present analysis. Screening of title, abstracts and
introductions of 54 references was conducted and 37 references
were considered appropriate for inclusion in the current review.
Quality assessment
All the 37 references met the minimum threshold scores. Narra-
tive review articles were assessed using the Scale for the Assessment
of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA) criteria (Table A.1) [12]. Quali-
tative studies and systematic reviews were assessed using the Critical
Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) checklists (Tables A.2 and A.3)
[13,14]. CASP scores were adapted from a prior study on factors gov-
erning HIV-self testing in Africa [15]. Quality of mixed-method stud-
ies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT),
version 2018 [16]. Although the MMAT does not provide cut-off
scores, a scoring scheme was developed to appraise the quality of
mixed-method studies (Table A.4). The AACODS checklist was used
to assess the quality of grey literature (Table A.5) [17]. Finally, a mod-
iﬁed version of ISPOR Task Force on Good Research Practices was
used to review the quality of modeling-based empirical studies (Table
A.6) [18].
Climate change and urban health
Climate change impacts human health through a number of path-
ways. However, since SEDH play a decisive role in determining the
direct and indirect impact of climate change on human health, these
pathways lead to differential health impacts. This section discusses
these mechanisms:
High temperatures and heat waves
One of the most profound and straightforward implications of cli-
mate change has been the rise of average surface temperatures.
While the Paris Agreement envisaged the reduction of global warm-
ing to below 2-degree Celsius, and preferably below 1.5-degree Cel-
sius, compared to pre-industrial levels, current projections indicate
that global average temperature could rise by 3 to 5 degrees Celsius
by the end of the century, given the existing pace of emissions of
greenhouse gases [19,20].
Cities are particularly vulnerable to the impact of extreme heat in
summers because of the urban heat island (UHI) effect. The UHI effect
in cities is regarded as a result of higher population density, limited
vegetation and green cover, and concentration of concrete structures.
Cities on marginal lowlands are more prone to hot and humid condi-
tions, which makes residents vulnerable to several health risks asso-
ciated with higher temperatures [5]. As much of the day heat is
retained by concrete buildings in the absence of vegetation and green
cover, night temperatures are likely to rise in cities with temperate
and tropical climates. It is due to the UHI effect that temperatures in
the interiors of cities are higher than areas on the outskirts [21].
While climate change may cause marginal changes in average
temperatures, changes in temperature extremes are likely to be sub-
stantial [21]. Evidence indicates that the UHI effect is correlated with
more intense impact of heat waves on populations, which is antici-
pated to be more severe for cities that are witnessing a rise in popula-
tion. This implies that populations living in developing countries are
particularly vulnerable to the adverse health impact of heat waves
[22]. A recent study based on India demonstrated that while 3014

2
men and 849 women died due to heat-related causes in 2001−05, the
corresponding estimates had increased to 5157 and 1254 in 2011
−15. Further, the study concluded that the number of deaths attribut-
able to heat-related causes were more than the number of deaths
caused by other natural calamities such as avalanches, earthquakes
and ﬂoods [23].
Since there is a rise in the level of ambient air pollution during
heat waves, heat-related causes of mortality, such as hyperthermia
and heat stroke, are often accompanied by a rapid surge in deaths
due to non-communicable diseases like respiratory, cardiovascular,
cerebrovascular, nervous and endocrine diseases [24,25]. Certain
studies have also indicated that compared to higher income groups,
the urban poor are more vulnerable to chronic respiratory conditions
following air pollution exposure due to their overall suboptimal
health status [26]. Moreover, since a considerable fraction of urban
poor fulﬁll their daily energy needs for cooking and heating by com-
bustion of solid fuels, indoor air pollution may worsen the human
health impact of climate change [27].
Given that heat is associated with both environmental and occu-
pational hazards, the impact of heat waves on health of the urban
poor is likely to be much more signiﬁcant vis-a-vis economically priv-
ileged individuals because the urban poor are less insulated against
the effects of heat both in their living and occupational environments.
The urban poor are often daily wage earners and are engaged in
informal jobs that require them to stay outdoors [21] and generally
have insufﬁcient means to escape the impact of heat waves by pur-
chasing air conditioners. Extreme heat may compel them to forego
incomes by working outdoors for shorter durations, thereby pushing
them further into poverty and exposing them to health-damaging
impacts of climate change [28].
Climate change and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)
Informal settlements in cities face acute water shortages, which
may be exacerbated as a result of a changing climate. Climate change
may adversely impact water availability through extreme rainfall
events, i.e., droughts and ﬂoods, which can both overwhelm urban
amenities and pose sizable health risks [29]. An increase in the occur-
rence of droughts has been registered both in cities which depend on
perennial rivers for their water supply, and in those which rely on
aquifers. While a rise in temperature has accelerated the pace of
melting of glaciers and led to an increase in the ﬂow of water in riv-
ers, this impact may cease to exist in the long run. Rapidly melting
and disappearing glaciers will no longer contribute water to some of
the perennial rivers, making these rivers seasonal and causing acute
water shortages in cities. Furthermore, cities which source their
water from coastal and inland aquifers are increasingly experiencing
groundwater depletion and salinization [21]. Water scarcity presents
serious challenges from the perspective of the urban poor who may
not be able to purchase water from other sources [29]. The incidence
of heavy rainfall and ﬂoods is also anticipated to increase as a result
of climate change.
Summer droughts can also lead to a deterioration in water quality
because an abnormal rise in water temperature can restrict the dilu-
tion of pollutants [30]. Similarly, ﬂooding causes contamination of
both surface water and groundwater [31]. While the extent of water
contamination during ﬂoods depends on the duration and intensity
of rainfall, water contaminants may include toxic substances like
heavy metals and pesticides [21]. In fact, water pollution is a leading
environmental risk factor for cities and a surge in the incidence of
water-borne diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, during and post
the occurrence of extreme rainfall events, has been observed in
developing countries. Vulnerability to water-borne diseases is exac-
erbated by a lack of good hygiene practices, such as handwashing
with soap before meals and after defecation. Lack of proper sanitation
facilities is often associated with fecal contamination of water
sources, which is regarded as an important cause for endemic diar-
rheal disease and cholera [32,33].
As rapidly urbanizing cities are incapacitated in providing equita-
ble access to improved water and sanitation facilities, the urban poor
are likely to suffer from WASH-related ill-effects of climate change.
Moreover, informal settlements in cities are situated in low-lying
areas that increase their vulnerability to ﬂoods and the ensuing
health risks. Several informal settlements may also face perennial
water shortages because of their unrecognized status [6].
Vector-borne diseases
Climate change is known to cause an increase in the burden of
vector-borne diseases such as dengue, malaria and lymphatic ﬁlaria-
sis. A rise in the incidence of vector-borne diseases may be attributed
to a number of meteorological and man-made factors. For instance,
an increase in temperatures, precipitation and humidity is associated
with enhancing the reproductive rate, biting propensity and longev-
ity of vectors, and shortening the development span of pathogens
that are carried by vectors [34]. Climate change has also increased
the occurrence of droughts in several parts of the world. This has led
people to adopt a range of coping strategies including water storage
and migration with drastic alterations in vector ecology. While signif-
icant gains have been achieved in terms of reducing global mortality
from vector-borne diseases, emergence and re-emergence of vector
species, and rapidly increasing insecticide and drug resistances pose
serious threats, particularly for developing countries [35].
Vector-borne diseases are endemic in developing countries due to
their tropical climates and unfavorable SES of a vast proportion of the
population. For instance, a rising incidence of dengue in urban areas
is considered an outcome of substandard housing structures and
inadequate provision of safe water, sanitation and waste manage-
ment services [21,35]. Furthermore, poor drainage systems, a com-
mon feature of informal settlements, facilitate breeding of vectors
which may lead to potentially life-threatening conditions such as ﬁla-
riasis, dengue and malaria [36].
Undernutrition
Climate change may severely impact the nutrition levels of the
urban poor, primarily by increasing global average temperatures and
causing extremes in rainfall patterns. These factors are vital to agri-
cultural productivity as they affect the conditions conducive for agri-
culture and impact the availability and quality of water required for
irrigation [5,37]. An increase in the frequency of droughts and ﬂoods
has already started impacting crop yields in different parts of the
world. Combined with the rise in global population and reduced
availability of agricultural land and water, a decline in crop yields
could pose signiﬁcant risks to global food security. The urban poor
are likely to face the brunt of the global food crisis as unlike subsis-
tence farmers, they procure food supplies from markets. Surges in
food prices can adversely affect the budget of the urban poor and
compel them to reduce their food consumption, thereby impacting
their nutritional status [5] (Fig. 1).
The urban poor are also more vulnerable to the aforementioned
health risks resulting from climate change due to their limited capac-
ity to access appropriate health care in urban settings. Health care
access in developing countries is impeded by factors such as limited
public
sector
funding,
growing
privatization
of
health
care,
catastrophic health care expenditures and reduced efﬁciency and
quality of public health care [38]. Combined with these barriers to
health care access, the climate change-induced health risks discussed
above could pose disproportionate health care and human costs on
the urban poor and increase health inequities in developing coun-
tries. Furthermore, as the urban poor often become victims of

recognitional injustice in cities, their access to health care may be fur-
ther curtailed [6].
The case for environmental justice
The principle of environmental justice provides a normative
framework to ensure that disadvantaged population groups do not
suffer from the disproportionate human health impact of environ-
mental hazards (such as industrial pollution) and unintended envi-
ronmental impacts of laws and policies. According to the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), environmental justice is ‘the
fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless
of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the develop-
ment, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, reg-
ulations, and policies. Fair treatment means no group of people
should bear a disproportionate share of the negative environmental
consequences resulting from industrial, governmental and commer-
cial operations or policies’ [39].
The notion of environmental justice originated in the early 1980s
when vulnerable African-American groups in North Carolina pro-
tested against a proposal that sought to designate an area as a dump-
ing site for toxic waste in their neighborhood. Subsequently, a
substantial amount of evidence established how the impact of pollu-
tion was being disproportionately borne by impoverished and mar-
ginalized households and communities [40]. For instance, in a
landmark study that was published in 1983, the US General Account-
ing Ofﬁce highlighted the linkages between race and location of sites
for toxic waste and observed that three out of four hazardous waste
landﬁlls were located close to minority community households in the
Southeastern part of the United States. In 1987, another study led by
the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice demon-
strated that environmental disamenities were also excessively con-
centrated in communities of color [11].
The concept of environmental justice has had a long history. For
instance, Taylor traced the origins of environmental justice to the
seventeenth century and showed that environmental concerns in
urban areas have been a major source of distress for the poor residing
in rapidly industrializing cities [41]. Simply put, scholars in the realm
of environmental justice have shown that socioeconomic determi-
nants such as race, ethnicity and income of households inﬂuence the
spatial design of cities by governing the development of their com-
mercial and residential structures. Furthermore, while the less afﬂu-
ent areas in cities endure an inordinate burden of environmental
hazards such as air pollution and inadequate management of waste,
recent scholarly work has shown that these areas seldom have sufﬁ-
cient access to environmental beneﬁts such as parks, tree cover and
playgrounds, which are associated with signiﬁcant health beneﬁts for
residents [10].
Within the purview of environmental justice, climate justice has
recently originated as a popular subﬁeld [10]. While environmental
justice has conventionally emphasized the need to address the ineq-
uitable distribution of environmental disamenities, concerns related
to the unequal impact of global climate change have assumed center
stage in the climate justice approach. The climate justice approach
has given thrust to the idea that nations which have contributed the
most to climate change to achieve economic gains should be held
responsible for causing climate change and compensate for its conse-
quences. Thus, unlike environmental justice, advocates of climate
justice have argued for restorative justice, i.e., resource transfer
from those who have caused climate change to those who bear its
cost [11].
Even though it is widely asserted that climate justice has largely
conceptualized the issue of climate change and its ramiﬁcations at
the international level, the fact that climate change has local manifes-
tations suggests that it is impossible to conceive the notion of climate
justice without consolidating both local and global perspectives asso-
ciated with climate change [10,11]. Still, the environmental justice
framework is criticized for being overly preoccupied with local envi-
ronmental concerns that have limited relevance in the context of
global climate change. However, there is sufﬁcient evidence to show
that movements supporting environmental justice have given due
recognition to global policies and have also developed linkages with
disadvantageous communities in other parts of the world. Moreover,
the focus of environmental justice on local procedures and policies

seems justiﬁed from the perspective of dealing with the impact of cli-
mate change and formulation of effective policies to cater to adapta-
tion
and
mitigation
needs
at
the
local
level.
In
fact,
the
environmental justice framework not only facilitates adaptation to
climate change but also focuses on addressing risk factors that affect
vulnerability [11]. Therefore, it may be argued that in addition to
encompassing vital aspects that are relevant to climate change, envi-
ronmental justice promotes the climate justice approach which fur-
ther reinforces the environmental justice movement.
Concluding observations
Using a narrative review, this paper makes a case for addressing
SEDH and mainstreaming environmental justice to protect the health
of the urban poor from climate change-induced consequences. Given
that an estimated 1 billion people live in informal settlements of
urban areas in developing countries, the human health risks posed by
climate change could be substantial without tackling SEDH [4,42].
Local governments should ensure the provision of improved living
and working conditions, safe drinking water, waste management,
and drainage. However, a major impediment associated with provi-
sion of such amenities is that these are situated outside the legal
framework of land ownership and use. In view of such challenges,
upgradation of informal settlements is increasingly regarded as a
promising solution from the perspective of mitigating health risks for
the urban poor and increasing their overall resilience to climate
change [4,43]. Therefore, in addition to addressing SEDH, the role of
participatory and transparent urban governance is integral to safe-
guarding the health of the urban poor from climate change-induced
impacts [43]. Furthermore, state governments could play a vital role
in strengthening health care systems in cities, which could signiﬁ-
cantly reduce human health risks associated with climate change.
Although the environmental justice framework has been exten-
sively used in the context of developed countries, it has been rarely
referred to for addressing human health risks posed by climate
change in developing countries. In order to deal with the climate
change-induced impact on health of the urban poor, mainstreaming
the environmental justice approach is of utmost importance. Given
that governments in developing countries are often challenged by
ﬁnancial bottlenecks, policy measures to support environmental jus-
tice should explore the potential of public-private-partnerships
(PPPs). PPPs have shown promise in solid waste management in
developing countries like Lebanon [44]. Moreover, since developing
countries are largely dependent on fossil fuels for meeting their
energy needs, PPPs could help exploit the potential of renewable
energy sources, which could reduce carbon footprints and limit the
pace of climate change.
A major challenge in the implementation of policy alternatives
recommended above is that both SEDH and climate change are
dynamic systems that are constantly changing and interacting with
each other. Therefore, developing countries may ﬁnd it challenging
to establish the impact and estimate the economic and welfare gains
achieved from these policies. This is important because initial trade-
offs between the status quo and recommended policy alternatives
could deter governments from pursuing alternatives that could
accrue long-term economic, environmental and health gains. From
this perspective, systems thinking approaches that consider the com-
plexity of dynamic systems and analyze ways in which such systems
are interconnected are crucial in the long-run to inform evidence-
based policymaking.
