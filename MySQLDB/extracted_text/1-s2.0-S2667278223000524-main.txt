Introduction: Climate change is causing far-reaching yet underappreciated worsening of outcomes across the
mental health and wellbeing spectrum. Despite increasing attention to the mental health impacts of climate
change, an absence of a clear, cross-sectoral agenda for action has held back progress against the dual and
interconnected challenges of supporting human and planetary health. This study aims to serve as an essential
ﬁrst step to address this gap.
Methods: Harnessing the expertise of a diverse panel of 61 participants, representing 24 nationalities, this
study developed and prioritized recommendations for action on climate change and mental health across
the relevant sectors of research, policy, healthcare and the third sector, and used a Delphi-style methodology
to examine their feasibility and importance.
Results: Broadly, the prioritized recommendations highlighted the need to expand the evidence base, work
collaboratively across sectors, and raise awareness. While broadly there was consensus on recommendation
importance, there was greater variation in the reported feasibility of the recommendations, which differed
across settings. Other common themes included the need for cultural and resource contextualization, raising
awareness of and addressing mental health co-beneﬁts via climate action, and working with communities
with lived experience to develop and implement the ﬁndings. As there may be some interdependencies
between the recommendations, further work needs to identify how best to implement them.
Conclusion: The recommendations serve as a robust and evidence-based framework that can be used as a
foundation to devise locally appropriate, concrete implementation strategies matching levels of need and
resource. These also serve as a clear call to action for investment from leaders across sectors to ensure they
are realized.

Introduction
Climate change is having substantial impacts across the mental
health spectrum [1]. Climate change stressors such as heat and
extreme weather events have been linked to multiple adverse mental
health outcomes such as increased rates of suicide and psychological
distress, worsened symptoms of psychiatric disorders, and height-
ened mortality among people with mental health problems [2].
Beyond the direct impacts of climate change, concerns over the cli-
mate crisis are also leading to the emergence of various psychological
reactions such as climate anxiety [3]. Climate change is impacting
mental health directly, for example by making exposure to traumatic
events more prevalent due to more frequent and intense extreme
weather events, as well as indirectly, by worsening known social
determinants of mental health such as poverty [4,5].
The latest International Panel on Climate Change report in 2022
stated that there is “high conﬁdence” that climate change has
adversely affected the mental health of people in the assessed regions
[6]. Similarly, the World Health Organization (WHO) policy brief on
climate change and mental health states that “climate change is
increasingly having stronger and longer-lasting impacts on people,
which can directly and indirectly affect their mental health and psy-
chosocial well-being” [7].
Despite increasing focus on the topic, the impacts of climate
change on mental health have traditionally received less attention
when compared to the literature on the relationship between climate
change and other health outcomes such as infectious diseases [8,9].
There has also been a lack of political attention and policies that con-
sider the relationship between climate change and mental health

[10]. This has led to calls for more research on the topic and for more
action based on the existing research [7,9,11,12]. However, among
other barriers, this has been hampered by the current lack of a clear
and coherent agenda for action on climate change and mental health
across sectors in what is a complex and interdisciplinary area with
multiple pathways to impact [1].
Various recommendations for action have been put forward in
several documents, including those developed by Lawrance et al., the
American Psychological Association, and the WHO [1,7,13]. The WHO
policy brief, for example, recommends ﬁve key approaches to address
the impacts of climate change on mental health, including integration
of climate change considerations into policies and programs for men-
tal health, and implementation of multi-sectoral and community-
based approaches to reduce vulnerabilities and address the mental
health and psychosocial impacts of climate change [7].
However, while informed by evidence and by experts, these prior-
ities were not developed as part of a formal consensus-building pro-
cess and are not part of the formally peer-reviewed literature. For
example, the recommendations in Lawrance et al.’s (gray literature)
brieﬁng paper were developed by the Global North-based authors, in
consultation with a small pool of experts. Some examples of formal
consensus-building exercises for climate change and mental health
do however exist. One Delphi study explored global priorities for cli-
mate change and mental health research by collecting data from 22
experts from multiple sectors and identiﬁed 10 key research priori-
ties [12]. Another Delphi study identiﬁed consensus for 20 research
priorities for mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS)
research in the context of climate change by consulting 91 experts
[14]. However, these studies focused only on the research sector and
were not developed in the context of other relevant sectors that are
key for climate change and mental health action, such as policymak-
ing, healthcare, or the third sector (although research priorities may
still be relevant to these sectors).
The current study aims to address these limitations by developing
recommendations for action on climate change and mental health
across and between the sectors of research, policy, healthcare, and
the third (non-governmental, non-proﬁt) sector, based on global
expert consensus of importance and feasibility. It also seeks to iden-
tify the recommendations which are deemed the greatest priority to
action. The need for cross-sectoral perspectives and collaborations
was a strong message from the 2022 Intergovernmental Panel on Cli-
mate Change (IPCC) reports, and we therefore suggest that cross-sec-
toral approaches are necessary when developing recommendations
for action [6,15]. We contend that such approaches may help increase
the chance of collaboration in the delivery phase and reduce the risk
of siloed, less efﬁcient actions. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the ﬁrst study to present cross-sectoral (involving multiple, overlap-
ping sectors) perspectives and examine the perceived feasibility of
cross-sectoral recommendations. Due to regional and national-level
differences in needs, resourcing and context, these recommendations
are intended to serve as an essential ﬁrst step for leaders in the devel-
opment of concrete and locally-appropriate action plans, rather than
a one-size-ﬁts-all approach. Such an approach is also necessary given
the variation in climate impacts and population vulnerability around
the world.
Methods
Study design
This study applied a modiﬁed Delphi methodology to reach a con-
sensus among an international, cross-sectoral group of experts on
globally-applicable priorities for action on the interconnections
between climate change and mental health. The Delphi process is a
research technique used to reach consensus on a topic and involves
recruiting a panel of experts and asking them to respond to rounds of
questions until consensus within the group is reached [14]. Although
other methods are applied in the literature, the Delphi methodology
is one of the most commonly used approaches to achieve consensus.
This technique has also been used in the ﬁeld of climate change and
mental health, demonstrating appropriateness for the aims of this
study, and was therefore selected to achieve consistency [12,14,16].
In this study we used an initial email questionnaire survey to co-
design a set of recommendations that were then prioritized using a
Delphi methodology in a subsequent email survey round. The
research was conducted online between January and May 2022, and
participation was voluntary and unpaid. This project received ethics
approval from the Imperial College London Ethics Committee (refer-
ence number 21IC7327).
Participants and recruitment
To be eligible to participate in the study, individuals needed to (i)
have had a minimum of one year’s experience working in mental
health and/or climate change across at least one of the healthcare,
research, policymaking or third sectors; (ii) be ﬂuent in English; (iii)
have an afﬁliation with an organization that includes mental health,
climate change, or other relevant sectors; (iv) and be over the age
of 18.
Potential participants were identiﬁed through snowball and pur-
posive sampling through the authors’ networks. The aim was to
recruit a similar number of participants from each sector to reduce
potential bias, and to maximize geographic and demographic diver-
sity. Prospective participants were emailed a survey to express inter-
est in participating in the study, to conﬁrm they met the eligibility
criteria, and to assess whether their level of expertise was appropri-
ate for the study. Individuals were asked demographic questions
(age, gender, nationality); afﬁliation; sector of work; scale of work
(local, regional, national, international); experience in climate change
and/or mental health, and number of years worked in these ﬁelds.
Individuals could also nominate up to six further individuals in this
survey.
As the literature does not specify an agreed acceptable minimum,
or optimal number of participants for a Delphi study, all individuals
who expressed interest in participating in the study were included
and a target was set to recruit a minimum of 35 participants. This tar-
get sample size was set in line with previous Delphi studies [19].
Recruited participants were provided with a participant information
sheet and gave informed consent through a consent form prior to
study commencement.
Survey and recommendations development
The ﬁrst survey was designed to facilitate the development of a
set of recommendations to be prioritized in the second (Delphi)
survey. An initial set of published recommendations (based on Law-
rance et al. [1]), grouped by four sectors (healthcare, policymaking,
research, and third sector/community organizations) were included
in a survey. The survey asked participants whether they had any sug-
gested edits to each of the recommendations (free text), and whether
they believed each should be included in the prioritization exercise
in the following survey (“yes”/“no”/“don’t know”). The survey also
asked participants whether they had any further recommendations
they believed should be added to the list.
The qualitative and quantitative feedback was then analyzed
sequentially in multiple rounds by the study team, including assess-
ment and review of over 350 comments. In the ﬁrst round, one
author (JA) identiﬁed whether any of the recommendations did not
receive sufﬁcient support (<50% agreement) for inclusion in the sec-
ond survey and therefore should be removed, and then identiﬁed
emergent common themes in the free text feedback. The qualitative
feedback was then reviewed a second time by two study authors (JA

& AM) who then made suggested edits to the existing recommenda-
tions based on recurring feedback. The adjustments included simpli-
fying the recommendations to use clear and consistent language so
that they could be read and understood by individuals from different
contexts; removing explanatory examples of a particular instance of
the recommendation that participants considered superﬂuous; sepa-
rating recommendations that were deemed distinct; merging those
that had substantial conceptual overlap, and adding or removing spe-
ciﬁc content from the recommendations based on recurring feedback
from participants. The amendments were then considered by all
authors to ensure agreement. Through this process a set of novel rec-
ommendations was produced.
The revised recommendations, organized by sector (healthcare,
policymaking, research, and third sector/community organization)
were then presented to participants in a second survey. Participants
were asked to rate the extent to which they believed each recom-
mendation is important and, separately, feasible, using a ﬁve-point
Likert scale: strongly disagree, disagree, neither agree nor disagree,
agree, strongly agree. Participants had the option to justify each rat-
ing in a free text box, and any such qualitative feedback was cap-
tured. In a second stage, participants were then asked to select their
top three priorities for each sector.
Data analysis
The data were analyzed using Qualtrics and Microsoft Excel,
where the answers from the Likert scale were converted into a
numerical score: (1) strongly disagree, (2) disagree, (3) neither agree
nor disagree, (4) agree, (5) strongly agree. The mean, range, and stan-
dard deviation were calculated to measure the relative agreement
level with each recommendation’s importance and feasibility. The
Likert scale values were then collapsed into three categories of
“agree” (scores of 4 or 5), “neutral” (scores of 3), and “disagree”
(scores of 1 and 2). A recommendation was determined as not reach-
ing consensus if less than 75% of participants agreed (i.e. score 4 or 5)
that it is important or feasible [14].
The top three recommendations for each sector were identiﬁed as
those that had the highest share of respective participant votes for
the prioritization exercise.
Results
Participant characteristics
Sixty-one participants were recruited, representing 24 nationali-
ties.
Of
these,
60
(98%)
participated
in
developing
the
recommendations (survey 1), and 48 (79%) participated in the Delphi
prioritization survey (survey 2). Forty-seven (77%) participants com-
pleted both surveys. The reduction in participation can be explained
by natural attrition. Participants’ demographic information is shown
in Table 1.
Priorities for the four sectors
Following qualitative analysis of the feedback received from par-
ticipants in survey 1, in which 352 comments were assessed, 36 rec-
ommendations were developed, including 7 that were novel. 11
recommendations were developed for the healthcare sector from the
initial eight existing recommendations; nine were developed for poli-
cymakers from the initial seven; nine were developed for the
research sector from the initial eight; and seven were developed for
the third sector and community organizations from an initial six. The
initial recommendations were substantially edited following exten-
sive feedback from participants and all received sufﬁcient support
(>50%) and were therefore included in the prioritization exercise.
The results of the subsequent Delphi survey in which these rec-
ommendations were ranked and rated in terms of importance and
feasibility are shown in Tables 2-5.
The following sections will describe the three priorities that were
most commonly selected in the top three of participants’ rankings for
each of the four sectors. We include examples of feedback where the
qualitative data adds valuable nuance and perspectives.
Priorities for the healthcare sector
All healthcare sector recommendations were deemed important
and reached consensus, with over 90% agreement in each case and
the mean Likert values above 4.5 (Table 2). While all recommenda-
tions also reached consensus on feasibility, there was greater vari-
ability in the responses as demonstrated by higher standard
deviation scores for all but one of the recommendations.
Following participants’ selection of their top three priorities, four
leading recommendations emerged (with two recommendations in
joint third place), which are described in the text below. These four
recommendations also received the highest mean score for impor-
tance and feasibility.
Recommendation 1: Take immediate action to build sustainable and
climate-resilient healthcare systems that mitigate and adapt to
climate change and therefore reduce the harmful impacts of cli-
mate change on physical and mental health.

This recommendation received the highest share of participants’
top three priorities (37.5%) and also had the highest mean impor-
tance (M = 4.9, SD = 0.31). Its feasibility was also rated high (M = 4).
However, there was greater variation compared with participants’
perceptions of importance (SD = 0.69). Participants noted the urgency
of this recommendation but that feasibility will vary between coun-
tries, dependent on resources and political will, with particular chal-
lenges in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). LMICs can be
categorized using the World Bank deﬁnition [17].
"Taking immediate action to build sustainable and climate-resil-
ient healthcare systems in LMICs will be difﬁcult as this is in most
cases not included in their political commitment" - Male, Bangladeshi
Recommendation 2: Partner with those who have lived experience of
climate change impacts, and who are at greater risk of future
impacts, in the development, research and delivery of services in
response to climate change and related mental health needs.
Over a third of participants selected this in their top three priori-
ties (35.4%). This recommendation was also rated as the most feasible
for this sector (M = 4.56, SD = 0.57) and was considered highly impor-
tant (M = 4.85, SD = 0.35). Several participants commented on the
need to include the perspectives of those from LMICs, who are at
greater risk of current and future impacts of climate change, for
example due to living in areas more prone to extreme weather
events, being more dependent on the land for livelihood, and having
been more subjected to extractive practices from wealthier countries.
Other at-risk groups identiﬁed by participants included women,
young people, Indigenous communities, climate/environmental sci-
entists, and marginalized communities.
Recommendation 3 (joint 3rd): Raise awareness of the mental health
impacts of climate change, and the opportunities for mental
health gains from climate action, among the public to increase
people’s capacity to recognize, plan for and respond to these
impacts on themselves and their community.
Respondents to survey 1 identiﬁed the government as a key actor
in fulﬁlling this recommendation, via public sector messaging. A third
of participants selected this in their top three priorities (33.3%).
Although this was perceived as important (M = 4.54, SD = 0.71) and
feasible, there was greater variation in feasibility ratings (M = 4.38,
SD = 0.83). Participants suggested that feasibility of communicating
these key messages rests on ﬁrst improving the evidence base for
effective interventions. Several participants suggested that a chal-
lenge will be improving public understanding of this complex and
nuanced subject, while another participant commented that materi-
als tailored for different demographics may help to better reach and
engage audiences.
"Raising awareness is very feasible but scientiﬁc literacy and sci-
ence communication need to be improved too for the public to
understand the impact and ROI [return on investment] of appropriate
actions" - Male, Malaysian
Recommendation 4 (joint 3rd): Strengthen mental healthcare sys-
tems to increase preparedness and resilience to climate-related
disruptions, and ensure continuity of care.
This recommendation ranked joint third in the prioritization exer-
cise (33.3%). It received a high mean score for importance (4.69,
SD = 0.55) but there was greater variability in opinions of feasibility
(M = 4.19, SD = 0.9) and agreement on feasibility was lower than for
other recommendations (79.2% agreement, the second lowest for this
sector). While recognizing the importance of this recommendation,
respondents commented that its feasibility depended on having the
budget and resources to implement it. For example, training ﬁrst

aiders and expanding digital mental health service provision could
increase capacity and reduce access gaps, even in the context of cli-
mate shocks, but would involve implementation costs and additional
resourcing. Several commented that this recommendation should be
part of wider efforts to strengthen all health, including mental
healthcare.

Priorities for policymakers
The results of the Delphi questionnaire for the policymaker sector
are shown in Table 3. All policymaker recommendations were
deemed important and reached consensus, with over 85% agreement
in each case and mean values above 4.35. One recommendation did
not reach consensus on feasibility (66.7% agreement, see Table 3).
The top three recommendations from the prioritization exercise
are described below. The top recommendation, as selected by the
highest number of participants, also had the highest mean for impor-
tance (M = 4.83, SD = 0.37). The two recommendations considered
most feasible were not among the top three priorities.
Recommendation 1: Ensure that the impacts of climate change on
mental health are integrated into national adaptation and mitiga-
tion plans.
This received the highest share of votes for inclusion in the top
three (60.4%), the highest mean (4.83), least variance (SD = 0.37), and
all participants agreed that it was important. It also received the sec-
ond highest score for feasibility (M = 4.5, SD = 0.71), with 87.5% of
participants agreeing that it is feasible. Comments included the
apparent low priority of mental health among policymakers, and the
need for more evidence on climate change’s impacts on mental
health.
Recommendation 2: Develop, resource, and implement locally appro-
priate, community-driven climate change mitigation and adapta-
tion policies that provide mental health co-beneﬁts and greater
resilience to climate change, with a particular attention to reduc-
ing existing inequities and addressing climate injustice.
Almost four in 10 participants selected this in their top three pri-
orities (39.6%). Almost all participants (98%) agreed that this recom-
mendation
is
important.
It
received
a
high
mean
score
for
importance (M = 4.71, SD = 0.5) and feasibility (M = 4.48, SD = 0.68).
Participants’ comments indicated that political buy-in and local level
action are needed.
Recommendation 3: Ensure active participation of those with lived
experience and who are particularly at risk from the mental
health impacts of climate change, alongside mental health pro-
viders, researchers, local communities and other relevant stake-
holders, in the development of policies related to climate change
and mental health.
Over a third of participants selected this in their top three priori-
ties (35.4%). All participants agreed that this recommendation is
important (M = 4.73, SD = 0.44), and feasible (M = 4.44, SD = 0.7). Sev-
eral participants noted the need to appropriately enact this recom-
mendation to avoid the risk of further marginalization.

Priorities for research
The results of the Delphi questionnaire for the research sector are
shown in Table 4. All research recommendations reached consensus
on importance (>75% agreement) but two failed to reach consensus
on feasibility (with low agreement on importance also) and were
excluded (7 recommendations remaining). The top three prioritized
recommendations also received the highest mean score for impor-
tance and feasibility.
Recommendation 1: Conduct interdisciplinary, collaborative and par-
ticipatory research on the interconnections between climate
change and mental health to strengthen the evidence base and
facilitate the design of effective interventions.
Six in 10 participants selected this in their top three priorities
(60.4%). This recommendation also received the highest mean score
for feasibility (4.58, SD = 0.64), a high mean for importance (M = 4.71,
SD = 0.5) and almost all respondents agreed that it is important
(97.92%). One expert highlighted the need for funders to recognize
the value of multi-disciplinary collaborations, so that researchers can
work together to tackle this issue.
Recommendation 2: Develop, identify, evaluate, and facilitate the
scale-up of effective programs and interventions to support indi-
viduals and communities whose mental health is at risk from or
has been affected by the climate crisis.
Almost half of participants selected this in their top three priori-
ties (47.9%). Although there was 100% agreement on the importance
of this recommendation and it received the highest mean score for
importance (4.77, SD = 0.42), there was greater variability in percep-
tions of feasibility (M = 4.33, SD = 0.77), with 12.5% neutral on its fea-
sibility and 2.08% disagreeing. Participants commented that having
the necessary resources to implement this recommendation would
be a feasibility barrier and that more evidence is required to identify
programs and interventions that are most likely to be successful, and
to determine when to implement them.
"We need a strategic decision-making framework to help guide
which programs to choose and when." - Female, Australian
Recommendation 3: Ensure active participation of those with lived
experience and who are particularly at risk from the mental
health impacts of climate change, alongside mental health pro-
viders, policy-makers, local communities and other relevant
stakeholders, in research and innovation activities.
Almost half of participants selected this in their top three priori-
ties (45.8%). Almost all (97.9%) agreed this was important with the
remaining neutral (M = 4.75, SD = 0.48). There was slightly more vari-
ability in perceptions of feasibility (M = 4.42, SD = 0.67) and a greater
proportion of people were neutral (10.4%). Participants’ feedback
highlighted the need for people to be empowered to overcome bar-
riers to participating in research.

Priorities for third sector/community organizations
The results of the Delphi questionnaire for the third sector are
shown in Table 5. All third sector recommendations were deemed
important and reached consensus, with over 89% agreement in each

case and mean values above 4.5. One recommendation did not reach
consensus on feasibility (68.6% agreement).
The recommendation that received the highest mean scores for
importance and feasibility was not among the top three prioritized
(Raise awareness among policymakers, the health sector and the public
of the interconnections between mental health and climate change).
This recommendation was similar to recommendations in the other
sectors and therefore may not be deemed as a priority for this sector,
which was reﬂected in participants’ feedback.
Recommendation 1: Incorporate mental health and psychosocial sup-
port as a key pillar of emergency responses, particularly in assess-
ing risk, planning, preventing and responding to climate-related
disasters and slower onset impacts.
Two-thirds of participants selected this recommendation in their
top three (66.6%), and almost all (93.7%) agreed it was important
(M = 4.71, SD = 0.58). Its mean score for feasibility was slightly lower
(M = 4.46, SD = 0.71), as was agreement (87.5%). Participants
expressed that rather than training emergency responders to be
mental health experts, this recommendation should be implemented
by building it into existing infrastructure, for example by strengthen-
ing referral pathways.
Recommendation 2: Establish cross-organizational and cross-sector
collaborations to develop and share knowledge, and replicate best
practices to prevent, mitigate and adapt to the impact of climate
change on mental health.
Half of participants selected this in their top three (50%). All par-
ticipants agreed this recommendation was important, with the sec-
ond highest mean (M = 4.75, SD = 0.43). Most agreed that it is feasible
(87.5%), with the remaining neutral. Such collaborations could
include those with community responders, health professionals,
academics, policymakers, and the media. Participants highlighted
potential difﬁculties in getting buy-in due to a potential lack of
deﬁned leadership, and the need to identify “higher-order beneﬁts”
[i.e., beneﬁts shared across sectors] to all parties to “overcome turf
protecting”.
Recommendation 3: Identify and respond to implementation gaps
where the co-beneﬁts of climate action on mental health are not
being acted upon and where third sector and community organi-
zations are particularly well-placed to lead and collaborate.
Almost half of participants selected this in their top three (47.9%).
Almost all participants agreed this was important (95.8%) with the
remaining neutral. It had the same mean score for importance as the
ﬁrst recommendation in this sector (4.71) and similar variance
(SD = 0.54). Agreement for feasibility was slightly lower (89.6%) with
the remaining neutral. Its mean was fourth highest for this sector
(4.38, SD = 0.67). The majority of participants’ comments reﬂected
the need for additional resources, particularly funding.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst peer-reviewed study to provide
a comprehensive list of recommendations from across a variety of
sectors simultaneously, and as part of a formal consensus-building
process, to address the interconnections between climate change and
mental health. These recommendations largely achieved consensus
on perceived importance and feasibility, and therefore serve as a
framework for action across sectors. As the causes and consequences
of the connections between climate change and mental health cut
across all levels and sectors of society, including healthcare, research,
policy and the third sector, ensuring actions are coordinated and con-
nected across sectors is essential.
Despite increasing attention on climate change and mental health,
there has been very little to guide decision-makers and practitioners
at different levels and prior efforts are largely non-peer-reviewed [7].
And while other organizations have developed guidelines for prac-
tice, these have not been speciﬁc to the subject of climate change and
mental health, do not target the whole sector, and were not devel-
oped through global expert consensus [18]. These recommendations
ﬁll these gaps and are a much-needed starting point. However, as
well as resource investment, their success will depend on skilled and
collaborative implementation.
Recommendations were developed and reﬁned in a ﬁrst round of
engagement with the diverse expert cohort, which resulted in 36 rec-
ommendations across the four sectors. The subsequent Delphi-style
exercise checked for consensus on importance and feasibility for the
recommendations, with 32 reaching consensus across the group.
While the remaining four were unanimously deemed important,
they were not considered feasible as it was considered by some par-
ticipants unlikely that their implementation would be successful,
particularly in low-resource settings. Participants were also asked to
select their top three priorities for each sector. Examining the top
three priorities with the highest share of votes for each sector
revealed 13 priority recommendations (two ranked jointly).
As corroborated by the differences in perceptions of feasibility, the
recommendations are not intended to be a one-size-ﬁts-all approach
and implementation will require consideration of context. Decision-
makers will therefore need to consider how the recommendations
apply to their local and regional needs, and resourcing. However,
their easy adaptation is strengthened by the diverse group of experts
that contributed to their development, which beneﬁted from wide
geographical and sectoral representation.
Broadly, the prioritized recommendations highlighted the need
to: 1) expand the current evidence base to better identify and
implement successful strategies to mitigate and respond to the inter-
connections between climate change and mental health (i.e. inter-
ventions); 2) work collaboratively across sectors; 3) raise awareness
of the current underappreciated evidence base and examples of good
practice. Our priorities largely conﬁrm and provide additional empiri-
cal support to the research and policy priorities identiﬁed in other
recommendation pieces [5,10]. They however also provide new evi-
dence concerning priorities in sectors that have not been previously
systematically assessed, such as the health and third sectors.
Several of the prioritized recommendations also emphasize the
need to involve people with lived experience of climate-related men-
tal health impacts, or communities most affected, in decision-making,
research, policy, and implementation. This will help to ensure that
mitigation and adaptation approaches are tailored to the needs of
those most affected, increasing their likelihood of success. For
instance, communities living in areas at high risk of extreme weather
events could help develop mitigation strategies, such as investment
in and implementation of early warning systems. This reduces the
impact of disasters, including on mental health and wellbeing and is
in line with the recommendation from WHO to “implement [. . .]
community-based approaches to reduce vulnerabilities and address
the mental health and psychosocial impacts of climate change”
All recommendations that were not cut out as a result of survey 1
had high levels of perceived importance in survey 2. However, given
the high levels of agreement as well as rates of importance and feasi-
bility across most recommendations, possible ceiling effects may
have biased the results.
There was divergence in perceived feasibility of recommendations
that appeared largely to relate to whether the expert was from a high
or a low-resource setting, with some recommendations only deemed
feasible in the former. In addition to resource constraints, other
potential obstacles to implementation included the need for buy-in
J. Alford, A. Massazza, N.R. Jennings et al.
The Journal of Climate Change and Health 12 (2023) 100252
9
from governments and the public, and barriers to effective aware-
ness-raising strategies.
While resource constraints were expressed as even more chal-
lenging in LMICs, participants reported that mental health can be a
low priority even in high-resource contexts. For instance, for the
healthcare sector, the recommendation “Strengthen mental health-
care systems to increase preparedness and resilience to climate-
related disruptions, and ensure continuity of care” ranked highly in
terms of priority and importance, yet participants vocalized concerns
over implementation driven by high costs and limited funding of
mental healthcare, even in high-income settings. Participants also
noted that mental healthcare systems are already stretched without
having to adapt to climate impacts. This means the win-win opportu-
nities are even more pressing to highlight to decision-makers, as
many of the changes required to address the interrelationship
between climate change and mental health are also those that are
needed to strengthen existing services, for example by focusing on
sustainable healthcare delivery and community-based interventions.
Participants advocated for investment now to reduce the threat of cli-
mate change and prepare for its impacts. Such investment may pay
for itself in the long run by reducing the far-reaching consequences
of climate change on mental health.
Underpinning successful action is a strengthened evidence base -
not only to better identify who is most affected and why, but also to
identify which interventions are most likely to work in different con-
texts, for different communities, and at different times. Learning
from current practice, particularly in low-resource settings, will help
to ensure that successful interventions are replicated while failures
avoided, contributing to cost savings. The importance of strengthen-
ing the evidence base for mental health interventions in the context
of climate change has also been noted in other consensus-building
exercises [10].
The recommendations outlined in this report will require skilled
and collaborative implementation, as well as resource investment.
Leaders across sectors should invest in toolkits for implementation of
these recommendations that can be tailored to different settings,
including case studies of success stories and co-developed with
experts by lived experience. This should be done in tandem with
efforts to: 1) achieve buy-in for the recommendations at the highest
level of policy and practice (e.g. via the WHO or United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change [UNFCCC]); 2) ensure that
there are enough resources to build pathways for implementation
(e.g. via dedicated funding through national health departments,
research funders, and philanthropic organizations); and 3) to draw
on learning from best practice where this is already happening (e.g.
via international conferences, collaborations and engagement with
local stakeholders).
Some recommendations will have the beneﬁt of triggering a dom-
ino effect, where enacting some will enable others to be done more
easily. Efforts are therefore also required to map any ordering effects
between synergistic strategies, outline co-beneﬁcial relationships
where recommendations can achieve more if conducted simulta-
neously, and to make links between the recommendations and other
existing relevant climate policies and/or mental health policies. For
instance, the top recommendation for healthcare was decarbonizing
the sector. For that to be seen as a priority, it helps to have climate-
conscious healthcare leaders, which would require investment in
educational initiatives for health system leaders. This could also be
funneled into the development of networks to share knowledge and
best practice.
This study has some limitations. Although participants were
diverse, the sample may have been subject to recruitment bias and
the authors were all from institutions in the Global North, which
could potentially have led to some bias in the interpretation of the
results. The study also excluded non-English speakers, which may
limit generalizability. Some recommendations were relevant for
multiple sectors and were therefore repeated across different sectors,
which may have biased participants’ responses. There may also be
other important recommendations which were not surfaced by the
current study. While consensus was achieved in the perceived impor-
tance and feasibility of most recommendations, heterogeneity in the
prioritization exercise was observed, which future studies could seek
to explain through subgroup analysis. This is not interpreted as a lack
of consensus and differences may reﬂect the diversity of the back-
grounds of participants. This study did also not include overarching
recommendations to be applied generally across all sectors. Future
research efforts should focus on developing a better understanding of
the nature of barriers to implementation in particular geographical
or contextual settings, which was out of the scope of this study’s
design.
Conclusion
Through a Delphi methodology, this study has identiﬁed and pri-
oritized a number of recommendations across sectors to address the
dual and deeply interconnected crises of climate change and mental
health and wellbeing. These recommendations, considered to be
important and feasible, serve as a robust and evidence-based frame-
work to guide decision-makers and practitioners as they devise, pri-
oritize, and implement urgently-needed strategies in these areas, and
tailor these to their local needs and contexts. Although the proposed
recommendations lay the essential groundwork for strategy develop-
ment to the interconnected needs of caring for people and for the cli-
mate, their success rests on sufﬁcient investment from leaders and
collaborative execution across sectors and with people already
affected. As the impacts of these crises will only worsen with passiv-
ity and procrastination, it is up to leaders to take heed of these rec-
ommendations and act now to both mitigate and prevent the
exacerbation of these dual challenges, or pay the likely swollen price
