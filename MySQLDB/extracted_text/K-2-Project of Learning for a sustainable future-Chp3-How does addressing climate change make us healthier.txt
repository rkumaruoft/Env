Chapter 3. How Does Addressing Climate Change
Make Us Healthier?
This collection of inquiries explores sensitive material. It explores the connection between
climate change and many facets of human health. We have included resources, activities, and
information to inform educators of the serious and widespread effects that climate impacts
have on physical and mental health across Canada. This inquiry also invites students to reflect
and consider their own health in the face of these serious climate changes. We explore how
many of the actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions also have the co-benefit of improving
our health.
Through open-ended discussion probes, thoughtful provocations, and several hands-on
activities, this inquiry provides multiple directions for educators to take as human health and
climate change are explored side by side.

Before you Begin: Background Information for Educators
To help you have conversations with your students about their feelings on the existential threats
of climate change, we recommend several additional resources. Before feeling ready to create a
safe space where students can explore issues of climate change, you should feel supported and
informed with the help of expert voices on the subject. Here is a list of both theory and practices

The climate is changing at a rapid rate, and this change continues to have implications for
human health in a profound way. It is important to consider human health as more than simply
the absence of disease; human health is a multidimensional framework that encompasses
mental, physical and emotional well-being as equal contributors. Climate change has both direct
and indirect implications for mental health and psychosocial well-being. Overall, recent studies
have found that Canadians are increasingly experiencing mental health conditions and
3
symptoms related to the effects of climate change. As well, in terms of the impacts on physical
health,“Climate change is already impacting health in a myriad of ways, including by leading to
death and illness from increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as heatwaves,
storms and floods, the disruption of food systems, increases in zoonoses and food-, water- and
vector-borne diseases, and mental health issues” (WHO, 2021). In order to properly address
the urgency of climate change in Canadian classrooms within a health and well-being
framework, it is important to understand the impact of climate change on all facets of human
health.
Educating students about the health-related effects of climate change is critical due to the close
link between comprehending and acting on climate change. Psychological Research and
Climate Change showed that people are better able and more motivated to act on climate
change solutions when they can relate information and solutions to their own health and
well-being or local environment.
There are many additional factors that can affect an individual’s or region’s susceptibility to the
negative physical effects of climate change including: geographic location, the presence of
pre-existing illness or disability, and inequalities (socioeconomic, demographic, education level,
economic status and age).
Physical Health
The Public Health Agency of Canada has classified physical health risks as a result of climate
change into five categories: temperature-related morbidity and mortality, weather-related natural
hazards, air quality, water- and food-borne contamination, and health effects of exposure to
ultraviolet rays. Some health effects can be directly linked to concrete climate events like natural
disasters (droughts, floods, storms), but other changes are more gradual (Health Canada).
Temperature-related morbidity and mortality: periods of higher than normal heat and the
numbers of days per year above 35 degrees Celsius are multiplying and, on this trajectory, will
continue to do so throughout the next century, causing:
●
respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses
●
increased occupational health risks
Weather-related natural hazards: climate change is increasing both the severity and
frequency of natural hazards throughout Canada which can cause:
●
damaged public health infrastructure
●
injuries and illnesses
●
social and mental stress
●
increased occupational health hazards
●
population displacement
Air quality issues: cars, planes and industrial facilities are causing air pollution and it is being
intensified by warmer temperatures, causing:
4
●
increased exposure to outdoor and indoor air pollutants and allergens
●
respiratory diseases
●
cancer, heart attacks, strokes
●
other cardiovascular diseases
Water-borne contamination and food safety: climate change causes increased precipitation,
storm surges, and water temperatures which can contribute to flooding and runoff that can
spread sewage, chemicals, diseases, bacteria, and toxic algae. Climate change can also put
food safety at risk due to changing environmental and social conditions that increase the
likelihood of contamination.
Health effects due to exposure of ultraviolet rays: Increased UV exposure poses a high risk
and has the potential to cause:
●
skin damage and increased risk of skin cancer
●
cataracts
●
disturbed immune function
Mental Health
Mental health is influenced in many ways by climate change, both directly and indirectly, and it
can have both acute and chronic impacts on human health. Chronic mental health impacts can
be less obvious than in physical illness, but no less important. Individuals may experience fear
and feelings of helplessness that can manifest into serious mental health conditions such as
post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, grief, substance abuse disorders, and
others.
Acute mental health consequences often occur as a reaction to a natural disaster which has
caused damage to infrastructure, food systems, medical services, transportation, home and
belongings, or loved ones. Natural disasters can cause or exacerbate stress, and the
psychological effects can be profound and long-lasting.
Chronic mental health consequences can occur as a result of gradual climate changes. Feelings
of powerlessness, despair, and constant worry about the future of the planet, one’s own health,
and that of future generations have been termed “eco-anxiety.”
According to Mental Health and Our Changing Climate, both acute and chronic mental health
effects can include:
●
Anxiety
●
Depression
●
Post-traumatic stress disorder
●
Compounded stress
●
Loss of personal and occupational identity
●
Feelings of fatalism and helplessness
●
Trauma and shock

It is crucial to be informed about and cognizant of students’ mental health when addressing
climate change in the classroom. There are clear risks associated with catastrophizing the
problem and leaving students feeling helpless or solutionless. However, when the emphasis is
placed on taking action against climate change, the impacts on mental health can be positive
rather than negative. Encouraging students to make lifestyle choices that benefit the
environment or taking collective action can curtail some of the negative effects of climate
change. According to the American Psychological Association, “climate solutions not only
improve the quality of air and food but also enhance our cognitive abilities and strengthen our
mental health.”

General Introduction to the Inquiries in this Chapter:
This chapter offers 3 different structured and scaffolded inquiries to support How Addressing
Climate Change Makes us Healthier. Each of the 3 inquiries begin with a provocation followed
by the other steps of the inquiry model which includes many strategies and examples.
These steps can be completed in their entirety as stated. However, as inquiry is an organic and
fluid process based on student input, educators may wish to adapt, modify or replace the
suggested steps to create their own inquiry with their class. We therefore suggest that teachers
review the whole chapter first in order to create a plan that will work best with their particular
group of learners.
The following 3 inquiries are connected to curricular concepts as shown in this chart. These
curricular concepts are applicable across Canada.

Tool: Journaling
Encourage students to record their thinking and learning throughout the learning process. The
main reason for developing a journal is for students to then be able to look back and track their
growth and progression with their connection to climate change. Students scaffold their thinking
throughout their learning journey. The entries can be a combination of personal reflections and
assigned reflections. This can be done as illustrations, concept maps or written reflections.
Inquiry 1: Impacts on Health- Campaign for Vitamin D
Through yoga exercises, observing nature and understanding the importance of keeping our
planet earth healthy, students will explore the concepts of health and its benefits.
Resources:
●
Possible Pictures for Concept Maps
●
Frames: These can be made out of cardboard or cereal boxes
●

Take Action
A. Provocation
To hook student interest, introduce the provocation to initiate student’s thinking.
Gallery Walk
Vitamin N (Vitamin Nature): Invite the students to bring pictures from home of them
outside or print photographs of the kids outside at school or print pictures from the internet.
(Unsplash, Pixabay). Post the pictures around the room. Ask the students to walk around the
classroom looking at the pictures conducting a Gallery Walk.
With younger students it is encouraged to do the gallery walk three times. After each step,
come back to a circle and discuss their observations and questions.
●
Step 1: Have the students focus on what they see.
●
Step 2: Have the students focus on what they think.
●
Step 3: Have the students focus on what they wonder.
More information about this strategy and examples are available at the following link: See Think
Wonder
Possible Discussion Questions:
●
How does it make you feel when you are outside?
●
Is it different than when you are inside?
B. Question Generation
At this point in the inquiry, we want to harness students’ curiosity and build off of
the provocation that has captured their interest by generating meaningful questions
1
to continue to drive the learning process. This section will outline several pathways for question
generation depending on the provocation that your class engaged with.
Outdoor Pictures:
Distribute a frame to each child or pair. They can be made out of cardboard or cereal boxes. Go
outside and have the students use the frames to focus their observations on different parts of
nature. For example, look at the bark of a tree or a spider web. Invite the students to ask
questions about what they see.
Help younger students with question starters such as Five Ws and an H and developing higher
order questions and Activities for Teaching Children to Ask and Answer Questions
C. Knowledge Building
At this stage, students may be ready to engage in a group knowledge building
activity. It will encourage students to open their minds to many alternative ways
of thinking about the provocation and ideas that have been generated thus far in
the inquiry process.
Engage in a class Knowledge Building Circle (outside is recommended if possible) using one
of the questions that you generated after the Frames Activity or the example below.
Possible Umbrella Question: “How do you think the trees feel about where they live?”
D. Determining Understanding
At this stage of the inquiry, use responses to inform and guide the learning
process. They can provide insight into which concepts need clarity, what students
are already well informed about, and a general direction that students want to
pursue.
2
After the Knowledge Building Circle, introduce Concept Mapping to students. This activity can
be done in groups or with the whole class.  (More info on Concept Maps | Classroom Strategies
| Reading Rockets)
1.
Introduce the concept map pictures of land, plants, animals, rain, sun, water, trees, wind
and anything else you discussed. You can add the images or concepts that were taught
on index cards or sticky notes to allow students to move them around the concept map.
2.
Place the cards on a large piece of paper and invite students to sort them.
3.
Connect the pictures with lines based on ideas they have in common.
4.
Save the concept map for inquiry 2, 3 and 4 where more concepts will be introduced.
E. Pursuing Learning
Students will continue exploration of health and climate change. If there is interest,
the activities listed below offer deliberate, focused opportunities for students to
pursue learning about physical and mental health related impacts and responses to climate
change.
Class Book
Create a Vitamin N classroom book. Have the students choose one of their outdoor pictures for
the book. Write down how they felt in the picture or why they selected the picture.
Yoga
Do a sun salutation outside. You could do this every morning and students can talk about how it
makes them feel.
Extension Video:
Watch the video Happiness | Sustainability Classroom Resources.
Discuss what is important to the students and what really brings people happiness.
F. Consolidation
This step is designed to encourage students to integrate and synthesize key ideas.
When students make connections and see relationships within and across lessons,
this helps them to solidify knowledge and deepen understanding.
Sorting
Sort these “Happy vs. Sad Earth Sorting Cards” to determine what will make the earth happy
and what makes it sad. Create a couple of cards to share with the class based on what your
students have learned about.
3
Assessment Idea
Teachers will assess learning at different points throughout the inquiry using multiple
methods. The following assessment provides an alternative evaluation method to
standard quizzes and tests, that can be used after consolidation or at any point in the lesson to
check for understanding.
Choice Board strategy:
Possible Guiding Question: Why is being in nature important for the health of living things?
Sample Choice Board
Create a Bumper
Sticker
Oral Story about how
the “fish/plant/animal”
feel being in nature
Make an
Announcement
Draw a Picture
FREE CHOICE
Create a dance or
yoga session
Make Music
(any materials)
Sing a Song
Use Recycled
Materials to Make a
Model
After the students have decided which activity they would use to improve the health of living
things, they should be given an opportunity to present their understanding to other students or
parents/administrators.
Take Action:
Allowing time for students to take action is an essential part of the learning process
on climate change, as it empowers students and eases their eco-anxiety. Remind
students that even when things get hard and seem so big they can always do
something by taking action. Their actions will create an impact.
These ideas for action can be utilized at any point in the learning process, whether it's now or
after completing more guided inquiries. Please note the suggestions are consistent in each
chapter.
While the future is uncertain, there are many examples of positive actions happening all around
the world, and too often these stories do not get media coverage (check out The Happy
Broadcast to get some good news for a change!). Finding actions that students can get involved
4
in is paramount and in the subsequent thematic inquiries there are many examples of school
projects and activities. As we collectively oscillate between optimism and outrage, stories of the
past can also be important for active hope pathways.
Ask the students what they want to do to positively impact climate change. List their ideas and
come up with a plan to put their decided action in place.
Ideas for Taking Action:
●
A Ready-made Vehicle Idling Campaign NRCAN
●
Create their own anti-idling or idle-free posters for their community
Catalogue of Potential Idling Reduction Campaigns NRCAN
●
Educate the school through different announcements sharing “waste and water facts”
●
Post the garbage collection graph on the wall outside the classroom. Do a second
schoolyard garbage audit a month later. Put the second graph on the wall. Celebrate
successes.
●
Start a campaign for rain barrels to water school gardens
●
Think about making a commitment to reducing plastic waste 10,000 Changes
Action Project Examples
“KINDERGARTEN GARDEN PROJECT” - Byron Northview Public School - London, ON
(2019) K-2
●
Their vision for Canada is to foster healthy and mindful attitudes toward nature
and the outside world. It is their hope to show the youngest students how to
cultivate and grow a sustainable garden, respect the planning and planting
process, and to reap the benefits of growing their own produce. See their project
here.
“USING A HYDROPONIC GROW KIT WITH GRADE 1/2” - Anne Hathaway Public School -
Stratford, ON (2020) K-2
●
The goal of the project was to learn about the importance of eating local produce,
sharing local produce with others, and learning about where food comes from.
The first step of the project was to use a hydroponic grow kit to see leafy greens
grow fairly rapidly in the classroom. Grade 1/2 were intrigued that plants could
grow without soil and were very excited to watch the lettuce grow. See their
project here.
How could you use these great examples to come up with action projects with your K-2
students?

World's Largest Lesson
○
“In the first activity the students watch a 5 minute video that takes them around
the world visiting other young people who have taken individual actions to fight
5
climate change.  From India to Jordan, the students see that individual actions
can make a difference while the narrator encourages them to fix things where
they live.  The message of the video is to invent, collaborate or campaign to
make improvements where you live. After watching the video, the students will
brainstorm a list of possible actions that could fight climate change.”
●
Feeding Our Community - Ruth Betts Community School - Flin Flon, MB (2019)
○
Students at RBCS built a community garden to increase the availability of
affordable fresh produce. Students acquired the knowledge to build, grow, and
harvest their own fresh fruit and vegetables and how to utilize them in daily meals
and snacks. The garden contains a plant medicine wheel, ceremonial plants, and
a three sisters garden, incorporating traditional knowledge. See their project here
●
VegFest - E.L. Crossley Secondary School, Pelham, ON (2016)
○
E.A.R.T.H. club members at E.L. Crossley hoped to inform their fellow students
about the positive impacts a plant-based diet can have on the future of our
planet. Students organized a week of veggie-friendly events with the support of
various local community partners. The week’s events included a vegan cooking
class with a local natural chef, a screening of the documentary Cowspiracy, a
smoothie day, vegan salad bar extravaganza, cafeteria games, and a vendor day.
VegFest received an overwhelmingly positive response and high levels of student
participation each day. See their project here

A. Provocation
To hook student interest, introduce the provocation to initiate student’s thinking.
Posters
Posters can be a great way of gaining student attention and interest. This link identifies the
advantages to poster use in education and suggests 6 attributes of an effective poster.
Look at these posters as a class (DADA, 2013):
●
“No Idling, Children Breathing”
●
“I Am Idle Free”
Possible Questions
●
What do you think each poster means?
●
Why is it important to have clean air?
●
Why is there a dollar sign on the poster?
●
Does clean air affect other things? (animals, plants, water)
●
Do all areas have clean air? How does air get polluted?
●
Which poster do you like the best? Why?
1
B. Question Generation
At this point in the inquiry, we want to harness students’ curiosity and build off of
the provocation that has captured their interest by generating meaningful questions
to continue to drive the learning process.
Discovery
If possible go outside and observe the buses and cars that come to the school for pick up in the
morning and after school.
Anti-Idling Survey
Create a class survey, to initiate conversation and discussion around the topic of idling. Come
up with 3 questions that students will ask peers to see if they have an understanding of idling.
For example: Do you know what idling is?
C. Knowledge Building
At this stage, students may be ready to engage in a group knowledge building
activity. It will encourage students to open their minds to many alternative ways of
thinking about the provocation and ideas that have been generated thus far in the
inquiry process.
Engage in a class Knowledge Building Circle (outside is recommended if possible) using one
of the questions that you generated after the anti-Idling activity or the example below.
Possible Umbrella Question: “How can we educate others about idling?”
D. Determining Understanding
At this stage of the inquiry, use responses to inform and guide the learning
process. They can provide insight into which concepts need clarity, what students
are already well informed about, and a general direction that students want to
pursue.
After the Knowledge Building Circle, introduce Concept Mapping to students. This activity can
be done in groups or with the whole class.(More info on Concept Maps | Classroom Strategies |
Reading Rockets)
1.
Refer to the concept map that was created in the first inquiry.
2.
Add the new concept map pictures of pollution, car, train, plane, boat, factory and
anything else that you wish. You can add the images or concepts that were taught on
index cards or sticky notes to allow students to move them around the concept map.
2
3.
Have students place and connect with lines the ideas that have something in common
with the concepts from the first inquiry.
4.
Save the concept map for inquiry  3 and 4 where more concepts will be introduced.
E. Pursuing Learning
Students will continue exploration of health and climate change. If there is interest,
the activities listed below offer deliberate, focused opportunities for students to
pursue learning about physical and mental health related impacts and responses to
climate change.
Survey Follow-Up
After completing the survey, create a graph to analyze all of the responses. Invite students to
come up with some conclusions about the graph. Lastly, discuss what they should do about the
results. They might choose to educate the school population about vehicle idling.
Mental Health Break
●
Option 1: Do some breathing exercises outside.
●
Option 2: If students are feeling overwhelmed at any time, spend time outside in a
natural space. Learn how to do Sit Spots outside as a coping/relaxation strategy as well
as a learning activity (you may have to have the students find a quiet spot by a window if
you are indoors). Start with one minute and increase the time every day or week. At
school, travel outside as a class with their Sit Upon. Quietly move about the playground
and find a place that your class will go back to every week. Encourage students to sit a
minimum of two metres apart and invite them to quietly observe what is around them.
F. Consolidation
This step is designed to encourage students to integrate and synthesize key ideas.
When students make connections and see relationships within and across lessons,
this helps them to solidify knowledge and deepen understanding.
Role Play
Children work together in this role play game to understand how pollutants are passed through
the ecosystem and how humans make an impact.
Idea Adapted from 10 Hands-On Science Projects to Teach About Pollution
Assessment Idea
Teachers will assess learning at different points throughout the inquiry using multiple
methods. The following assessment provides an alternative evaluation method to standard
3
quizzes and tests that can be used after consolidation or at any point in the lesson to check for
understanding.

A. Provocation
To hook student interest, introduce the provocation to initiate student’s thinking.
Video
As a class, watch the following video as a springboard for discussion:
●
The Lump! A Rhyming Kids' Story About Plastic Pollution in the Sea
Possible Questions:
●
How does it make you feel when you hear and see what is happening to the animals in
the water?
●
Why do you think that some animals eat plastic they find in the water?
●
How do you think the pollution gets into the water?
B. Question Generation
At this point in the inquiry, we want to harness students’ curiosity and build off of
the provocation by generating meaningful questions to continue to drive the
learning process.
Take students on a Neighbourhood Walk. Before setting off, tell students that they will go
outside to look for pollution in the community. Encourage them to ask “I Wonder” questions
while on the excursion. Example: I wonder where the plastic bag came from?
Note: Bring a camera to take photographs of any pollution that your students notice throughout

C. Knowledge Building
At this stage, students may be ready to engage in a group knowledge building
activity. It will encourage students to open their minds to many alternative ways of
thinking about the provocation and ideas that have been generated thus far in the
inquiry process.
Engage in a class Knowledge Building Circle (recommended to conduct outside if possible)
using one of the questions that you generated after the neighbourhood walk or the example
below.
Possible Umbrella Question: “What happens to the pollution that is left on the ground or
in the water?”
D. Determining Understanding
At this stage of the inquiry, use responses to inform and guide the learning
process. They can provide insight into which concepts need clarity, what students
are already well informed about, and a general direction that students want to
pursue.
After the Knowledge Building Circle, introduce Concept Mapping to students. This activity can
be done in groups or with the whole class. (More info on Concept Maps | Classroom Strategies |
Reading Rockets)
1.
Refer to the concept map that was created in the second inquiry.
2.
Add the new concept map pictures of water pollution, and/or photos taken during the
neighbourhood walk. You can add the images or concepts that were taught on index
cards or sticky notes to allow students to move them around the concept map.
3.
Have students place and connect with lines the ideas that have something in common
with the concepts from the first inquiry.
4.
Save the concept map for inquiry 4 where more concepts will be introduced.
E. Pursuing Learning
Students will continue exploration of health and climate change. If there is interest,
the activities listed below offer deliberate, focused opportunities for students to
pursue learning about physical and mental health-related impacts and responses
to climate change.
Activity Example 1: Garbage Audit
Conduct a schoolyard garbage audit.
●
Create a graph of the different types of garbage found around the school or schoolyard
and post it in the hallway for other classrooms to see.
2
●
Create and share announcements and information about water pollution and garbage.
(e.g. posters, school-wide announcements, send students class to class)
●
Do another schoolyard garbage audit in a couple of weeks and compare the graphs.
Were there any changes after educating the community? Why or why not?
OR
Activity Example 2: Puppet Show
Create a puppet show.
●
Using the story plan below, students work with the teacher to write a story.
○
Beginning: An animal/fish/amphibian/reptile is in a pollution situation in a
river/ocean/pond.
○
Problem: How is the character impacted by pollution?
○
Solution: How is the problem resolved?
The story is then presented as a puppet show.
Possible Extension Activity
Make puppets out of recycled material or create sock puppets using mismatched socks.
F. Consolidation
This step is designed to encourage students to integrate and synthesize key ideas.
When students make connections and see relationships within and across lessons,
this helps them to solidify knowledge and deepen understanding.
Perspective
Write, draw or dramatize a story about pollution from a living thing’s perspective.
Example: Ask students to tell you how the fish feels.
Assessment Idea
Teachers will assess learning at different points throughout the inquiry using multiple methods.
The following assessment provides an alternative evaluation method to standard quizzes and
tests, that can be used after consolidation or at any point in the lesson to check for
understanding.
Choice Board Strategy
Possible Guiding Question: What can we do to prevent pollution in the first place?

After the students have decided which activity they would use to prevent pollution, they should
be given an opportunity to present their understanding to other students or
parents/administrators.
Take Action:
Allowing time for students to take action is an essential part of the learning process
on climate change, as it empowers students and eases their eco-anxiety. Remind
students that even when things get hard and seem so big they can always do
something by taking action. Their actions will create an impact.
These ideas for action can be utilized at any point in the learning process, whether it's now or
after completing more guided inquiries. Please note that the suggestions are consistent in each
chapter.
While the future is uncertain, there are many examples of positive actions happening all around
the world, and too often these stories do not get media coverage (check out The Happy
Broadcast to get some good news for a change!). Finding actions that students can get involved
in is paramount and in the subsequent thematic inquiries there are many examples of school
projects and activities. As we collectively oscillate between optimism and outrage, stories of the
past can also be important for active hope pathways.
Ask the students what they want to do to positively impact climate change. List their ideas and
come up with a plan to put their action in place.

Action Project Examples
“KINDERGARTEN GARDEN PROJECT”-Byron Northview Public School- London, ON (2019)
K-2
●
Their vision for Canada is to foster healthy and mindful attitudes toward nature
and the outside world. It is their hope to show the youngest students how to
cultivate and grow a sustainable garden, respect the planning and planting
process, and to reap the benefits of growing their own produce. See their project
here.
“USING A HYDROPONIC GROW KIT WITH GRADE 1/2”-Anne Hathaway Public School-
Stratford, ON (2020) K-2
●
The goal of the project was to learn about the importance of eating local produce,
sharing local produce with others, and learning about where food comes from.
The first step of the project was to use a hydroponic grow kit to see leafy greens
grow fairly rapidly in the classroom. Grade 1/2 were intrigued that plants could
grow without soil and were very excited to watch the lettuce grow. See their
project here.
*How could you use these great examples to come up with action projects with your K-2
students?

○
“In the first activity the students watch a 5 minute video that takes them around
the world visiting other young people who have taken individual actions to fight
climate change.  From India to Jordan, the students see that individual actions
can make a difference while the narrator encourages them to fix things where
they live.  The message of the video is to invent, collaborate or campaign to
make improvements where you live. After watching the video, the students will
brainstorm a list of possible actions that could fight climate change.”

VegFest - E.L. Crossley Secondary School, Pelham, ON (2016)
○
E.A.R.T.H. club members at E.L. Crossley hoped to inform their fellow students
about the positive impacts a plant-based diet can have on the future of our
planet. Students organized a week of veggie-friendly events with the support of
various local community partners. The week’s events included a vegan cooking
class with a local natural chef, a screening of the documentary Cowspiracy, a
smoothie day, vegan salad bar extravaganza, cafeteria games, and a vendor day.
VegFest received an overwhelmingly positive response and high levels of student
participation each day. See their project here

A. Provocation
To hook student interest, introduce the provocation to initiate student’s thinking.
Pictures
Compare these two pictures of a cornfield as a class.
(unsplash.com)
Possible Questions:
●
What do you notice about these pictures?
●
Why is the weather important to farmers?
●
What would happen to the farmers’ crops if we didn’t get any rain for a month?
●
What would happen to the farmers’ crops if it rained everyday for a month?
●
Do you like to eat corn? Would you be able to if this happened?
●
Is this happening in other parts of the world? How will this impact humans?
1
B. Question Generation
At this point in the inquiry, we want to harness students’ curiosity and build off of
the provocation by generating meaningful questions to continue to drive the
learning process.
Discovery
In the fall, spring or summer, you can take the students outside and look at plants and where
they grow. In the winter season they can look at indoor plants. What questions do the students
have about the plants, the soil and where they grow?
Extension (Food access):
●
How might these plants look different in other countries around the world?
●
Do you think all of the countries in the world have the same plants?
●
How do people decide what to grow?
●
If the plants are different, what does that mean for the food people eat?
Help younger students with question starters.

C. Knowledge Building
At this stage, students may be ready to engage in a group knowledge building
activity. It will encourage students to open their minds to many alternative ways
of thinking about the provocation and ideas that have been generated thus far in
the inquiry process.
Engage in a class Knowledge Building Circle (recommended to conduct outside if possible)
using one of the questions that you generated after the picture comparison activity or the
example below.
●
Possible Umbrella Question: “What would you ask the farmer about their crops?”
D. Determining Understanding
At this stage in the inquiry, use responses to inform and guide the learning
process. They can provide insight into which concepts need clarity, what students
are already well informed about, and a general direction that students want to
pursue.

After the Knowledge Building Circle, introduce Concept Mapping to students. This activity can
be done in groups or with the whole class.   (More info on Concept Maps | Classroom Strategies
| Reading Rockets)
1.
Refer to the concept map that was constructed in the first three inquiries.
2.
Add the new concept map picture(s) of drought, flood, environment and human impact.
You can add the images or concepts that were taught on index cards or sticky notes to
allow students to move them around the concept map.
3.
Have students place and connect with lines the ideas that have something in common
with concepts from inquiry 1, 2 and 3.
4.
Finally, together develop a statement or big idea that explains the concept map.
E. Pursuing Learning
Students will continue exploration of health and climate change. If there is interest,
the activities listed below offer deliberate, focused opportunities for students to pursue learning
about physical and mental health related impacts and responses to climate change.
Activity Example 1: Science Experiment
Create a science experiment to understand drought and flooding.
Plant three food plants from seed or purchase three plants that are exactly the same.
Decide what the plants will need in order to survive and how often they need to be watered.
Decide which plant will be overwatered, never watered and which one will be watered when it
needs to be. Make some predictions about what will happen to the plants or seeds after a
couple of weeks. Students can use this template to record their predictions and subsequent
learning.
Example Activity 2: Food Securities
If you would like to delve more into food securities and healthy eating and how it relates to
climate change, read the book The World Came to my Place Today by Jo Readman,
illustrated byLey Honor Roberts or find the book here.
“The world really does come to visit George when his grandpa arrives, with a globe, to look after him
and his sister for the day. Grandpa explains how everything from the cereal they eat for breakfast
and the chocolate bars they love, to the rubber in their bicycle tyres and wood in their toys, come
from plants all over the world. The lively, simple text follows George's day as he discovers the
wonder of plants and how they affect his daily life.” (Jo Readman and Ley Honor Roberts)
Follow up: Activities to introduce the global-ness of food can be found in this document based
on the book “The World Came to My Place”.
Talk about children in our communities, in the rest of Canada, and in the world and how
everyone is affected by climate change and food.
