Costing Climate Change Impacts to Public Infrastructure: Summary Report 
Estimating the budgetary impacts of changing climate hazards on public infrastructure in Ontario 
1 | Summary 
Public infrastructure is vulnerable to changing climate hazards 
To ensure safety and reliability, public infrastructure is designed, built and maintained to withstand a specific 
range of climate conditions, typically based on historical climatic data. However, Ontario’s climate is changing, 
bringing more frequent and intense extreme rainfall and extreme heat, and fewer freeze-thaw cycles. These 
changing climate hazards will increase the cost of maintaining the $708 billion portfolio of municipal and 
provincial public infrastructure in Ontario, including buildings and facilities, transportation infrastructure, and 
linear storm and wastewater infrastructure. 
Climate change will raise public infrastructure costs 
Climate hazards are accelerating asset deterioration, resulting in the need for higher capital investments for more 
frequent rehabilitations and earlier renewals, as well as higher spending for more operations and maintenance 
(O&M) activities. The FAO projects that in the absence of adaptation, these changing climate hazards will add 
$4.1 billion per year on average to the cost of maintaining the $708 billion portfolio of existing public 
infrastructure in a medium emissions scenario. This represents a 16 per cent increase in infrastructure costs 
relative to a stable climate base case. 
 
Municipalities will bear most of the climate-related infrastructure costs estimated in the CIPI project, in part 
because they manage over 70 per cent of the portfolio in scope, and because their portfolio is more susceptible 
to these climate hazards. 
 
 
 
Ultimately, the extent of climate change will have a direct impact on the costs to maintain Ontario’s public 
infrastructure. In the absence of adaptation, the FAO estimates that Ontario’s public infrastructure costs will rise 
by approximately eight per cent (or about $2.0 billion per year) on average over the rest of the century for each 
degree Celsius increase in the global mean surface temperature beyond the 0.5°C in the base case.

Costing Climate Change Impacts to Public Infrastructure: Summary Report 
Estimating the budgetary impacts of changing climate hazards on public infrastructure in Ontario 
Adaptation can lower climate-related infrastructure costs 
Adapting public infrastructure can help to 
avoid climate-related deterioration and 
operations and maintenance activities. 
However, adaptive actions can also raise 
public infrastructure costs. The FAO costed 
climate impacts to public infrastructure for 
multiple climate scenarios and across three 
asset management strategies. A no adaptation 
strategy assumes that public infrastructure is 
not adapted to withstand changing climate 
hazards. A proactive adaptation strategy 
assumes asset managers adapt infrastructure 
either during an asset’s next major 
rehabilitation or upcoming renewal, whichever 
comes first. A reactive adaptation strategy 
assumes infrastructure assets are adapted 
when replaced at the end of their useful lives. 
 
The financial impact of extreme rainfall, 
extreme heat and freeze-thaw cycles will be 
material to the Province and municipalities 
regardless of which asset management 
strategy is pursued. However, the FAO estimates that on a constant dollar basis, average annual climate-related 
costs are highest under the no adaptation strategy ($4.1 billion per year, or 16 per cent above a stable climate 
base case) and lowest under the proactive adaptation strategy ($3.0 billion per year, or 11 per cent above a 
stable climate case case) in a medium emissions scenario. Across all climate scenarios, the proactive adaptation 
strategy carries the lowest climate-related costs in constant dollars. 
Adaptation reduces the risk of climate-related infrastructure service disruption 
Adapting public infrastructure reduces its 
climate vulnerability and lowers the risk of 
infrastructure failure or loss of performance. 
The proactive adaptation strategy adapts all 
public infrastructure over the next five decades, 
rapidly improving the portfolio’s climate 
resilience. The reactive adaptation strategy 
adapts assets more slowly, leaving the majority 
of Ontario’s public infrastructure more vulnerable 
to climate risk though to the mid-2060s.  
 
When public infrastructure suffers a loss of 
performance, or fails entirely, it can impose 
costs on households, businesses and the 
broader economy. For example, if extreme 
rainfall overwhelms stormwater infrastructure 
and the surrounding area floods, households 
and businesses may have to repair the flood 
damages. These broader societal costs are 
likely to be substantial but were beyond the 
scope of the FAO’s costing analysis.

Costing Climate Change Impacts to Public Infrastructure: Summary Report 
Estimating the budgetary impacts of changing climate hazards on public infrastructure in Ontario 
The long-term budget impact of 
climate-related infrastructure costs 
for the provincial portfolio 
In a medium emissions scenario, climate-related 
infrastructure costs for the provincial portfolio 
would add 2.8 to 3.4 percentage points to the 
Province’s net debt-to-GDP ratio by the end of 
the century. For context, Ontario’s net debt rose 
from 10.4 per cent of GDP in 1981-82 to 38.3 per 
cent in 2022-23, an increase of 27.9 percentage 
points in 41 years. In the medium emissions 
scenario, the climate costs for provincial 
infrastructure are not likely to significantly impact 
the Province’s fiscal sustainability.  
 
Early investment in the proactive strategy 
would minimize the risk of climate-related 
provincial infrastructure service disruption and 
would consume an additional 20 cents of every 
$100 dollars in revenue in the 2050s relative to 
the reactive strategy. However, by the 2090s, 
all asset management strategies have similar 
budgetary impacts.  
 
Climate scenarios with greater increases in global mean temperatures result in more significant fiscal outcomes 
due to more frequent and intense climate hazards. For example, in the absence of adaptation, the FAO estimates 
that Ontario’s net debt-to-GDP ratio would increase by 1.6 percentage points by the 2090s for every degree 
Celsius increase in global mean temperatures beyond 0.5ºC. 
 
The impact of climate-related infrastructure costs for municipalities is projected to be 
four times larger than for the Province 
Ontario’s 444 municipalities own 71 per cent ($506 billion) of the public infrastructure portfolio in the CIPI 
project’s scope. The municipal portfolio includes all the linear storm and wastewater infrastructure, which is more 
vulnerable to extreme rainfall than the other asset classes. As a result, Ontario’s municipalities are projected to 
incur about four times the climate-related infrastructure costs than the Province.  
 
In the medium emissions scenario, municipal climate-related infrastructure costs are projected to range between 
$2.4 billion and $3.3 billion per year on average over the century, depending on the asset management strategy. 
These costs are equivalent to between five and seven per cent of total Ontario-wide municipal spending in 2020, 
similar to the amount municipalities spent on social housing, general government, or health and emergency services. 
 
The impact of climate-related infrastructure costs for the combined provincial and 
municipal portfolios 
To gauge the full magnitude of the CIPI project’s climate cost estimates, the FAO projected the impact of both 
provincial and municipal climate-related infrastructure costs on the Province’s long-term fiscal position. While the 
Province is not legally required to fund municipal financial liabilities, the intent of this analysis is to illustrate the 
size of the combined budgetary liability.

Costing Climate Change Impacts to Public Infrastructure: Summary Report 
Estimating the budgetary impacts of changing climate hazards on public infrastructure in Ontario 
Climate-related costs for the combined 
infrastructure portfolio would raise the 
Province’s net debt-to-GDP ratio by 15.2 to 
16.7 percentage points by the 2090s in a 
medium emissions scenario. These impacts 
are much larger than for the provincial 
portfolio alone. 
 
The fiscal impacts of the proactive strategy 
occur earlier in the century since 
investments are made to adapt roughly 90 
per cent of provincial and municipal public 
infrastructure by 2050, versus roughly 20 
per cent in the reactive strategy.  
 
Early investments in the proactive strategy 
would minimize the risk of climate-related 
public infrastructure service disruption and 
would consume an additional $1.60 of every 
$100 dollars in revenue in the 2050s relative 
to the reactive strategy. However, all asset 
management strategies have similar 
budgetary impacts by the 2090s.  
 
The Province’s climate change risk assessment aligns with CIPI 
The Province recently released its Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment (PCCIA), which found that 
“…all infrastructure across Ontario face climate risk.”1 While the PCCIA examined a broader range of climate 
hazards on a different composition of public and private infrastructure asset classes, its conclusions on the 
climate vulnerability of public infrastructure are broadly aligned with those of the CIPI project.  
The FAO’s climate costs are lower-bound estimates  
Public infrastructure is one of many ways that climate change is impacting Ontario’s society and economy. Within 
the scope of climate change’s impact to public infrastructure, the FAO’s cost estimates reflect the lower bound of 
potential impacts. The CIPI project examined only three of many climate hazards, considered a subset of 
Ontario’s public infrastructure, and did not incorporate the broader costs to households and businesses of 
climate-related infrastructure service disruption.

Costing Climate Change Impacts to Public Infrastructure: Summary Report 
Estimating the budgetary impacts of changing climate hazards on public infrastructure in Ontario 
2 | About the CIPI project 
Canada has produced a growing body of work examining how climate change will impact public infrastructure. Recently, 
the Canadian government released its National Adaptation Strategy, which stated that there is a need to scale up 
investments to make public infrastructure more resilient to a changing climate.2 Ontario also released its Provincial 
Climate Change Impact Assessment (PCCIA), which found that “…all infrastructure across Ontario face climate risk.”3  
 
Despite numerous climate risk assessments, the cost implications of changing climate hazards for government 
infrastructure budgets remain largely unexplored, both in Canada and abroad. In response to this knowledge 
gap, a Member of Provincial Parliament asked the FAO to analyze the costs that the impacts of climate change 
could impose on Ontario’s provincial and municipal infrastructure, and how those costs could affect the long-
term budget outlook of the Province. In response, the FAO launched its Costing Climate Change Impacts to 
Public Infrastructure (CIPI) project. 
 
Given the complexity of the request, the CIPI project was carefully scoped in three important ways. First, despite 
the presence of many climate hazards, CIPI only considered three: extreme rainfall, extreme heat and freeze-
thaw cycles. Second, while these three climate hazards will have a wide range of impacts on Ontario’s public 
infrastructure, CIPI included only 11 of the most important impacts on select asset classes. Third, only those 
costs borne by governments to maintain the current suite of infrastructure in a state of good repair were 
included. The broader societal costs to households and businesses from reductions or losses in infrastructure 
service provision were beyond the scope of the CIPI project.  
 
The project began with two reports assessing the composition and state of repair of provincial and municipal 
infrastructure. Then, in the fall of 2021, the FAO released three reports: the CIPI project backgrounder, which described 
the overall context and methodology of the CIPI project; a report prepared by WSP Global, which detailed the 
engineering impacts of these climate hazards on public infrastructure; and the first CIPI sector report, which described 
how changes in these climate hazards will impact the long-term costs of maintaining Ontario’s public buildings and 
facilities in a state of good repair. This was followed by sector reports for transportation infrastructure and linear storm 
and wastewater infrastructure.  
 
 
 
This summary report outlines the main results of the three sector reports and projects long-term budgetary 
impacts on key fiscal sustainability measures. In addition, WSP’s updated engineering assessment is available for 
download on the FAO’s website, as well as all historical and projected climate indicators used in the CIPI project. 
Municipal and region-specific results are available by request. All costs are expressed in 2020 constant dollars 
unless otherwise noted.

Costing Climate Change Impacts to Public Infrastructure: Summary Report 
Estimating the budgetary impacts of changing climate hazards on public infrastructure in Ontario 
3 | Public infrastructure is vulnerable 
to changing climate hazards 
Ontario has a large portfolio of public infrastructure 
The FAO’s Costing Climate Change Impacts 
to Public Infrastructure (CIPI) project focuses 
on $708 billion4 (in current replacement 
value5) of provincial and municipally owned 
assets that encompassed three asset sectors: 
buildings, transportation infrastructure, and 
linear storm and wastewater infrastructure.6  
• The buildings sector comprises 
buildings and facilities such as schools, 
hospitals, government administration 
buildings, social housing, water 
treatment plants, among others. 
• Transportation infrastructure includes 
highways, arterials, collector roads, 
local roads, bridges, rail track and large 
structural culverts.  
• Linear storm and wastewater 
infrastructure includes stormwater 
pipes, ditches and culverts, as well as 
wastewater sewers and sanitary force 
mains.  
 
Ontario’s 444 municipalities own and manage $506 billion of this infrastructure, representing 71 per cent of the 
infrastructure assets in scope. The Province owns $202 billion, or 29 per cent of assets in scope. For context, the 
value of the portfolio under analysis is equivalent to almost three-quarters of Ontario’s 2021 economic output.  
 
The project’s scope excludes federal infrastructure, infrastructure owned by Indigenous communities, linear 
potable water infrastructure, machinery and equipment assets, land, and infrastructure related to electricity 
generation, transmission and distribution.  
 
 
 
4 All costs presented in this report are expressed in 2020 real (inflation-adjusted) dollars, unless otherwise noted.  
5 To measure the value of infrastructure, asset managers use the concept of current replacement value (CRV). CRV is the 
current cost of rebuilding an asset with the equivalent capacity, functionality and performance as the original asset. Estimates 
of infrastructure CRV were developed from several sources and methodologies, with a large portion developed by Ontario’s 
Ministry of Infrastructure. See the FAO’s provincial and municipal infrastructure reports for more details.

Costing Climate Change Impacts to Public Infrastructure: Summary Report 
Estimating the budgetary impacts of changing climate hazards on public infrastructure in Ontario 
While much of this portfolio was designed based on 
historical climate data, the climate is changing 
To ensure safety and reliability, public infrastructure is designed, built and maintained to withstand a specific 
range of climate conditions typically based on historical climatic data. For example, Ontario’s Building Code uses 
climate design data based on historical weather observations, and Ontario’s Ministry of the Environment, 
Conservation and Parks requires municipalities to design sewers using historical precipitation data.7 In addition, a 
survey of municipalities revealed that 57 per cent continue to rely on historical climate data when designing 
stormwater infrastructure.8  
 
However, rising concentrations of greenhouse gases are increasing global mean temperatures, leading to more 
frequent and intense climate hazards in Ontario. The purpose of the CIPI project is to assess how future changes 
in climate variables will impact infrastructure costs relative to the recent past.  
 
The historical baseline for CIPI is defined as the 1976-2005 period, as a significant portion of Ontario’s current 
public infrastructure was designed and built to the climate of that period. The “stable climate base case” 
assumes that all climate indicators remain at their 1976-2005 average levels. As the global mean surface 
temperature rose by 0.5ºC above pre-industrial averages by the 1976-2005 period, the stable climate base case 
incorporates 0.5ºC of global warming.9 This stable climate base case cost projection will be compared in later 
chapters to projections that account for changing climate hazards, allowing the FAO to estimate the additional 
climate-related infrastructure costs.  
 
While the global mean surface temperature has already risen substantially, the extent of future change will 
depend on the path of global greenhouse gas emissions. CIPI considered three possible global emissions 
scenarios based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) fifth comprehensive assessment. 
The low emissions scenario assumes a major and immediate turnaround in global climate policies. The medium 
emissions scenario assumes that global emissions peak in the 2040s, then decline rapidly thereafter. The high 
emissions scenario assumes global emissions continue to grow at their historical pace for most of the century.10  
 
While the IPCC does not attach any likelihood to future emissions scenarios, further warming is projected to 
occur in all emissions scenarios.

environmental data used in the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code.

9 Note that Figure 3-2 uses data presented in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2013, Table All. 7.5 (page 
1444), which published results for the 1986-2005 period. The change in global mean surface temperature during the 1976-
2005 period relative to 1850-1900 was obtained based on calculations provided to the FAO by Environment and Climate 
Change Canada. 
10 The IPCC calls these scenarios Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The low emissions scenario corresponds 
to RCP2.6, medium corresponds to RCP4.5 and high corresponds to RCP8.5 as defined in the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment 
Synthesis Report released in 2013. These were the most current emissions scenarios available at the time of CIPI’s climate 
analysis. Since then, the IPCC released its sixth assessment in 2021, which contained updated emissions scenarios. These 
new scenarios align with those from 2013 in terms of average warming, and as such, the emissions scenarios CIPI considers 
remain relevant.

Costing Climate Change Impacts to Public Infrastructure: Summary Report
Estimating the budgetary impacts of changing climate hazards on public infrastructure in Ontario 
Climate change will bring more frequent and intense extreme 
heat and rainfall in Ontario, but fewer freeze-thaw cycles 
Climate change is associated with many hazards to public infrastructure, which can take the form of extreme 
weather events or long-term chronic impacts. While public infrastructure faces many climate hazards,11 CIPI 
focused on those that can be projected with reasonable scientific confidence, and which will have financially 
material impacts to public infrastructure budgets.  
Working with WSP,12 the FAO’s engineering consultant for the CIPI project, the scope of analysis was narrowed 
to three climate hazards that include extreme heat, extreme rainfall13 and freeze-thaw cycles. Figure 3-3 shows 
which of these three climate hazards were examined for each asset class. 
11 Ontario has been subject to costly floods and ice storms and is also prone to droughts, intense rainfall, wildfires, 
windstorms, heat waves and permafrost melt. See Canada in a Changing Climate, Section 6.4. 
12 WSP is a large engineering firm with expertise in all aspects of public sector infrastructure, including asset management, 
public infrastructure construction and operations, and climate change impacts. See WSP’s website for more details. 
13 Extreme rainfall includes the impact of pluvial flooding but excludes the impact of fluvial flooding due to a lack of 
comprehensive flood plain mapping in Ontario.

Costing Climate Change Impacts to Public Infrastructure: Summary Report
Estimating the budgetary impacts of changing climate hazards on public infrastructure in Ontario 
To acquire projections of key climate indicators for Ontario, the FAO partnered with the Canadian Centre for 
Climate Services (CCCS) at Environment and Climate Change Canada,14 which provided projections for all 
climate variables used in the CIPI project.15  
Over the rest of the 21st century, Ontario will experience more frequent and intense extreme heat, more frequent 
and intense extreme rainfall, and fewer freeze-thaw cycles on average across the province than occurred in the 
1976-2005 base period. While the CIPI project used a broad range of climate variables to represent the climate 
hazards, Figure 3-4 below shows how three select climate indicators representing these hazards are expected 
to change over the rest of the century.16 
14 See Canadian Centre for Climate Services website. 
15 These climate projections are drawn from the Bias Correction/Constructed Analogues with Quantile mapping reordering 
Version 2 (BCCAQv2) dataset, based on the multi-model Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5a. This is a widely 
recognized source that has been transparently peer reviewed and used extensively in Canada, including in Canada’s 
Changing Climate Report, the data available on ClimateData.ca, and the Climate Atlas of Canada. See Chapter 2 of the CIPI 
backgrounder for more details.

The annual number of “hot days” is one indicator of extreme heat, and occurs when the daily maximum 
temperature exceeds 30°C. On average across the province, hot days are expected to increase from 4 days per 
year in the 1976-2005 base period to 17 days (9 to 23 days)17 by the late century period (i.e., 2071-2100) in the 
medium emissions scenario.  
 
One indicator of extreme rainfall is the amount of rainfall that occurs in 24 hours for the 1-in-100-year storm 
event.18 This storm event brought 103 mm of rain in a 24-hour period on average across the province in the 
1976-2005 base period, which is projected to rise to 129 mm of rain (120 to 144 mm) by late century in the 
medium emissions scenario.  
 
Freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) are fluctuations between freezing and non-freezing temperatures that cause water 
to freeze (and expand) or melt (and contract). One indicator of FTCs is the annual number of days with daily 
maximum temperature above 0°C and daily minimum temperature below 0°C. In the medium emissions scenario, 
the number of annual freeze-thaw cycle events is expected to decline from 77 per year on average across the 
province in the 1976-2005 base period to an average of 68 (61 to 79) during the late century period.

When reporting climate variables in an emissions scenario, this report provides the median climate model projection value, 
followed by a range in parentheses bounded by the upper 90th and lower 10th percentile model projections from the ensemble

18 This is based on intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves, which are graphical representations of the probability that a 
given rainfall intensity will occur. IDF curves play an important role in water resources engineering to describe the 
magnitudes of extreme rainfall events (e.g., the 1-in-100-year event) and to assist in designing urban drainage systems.

Costing Climate Change Impacts to Public Infrastructure: Summary Report
Estimating the budgetary impacts of changing climate hazards on public infrastructure in Ontario 
These climate impacts will vary across the province as well as within regions. With the assistance of the CCCS, it 
was determined that providing climate change projections for 15 regions19 in Ontario would adequately account 
for the expected geographic variability of climate change in Ontario. As an example, Figure 3-5 shows the 
projected change in annual mean temperatures across the CIPI project’s regional breakdown. 
On average, Ontario is projected to warm faster than the global mean surface temperature, with Ontario’s north 
warming faster than its south.20 As all asset locations in the CIPI portfolio are known, public infrastructure in each 
region was paired with the relevant climate impacts of that region to produce the costing results in the next chapter. 
19 These regions were defined using Statistics Canada’s definition of economic regions, with the northeast and northwest 
regions each divided into three subregions due to their size and climate variability. 
20 See Figure 2-4 of the CIPI backgrounder for more details.

4 | Climate change will raise public 
infrastructure costs 
Maintaining Ontario’s public infrastructure portfolio in a 
stable climate would cost $26 billion per year 
Keeping public infrastructure in a state of good repair helps to maximize its benefits in the most cost-effective 
manner over time, and ensures these assets are operating in a condition that is considered acceptable from an 
engineering perspective. This requires annual spending on operations and maintenance (O&M) activities, as well 
as capital investments to intermittently rehabilitate assets or replace them at the end of their useful service lives. 
The capital investments and O&M spending required to maintain assets in a state of good repair are referred to 
as “infrastructure costs” throughout this report.  
 
If the climate remained stable at 1976-2005 average levels, when much of the province’s infrastructure was 
designed and built, maintaining the $708 billion portfolio of existing public infrastructure would require an 
average of $26.0 billion per year (in 2020 constant dollars) in infrastructure costs over the rest of the century. In 
the next section, this stable climate cost projection will be compared to projections that account for changing 
climate hazards, allowing the FAO to estimate the additional climate-related infrastructure costs. 
 
 
Ontario’s municipalities, which own almost three-quarters of this portfolio, would need to spend an average of 
$17.8 billion per year to maintain their assets in a state of good repair, while the Province would need to spend 
an average of $8.2 billion per year.

Costing Climate Change Impacts to Public Infrastructure: Summary Report 
Estimating the budgetary impacts of changing climate hazards on public infrastructure in Ontario 
 
Climate change will raise public infrastructure costs  
Extreme heat and extreme rainfall have already become more frequent and intense relative to the late 20th century 
when a large portion of the province’s infrastructure was designed and built, while freeze-thaw cycles have become 
less frequent. Taken together, these changes are accelerating asset deterioration, resulting in the need for higher 
capital investments for more frequent rehabilitations and earlier renewals. In addition, changing climate hazards 
also require more operations and maintenance (O&M) activities, resulting in higher O&M spending. Figure 4-2 
provides select examples of how these changing climate hazards will impact public infrastructure.23 
 
21 See the FAO’s provincial and municipal infrastructure reports for estimates of the infrastructure backlogs. 
22 For definitions and more information on the asset management framework used in the CIPI project, see the FAO’s CIPI 
backgrounder. For the engineering rationale and climate cost elasticities, see WSP’s engineering report.  
23 See Chapter 4 of CIPI Buildings, CIPI Transportation or CIPI Water for more examples of how these changing climate 
hazards will impact various asset types. See WSP’s engineering report for the full scope of engineering impacts considered. 
Infrastructure cost projections 
The infrastructure cost projections presented throughout this report only relate to the existing $708 billion 
portfolio (as of 2020). They do not include the cost of assets either currently under construction, planned 
for future construction or necessary to meet future infrastructure demand. Cost projections assume that the 
funding required to address infrastructure repair backlogs and maintain a state of good repair is spent as 
necessary. In practice, not all infrastructure is maintained in a state of good repair and infrastructure 
backlogs exist.21 To produce infrastructure cost projections for different climate scenarios, the FAO used a 
standard infrastructure deterioration model that was upgraded with “climate cost elasticities.” These climate 
cost relationships relate changes in climate variables to public infrastructure costs. WSP, FAO’s 
engineering consultant, provided these estimates. The full methodology is described in the WSP report and 
the CIPI backgrounder.22

erosion of porous materials, corrosion,

Extreme rainfall will increase erosion and 
washouts, while extreme heat will 
increase the risk of cracks forming 
through thermal weathering.

Costing Climate Change Impacts to Public Infrastructure: Summary Report
Estimating the budgetary impacts of changing climate hazards on public infrastructure in Ontario 
While in practice many climate change adaptation initiatives are under way, to explore the cost implications of 
not adapting public infrastructure to changing climate hazards, the FAO developed a no adaptation asset 
management strategy. This strategy assumes that public infrastructure is not adapted to withstand changing 
climate hazards. Instead, asset managers pay the costs of climate-related accelerated deterioration and more 
frequent operations and maintenance activities.  
Over the current decade (2022-2030), these climate-related impacts are projected to add an average of $2.6 
billion ($1.4 to $4.4 billion)24 per year to infrastructure costs. These climate-related costs would cumulate to $23 
billion ($12 to $40 billion) by 2030 in the absence of adaptation.  
In the medium emissions scenario, climate-related costs increase through the mid-century period (2031-2070)25 
as extreme rainfall and extreme heat become more frequent and intense. Costs plateau in the late-century 
period (2071-2100) as the severity of these climate hazards levels off (see Figure 3-4). 
The estimated climate-related costs only account for the direct costs to governments of maintaining 
infrastructure in a state of good repair. They do not account for the broader societal costs to households and 
businesses from climate change’s impact on public infrastructure.26 These broader climate-related costs are 
likely to be substantial but are beyond the scope of this analysis.  
24 For costing results, the point estimate represents the median climate model projection combined with the “most likely” 
climate vulnerability, followed by a range in parentheses showing the most and least costly outcomes of the medium 
emissions scenario (see Accounting for uncertainty).  
25 Infrastructure costs are projected to 2100 and averaged over three periods. The short term (2022-2030) shows how 
changing climate hazards are already impacting public infrastructure costs in the current decade. Mid-century (2031-2070) 
captures the period where projections for the relevant climate variables begin to diverge in the three global emissions 
scenarios. Late century (2071-2100) captures the period where projections for the relevant climate variables diverge 
significantly in the three global emissions scenarios. 
26 For example, if an extreme rainfall event washes out a section of highway, this analysis includes the capital investment and 
O&M costs required to bring the highway section back into a state of good repair but does not include the costs to 
households and businesses who lose access to the highway.

Costing Climate Change Impacts to Public Infrastructure: Summary Report
Estimating the budgetary impacts of changing climate hazards on public infrastructure in Ontario 
Accounting for uncertainty 
The FAO’s cost projections account for three key types of uncertainty: emissions uncertainty, climate model 
uncertainty and infrastructure vulnerability uncertainty. Emissions uncertainty reflects the uncertain future path of 
global emissions and is represented by the three emissions scenarios – low, medium and high (see Figure 3-2). For 
each global emissions scenario, different climate models project slightly different climate variable outcomes. This 
climate model uncertainty is represented by reporting the median (50th percentile) model projection, as well as 
the 10th and 90th percentile model projections of each emissions scenario. This produces nine climate scenarios. 
In addition, the impact of a given change in climate hazard on infrastructure costs is also uncertain. In the absence 
of adaptation, infrastructure vulnerability uncertainty will depend on the design standards, age, condition, 
location and maintenance practices of individual assets. For adaptation costs, this uncertainty reflects the 
engineering options available to address specific climate hazards. The FAO commissioned an engineering survey 
to assess these climate vulnerabilities, which produced a range of opinion from “optimistic” to “pessimistic,” as well 
as the “most likely” climate vulnerability.27 Incorporating these uncertainties into the nine climate scenarios 
produced 27 cost projections. 
This report focuses on climate cost 
projections for the medium emissions 
scenario, whose global mean 
temperature projections closely align 
with those in a United Nation’s (UN) 
emissions assessment from October 
2022.28 The UN report estimates that 
under the current policies of global 
governments, and assuming no 
further emissions reductions are 
enacted, the global mean temperature 
has a 66 per cent chance of 
increasing by between 1.9 to 3.3°C by 
2100 relative to the 1850-1900 pre-
industrial period. If global “net zero” 
ambitions are realized by 2050, the 
UN estimates that global warming has 
a 66 per cent chance of staying below 
1.7°C and 1.9°C by 2100.29 Both of 
these outcomes are almost fully 
bounded by the range of warming in 
the medium emissions scenario (see 
Figure 3-2). 
Throughout this report, costs are presented as point estimates, which reflect the median (50th percentile) climate 
model projection combined with the “most likely” asset vulnerabilities. This is followed by a parenthesis showing 
the range of possible cost projections for the medium emissions scenario given the climate model and 
infrastructure vulnerability uncertainties. This range is bounded by the lower 10th percentile climate model 
projection combined with the “optimistic” asset vulnerabilities (the least costly outcome), and the upper 90th 
percentile climate model projection combined with the “pessimistic” asset vulnerabilities (the costliest outcome). 
Global warming and the related climate cost outcomes could also occur outside of this range. These are presented 
selectively in this report as well as in the report’s Appendix.

Costing Climate Change Impacts to Public Infrastructure: Summary Report
Estimating the budgetary impacts of changing climate hazards on public infrastructure in Ontario 
Municipalities will bear most of the climate-related 
infrastructure costs  
In the absence of adaptation, municipal infrastructure costs would increase by an average of $3.3 billion ($1.7 to 
$6.0 billion) per year over the century, while provincial costs would be expected to increase by $0.8 billion ($0.3 
to $1.5 billion) per year. Municipalities bear most of the climate-related infrastructure costs estimated in the CIPI 
project in part because they own and manage over 70 per cent of the portfolio in scope (see Figure 3-1), and 
because their asset portfolio is also more susceptible30 to these changing climate hazards. 
Under the no adaptation strategy, the infrastructure costs of public buildings would increase by 8 per cent (4 to 
17 per cent). About 85 per cent of these additional climate-related costs are attributed to increased O&M 
activities, such as clearing of debris, inspections or increased HVAC use, while the remaining 15 per cent are 
due to capital investments associated with accelerated infrastructure deterioration, such as thermal expansion of 
the building envelope. The Province owns just over half of the public buildings in CIPI’s scope. 
Transportation infrastructure costs would increase by 17 per cent (9 to 29 per cent). About two-thirds of the 
additional climate-related costs are due to increased O&M activities, such as more crack sealing, road patching, 
or bridge and culvert inspections, with the remaining one-third due to more rapid deterioration, such as 
increased scour and bridge erosions or transit track buckling. Municipalities own more than four times the 
amount of provincial transportation infrastructure by value in CIPI’s scope. 
Linear storm and wastewater asset costs would increase by 37 per cent (19 to 69 per cent). The increased 
costs are almost entirely due to increases in O&M activities, such as more frequent and costly inspections, and 
preventive maintenance as more debris, sediment and vegetation are expected to enter storm and wastewater 
systems. These assets are owned exclusively by municipalities. 
30 This report measures the susceptibility of assets to changing climate hazards by the no adaptation strategy’s percentage 
increase in infrastructure costs above the stable climate base case.

Costing Climate Change Impacts to Public Infrastructure: Summary Report 
Estimating the budgetary impacts of changing climate hazards on public infrastructure in Ontario 
Public infrastructure costs could be much larger in the high 
emissions scenario 
This chapter focused on costing results in the medium emissions scenario, where global emissions peak in the 
2040s, and then decline rapidly thereafter. If global emissions follow the high emissions path, climate-related 
infrastructure costs in Ontario could be much larger. The range of potential cost increases in the higher emissions 
scenario is also much greater than the range of costs in the medium emissions scenario. Importantly, there is no 
likelihood attached to global emissions scenarios, or to the range of cost outcomes within each. 
 
 
The profile of climate-related infrastructure costs over the century also differs significantly between the emissions 
scenarios. In the short term, climate-related costs are similar. By mid-century, costs in each emissions scenario 
begin to diverge, in line with the change in relative severity of climate hazards. By late century, costs diverge 
significantly. For example, the climate costs in the high emissions scenario are more than four times higher than in 
the low emissions scenario, and more than twice those in the medium emissions scenario.

Ultimately, the extent of increase in the global mean surface temperature will have a direct impact on the costs to 
maintain Ontario’s public infrastructure. Across all climate scenarios, and in the absence of adaptation, the FAO 
estimates that public infrastructure costs will rise by approximately eight per cent (or roughly $2.0 billion per year) 
on average over the rest of the century for each degree Celsius increase in global mean surface temperatures 
beyond 0.5°C.

5 | Adaptation can lower climate 
related infrastructure costs 
Public infrastructure can be adapted to withstand more 
frequent and intense climate hazards 
The previous chapter outlined the climate-related costs to public infrastructure in the absence of adaptation 
actions. Adapting public infrastructure can help avoid the accelerated deterioration and increased O&M activities 
associated with more frequent and intense climate hazards. Adaptation can take many forms. Figure 5-1 
provides three examples.31 
 
 
 
 
 
31 See Chapter 5 of CIPI Buildings, CIPI Transportation or CIPI Water for more examples. See WSP’s engineering report for a 
detailed discussion of the adaptation options considered in the CIPI project.

Finishes on the exterior need to be 
more sustainable to withstand heat and

Roof drainage needs to be sized for 
future rainfall projections and 
sufficiently graded to limit ponding. 
Using a higher temperature grade asphalt 
binder can help reduce the risk of 
permanent deformation from extreme heat. 
 
Mitigative measures against warping / 
curling and blow-up due to slab expansion 
include shortening joint spacing and 
installing high-quality expansion joints. 
 
Specialized asphalt mixes and higher 
quality materials can mitigate drainage or 
erosion issues caused by extreme rainfall.

Costing Climate Change Impacts to Public Infrastructure: Summary Report 
Estimating the budgetary impacts of changing climate hazards on public infrastructure in Ontario 
To assess the cost impacts of adapting public infrastructure, the FAO developed two representative adaptation 
strategies, where the speed of adaptation differs in each strategy.  
• Proactive adaptation – asset managers adapt infrastructure either during an asset’s next major 
rehabilitation or upcoming renewal, whichever comes first. This strategy fully adapts the infrastructure 
portfolio by 2070.  
• Reactive adaptation – asset managers adapt infrastructure assets only when they are replaced at the end 
of their useful lives. This strategy results in a slower pace of adaptation compared to the proactive 
strategy. By the end of the century, just under 90 per cent of assets are adapted.  
Public infrastructure assets will continue to incur accelerated deterioration and require increased O&M activities 
from more frequent and intense climate hazards (as in the no adaptation strategy) until asset managers adapt 
their infrastructure. Once adapted, assets are assumed to be resilient to these climate hazards and avoid these 
climate-related infrastructure costs.  
Adaptation will increase the costs to maintain infrastructure 
If a proactive adaptation strategy is pursued, infrastructure costs would increase significantly in the short term, as 
substantial capital investments would be required to adapt almost half of the infrastructure portfolio by 2030. Over 
the 2022-2030 period, climate-related infrastructure costs under the proactive adaptation strategy average $7.9 billion 
($4.8 to $12.6 billion), cumulating to $71 billion ($44 to $113 billion) by 2030 in the medium emissions scenario. 
 
In the mid-century period, the pace of adaptation slows, resulting in an average of $4.2 billion ($2.6 to $6.9 
billion) per year in additional climate-related costs. By late century, all assets are adapted, and infrastructure 
costs fall slightly below the stable climate base case as fewer infrastructure renewals occur during this period 
relative to the stable climate base case.32 
 
 
32 To adapt certain types of infrastructure, the proactive strategy renews some assets earlier than they would otherwise have 
been if the climate were stable. These earlier renewals result in lower infrastructure costs in the late-century period compared 
to stable climate costs. However, the cost savings experienced in the late 21st century would be temporary, since assets 
replaced before the end of their useful life in this century will bring forward renewals in the 22nd century.

Proactive adaptation requires significant upfront spending 
 
Note: Uncertainty bands represent the range of cost outcomes in the medium emissions scenario. See Accounting for 
uncertainty. The proactive adaptation strategy assumes that infrastructure is adapted at the first available opportunity, and that the 
portfolio is fully adapted by 2070.

Estimating the budgetary impacts of changing climate hazards on public infrastructure in Ontario 
If a reactive adaptation strategy is pursued, infrastructure costs would also increase in the short term but at a 
slower pace than under the proactive adaptation strategy. Over the 2022-2030 period, climate-related 
infrastructure costs under the reactive adaptation strategy average $3.1 billion ($1.6 to $5.3 billion) per year, 
cumulating to $28 billion ($15 to $48 billion) by 2030 in the medium emissions scenario. 
 
In the mid-century period, as the pace of adaptation increases and extreme rainfall and heat become more 
frequent and intense, average climate-related costs increase to $4.4 billion ($2.0 to $8.1 billion) per year. By late 
century, as most assets are adapted, climate-related infrastructure costs average $2.4 billion ($1.5 to $4.5 billion) 
per year. 
 
 
Adaptation reduces the climate vulnerability of public 
infrastructure 
Adapting public infrastructure reduces its climate vulnerability and lowers the risk of infrastructure failure or loss 
of performance. The quicker assets are adapted, the greater the reduction of climate risk. Figure 5-4 shows the 
share of assets adapted (by CRV) over the projection under each of the asset management strategies.  
Figure 5-3 
Slower pace of adaptation under the reactive strategy results in a more gradual increase in costs  
Note: Uncertainty bands represent the range of cost outcomes in the medium emissions scenario. See Accounting for 
uncertainty. The reactive adaptation strategy assumes that infrastructure assets are adapted when they are replaced at the end of 
their useful lives, and that half the portfolio is adapted by 2070 and 90 per cent by 2100.

Costing Climate Change Impacts to Public Infrastructure: Summary Report
Estimating the budgetary impacts of changing climate hazards on public infrastructure in Ontario 
The proactive adaptation strategy sees 43 per cent of the portfolio adapted by 2030, 92 per cent by 2050 and 
100 per cent by 2070. This strategy most rapidly lowers the climate vulnerability of Ontario’s public 
infrastructure. The reactive adaptation strategy undertakes adaptation more slowly, has lower upfront spending 
than the proactive strategy, but leaves the majority of Ontario’s public infrastructure more vulnerable to climate 
risk though to the mid-2060s. Even by the end of the century, the reactive strategy leaves over 10 per cent of 
public infrastructure exposed to more frequent and intense climate hazards. The no adaptation strategy carries 
the highest climate risk since no assets are adapted over the projection. 
When public infrastructure suffers a loss of performance, or fails entirely, it can impose costs on households, 
businesses and the broader economy. For example, if extreme rainfall overwhelms stormwater infrastructure and 
the surrounding area floods, households and businesses may have to repair the flood damages. While these 
broader societal costs are likely to be substantial, they are not incorporated in the FAO’s costing analysis, which 
only includes the costs incurred to provincial and municipal infrastructure budgets.  
Adaptation strategies result in lower average annual 
infrastructure costs 
The financial impact of extreme rainfall, extreme heat and freeze-thaw cycles will be material to the Province and 
municipalities regardless of which asset management strategy is pursued. However, the FAO estimates that on a 
constant dollar basis, average annual climate-related costs are highest under the no adaptation strategy and 
lowest under the proactive adaptation strategy.  
Figure 5-5 compares the climate-related infrastructure costs of all three asset management strategies in the 
medium emissions scenario. The proactive adaptation strategy results in the smallest increase in average annual 
infrastructure costs over the century at $3.0 billion per year. These climate-related costs represent an 11 per 
cent increase in infrastructure costs above the stable climate base case and are $1.1 billion lower per year on 
average than the no adaptation strategy.

Costing Climate Change Impacts to Public Infrastructure: Summary Report
Estimating the budgetary impacts of changing climate hazards on public infrastructure in Ontario 
As the direct infrastructure costs to governments 
are included in each strategy but the societal 
costs of infrastructure service disruptions are 
not, these results reflect the impact on 
government budgets and should not be 
interpreted as a society-wide cost-benefit analysis. 
Across all climate scenarios, adaptation 
strategies are consistently less expensive over 
the century when compared with the no 
adaptation strategy, with the proactive strategy 
consistently the least expensive. Figure 5-6 
shows adaptation cost savings for the full range of 
potential global mean temperature increases. 
Each dot represents the average annual cost 
savings of adaptation relative to not adapting for 
a specific combination of climate scenario and 
asset vulnerability. 
Cost savings of adapting infrastructure are larger 
in higher temperature scenarios, due to the 
avoidance of infrastructure damage and higher 
O&M costs from more severe climate hazards. 
In the next chapter, the climate-related infrastructure costs are incorporated into the FAO’s long-term fiscal 
projections, which include the interest costs associated with borrowing to fund capital investments and higher 
climate-related operating expenses.

Costing Climate Change Impacts to Public Infrastructure: Summary Report
Estimating the budgetary impacts of changing climate hazards on public infrastructure in Ontario 
6 | Climate-related infrastructure costs 
will impact government budgets 
The long-term budget impact of climate-related 
infrastructure costs for the provincial portfolio 
To assess the impact of higher climate-related infrastructure costs on Ontario’s finances over the long term, the 
FAO focused on the effect that these climate-related infrastructure costs could have on two key metrics: the 
Province’s net debt-to-GDP ratio and the interest on debt-to-revenue ratio.  
•
Net debt as a share of GDP is an indicator of the government’s ability to service its debt obligations. A
significant and prolonged deterioration in this indicator over time could raise concerns about the
government’s ability to deliver on its budgetary responsibilities.
•
Interest on debt as a share of revenue is a measure of budgetary flexibility. Higher interest payments as a
share of revenue indicate that the government has a smaller share of revenue available to spend on key
programs such as health care or education.33
Focusing on the provincially owned portion of Ontario’s infrastructure portfolio, Figure 6-1 shows how climate-
related infrastructure costs would impact these two measures of provincial budgetary health. Overall, in the 
medium emissions scenario, the climate costs to provincial infrastructure are not likely to significantly impact the 
Province’s fiscal sustainability under any of the asset management strategies. 
Climate-related infrastructure costs result in higher spending, more borrowing and higher interest costs relative 
to the stable climate base case.34 These costs are projected to raise the Province’s net debt-to-GDP ratio by 2.8 
to 3.4 percentage points by the 2090s, and increase Ontario’s interest on debt-to-revenue ratio by between 0.6 
and 0.7 percentage points in the medium emissions scenario. For context, Ontario’s net debt rose from 10.4 per 
cent of GDP in 1981-82 to 38.3 per cent in 2022-23, an increase of 27.9 percentage points in 41 years, and 
Ontario’s debt-interest payments consumed 6.0 per cent of total revenue in 1981-82, which rose to 15.5 per cent 
of revenue in 1999-00 before declining to 6.4 per cent in 2022-23. 
33 For more information on fiscal sustainability see the FAO’s 2022 Long-Term Budget Outlook.  
34 This analysis is “all else equal.” Other impacts to economic and revenue growth could result from these adaptation 
strategies. For example, a more climate-resilient public infrastructure.

Costing Climate Change Impacts to Public Infrastructure: Summary Report
Estimating the budgetary impacts of changing climate hazards on public infrastructure in Ontario 
All asset management strategies have similar budgetary impacts by the 2090s. The fiscal impacts of the 
proactive adaptation strategy occur earlier since investments are made to adapt about 90 per cent of provincial 
public infrastructure by 2050, compared to 20 per cent under the reactive adaptation strategy (see Figure 5-4). 
Early investments under the proactive adaptation strategy would minimize the climate risk of provincial 
infrastructure service disruption and would consume an additional 20 cents of every $100 dollars in revenue in 
the 2050s relative to the reactive adaptation strategy. 
Higher global temperatures would increase the climate-related impact to provincial 
finances 
Greater increases in global mean temperatures result in more significant fiscal outcomes due to more frequent 
and extreme climate hazards and higher climate-related infrastructure costs, regardless of the asset 
management strategy undertaken. Figure 6-2 shows the impact to the Province’s net debt-to-GDP ratio of the 
no adaptation strategy in the low, medium and high emissions scenarios. In the absence of adaptation, the FAO 
estimates that Ontario’s net debt-to-GDP ratio would increase by 1.6 percentage points by the 2090s for every 
degree Celsius increase in global mean temperatures beyond 0.5ºC.

Costing Climate Change Impacts to Public Infrastructure: Summary Report 
Estimating the budgetary impacts of changing climate hazards on public infrastructure in Ontario 
 
Building new assets will increase the fiscal impact of these climate hazards 
The CIPI project focused on the impact of climate hazards on existing infrastructure. However, as the population 
grows, new public infrastructure assets will be built. These new assets will also be impacted by the changing 
climate, as will the costs to build and maintain them. If expansionary assets were incorporated into the FAO’s 
analysis, the climate-related costs to maintain infrastructure would increase, further raising the fiscal impacts 
shown above for all asset management strategies.  
 
The impact of climate-related infrastructure costs on 
municipalities is projected to be four times larger than for 
the Province 
Ontario’s 444 municipalities own 71 per cent of the portfolio of public infrastructure in the CIPI project’s scope. In 
addition, their portfolio includes all the linear storm and wastewater infrastructure, which is much more 
vulnerable to extreme rainfall than the other asset classes. As a result, Ontario’s municipalities are projected to 
incur about four times the climate-related infrastructure costs than the Province.  
 
In the medium emissions scenario, municipal climate-related infrastructure costs are projected to range between 
$2.4 billion to $3.3 billion per year on average over the century, depending on the asset management strategy. 
These costs are equivalent to between five per cent and seven per cent of total municipal spending in 2020, similar 
to the amount municipalities spent on social housing, general government, or health and emergency services.

Estimating the budgetary impacts of changing climate hazards on public infrastructure in Ontario 
The proactive adaptation strategy results in the lowest average infrastructure costs over the projection. In 
addition, the proactive adaptation strategy would minimize the climate risk of public infrastructure service 
disruption and failure relative to the other strategies. However, the proactive adaptation strategy would require 
significant upfront investment, worth about 14 per cent of current municipal spending over the current decade to 
adapt about 43 per cent of municipal infrastructure assets. These rapid investments would enable the municipal 
infrastructure portfolio to avoid the accelerated deterioration and higher O&M costs seen under the other 
strategies in later decades, particularly in the 2071-2100 period.

Costing Climate Change Impacts to Public Infrastructure: Summary Report
Estimating the budgetary impacts of changing climate hazards on public infrastructure in Ontario 
The impact of climate-related infrastructure costs for the 
combined provincial and municipal portfolios 
To gauge the full magnitude of the CIPI project’s climate cost estimates, the FAO projected the impact of both 
provincial and municipal climate-related infrastructure costs on the Province’s long-term fiscal position. While the 
Province is not legally required to fund municipal financial liabilities, the intent of this analysis is to illustrate the 
size of the combined budgetary liability.  
Figure 6-5 shows the fiscal impact of climate-related costs on the Province’s finances for the combined 
provincial and municipal portfolio in the medium emissions scenario. Given the much larger size of the combined 
infrastructure portfolio, the impacts are much larger than for the provincial portfolio alone.  
Climate costs for the combined infrastructure portfolio would raise the Province’s net debt-to-GDP ratio by 15.2 
to 16.7 percentage points by the 2090s, and increase Ontario’s interest on debt-to-revenue ratio by between 3.1 
and 3.4 percentage points, in the medium emissions scenario. 
All asset management strategies have similar budgetary impacts by the 2090s. The fiscal impacts of the 
proactive adaptation strategy occur earlier in the century since investments are made to adapt about 90 per cent 
of provincial and municipal public infrastructure by 2050, compared to 20 per cent under the reactive strategy 
(see Figure 5-4). Early investment under the proactive adaptation strategy would minimize the climate risk of the 
entire provincial and municipal infrastructure portfolio and would consume an additional $1.60 of every $100 
dollars in provincial revenue in the 2050s relative to the reactive adaptation strategy.

Costing Climate Change Impacts to Public Infrastructure: Summary Report 
Estimating the budgetary impacts of changing climate hazards on public infrastructure in Ontario 
7 | The Province’s climate risk 
assessment aligns with CIPI 
In August 2023, the government released its Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment (PCCIA). The purpose of 
the assessment was to “…help government and public and private institutions better understand where and how 
climate change is likely to affect communities, critical infrastructure, economies and the natural environment so we 
can make more informed decisions on planning and investments to keep our communities healthy and safe.”35 
 
The PCCIA examined numerous climate hazards, concluding that: “…extreme heat, extreme precipitation and 
seasonal temperature-related impacts are the drivers of highest risks across Ontario.”36 The PCCIA examined 
climate risks in five areas of focus, including infrastructure. On infrastructure, the PCCIA noted that:  
 
This impact assessment finds that all infrastructure across Ontario face climate risk. In fact, 
not a single asset included in this assessment is considered to have a risk less than ‘medium’ 
under current climate conditions. In many regions and for several … categories, the level of 
risk is expected to rise in the future…These results can be used as a foundation for informing 
adaptation efforts made to improve the resilience of infrastructure assets across Ontario...37 
 
Among the asset classes examined, the PCCIA found that under the high emissions scenario, public buildings 
and transportation infrastructure are currently at “medium risk” and will be at “high risk” by the 2050s in the 
absence of adaptation.38 Stormwater assets were found to be currently at “high risk.” The PCCIA did not include 
any cost analysis, either for the risks of not adapting or for any broad adaptation strategies. Table 7-1 compares 
the PCCIA’s risk impact results with CIPI’s cost impacts for the high emissions scenario.

cent of asset value, with infrastructure “…still operating in some capacity at its intended purposes but at a reduced level.” 
(page 137 of the Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment). Infrastructure assessed as “high risk” carries the 
potential consequence of asset damage between 40 and 60 per cent of asset value, with a shorter useful service life.

8 | The FAO’s climate costs are 
lower-bound estimates 
The FAO costed just one aspect of climate change’s broader 
impacts  
The CIPI project was designed to estimate the scale of the budgetary impact that changes in specific climate 
hazards could impose on public infrastructure costs at a portfolio level over the rest of the century. CIPI was not 
designed as a comprehensive examination of the impacts of climate change on all aspects of society in Ontario.  
 
Numerous recent reports have outlined how climate change is leading to increasingly costly and disruptive impacts. 
The Council of Canadian Academies identified 12 major areas of climate change risk for Canada, with the risk to 
infrastructure considered one of the most likely and consequential.39 Natural Resources Canada echoed this conclusion 
in a recent assessment.40 Figure 8-1 shows CIPI’s scope of analysis within the context of these major areas of risk.

Costing Climate Change Impacts to Public Infrastructure: Summary Report
Estimating the budgetary impacts of changing climate hazards on public infrastructure in Ontario 
CIPI’s results should be seen as lower-bound cost impacts 
Given CIPI’s limited scope, the cost impacts of climate change on the Province and Ontario’s municipalities are 
likely to be larger. There are many reasons that CIPI’s climate-related infrastructure cost projections are 
underestimated given the broader scope of climate change’s impacts to public infrastructure. 
CIPI examined a subset of public infrastructure in Ontario 
The CIPI project focused on public buildings, transportation, and linear storm and wastewater infrastructure 
owned by provincial and municipal governments (see Figure 3-1). While these assets make up the majority of 
Ontario’s public infrastructure portfolio, many public asset classes were excluded, including linear drinking water 
infrastructure, machinery and equipment, land, assets owned by the federal government, and assets owned by 
Indigenous communities. While changing climate hazards will impact these assets, they were excluded from the 
FAO’s analysis due to data availability, materiality and the FAO’s own resource constraints. 
CIPI analyzed only three climate hazards 
CIPI focused on the impacts of three climate hazards: extreme heat, extreme rainfall and freeze-thaw cycles (see 
Figure 3-3). Other climate hazards, including fluvial flooding, wildfires and permafrost melt (among others), will 
impact public infrastructure but were excluded from the analysis either due to data availability, a lack of 
confidence in forecasting certain climate hazards or cost materiality.  
CIPI excluded costs to households and businesses 
CIPI focused on the direct costs to government budgets of maintaining infrastructure in a state of good repair. 
However, climate change’s impact on unadapted public infrastructure will have broader societal costs that will 
impact households and businesses. These costs were beyond the CIPI project’s scope but are likely to be 
significant. As such, these costs are an area for further research that could greatly benefit the public interest. 
CIPI modelling assumptions, taken together, produced more conservative estimates 
CIPI’s modelling approach allowed for significant flexibility in evaluating the impact of climate change costs to 
public infrastructure, including the ability to model cost outcomes in different emissions scenarios, for different 
cost types (i.e., O&M, rehabilitation or renewal costs), and for various geographies. CIPI’s modelling approach 
also had numerous limitations that, taken together, produced conservative cost estimates. 
CIPI’s approach assessed the impact of each climate hazard independently and did not account for the 
significant interdependencies between public infrastructure. Extreme weather events often cause cascading 
infrastructure failures, such as storms that knock out power to sump pumps in public buildings, leading to 
significant damage from basement flooding. The inability to adequately model these interdependencies is one 
reason that CIPI’s climate costs (and those under the no adaptation strategy in particular) should be considered 
lower-bound estimates. 
CIPI assumed that all assets are kept in a state of good repair and that whatever capital investment or operating 
spending is needed is available and spent by the Province and Ontario’s municipalities. However, significant 
infrastructure backlogs exist, and assets in poorer condition may be more vulnerable to climate hazards, leading 
to higher climate-related costs to maintain infrastructure and higher broader societal climate-related costs. 
Lastly, CIPI used the most recent climate model projections available from Environment and Climate Change 
Canada at the time of the analysis. These projections, based on global climate models developed by modelling 
centres around the world, show a roughly linear path for global warming. They do not anticipate any potential 
climatic “tipping points,” or thresholds beyond which aspects of the climate system could reorganize and not 
return to their historical state. These tipping points could have dramatic impacts, including on the costs to 
maintain public infrastructure.

• The no adaptation strategy assumes that public infrastructure is not 
adapted to withstand changing climate hazards, and instead, asset 
managers pay the higher costs of maintaining assets in a state of 
good repair in the face of increasing climate hazards. 
• The proactive adaptation strategy assumes that infrastructure is 
adapted at the first available opportunity, and that the portfolio is fully 
adapted by 2070. 
• The reactive adaptation strategy assumes that infrastructure assets are 
adapted when replaced at the end of their useful lives, and that half of 
the portfolio is adapted by 2070.  
• The low emissions scenario assumes a major and immediate 
turnaround in global climate policies. 
• The medium emissions scenario assumes that global emissions peak 
in the 2040s, then decline rapidly thereafter. 
• The high emissions scenario assumes global emissions continue to 
grow at their historical pace for most of the century.

* Lower-bound estimates represent the 10th percentile climate model projection of each emissions scenario combined with optimistic 
infrastructure vulnerability. Median estimates represent the 50th percentile climate model projection of each emissions scenario assuming 
“most likely” infrastructure vulnerability. The upper-bound estimates represent the 90th percentile climate model projection of each 
emissions scenario combined with pessimistic infrastructure vulnerability. See Accounting for uncertainty for more information on the range 
of possible cost projections. 
** This is the increase in global mean surface temperature by 2100 relative to the pre-industrial era (1850-1900) in this climate scenario. 
*** A positive value represents an increase in the net debt-to-GDP ratio relative to the stable climate projection, while a negative value represents a 
decrease in the ratio. Net debt-to-GDP impacts are presented as decadal averages (e.g., 2020s is 2020-2029 average), although 2090s 
includes 2090-2100.

Definitions  
• The no adaptation strategy assumes that public infrastructure is not 
adapted to withstand changing climate hazards, and instead, asset 
managers pay the higher costs of maintaining assets in a state of 
good repair in the face of increasing climate hazards. 
• The proactive adaptation strategy assumes that infrastructure is 
adapted at the first available opportunity, and that the portfolio is fully 
adapted by 2070. 
• The reactive adaptation strategy assumes that infrastructure assets are 
adapted when replaced at the end of their useful lives, and that half of 
the portfolio is adapted by 2070.  
• The low emissions scenario assumes a major and immediate 
turnaround in global climate policies. 
• The medium emissions scenario assumes that global emissions peak 
in the 2040s, then decline rapidly thereafter. 
• The high emissions scenario assumes global emissions continue to 
grow at their historical pace for most of the century.
