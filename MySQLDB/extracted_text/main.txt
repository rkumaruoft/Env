Climate change has a broad range of health impacts and tackling climate change could be the greatest opportunity for 
improving global health this century. Yet conversations on climate change and health are often incomplete, giving 
little attention to structural discrimination and the need for racial justice. Racism kills, and climate change kills. 
Together, racism and climate change interact and have disproportionate effects on the lives of minoritised people both 
within countries and between the Global North and the Global South. This paper has three main aims. First, to survey 
the literature on the unequal health impacts of climate change due to racism, xenophobia, and discrimination through 
a scoping review. We found that racially minoritised groups, migrants, and Indigenous communities face a 
disproportionate burden of illness and mortality due to climate change in different contexts. Second, this paper aims 
to highlight inequalities in responsibility for climate change and the effects thereof. A geographical visualisation of 
responsibility for climate change and projected mortality and disease risk attributable to climate change per 
100 000 people in 2050 was conducted. These maps visualise the disproportionate burden of illness and mortality due 
to climate change faced by the Global South. Our third aim is to highlight the pathways through which climate 
change, discrimination, and health interact in most affected areas. Case studies, testimony, and policy analysis drawn 
from multidisciplinary perspectives are presented throughout the paper to elucidate these pathways. The health 
community must urgently examine and repair the structural discrimination that drives the unequal impacts of 
climate change to achieve rapid and equitable action.
Introduction
Climate change impacts the health of the planet and 
people; however, the impacts fall disproportionately on 
groups 
that 
are 
already 
disadvantaged. 
Racism, 
xenophobia, and discrimination are about division, 
control, and ultimately power, which are present in every 
society.1 Racism kills,2 and climate change kills.3 Racism, 
xenophobia, and discrimination interact with climate 
change to worsen existing harm to health and widen 
inequities for minoritised people both within and 
between 
the 
Global 
North 
and 
Global 
South4 
(ie, individuals and populations who are denied equitable 
access to resources, social standing, and power; see the 
appendix pp 2–5 for a glossary of terms). This interaction 
is facilitated through institutionalised discriminatory 
policies and experiences of systemic oppressions by 
individuals and communities.5 In this Health Policy, we 
explore how several different forms of structural 
discrimination (based on caste, skin colour, ethnicity, 
race, Indigeneity, migratory status, and religion) interact 
with climate change and health. These distinct but 
intersecting vectors of inequality often result in poor 
health and underlying them are similar systems of 
categorisation, minoritisation, and oppression.6 The 
COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the absence of 
global solidarity and willingness to redistribute resources 
to secure a safe route out of the pandemic. The same is 
true of climate change.
The most affected peoples and areas living in the 
Global South are often least responsible for climate 
change and yet bear its burden; but this also includes 
minoritised 
communities 
everywhere, 
such 
as 
Indigenous Peoples in the settler-colonial countries of 
the Global North (eg, the USA, Canada, and Australia).7 
The majority of the responsibility for excess emissions 
lies with the states, corporations, and ruling classes of 
the Global North, in a manner reminiscent of the 
damages inflicted on people, land, and biodiversity 
during industrialisation and colonisation. In 2022, the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change explicitly 
identified “historical and ongoing patterns of inequity 
such as colonialism” as a factor in vulnerability to climate 
change.8 Global North–South inequality in responsibility 
and impact are intrinsically linked to discriminatory 
social and structural processes produced during 
colonialism. 
These 
processes 
continue 
today—
eg, through the corporate destruction of land, excessive 
emissions, frequent exclusion of people from the 
Global South and Indigenous Peoples from international 
climate-related decision making, and placing the burden 
on minoritised people to develop less, slowly, or restrict 
their population to mitigate climate change.9,10
This Health Policy has three aims. The first is to show 
the unequal health impacts of climate change due to 
racism, xenophobia, and discrimination, achieved 
through a scoping review of the literature. The second is 
to highlight unequal responsibility for climate change 
historically between countries, achieved through a 
geographical visualisation of secondary data, comparing 
responsibility for and the health burden of climate change 
with maps. Although Global North–South analysis can 
illustrate inequalities in responsibility and health burden 
between colonised countries and their ex-colonisers, and 
discrimination at the global level, they obscure inequities 
within countries. We also cannot infer causal links 
between unequal responsibility and unequal health

burdens from solely Global North–South analysis. Thus, 
the third aim is to show the pathways through which 
climate change, health, and discrimination interact in the 
most affected areas across the world. These pathways are 
shown through case studies, testimonies, and policy 
analyses from multidisciplinary perspectives throughout 
the paper. This is a novel paper that presents the first 
academic review of literature on the interaction between 
climate change and discrimination leading to health 
inequalities, with quantitative geographical visualisations, 
qualitative case studies, and policy analysis to produce an 
encompassing analysis on this topic. We hope this can 
provide a robust platform for academics and practitioners 
to build discourse and justice-led action.
Definitions
We define discrimination as unequal access to resources, 
political representation, and social treatment on the basis 
of caste, ethnicity, Indigeneity, migratory status, race, 
religion, or skin colour, unless otherwise specified.6 
Further, per Crenshaw’s notion of intersectionality,11 
discrimination takes many forms and the lived experience 
of multiple forms of discrimination is greater than and 
distinct from the sum of each type of discrimination in 
isolation (see the appendix pp 2–4 for a glossary of 
terms). Above all, we stress that these categories assigned 
to people are socially constructed, born from colonial 
histories linked to ongoing separation and subjugation.
Other characteristics such as age, disability, gender, 
sexuality, and socioeconomic status (and the values 
placed on them) can exacerbate or mitigate experiences 
of discrimination, compounding the impact of climate 
change on health.12 Although this Health Policy focuses 
on the forms of discrimination specified previously, lived 
experiences are shaped by the relationship between 
overlapping systems of power and social categorisation.13 
We acknowledge the commonalities in the role of 
coloniality, separation, and division in giving rise to 
discrimination based on social categorisations.14 Gender, 
disability, and income overlapping with racism are 
explored in this paper to understand interactions between 
social stratifiers.
There is no single definition of climate justice. Defini­
tions range from Western conceptions (eg, Robinson’s 
human-centred definition for activist spaces that 
insists on a movement in solidarity with people and 
communities most affected and sharing the impacts of 
climate change fairly15) to Global South conceptions 
(eg, the 2002 Bali Principles that demand ecological unity 
of all species). The Bali Principles insist that “communities 
have the right to be free from climate change, its related 
impacts and other forms of ecological destruction”.16 We 
acknowledge both definitions. We also recognise that 
climate justice must grapple with notions of climate debt 
and coloniality caused by centuries of ongoing oppression, 
felt deeply by generations of minoritised people,17,18 and 
that populations already facing human rights violations 
also face the greatest human rights consequences of 
climate change.19 Environmental justice is also a relevant 
but distinct movement, which can largely be traced back 
to resistance to toxic waste dumping in poor, Black 
communities in the USA in the 1980s. This movement 
brought the civil rights, racial justice, and environ­
mentalism movements together.20
Methods
We used a multimethod approach to tackle our three 
central aims. The first section of the paper presents the 
findings of a scoping review on the health impacts of 
climate change, related to racism, xenophobia, and 
discrimination. The findings of the scoping review are 
presented according to the form of categorisation that 
they relate to. This section highlights health inequalities 
within countries.
The 
second 
section 
presents 
a 
geographical 
visualisation, highlighting inequalities in responsibility 
for climate change and the distribution of illness and 
Search strategy and selection criteria
This literature review addressed the question: how does 
climate change lead to health inequalities by race, ethnicity, 
caste, Indigeneity, religion, migratory status, or skin colour? 
We ran search terms (appendix p 11) through six databases: 
MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, Global Health, 
and GEOBASE, with no date restrictions on Dec 17, 2021. We 
restricted papers to availability in an English version. We also 
used subject headings related to the search terms in running 
the search, to ensure that no relevant literature was missed. 
The literature search returned 830 titles. The title and 
abstract of each paper were then independently screened 
against the inclusion criteria (appendix p 12) by two authors 
(TAD, CS, JB, MH, PdMS, RI, or SE) and any conflicts were 
resolved by a third author (SE or MH). Full-text screening was 
then done for 96 papers. Each paper was screened 
independently by two authors, and conflicts were resolved in 
discussion. 35 peer-reviewed articles met the inclusion 
criteria for this paper. All studies were published between 
2003 and 2021, and both qualitative (n=15) and 
quantitative (n=20) studies were included. The studies were 
from North America (USA=22; Canada=1), Australasia (n=4), 
Africa (n=3), Asia (n=2), Pacific islands (n=2), and 
South America (n=1). A PRISMA diagram and checklist can be 
found in the appendix (p 13). We extracted and charted data 
with the following headings: author, title, journal, year, 
country, location, population affected, life course stage, study 
type, aims, methods, climate indicator, health indicator, 
inequity indicator, outcome, limitations, and summary. We 
specifically sought data on climate, health, and inequity 
indicators (variables) as identified by the included sources. 
Definitions of all inequity indicators can be found in the 
glossary of terms.6 All data extraction was verified by a second 
author.

mortality burden due to climate change between 
countries. In this section, national responsibility for 
climate breakdown is defined according to the fair-share 
approach.21 The fair-share approach rests on the principle 
that all people are entitled to use an equal share of the 
atmosphere within the safe planetary boundary of 
350 parts per million concentration of carbon dioxide in 
the atmosphere.22 The maps visually represent the burden 
of illness and mortality attributable to climate change for 
climate-sensitive health outcomes in 2050.23 Indicators 
were chosen due to the availability of climate-related 
health data at the global level. Mortality and at-risk 
estimates were drawn from WHO,23 and population 
estimates from the UN World Population Prospects.24
The third aim of this paper is to show the pathways 
through which climate change, health, and discrimination 
interact. This is addressed throughout the paper with 
case studies, testimony, and policy analysis (presented in 
panels), as these methods are better suited than 
quantitative methods for analysing injustice in depth.25 
These panels draw on perspectives from health workers, 
activists, youth (people aged 15–24 years), climate 
educators, anthropologists, and economists, integrating 
insights from community engagement activities, publicly 
accessible video testimony, and diverse bodies of 
collective knowledge from climate justice movement 
spaces with peer-reviewed literature. The topic of each 
panel was collaboratively decided by the authors and 
each panel was written or reviewed (or both) by 
individuals with localised expertise. The panels highlight 
the complex nature of the interactions between climate 
change, discrimination, and health, supplementing the 
overarching analysis presented in the scoping review and 
geographical visualisation sections.
Climate change, health, and discrimination: 
a scoping review of the literature
This section identifies and analyses literature from a 
scoping review we conducted to identify the breadth of 
available evidence on the impact of climate change on 
health inequalities by race, ethnicity, caste, Indigeneity, 
religion, migratory status, and skin colour. The findings 
were limited to race, ethnicity, migratory status, and 
Indigeneity as no evidence was elicited in the search on 
caste, religion, or skin colour. Findings are summarised 
according to the form of categorisation that they relate to, 
with detailed findings in the appendix (pp 6–10).
Key themes from the scoping review are displayed in 
figure 1 with the use of Devakumar and colleagues’ 
conceptual model from The Lancet Series on racism, 
xenophobia, discrimination, and health.6 This conceptual 
model highlights that health inequities are determined by 
active processes that occur within power structures, affect 
different levels of society, and impact biology across the 
life course. In figure 1, layers of society from the structural 
to individual level are represented by the layers from the 
core to the surface of the earth, illustrating the numerous 
dimensions of the interaction between climate change, 
health, and discrimination at each level. Specific examples 
are included throughout figure 1 to highlight how these 
interactions manifest across contexts and from the 
structural to individual level. A fully referenced version of 
figure 1 can be found in the appendix (pp 17–18).
Race and ethnicity
17 studies from the USA and one from Canada addressed 
the relationship between climate change, health, and 
race or ethnicity (or both). Although the effects of race 
and ethnicity were searched separately, we summarise 
the findings together due to their overlap in the 
literature.
13 studies focused on heat exposure, heat sensitive 
illness, and mortality in the context of a warming climate. 
In the USA, census block groups (geographical units) 
with greater proportions of Black, Hispanic, and non-
White residents have been found to be hotter on average 
than block groups with higher proportions of White 
residents within the same cities.26,27 Areas with greater 
proportions of non-White residents also have heat-risk 
related land cover conditions (eg, little tree cover and high 
proportions of impervious surfaces), contributing to 
urban heat inequalities.28 Further, Black and Hispanic 
people are less likely to have air conditioning at home, 
after adjusting for household income, than White 
people.29,30 In contrast, a study in Canada found no 
correlation between area level temperatures and 
proportion of visible minorities in Montreal, potentially 
due to rapid gentrification and lower levels of segregation 
than in the USA.31 The continued legacy of redlining, a 
policy of systematic disinvestment in minority and low-
income neighbourhoods, could contribute to the 
inequitable distribution of heat exposure and heat-
sensitive illness in the USA. Land surface temperatures 
and hospital admissions for heat-sensitive illnesses were 
higher in areas of cities previously targeted by this racist 
policy than areas not targeted.32,33
Reflecting exposure patterns, heat-related asthma and 
acute myocardial infarctions are more common in Black 
and Hispanic people than White people in the USA.29,34,35 
Further, 
hospital 
admissions 
for 
asthma, 
and 
cardiorespiratory and non-injury mortality, are more 
temperature-dependent in Black and Hispanic people 
than White people.34–37 Climate-sensitive health risks can 
have intergenerational effects on racially minoritised 
families: Black women have a higher relative risk of 
preterm birth after exposure to heatwaves than White and 
Hispanic women, and exposure to extreme heat increases 
the risk of maternal hospitalisation more for Black women 
than White women.38,39
Beyond heat-sensitive morbidity and mortality, racially 
minoritised groups are also more vulnerable to the 
physical and mental health impacts of extreme weather 
events and less likely to have their health-care needs met. 
For example, following the 2017 Hurricane Harvey, Black

Texas residents were four times more likely to have high 
post-traumatic stress (scoring above 40 on the Post-
Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist–Specific).40 Racially 
and ethnically minoritised respondents were also more 
likely to report poor access to health care due to the 
hurricane than their White counterparts.40 Panel 1 
presents a case study from Brazil on the interaction 
between racism against Quilombola people, climate 
change and deforestation, and their health. The case 
study highlights the complex and cascading risks linking 
discrimination, climate change, and health, showing 
relevant pathways not captured by the scoping review 
findings presented previously.
Migratory status
Ten studies from the USA (n=3), New Zealand (n=2), 
Australia (n=1), Austria (n=1), Bangladesh (n=1), Fiji (n=1),

Individual health outcomes 
• Climate change increases food insecurity and undernutrition, including for Batwa 
Indigenous communities in Uganda
• Following Hurricane Harvey, Black Texas residents had a four times higher risk of 
post-traumatic stress disorder than White residents
• Racially minoritised individuals face a disproportionate burden of occupational 
health risks such as heat-related illness
Communities and spatial determination 
• Previously colonised countries are disproportionately located in the areas most 
aﬀected by climate change
• Within US cities, areas with greater proportions of Black, Hispanic, and Asian 
residents are hotter on average than areas with more White residents
• Rural–urban migrants in Dhaka (Bangladesh) are more likely to end up in areas of 
the city that are prone to ﬂooding than non-migrants
• In Pakistan, exposure to ﬂooding increased the proximity between people 
displaced to zoonotic and vector-borne diseases
Health systems 
• Previously colonised countries have less economic resources to adapt their health 
systems in response to climate change, contributing to a disproportionate 
burden of deaths in the Global South
• Without legal recognition or protection, climate refugees are excluded from 
accessing health systems in receiving countries
• Climate change is a cause of ill health, as seen in the tragic death of Ella Addo-Kissi 
Debrah
• Health systems must tackle the interwoven roots of discrimination that exist 
alongside their carbon emitting processes
Institutions and systems 
• The harmful health impacts of the fossil fuel industry aﬀect minoritised 
populations even before reaching the high emissions stage by polluting land 
and water (eg, the oil spills in the Niger Delta)
• Health institutions must support the dismantling of extractive industries that 
create health inequalities
Intersecting systems of oppression 
• Racially minoritised people with disabilities face unique challenges to disaster and 
extreme weather-related evacuation, exacerbating health inequalities
• Climate change compounds racialised and gendered health harms, including 
increasing prenatal hospitalisation and preterm birth in racially minoritised 
women
• Racially minoritised people are over-represented in low income groups who have 
limited ﬁnancial capacity to mitigate climate-related health risks, including access 
to air conditioning
Structural discrimination 
• Global capitalism has an extractive relationship with the Global South, shaping 
local inequalities especially for Indigenous and rural communities
• Settler-colonialism institutionalises manufactured diﬀerence, creating political, 
social, and economic implications for those in the margins (eg, the life expectancy 
gap between Aboriginal and White Australians that is exacerbated by climate 
change)
• Within a capitalist system, individuals and institutions are incentivised to project 
an image of tackling climate change or racial equity, which is tokenistic and 
performative

of migrants to environmental hazards related to climate 
change. In Bangladesh, poor rural-to-urban migrants 
often migrate to low elevation coastal zones, increasing 
their risk from coastal flooding.50,51 Internal migrants in 
Pakistan and Fiji face increased vulnerability to zoonotic 
diseases and non-communicable diseases due to dietary 
change, respectively.52–55 In the USA, non-citizens are 
more likely to live in previously redlined areas where land 
surface temperatures are higher; are over-represented in 
flood-zones; and face greater exposure to harms associated 
with wildfires due to precarious work conditions and poor 
accessibility of disaster risk information.32,56,57 In Australia, 
migrant families reported higher perceived risk of heat-
related health effects and decreased access to cooled 
public spaces.50 In addition to increased exposure to 
environmental hazards, people who have experienced 
international climate-induced migration face restricted 
access to health care, further increasing their vulnerability 
to climate-related health problems, highlighting the need 
for universal health care.50,52,53,58
Indigeneity
Eight studies discussed Indigenous communities in 
Uganda (n=3), the USA (n=2), Australia (n=1), Peru (n=1), 
and Tuvalu (n=1). Climate-related health concerns 
for Indigenous communities included malnutrition, 
malaria,59,60 negative reproductive health outcomes,61 
declining infant health,60 poor mental health,62 and 
respiratory distress.63 These outcomes were linked to 
colonialism’s role in marginalising Indigenous com­
munities, encroaching on land rights, and the impact 
that this has on their way of life.64,65
In Batwa (Uganda) and Shawi (Peru) communities, 
malnutrition was driven by unusually extended rainy and 
dry seasons that negatively affected their primary food 
sources and added financial hardships that shaped food 
insecurity.59,64 In Batwa communities, food insecurity was 
also linked to worse birth outcomes, such as smaller 
babies and a higher frequency of infant illness.60 In the 
same community, increased rainfall led to higher rates of 
malaria by increasing the amount of contaminated, 
stagnant water present in the community, whereas the 
dust of extended dry seasons led to respiratory problems.59 
In Houma Nation (USA), women observed an increase 
in reproductive health concerns including eclampsia, 
gynaecological cancers, and preterm birth.61 Sociopolitical 
exclusion and socioeconomic hardship amplified the 
health impacts of climate change faced by Indigenous 
communities. For example, land insecurity restricts 
Batwa communities’ socioeconomic mobility and low 
socioeconomic status restricts their access to household 
goods for infection prevention (eg, boiling contaminated 
water)59 and financial access to education.64
Intersecting systems of oppression
An intersectional approach is necessary to understand 
and respond to health inequalities resulting from 
interacting power structures.14 Two intersecting systems 
of oppression are addressed in the findings of our 
scoping review: gender and race; and income and race. 
None of the papers reviewed presented findings on age 
Panel 1: Justice for Quilombolas in Brazil
In Brazil, Quilombola communities, composed of descendants of enslaved African people 
with specific forms of communal social organisation, rely on the land and natural 
resources for their cultural, social, religious, ancestral, and economic reproduction. 
Under the Brazilian settler-colonial state, Quilombolas experience legal instability to their 
territorial rights, which (combined with poor access to health care, education, and other 
rights) reveals how historical disadvantages and institutional racism restricts the dignified 
survival of these populations.41 In several regions of the country, as in the Brazilian 
Amazon, land disputes of Quilombola and other traditional populations are intensified by 
mining and agribusiness. Brazil’s previous governmental response reinforces threats to 
traditional communities and the Amazon rainforest, with the reduction of law 
enforcement and increased amnesty for deforesters.42 From August, 2020, to July, 2021, 
13 235 km² were deforested in the Brazilian Amazon region.43 A study in the region has 
shown that increases in deforestation combined with the intensification of the dry season 
worsens carbon emissions, risk of fire, and ecosystem stress.44
In addition to contributing to climate change, deforestation drastically impacts 
Quilombola communities. Residents of the Médio Itacuruçá community located in 
Abaetetuba, a city in the Brazilian Amazon, have reported the effects of weather 
unpredictability leading to crop failures and reduced food production in family farming. 
Older residents also reported that extreme heat has shortened the length of working 
days. These situations are aggravated by other forms of discrimination that leave 
Quilombolas more economically vulnerable to the delay in planting and the smaller 
harvests, creating susceptibility to food insecurity; almost half of Quilombolas are highly 
food insecure.45 Climate change threatens food security in communities around the 
world.46 Negative health outcomes associated with food insecurity include anaemia, 
asthma, cognitive problems, aggression and anxiety, depression, and suicide among 
children and poor mental health, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and poor sleep 
among adults.47
The vulnerability of Quilombola communities to the health impacts of climate change 
is multidimensional, extending beyond the impacts of food insecurity while also 
aggravating it. Severe storms endanger housing of Quilombolas, as observed between 
December, 2021, and January, 2022, in several regions of Brazil. For example, in the state 
of Minas Gerais at least 72 communities across 20 municipalities were affected, leaving 
more than 7000 families in need of assistance, without food or water.48 The storms 
further hampered access to already marginalised communities, leaving populations 
without access to health care. Loss of biodiversity is a serious problem in the Amazon 
rainforest as it diminishes ecological niches occupied by predators of vector species and 
also creates new niches to alternative vectors, hosts, and pathogens. Moreover, 
deforestation and habitat loss are often accompanied by psychological aggressions 
(stress, malnutrition, and increased contact with pollutants), which can affect the 
immune system chronically and increase susceptibility to pathogens.49
Although protecting the environment is necessary for the existence of Quilombola 
communities, Quilombolas are also essential in ensuring the preservation of the 
environment and limiting the greenhouse effect. In Quilombola territories, nature is well 
conserved and highly valued, as their way of living centres around the rational and 
sustainable use of available natural resources. Therefore, assuring Quilombolas’ rights and 
facilitating community leadership before measures that could affect the territory are 
necessary to achieving both historical reparation to the Quilombola population and 
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

or sexuality. Visually, intersectionality is represented in 
Devakumar and colleagues’ model as an arrow cutting 
across various strata of society, representing how 
minoritisation and discrimination result from multiple 
systems of power operating within their own historical 
and structural contexts (figure 1).
Gender and race
Two studies focused on the environmental determinants 
of racial inequalities in maternal health; in addressing 
gendered health issues, they highlighted that women face 
additional climate-related health vulnerabilities and that 
racially minoritised women are doubly disadvan­taged.38,39 
However, none of the studies applied intersectionality to 
analyse the role of gender in shaping inequalities faced by 
minoritised people or addressed the health burden faced 
by people of other marginalised genders (ie, other than 
cisgender women). Nevertheless, there is a large body of 
work on gendered climate-related health inequalities.66,67 
Panel 2 shows the interaction between colonialism, 
gender, and health in the Philippines and Uganda through 
a comparative policy analysis.
Income and race
Income and race are two axes of oppression that closely 
interact.14 Many of the papers (n=16) addressing race and 
ethnicity in our scoping review also highlighted the 
importance of income in mediating climate-related racial 
health inequalities. For example, the literature highlighted 
the disproportionate burden of extreme heat and heat-
sensitive illnesses faced by people and areas with low-
income,27,31,34 their poor access to cooling facilities and 
resources, and their exclusion from green infrastructure 
initiatives,26,29,30 demonstrating structural racism.1,81 None 
of the studies examined how race or ethnicity intersect 
with 
socioeconomic 
status 
to 
compound 
health 
inequalities related to climate change. Further, the 
reviewed literature failed to highlight that poorer and 
marginalised people who experience the greatest impacts 
of climate change have contributed to it the least, as 
shown in a large body of work.82–84
Summary
Overall, the findings indicate an unequal distribution of 
the health impacts of climate change, disproportionately 
burdening racially and ethnically minoritised groups, 
migrants, and Indigenous Peoples. These findings are 
supported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change, which has highlighted that people who face 
social marginalisation due to ethnicity and Indigeneity 
are among those most vulnerable to the impacts of 
climate change.8 The numerous dimensions of the 
interaction between climate change, health, and 
discrimination at each level of society are presented 
through application of Devakumar and colleagues’ 
conceptual model in figure 1.6 The evidence is

Panel 2: Comparative policy analysis of gender mainstreaming in the climate–
agriculture–health policy nexus in the Philippines and Uganda
Gender mainstreaming has been integrated into climate policies in many countries, 
including the Philippines and Uganda, to address the health inequities faced by women 
agriculturalists due to a changing climate. Mainstreaming is a policy approach that 
integrates elements across distinct issue areas towards one policy agenda. Gender 
mainstreaming can redress structural inequalities that result from colonial legacies, 
including gender inequity. Such structural inequalities shape the uneven distribution of 
climate change’s impact on health, causing women and minoritised groups to be 
disproportionately affected.
Under Spanish, American, and British occupation, the Philippines and Uganda 
experienced colonial histories that continue to diminish the role of women in society 
compared with pre-colonial times. For instance, in pre-colonial Philippine society, women 
held leadership roles in spiritual and scientific affairs;68 in Uganda, the value system 
introduced by colonialism devalued the role of women in society by depicting their work 
as traditional and backwards.69 Colonial structures still shape how both Filipino and 
Ugandan women experience health, economic, and social deprivations.
The nexus of agriculture, climate change, and health exemplifies the lasting impacts of 
colonially driven gender inequity. Climate change will devastate the health of small scale 
and subsistence farmers, particularly through reducing food security and nutrition. 
In both the Philippines and Uganda, these health implications will be felt more acutely by 
women. In Uganda, women constitute 76% of the agricultural labour force70 and are 
disproportionately represented in subsistence-oriented farming of low-value crops. 
Women are less represented in the Philippine agricultural labour force, but consistently 
have lower wage rates and purchasing power relative to men.71 The marginalisation of 
women increases their vulnerability to climate change-related agricultural shocks 
including drought, flooding, and crop failures. Women additionally face unique climate 
impacts on maternal, reproductive, and sexual health.72,73 For instance, following the 
2013 Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, pregnant women were more vulnerable to 
undernutrition and miscarriage and adolescent girls to sexual-based violence.74
The Philippine Magna Carta for Women75 protects women affected by disasters and 
calamities, empowers women farmers, and ensures access to healthy food for women and 
girls. Further, the Climate Change Act76 of 2009 and the People’s Survival Fund Act77 of 2012 
both promote gender mainstreaming in climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction. 
Meanwhile, the Ugandan National Climate Change Act78 2021 includes valuable 
considerations of gender and food security, showing attention to the specific needs of 
women agriculturalists. Nevertheless, gender mainstreaming efforts have not substantially 
mitigated the risks faced by Filipino and Ugandan women. In Uganda, gender and food 
security are unsystematically integrated into climate and food security policies79 and in the 
Philippines, community-level implementation of climate disaster risk management policies 
are insufficient and devoid of gender considerations.80,69 Addressing the implementation 
challenges of gender mainstreaming is key to ensuring effective and sustainable policy 
responses. Although gender mainstreaming might be frequently advocated by international 
organisations, the design and implementation of such policies must consider the 
idiosyncrasies of local contexts (including colonial histories) and incorporate grassroots, 
community-led interventions. In addition to embedding gender mainstreaming in domestic 
climate policy, it must be integrated across other sectoral policy areas, given the climate’s 
overarching impact on society and government. Finally, gender mainstreaming must also 
incorporate a broader anti-colonial and anti-imperialist approach to address all forms of 
inequality—eg, racial discrimination, which oftentimes overlaps with gender inequality.

responsibility for climate change was not highlighted in 
the body of literature reviewed here, suggesting a gap in 
research linking unequal responsibility with health 
effects. Yet, inequities in responsibility and burden are 
visible within and between countries. Discussion of 
unequal responsibility alongside the health inequalities 
identified in this scoping review is essential to identifying 
and dismantling the power structures at the root of 
climate-related health inequities. As such, the next 
section of this paper analyses inequalities in responsibility 
and health impacts of climate change through presen­
tation of a geographical visualisation.

terminology is useful to the extent that it highlights the 
anthropogenic causes of the crisis; however, not all 
humans are equally responsible for the problem. 
Climate change is ultimately an effect of the economic 
system: capitalism, which seeks to cheapen labour and 
resource inputs, often through processes of extraction 
and exploitation, including through historical and 
ongoing processes of colonisation, dispossession, and 
coercion.85 Ideologies of race and other forms of 
categorisation have long been used to justify these 
processes (figure 1).86 Capitalist dynamics have produced 
severe global inequalities, with centres of wealth and 
capital accumulation characterised by high amounts of 
consumption and energy use, hindering the ability of 
some populations to meet their basic needs.
Centres of accumulation in the Global North are 
overwhelmingly responsible for greenhouse gas emissions 
that exceed the safe planetary boundary, whereas the 
Global South suffers the effects dispropor­tionately. With 
the fair-share approach, described in the methods section, 
it is possible to determine the extent to which nations have 
exceeded their fair share of the safe emissions budget and 
thus how much they have contributed to pushing global 
emissions beyond the safe planetary boundary. Cumulative 
emissions exceeded this level in the late 1980s, driving the 
crisis of climate breakdown that is evident today.
Assessing cumulative emissions over the period 
1850–2015, countries of the Global North, which represent 
14% of the world’s population, are responsible for 
92% of historical carbon dioxide emissions in excess of 
the safe planetary boundary.21 Most countries in the 
Global South (including large, populous countries like 
India, Indonesia, and Nigeria) are still well within their 
fair share of the planetary boundary (figure 2). This 
dynamic can be understood as a process of atmospheric 
colonisation.87 Just as land and territories have been 
colonised in the past, so too have the atmospheric 
commons been appropriated by wealthy countries for 
their own enrichment, through forms of industrialisation 
and growth that have relied on colonial patterns of 
appropriation, with devastating consequences for all life 
on Earth.88 In this way, climate change showcases 
colonialism as a historically rooted, yet ongoing structure, 
that governs and shapes our lives, “which are co-
constitutive of processes of capitalism, imperialism, and 
international development”.18 This visualisation shows 
not only where economic, social, and political dominance 
lies, but also which economies are more responsible for 
repairing damage.
Not all people in the Global North are responsible for 
excessive emissions, just as not everyone in the 
Global South is less responsible. Here, class inequalities 
prevail; wealthy individuals are disproportionately respon­
sible for excess emissions given their dispro­portionate 
influence over production and legislation, but also in 
terms of their personal consumption. The average carbon 
footprint of the top 1% of emitters is 75 times higher than 
the bottom 50% of emitters.84 Corporations bear a specific 
respon­sibility here, and have long exploited racial 
divisions—eg, through damaging the territories of 
minoritised groups, exemplified by the case study of 
Quilombolas. In all settings, groups who are minoritised 
experience the health impacts in their settings while 
consumption occurs in global centres of wealth.89,90
Health inequalities between countries
According to the Climate Vulnerability Monitor, of the 
estimated 400 000 deaths caused by climate change 
globally in 2010, 98% occurred within the Global South.91 
Figure 2 displays the unequal global burden of mortality 
attributable to climate change from heat-related mortality, 
undernutrition, and diarrhoea, and the population at risk 
of malaria in 2050. The data used in each map accounts 
for base case economic growth and an emissions scenario 
consistent with A1b (see appendix p 19 for descriptions of 
emissions scenarios).23 The responsibility for the climate 
breakdown map92 is based on overshoot emissions beyond 
the 350 parts per million planetary boundary.21
Geographically uneven patterns of climate-related 
health impacts are apparent, with risk of exposure to 
deadly heat and heat-related mortality93–96 and food 
insecurity97,98 concentrated in the Global South. Multi­
dimensional 
climate 
vulnerability, 
which 
assesses 
vulnerability indicators related to food, water, health, 
ecosystem services, human habitat, and infrastructure, is 
likewise higher in the Global South than the Global North.99
The vulnerability of Global South countries to climate 
change is due in part to the concentration of negative 
biophysical effects in tropical zones, but also to colonial 
histories and persistent structures, including trade 
liberalisation, predatory financing arrangements, and 
debt accrual by the International Monetary Fund and 
World Bank beginning in the 1980s.100,101 Countries 
affected by these measures often do not have the capacity 
to respond and adapt to climate-related health impacts, 
and benefits of adaptation will thus be concentrated in 
countries with the economic power necessary to invest in 
adaptive technologies and behaviours.94 Panel 3 is a case 
study from the Marshall Islands, a nation that still 
remains well within its fair share of the planetary 
boundary but is highly vulnerable to climate-related 
health inequalities driven by racial injustice.
Health inequalities within countries
Climate change and other human-induced environmental 
changes, such as loss of biodiversity and air pollution, 
disproportionately affect the health of minoritised people 
globally. Indigenous Peoples live in different contexts, 
affected by different histories, and according to different 
lifeways. Despite these differences, Indigenous Peoples 
around the world bear an extraordinary burden of the 
health threats of climate change.113 This burden is due to 
a legacy of colonial subjugation, responsible for 
catastrophic loss of life, loss of lands, and ethnocide.114 In 
Health Policy

efforts to recognise the scope of land dispossession and 
forced removals in the USA, an investigation found that 
Indigenous communities have experienced near total 
loss of historical coextensive territorial homelands 
(98·9%), an average forced removal from territorial 
homelands of 239 km, and contemporary lands that have 
more heat days (ie, days when the maximum temperature 
surpasses approximately 38·8°C), less precipitation, and 
decreased mineral value potential than historical lands.115
Indigenous Peoples are also minoritised through 
evictions with no compensation for their relocation,59 
subsequent financial burdens associated with housing 
insecurity and displacement,59,64 and isolation and stress 
stemming from a disrupted spiritual and cultural 
relationship with their land.62,65 Indigenous communities 
have been stewards of land and ecosystems, defending it 
against ongoing extraction from industry and managing 
an estimated 20–25% of the Earth’s land and 
80% of biodiversity, all while comprising only 5% of the 
world’s population.116
Discussion
Interaction between climate change, health, and 
discrimination
This is the first scoping review that has summarised 
current evidence on how structural discrimination 
interacts with climate change to cause profound damage 
to minoritised people’s health globally. The geographical 
visualisation has illustrated geopolitical inequities in 
responsibility for emissions: Global South countries (and 
minoritised people in any region) have contributed the 
least to the problem, yet experience the health impacts 
most acutely. Climate breakdown is being driven by 
processes of atmospheric colonisation and its conse­
quences unfold along colonial lines. The case studies and 
policy analysis have elucidated the relationship between 
climate change, health, and discrimination, manifesting 
through extractive behaviours of powerful industries, 
often facilitated by governments. For example, government 
subsidies for fossil fuels exceed national health spending 
in some countries and totals US$400 billion globally.3 
Applying racial justice to climate change and health 
reveals opportunities for the health community to redress 
unequal power dynamics between minoritised com­
munities and the geopolitical and commercial factions 
that dominate the world economy and directly affect 
health. Racial justice necessitates repairing the harm 
through equitable distribution of the costs of adverse 
effects of climate change and resources to address climate 
change.
Our analysis of climate-related health inequities, and 
the parameters defining evidence-based solutions, are 
shaped by a research lens informed by data, policies, and 
practices produced by systems of colonialism and 
discrimination. For example, our understanding of 
climate change, health, and discrimination is limited by 
the concentration of studies on racial and ethnic health 
Panel 3: Climate, health, and racial apathy in the Marshall Islands
Despite being well within their fair share of the planetary boundary and facing 
geographical isolation from the financial benefits of a fossil fuel-driven global economy, 
large ocean states are uniquely vulnerable to climate change.102 The Marshall Islands is 
among the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world due to the risks associated 
with sea level rise, given its low altitude (averaging less than 2 metres above sea level), 
densely populated coastlines, and concentration of more than 95% of its infrastructure in 
the Low Elevation Coastal Zone.8,103 Under a high emissions scenario, the Marshall Islands 
is projected to have annual wave-driven flooding over its entire surface by 2060–2070.104 
For this atoll nation, climate change is a current reality already affecting the Marshallese 
and the survival of their nation.
Marshall Islands faces a triple burden of disease: communicable disease, 
non-communicable diseases, and the health impacts of climate change.8,105 High-priority, 
climate-sensitive health risks in the Marshall Islands span insufficient food and water; 
vector-borne, non-communicable, and respiratory diseases; mental health stress; and 
extreme weather events.106 The health impacts of extreme weather events alone have the 
potential to be widespread and devastating, resulting in reduced drinking water and food 
availability, increased communicable diseases, and diminished mental health and 
wellbeing.8,107 Despite relevant evidence showing the health risks associated with climate 
effects in the Marshall Islands, crucial gaps in research and evidence exist. Very little 
research has been conducted within the Marshall Islands, or the Pacific Islands more 
broadly.105,108 As a result, there are no granular data on the health impacts of climate 
change experienced by minoritised people in the Marshall Islands, mirroring global 
epistemic injustice in this area. Research must identify climate-attributable changes to 
health indicators over time; no data of this nature currently exist for the Marshall Islands 
and are limited across the Pacific Islands.105 Research in these areas is crucial for guiding 
climate action and health policy.
Adaptation is also essential to addressing the health impacts of climate change. However, 
Marshallese adaptive capacity has been diminished by colonialism, creating an economy 
of dependency and limiting Marshallese sovereignty over adaptative planning due to 
power differentials.109 From the beginning of the 19th century, the Marshall Islands passed 
under colonial rule of Spain, Germany, Japan, and finally the USA. While under American 
occupation, the Marshall Islands additionally faced nuclear colonisation: the USA tested 
more than 65 nuclear weapons on the Bikini and Enewetak atolls, contaminating water 
and soil with long lasting implications for food access, forcibly displacing Indigenous 
communities and rendering 20% of the Marshall Islands uninhabitable.107,110,111 Racism was 
central to the justification of such violence.6 This same racist logic has facilitated 
atmospheric colonisation,21 causing the Marshall Islands to now face the existential threat 
posed by climate change. Prominent Marshallese climate activist and poet 
Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner has powerfully drawn this parallel between nuclear testing and climate 
change: “We’re seen as disposable in both situations. We’re disposable. Our lives don’t 
matter, the war matters, nuclear bombs matter. Our lives don’t matter, oil matters, 
money matters, gas matters, profits matter.”112
In the face of climate change and an apathetic global system, the Marshallese are not 
passive. They are spearheading global action on climate change through the Climate 
Vulnerable Forum and the High Ambition Coalition. As articulated by the Paris Agreement 
and Glasgow Pact, staying within 1·5°C of warming (which would still result in some 
damage) is paramount to the survival of the Marshall Islands and Large ocean states and 
require drastic emissions reduction. As the Marshallese are fighting for survival, the rich 
nations of the world, including Marshall Islands’ former colonisers, must take 
responsibility for their actions by repairing past and ongoing harm.

inequalities in North America, enacting epistemic injus­
tice through both hypervisibility of some characteristics 
and erasure of those not accounted for. Geographical 
inequalities between countries are better documented 
due to greater data availability and policy attention.
Colonial legacies of profit and power are ever present 
today. As shown in the case studies and geographical 
visualisation, reliance on oil, gas, and other extractive 
industries that drive excessive emissions is a matter of 
life and death for minoritised people. Although 
millions of people in Europe face fuel poverty and 
residents in the Niger Delta are poisoned by oil spills, the 
companies responsible report soaring profits.117 Health 
institutions’ investment in fossil companies continues 
despite overwhelming evidence that such companies are 
actively blocking climate justice and harming the health 
of minoritised people. A fair and just transition to 
renewable energy to meet the 1·5°C climate target 
requires transdisciplinary solidarity between movements 
fighting colonialism, racism, and health inequities.
Relational Indigenous lifeways and health
Indigenous communities continue to contend with the 
ontological and epistemic assault of colonialism on 
Indigenous lifeways, cultures, languages, and spirituality, 
resulting in a profound cultural discontinuity that 
challenges the capacity to engage Indigenous Traditional 
Ecological Knowledges towards adaptation or mitigation 
efforts (or both).118–120 Meanwhile, the interdependence 
and kinship shared between local ecosystems, sacred 
places, and Indigenous Traditional Ecological Know­
ledges are persistently threatened by climate change, 
undermining community health.
Unequal health outcomes highlighted by existing 
evidence in the scoping review are perpetuated by political 
exclusion and under-representation of minoritised voices 
from decision-making spaces. Indigenous communities 
are continuously excluded from policy-making pro­
cesses,60,64 an enactment of colonial violence,64 and have 
few protections against intrusive developments by fossil 
fuel companies.61 Despite increasing recognition of 
Traditional Knowledges in climate adaptation and 
mitigation plans, these have been symbolic rather than 
applied practically on a global scale.121 Non-tokenistic 
representation of Indigenous voices in decision-making 
spaces is an important solution to alleviating these health 
inequalities, but is severely scarce.60,64
In efforts to mitigate the intersecting and persistent 
threats of settler-colonialism, white supremacy, and 
structural discrimination, Indigenous communities have 
spearheaded movements to decolonise the Anthropocene 
across multiple sectors, namely public health policy, land 
rights, maternal and child health, and environmental 
health policy.122 Planetary health recognises the need to 
pursue mechanisms that confront the enduring impacts 
of structural discrimination while advancing the often-
cited adaptive capacity of Indigenous Knowledge systems, 
and appropriately resourcing movements to decolonise 
and reclaim Indigenous cultures, lifeways, and traditional 
practices.121 Ultimately, allies and global health movements 
must recognise the crucial relationship and kinship of 
Indigenous communities with local ecosystems and 
associated ecological knowledge systems as a solution to 
climate change and representative of model sustainability 
practices.
Reparative justice and human rights legal interventions
The evidence in this Health Policy shows the unequal 
distribution of responsibility for damage between 
countries, whereby the Global North is disproportionately 
responsible for damage and the Global South is least 
responsible. The Global North nations have colonised the 
atmospheric commons for their own enrichment through 
forms of industrialisation and growth that have relied on 
colonial patterns of appropriation.88 Across all countries, 
responsibility lies primarily with the affluent and ruling 
classes, due to their high levels of emissions83 and 
disproportionate control over energy systems and national 
legislation. In many settings, extraction lies more with 
corporations with substantial economic influence.89 
Alternative economic paradigms such as degrowth, 
wellbeing economy, and doughnut economics—all rooted 
in ecological economics—offer opportunities to make the 
transition to an economic system that is designed to 
promote human and planetary health from the outset, 
rather than one where social and environmental damage 
must be constantly corrected afterwards.123
In light of the evidence discussed here, there is a clear 
health case for supporting climate reparations.124 Those 
countries, companies, and ruling classes who are most 
responsible both historically and currently should pay 
monetarily to the most affected peoples and areas and 
repair harm holistically.125 The health community must 
not only lobby to ensure that loss and damage funds are 
rapidly implemented, it must also demand more to heal 
and repair harm, grounded in principles of reparative 
justice.126 Reparative justice can take many forms: debt 
cancellation; 
giving 
land 
back 
to 
communities; 
unconditional grants; a Global Climate Stabilisation Fund 
according to responsibility; divestment from extractive 
industries; and transfer of technology, wealth, and 
resources.127 Scholars urge that reparations involve not 
only addressing past harm but a transformative 
worldbuilding project for ecological futures.125
As discriminatory policies are enabled by our current 
political and legal landscapes, a legal approach that 
employs human rights frameworks can provide grounds 
for the structural change that is necessary to address the 
deep health inequities outlined throughout this Health 
Policy. International human rights legal interventions can 
be a tool for challenging racist and discriminatory policies, 
through setting shared visions and com­mitments around 
the human right to health and enshrining mechanisms 
for public and private actors to be held accountable for 
Health Policy

violating equality frameworks.128 For example, health 
organisations can support the increasingly popular 
method of litigation against the fossil fuel industry to stop 
racist and discriminatory practices deployed by the 
industry to harm the health of minoritised groups. When 
international judicial systems fail communities, initiatives 
such as the People’s Health Tribunal provides space for 
testimonies from the front lines of climate violence caused 
by extractive industry giants based in the Global North.129 
This initiative is an example of the health community in 
the Global North practising solidarity-driven work with 
communities across the African continent and diaspora.
Strengths and limitations
A key strength of this paper lies in its multiple methods, 
employing a scoping review, geographical visualisations, 
case studies from most affected peoples and com­
munities, testimonies, and policy analysis. The 
geographical visualisation draws together a robust body 
of literature, visually complemented by original maps. 
These maps are the first to present unequal 
responsibility for climate change and health outcomes 
in this way. The inclusion of case studies and policy 
analysis sheds light on the complex pathways through 
which unequal responsibility leads to unequal impact, 
exacerbated by discrimination. Through these methods, 
we respond to calls for consideration of the multiple 
injustices and their health implications in climate and 
health.130
We encountered several methodological challenges 
highlighting the difficulty of analysing injustice with 
existing climate and health indicators.25 The literature 
represents scholarship on the unequal health impacts of 
climate change, a topic that is grossly underexamined 
due to the skewing of global research efforts towards the 
health needs of high-income countries. Additionally, 
focusing on papers written in English narrows the reach 
of our analysis and excludes non-English-speaking 
research communities. Further, the search strategy was 
limited to describing health inequities due to climate 
change but not the effects of drivers of climate change, 
such as consumerism and extractivism, or more broadly 
conceived health effects, such as wellbeing and social 
health. The scoping review did not capture the 
complexity of pathways linking climate change, 
discrimination, and health impacts, especially when 
either climate change or health were not explicitly 
discussed.
For the geographical visualisation, the availability of 
data for map creation were limited overall, as existing 
data initiatives do not capture information on variables 
that reflect different forms of discrimination and as a 
result are not presented in a granular and disaggregated 
manner to allow a more complete examination of climate, 
health, and discrimination. Different forms of inequality 
and discrimination could not be captured beyond the 
traditional geographical or economic and income 
inequalities. As such, the maps represent only regional-
level inequalities. Further, existing data are probably an 
under-estimation as they only cover a select number of 
climate-related causes of death and do not include the 
health impacts of economic damage, major heat waves, 
river flooding, water scarcity, or conflict.
Towards just futures
We conclude that a holistic approach to climate change 
and health requires not only addressing the web of social, 
commercial, and political determinants of health (eg, the 
built environment, education, and income) but going 
one step further into the oppressive structures that 
underpin all these conditions. Colleagues must strive to 
incorporate anti-racism, anti-xenophobia, and anti-
discrimination in their work, centring voices of the most 
affected peoples and communities resisting the root causes 
of the health inequalities. As such, we have set out guiding 
principles to approach research and action at this 
intersection of climate change, health, and discrimination, 
at differing levels of society.
We invite scholars to pursue research that interrogates 
and repairs structural discrimination. The nexus of 
climate change, health, and discrimination offers a wealth 
of opportunities to engage with research that is justice-
driven, has hyperlocal to international reper­cussions, and 
harnesses the potential in inter­disciplinary collaborations

to create policies and practices for equitable health 
outcomes and flourishing ecosystems. We present a non-
exhaustive list of research priorities (figure 3). For 
example, we highlight the possibility for transformative 
mixed methods to address structural issues, including 
racism and inequity. Study designs that use participatory 
action research and restorative practices have been shown 
to be effective in flattening hierarchies when conducting 
research with minoritised populations, legitimising and 
contextualising perspectives, and promoting critical 
conscious­ness. Hegemonic research involving ran­dom­
ised controlled trials and epidemio­logical methods need 
valid critique over their appropriateness in this complex 
research context. Publications from a diversity of 
epistemologies and onto­logies using alternative methods 
carry the opportunity for producing emancipatory 
research outcomes.131
We urge the health community, including everyone 
whose work affects health, to engage in the principles set 
out here (panel 4), based on Abubakar and colleagues’128 
six principles for confronting the impact of discrimination 
on health from The Lancet Series on racism, xenophobia, 
discrimination, and health. Our values were developed 
from the findings of this paper and the expertise of the 
authors (see appendix p 20 for the process of developing 
the principles). We urge the health community to tackle 
root causes of historical and ongoing harm and trauma 
brought about when climate change interacts with 
structural discrimination.

Panel 4: Principles to guide research and action on climate 
change, health, and racial justice
The health community can offer skills, solidarity, research, and 
organising power and be a strong voice for justice. The health 
community’s role in dismantling power structures to achieve 
health equity should be embraced at each level of society, 
aligned with Devakumar and colleagues’6 conceptual model 
from The Lancet Series on racism, xenophobia, discrimination, 
and health—ie, the individual, community, institutional, 
health system, and structural level (figure 1). In taking up 
these values, we urge the health community to be mindful of 
context and to be guided by communities taking action.
Individual
•	
Centre the voices and solutions of the most affected 
people and areas in policy, education, advocacy, and 
action to practise a decolonial approach
•	
Accountability for measures of success in policy and 
action should lie with the most affected people and areas
Communities
•	
Global North communities must practise allyship by 
creating space for Global South voices in decision making 
through non-tokenistic means
•	
Diverse forms of knowledge, including Indigenous 
Knowledges, should be embraced during decision making
Institutions and health systems
•	
Education institutions should raise critical consciousness 
about power imbalances and discrimination related to 
climate and health
•	
Unequal responsibility of powerful countries, institutions, 
systems, and industries must inform actions
•	
Health institutions must support the dismantling of 
extractive industries that sustain health inequities
•	
Develop and implement policies that take human rights-
based approaches to health
Structural
•	
Support initiatives that foster healing and repair, 
including calls for reparations
•	
Take a solidarity-driven approach, bringing intersecting 
issues together such as gender and racial justice
•	
Take climate justice as the starting point for action, 
not an afterthought
