Background: Fossil fuel combustion and climate change are endangering respiratory health. As these threats
increase, healthcare delivery systems must adapt and build resilience. In this scoping review, we aim to
assess the current landscape of respiratory care impacts from climate change, identifying priorities for future
study.
Methods: We performed a scoping review of scientiﬁc and gray literature, and selected institutional websites,
to understand the impacts of climate change on respiratory healthcare.
Results: Medline, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Lens.org, and Google Scholar were searched from data-
base inception through 28 July 2023. The initial search yielded 1207 unique articles. Of the 67 articles identi-
ﬁed as relevant to the impacts of climate change on respiratory care, 50 (74.6 %) had been published
between 2020 and 2023. The most studied climate change and severe weather exposures were extreme heat
(n = 31, 46.3 %), particulate matter not from wildﬁres (n = 22, 32.8 %), and wildﬁres (n = 19, 28.4 %). Respira-
tory-related hospital admissions (n = 33, 49.3 %) and emergency department visits (n = 24, 35.8 %) were the
most common study outcomes. Few studies identiﬁed potential impacts on telehealth services, facility
energy distribution, and pharmaceutical supplies.
Discussion: Climate change is projected to increase respiratory-related emergency department visits and hos-
pital admissions. Limited research is available on current and projected economic costs, infrastructure effects,
and supply chain impacts. While climate change and extreme weather are increasing strain on respiratory
care systems, additional work is needed to develop evidence-based strategies for climate adaptation.

Introduction
Climate change has wide-ranging, deleterious effects on respira-
tory health. The combustion of fossil fuels results in direct health
impacts through the release of ﬁne particulate matter and other
respiratory disease-promoting factors [1]. Fossil fuel pollution exerts
further stress on the human respiratory system by driving anthropo-
genic climate change. Extreme weather events, made more common
in a warming world, including prolonged and intense heat waves [2],
expansive droughts [3], profuse wildﬁres [4], and earlier and more
intense allergy seasons [5], endanger the lung health of adults and
children. These threats are of particular concern for populations
already shown to be most vulnerable to the effects of climate change,
including children [6], pregnant people [6], the elderly [7], patients
with pre-existing lung disease [8], and those who have experienced
the consequences of historic economic and/or systemic injustices [9].
While the public health impacts of air pollution (e.g., ﬁne particu-
late matter) and extreme climate change-exacerbated events (e.g.,
wildﬁres) on respiratory health and mortality have been extensively
studied and reviewed [1,10−12], the effects of climate change on
respiratory healthcare delivery have not. To adequately respond to
the climate crisis, patients, providers, and health systems must
develop evidence-based solutions to reduce respiratory-related mor-
bidity and mortality. Healthcare systems frequently provide the last

line of defense for climate-related health emergencies, offering ref-
uge to patients suffering the acute effects of poor air quality, severe
heat, ﬂooding, and other extreme weather events. It is therefore
important to understand how care providers have experienced cli-
mate change, how they are adapting, and what innovations are wor-
thy of further study and investment to protect respiratory health in a
changing world.
Methods
Aims and research questions
This scoping review aims to understand how respiratory care sys-
tems worldwide experience the effects of climate change and
extreme weather by answering the following research questions:
 What are the key respiratory care delivery outcomes related to cli-
mate change, and how are these impacts measured?
 What evidence exists to improve climate adaptation and infra-
structure “hardening” (i.e., building resilience to extreme weather
and other natural disasters)?
 Where are the greatest gaps in the literature, and which popula-
tions or geographical locations demand urgent attention and
future investigation?
Study protocol and search strategy
An experienced health sciences librarian (C.S.) generated search
terms based on six sentinel articles [13−18]. Reference tracking was
performed in Scopus. The original search strategies were developed
in PubMed and translated as appropriate to the other databases using
the Systematic Review Accelerator Polyglot tool [19]:
((lung neoplasms[mh] OR "lung cancer*"[tw]) OR "pulmonary dis-
ease, chronic obstructive"[mh] OR "pulmonary disease*"[tw] OR
"respiratory
disease*"[tw]
OR
"asthma"[tw])
AND
("climate
change"[mh] OR "climate change"[tw] OR extreme weather[mh] OR
"extreme weather"[tw] OR "global warming"[tw]) AND (health care
[tw] OR "health care"[tw] OR delivery of healthcare[mh] OR "Patient
Care Management"[mh] OR mitigation[tw] OR attitude to health[mh]
OR awareness[mh] OR awareness[tw] OR education[mh] OR educa-
tion[tw] OR "percep*"[tw] OR polic*[tw] OR knowledg*[tw])
A systematic search of MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE (Embase.
com), Scopus (Elsevier), and Cochrane Library - CENTRAL, was con-
ducted from the time of inception of each database to identify articles
addressing the impact of climate change on respiratory care. Gray lit-
erature was identiﬁed by searching Google Scholar @ UM (the ﬁrst
200 results were selected and screened), Lens.org, and selected insti-
tutional websites (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
World Health Organization (WHO), and The Lancet) were searched
manually [20]. Findings are reported according to the PRISMA Exten-
sion for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR): Checklist and Explanation
[21].
All searches were completed by 23 August 2023. Citations were
imported into EndNote 21 (Thomson Reuters, New York, NY) for
deduplication (with the exception of records from Lens, which were
directly imported into Covidence), then exported into Covidence [22]
for further deduplication and analysis.

tary Appendix A.1.
Eligibility criteria
Peer-reviewed
quantitative,
qualitative,
and
mixed-methods
studies, as well as reviews published from database inception
through 28 July 2023 were considered for inclusion. Articles in
English, French, and Russian were eligible for inclusion (languages
selected based upon the native ﬂuency of the author group). The
included articles were required to address the effects of climate
change or extreme weather on respiratory care. Respiratory care was
broadly deﬁned to include (1) hospital care, (2) emergency depart-
ment (ED), or (3) ambulatory clinic care for respiratory illness; (4)
respiratory medication procurement or supply chain delivery of
durable medical equipment; (5) telehealth; and (6) any other aspect
of healthcare delivery that could be viewed as relevant to patients
with respiratory disease (e.g., pulmonary function testing, pulmonary
rehabilitation, insurance coverage, cost, and quality and safety meas-
ures) [23].
Articles were excluded that did not investigate a climate change-
driven event or extreme weather exposure or if there were no perti-
nent respiratory care outcomes. Commentaries, editorials, case
reports, and opinion pieces were also excluded.
Data extraction and analysis
A single reviewer (A.S.R.) completed a title and abstract review to
identify relevant literature. Two authors (J.R.L. and A.S.R.) then com-
pleted a full-text review. When there was a discrepancy in adjudica-
tion, a conversation was initiated between authors to determine
eligibility, and in every instance, consensus was achieved for ﬁnal
inclusion. Single-reviewer data extraction was then completed by
two authors (J.R.L. and A.N.K.) with oversight provided by the senior
author (A.S.R.). The author group sorted articles to identify major
themes according to descriptors and ﬁndings to generate a thematic
synthesis [24−26].
Results
An initial search yielded 1271 articles. Of these, 64 duplicates
were removed. After title and abstract screening, 720 articles were
deemed irrelevant. The remaining 487 full-text studies were assessed
for eligibility, of which 420 studies were excluded. The most common
reason for exclusion was that the outcomes measured did not relate
to respiratory care (n = 343). A total of 67 studies were included for
data extraction (Supplementary Table A.1.), of which 50 studies
(74.6 %) were published between 2020 and 2023. The article selection
process is shown in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) ﬂow diagram (Fig. 1) as well as
a summary of study ﬁndings (Table 1).
Respiratory healthcare utilization
Climate change-related respiratory healthcare utilization was
measured principally in terms of acute care (ED visits and hospital
admissions), with 70.1 % of the reviewed articles adopting one or
both as primary endpoints (Fig. 2).
Although not all studies met thresholds for statistical signiﬁcance,
studies conducted in different populations and geographies generally
found that extreme heat was associated with higher odds of respira-
tory-related acute care visits [27−32]. In a case-crossover study of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) hospitalizations in
England from 2007 to 2018, every 1 °C rise in temperature above
23.2 °C was associated with a 1.47 % increase in hospitalization (95 %
Credible Interval 1.19−1.73) [33]. Similarly, in the US state of Alaska,
a heat index threshold above 21.1 °C (70°F) increased the odds of ED
utilization, while ED visits for both asthma and pneumonia were
highest the day after a heat event [34].
The effects of wildﬁre smoke and air pollution similarly showed
consistent trends toward increased acute care utilization for respira-
tory causes. A 2016 review article by Reid et al. on the health impacts
of wildﬁre smoke identiﬁed a number of prior studies showing
increases in ED visits and hospitalizations [35]. More recent research

bolstered these ﬁndings, including an Australian study of that coun-
try’s 2019−20 bushﬁre season that demonstrated a 6 % (95 % empiri-
cal Conﬁdence Interval [CI] 1.9−10.3) increase in ED visits for
respiratory diseases in regions of the country with lower markers of
socioeconomic status and high ﬁre density [36].
Among the studies examining emergency medical service (i.e.,
ambulance) utilization, there was evidence of increased utilization
during extreme cold and heat. Sangkharat et al. found that extreme
cold temperatures (less than 0 °C) in London, UK were associated
with more ambulance dispatches for asthma, dyspnea, and respira-
tory infections, with the relative risk (RR) ranging from 1.39 (95 %CI
1.16−1.70) for asthma to 2.08 (95 %CI 1.67−2.57) for respiratory
infections. Meanwhile, extreme heat (greater than 22.8 °C) was
associated with increased ambulance calls for exacerbations of COPD
(RR = 1.27, 95 %CI 1.18−1.36) [37]. Another study demonstrated that
immediate exposure (within one hour) to a 10 mg/m3 increase in ﬁne
particulate matter (PM2.5) during wildﬁre season was associated with
more frequent ambulance dispatches for respiratory conditions [38].
A more recent systematic review and meta-analysis of ambulance
dispatches showed that for every 5 °C increase in mean temperature,
the use of ambulance services increased for all-cause diagnoses and
for cardiovascular disease, but not for respiratory-related diagnoses
[39]. However, the authors identiﬁed potential biases, including pos-
sible misclassiﬁcation of respiratory disease.
Only one study investigated the impact of heat on primary care
visits for respiratory-related diseases. Vashishtha et al. analyzed

outpatient visits for heat-related illnesses, including respiratory dis-
ease, during six heat wave events in southern California, US between
2012 and 2016 and found no signiﬁcant relationship between heat
and ambulatory care utilization as measured by assignment of a
heat-related diagnosis code (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.35, 95 %CI
0.86−1.36, p = 0.51) [40].
Respiratory disease-related healthcare costs
Future projections of healthcare costs attributable to climate
change were limited, although several analyses suggested the
likelihood of increased healthcare costs related to respiratory illness-
related acute care in a warming climate. In a 2012 study, Lin et al.
estimated that heat-related admissions for respiratory disease in the
US state of New York would likely rise two to six fold by 2080−2090
compared to a 1991−2004 baseline [28]. In a separate study, costs of
respiratory-related care were similarly projected to rise in the west-
ern United States owing to increasingly severe wildﬁre events [41]. A
simulation study predicted that climate change-driven temperature
increases in Australia could result in a 140 % increase in respiratory
disease-related hospitalization costs by the 2050s [42].
Effects on select and vulnerable populations and geographic distribution
Of the 67 studies reviewed, 53 examined the effects of extreme
weather on speciﬁc demographic groups. A series of studies showed
that elderly populations were more affected by adverse weather
events, as supported by increased ED visits [43], hospitalizations dur-
ing times of high temperature variability [44], and prolonged heat
wave duration [27]. In a nationwide time-series study of wildﬁre
smoke-related hospital admissions from 2000 to 15 in Brazil, Ye at al.
demonstrated that the very young and the old were at highest risk
for all-cause hospital admission (RR 4.88, 95 %CI 4.47−5.28 for ages ≤
4, RR 3.70, 95 %CI 3.2−4.2 for ages ≥80 vs. RR 0.83, 95 %CI 0.44−1.23
for ages 30−39) [45]. The same study showed that for every 10 mg/
m3 increase in wildﬁre-related PM2.5, there was a 5 % (95 %CI 4.73
−5.44) increase in respiratory-related hospital admissions [45]. Other
isolated effects of climate change appeared to occur independently of
age. Among those seeking ED care for asthma on thunderstorm days
with heavy precipitation and cool temperatures in Louisiana, for
instance, the risk of exacerbation was higher among children com-
pared to adults (RR 1.27, 95 %CI 1.06−1.53); the association with age
did not carry over to non-thunderstorm days with heavy daily pre-
cipitation [46].
Among seven studies that focused on children [6,32,47−51],
researchers identiﬁed those under the age of 18, and especially those
under the age of 5 [51], to be at increased risk for climate-related
respiratory exacerbations. The varied climatological exposures stud-
ied included heavy precipitation [49]; drought [48]; wildﬁres
[45,51,52]; temperature, humidity, and air pollution [32,50]; and
aeroallergens [47]. Extremes of precipitation presented challenges to
children’s respiratory health: heavy precipitation was associated
with 11 % higher odds (95 %CI 1.02−1.21) of asthma exacerbation
resulting in outpatient and inpatient acute care compared to non-
precipitation days in the US [49]. In the Brazilian Amazon, a 2010
drought was linked to wide-ranging increases in pediatric hospital-
izations (1.2−267 %) in a large proportion of affected municipalities
compared to the region’s 10-year mean [48]. The risk of hospitaliza-
tion was in part believed to result from aerosolized particulate matter
generated from a variety of human-exacerbated changes, including
land use conversion [48].
Ten articles noted differences in healthcare utilization based on
race, ethnicity, and underlying disabilities among communities
known to suffer disparate pulmonary health outcomes [9]. Some
studies examined the disparate effects of speciﬁc natural disasters on
vulnerable populations. For example, a survey of non-Hispanic black
residents of Houston, Texas found higher odds of post-traumatic
stress following Hurricane Harvey (OR 5.03, 95 %CI 1.90−13.10) and a
non-signiﬁcant trend toward decreased healthcare access (OR 1.57,
95 %CI 0.79−3.12); residents with a disability were signiﬁcantly more
likely to face challenges accessing healthcare than those who did not
have a disability (OR 3.19, 95 %CI 1.37−7.45) [53]. Severe wildﬁres in
the Canadian subarctic during the summer of 2014 also dispropor-
tionately affected the healthcare utilization of indigenous peoples
[54], while infrastructure deﬁciencies and debt linked to longtime
political marginalization likely contributed to the disastrous after-
math of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico [55].

The geographic representation of authors and study locations was
not representative of the global population. While most studies
focused on North America, Europe, China, and southeast Asia, there
was a paucity of studies from South American, Caribbean, African,
and Asian countries. Of the ﬁve articles from South America, four
originated from Brazil and one from Chile. There were only two
papers examining the Caribbean region and two from the African
continent; among the latter group, both were speciﬁc to the country
of South Africa. In addition, review papers included in our analysis
were often limited to an examination of English-speaking countries,
excluding large swaths of the globe most vulnerable to the effects of
climate change [56].
The role of telehealth
The scoping review found very few studies examining the rela-
tionship between climate-related exposures and telehealth services
and accessibility, or the inﬂuence of extreme weather on access to
high-speed internet and electricity for respiratory care. Only one
included paper evaluated climate-related exposures and telemedi-
cine: In a trial of 62 patients in Germany with COPD experiencing
“heat stress days” (i.e., days when the maximal temperature was
greater than 25 °C), investigators randomized patients to tele-moni-
toring (including COPD clinical assessment, daily lung function, and
weekly 6-minute walk testing) versus usual care. The trial showed
that over the 9-month study period, patients undergoing tele-moni-
toring had fewer COPD exacerbations (7 vs. 22, p = 0.01), shorter
cumulative hospital stays (34 vs. 97 days), and fewer specialist con-
sultations (24 vs. 42, p = 0.04) as compared to controls [57].
Power outages and adverse respiratory health outcomes
It is known that climate change and adverse weather events affect
critical infrastructure needed for healthcare delivery. Power grids
supplying electricity essential to hospital operations are at elevated
risk during wildﬁres, droughts, and other extreme weather events
[58]. Although one study included in the review showed that power
outages in New York City were associated with higher rates of COPD-
related hospital admission (RR 1.61, 95 %CI 1.05−2.48 at day two fol-
lowing power outage) [59], there was scant additional evidence
exploring the effects of prior or projected future extreme events on
respiratory care.
Effects on respiratory medication supply chains
While two studies commented on the need for healthcare pro-
viders to ensure proper respiratory home medication supply in prep-
aration for extreme heat events and/or poor air quality days [60,61],
we did not uncover any primary research of climate change effects
on respiratory medication supply or drug distribution. Many articles
highlighted increased rescue medication utilization during extreme
weather events, including a positive association between exposure to
wildﬁre-related ﬁne particulate matter and salbutamol dispensations
(RR 1.06 95 %CI 1.04−1.07 for every 10 mg/m3 increase in wildﬁre-
related PM2.5) [62]. In addition, one included scoping review under-
scored the risks of extreme weather to medication access following
disasters such as hurricanes [63].
The practice of respiratory medicine in a changing climate
Four publications examined the effects of climate change on the
practice of respiratory medicine, including the importance of educat-
ing at-risk populations. George et al. explored how nurses can play a
role in mitigating climate change by focusing research efforts on the
effects of climate change while educating patients on planetary
health [18]. Further, Balakrishnan et al. summarized the climate
effects on respiratory healthcare with the aim of building climate lit-
eracy among pulmonary providers [13].
Adaptation for the future
Very limited research on respiratory care system adaptation was
identiﬁed. One exception was a pilot study of training on personal
protective equipment use (e.g., N95 respirators) in the aftermath of
Hurricane Harvey in 2017 [64]. Researchers noted a high incidence of
respiratory symptoms in the weeks following the ﬂooding disaster,
as well as high respirator utilization (98 %) [64]. Yet similar studies
addressing health system resilience were generally lacking, with the
included reviews consistently underscoring a lack of data on climate-
disaster preparedness [60].
Discussion
This scoping review of respiratory healthcare impacts from cli-
mate change and extreme weather shows that patients, and espe-
cially vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly, are
experiencing adverse respiratory health outcomes. These negative
effects risk stressing under-resourced care delivery systems. Respira-
tory healthcare utilization, as measured by ED visits and hospitaliza-
tions, has increased. These impacts have been driven primarily by
extreme weather events, including severe heat waves, wildﬁres, hur-
ricanes, drought—and to a lesser extent extreme cold and ﬂoods.
Nonetheless, our review highlights the vast knowledge gaps per-
taining to respiratory disease management and health system adap-
tation in a changing climate. Most of the literature identiﬁed in this
ﬁeld has focused narrowly on acute, hospital-based care for cli-
mate-related respiratory health, with relatively little attention
paid to the effects of climate change on primary care for respira-
tory illness or pre-hospital care. In addition, while previous work
has shown an increased need for acute bronchodilator medication
dispensation during wildﬁre smoke events [62,65] and increased
demand for all respiratory medications during short-term expo-
sure to extreme heat or cold [66], we did not identify any litera-
ture examining the effects of climate change on medication
distribution or pharmacy operations, which are basic necessities
of respiratory disease management.
Another key ﬁnding of this review was the scarcity of published
research originating from large swaths of the Global South that are
expected to confront the worst effects of climate change [56]. Areas
of the developing world that have contributed the least to climate
effects now also face increasingly severe weather and climate effects
without the research or healthcare resources necessary to bolster
healthcare systems [67]. This is of particular concern for respiratory
disease management, as, worldwide, the WHO estimates that out-
door air pollution results in over four million excess deaths per year
[68].
Despite the large content areas in need of scientiﬁc exploration,
the increase in the number of reports generated on the topics of
respiratory health and climate change in recent years has been nota-
ble. A growing number of physician viewpoints and policy perspec-
tives, although excluded from the present scoping review, highlight
the increased awareness of climate change among respiratory care
providers [69,70]. Still, scientiﬁc study of respiratory disease out-
comes, economic costs, and innovations in climate resilience and
adaptation are urgently needed to bolster healthcare systems as cli-
mate change increasingly threatens care delivery.
Strengths and weaknesses
Strengths of our approach included the broad literature search
comprising any aspect of respiratory healthcare that could be affected
by climate change (performed using six databases, including a gray

literature search). Over 1000 papers were considered in multiple lan-
guages, and our multi-disciplinary review team included an experi-
enced health sciences librarian.
The targeted approach of our article inclusion process, focusing on
climate change-related exposures (as opposed to weather impacts
alone) and healthcare delivery outcomes, may have led to the exclu-
sion of a substantial body of literature connecting respiratory care to
climate change. This was evident upon further examination of review
papers, including those by Reid et al. [35], showing that a number of
cited articles on climate change-related respiratory health outcomes
had been omitted from the present review [71]. As the primary focus
of the article was to identify novel aspects of respiratory care delivery
rather than to re-examine known epidemiological associations, we
felt that these gaps did not substantially deter from the cumulative
ﬁndings of the paper. In addition, the study may have been subject to
misclassiﬁcation bias as respiratory-related outcomes frequently
overlapped with cardiac or other organ-system outcomes. Future
reviews may consider adopting knowledge maps to minimize the
impact of such bias. Consistent with previously described scoping
review methodology [26], we did not perform a quality assessment
of the included articles. The inclusion of lower-quality studies may
limit the strength of our conclusions.
Future directions
The scoping review has identiﬁed several key areas for future
research to better elucidate the effects of climate change on respira-
tory care:
1. Understudied populations: Africa, South America, the Caribbean,
and large portions of Asia, stand out as vastly under-researched
geographies. Many healthcare systems in these areas of the Global
South are likely to experience the worst impacts of climate
change, yet they remain understudied and thus at risk of under-
representation in future policymaking.
2. Going beyond acute care: Studies to date have largely adopted ED
visits and hospitalizations as proxies for healthcare utilization
from climate change effects. Primary and specialty respiratory
care utilization, emergency medical service calls, supply chain
impacts, effects on long-term care and pulmonary rehabilitation,
respiratory pharmaceutical availability, and studies of economic
impacts would be useful to inform policies related to climate
change preparedness and the provision of respiratory care.
3. A focus on solutions: Studies have consistently demonstrated that
fossil fuel pollution and climate change have exacerbated respira-
tory health, yet there remains relatively little research focus on
solutions. Telehealth is one such technology that may provide
low-carbon, high-quality healthcare [72], but how best to inte-
grate this tool in the areas most affected by climate change or
extreme weather remains unexplored. Insurers, architects, urban
planners, health system engineers, sustainability experts, regula-
tors, and other related stakeholders must play a role in construct-
ing a resilient healthcare system.
Currently available resources
There are several existing resources and tools to help respiratory
care providers and investigators generate new research questions
and healthcare-based interventions to improve climate resilience.
The US government has a publicly available online “toolkit” with sug-
gestions on the provision of healthcare during extreme weather
events [73]; prominent journals have offered generalized ﬁndings
and recommendations on how to improve healthcare delivery infra-
structure in the face of climate change [74,75]; the WHO has created
a report on the current status of healthcare systems [76]; and reports
are available to supplement understanding of how allied health pro-
fessionals can work together to create systemic change [77].
Conclusions
Our scoping review of climate change-related impacts on respira-
tory healthcare delivery has identiﬁed important future research
opportunities. Ambulatory care, medication availability, telehealth,
and supply chain distribution for respiratory care are under-
researched. More work is needed to address the lack of representa-
tion in geographies most at risk of climate impacts and to develop
systemic health interventions to ensure that patients in need of respi-
ratory care can receive it.
