Abstract
Extreme weather events are expected to increase due to climate change,
which could pose an additional burden of morbidity and mortality. In re-
cent decades, drought severity has increased in several regions around the
world, affecting health by increasing the risk of water-, food-, and vector-
borne diseases, malnutrition, cardiovascular and respiratory illness, mental
health disorders, and mortality. Drought frequency and severity are expected
to worsen across large regions as a result of a decrease in precipitation and
an increase in temperature and atmospheric evaporative demand, posing a
pressing challenge for public health. Variation in impacts among countries
and communities is due to multiple factors, such as aging, socioeconomic
status, access to health care, and gender, affecting population resilience. In-
tegrative proactive action plans focused on risk management are required,
and resources should be transferred to developing countries to reduce their
vulnerability and risk.

1. INTRODUCTION
Climate change is currently considered one of the greatest threats to human health. According
to the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, climate hazards in-
creasingly contribute to a growing number of adverse health outcomes in multiple geographical
areas (59). In the absence of additional actions, climate change will exacerbate the current health
burden and alter the geographic range of climate-sensitive health outcomes and functioning of
public health and health care systems (53).
Climate change, through increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events,
affects health through multiple pathways,leading to short-term shocks or changes in temporal pat-
terns of climate-sensitive diseases (37, 97). Extreme weather events, such as heat waves, droughts,
and floods, are associated with an increased risk of hospitalizations and mortality due to various
diseases, including cardiovascular, respiratory, mental health, and renal diseases (48, 52, 87). In
addition, climate alters environmental risk factors, such as pollen and air pollution, leading to
an increased risk of cardiovascular and respiratory outcomes, including death (9, 88, 126). The
incidence and geographical spread of vector-borne, waterborne, and foodborne infectious dis-
eases, such as dengue, malaria, and diarrheal diseases, have changed during the last several decades,
driven mostly by changes in climate extremes, climate variability, and geographic environmental
conditions (97). Furthermore, climate change could drive multifaceted influences on food produc-
tion systems and water resources, which would lead to increased undernutrition, poverty, conflicts,
and migration. Several of these mechanisms can happen simultaneously in time and space, result-
ing in compounding or cascading impacts, which, when coupled with higher vulnerability, would
translate into magnified health effects (59).
In addition to the progressive warming and changing patterns in climate-related hazards, exist-
ing societal challenges, such as social inequality, progressive urbanization, and aging populations,
will likely amplify the health burden attributed to climate change (22, 151). For instance, vul-
nerable and marginalized populations are and will continue to be disproportionately impacted by
climate change, including impoverished and undernourished communities, those in poor hous-
ing, people with chronic conditions, and elderly populations. Therefore, future climate change
trends will likely exacerbate existing health and social inequalities, enhancing vulnerability to
climate-related hazards (59, 97).
Drought is one of the climate hazards with the most far-reaching effects and impacts a mul-
titude of sectors, such as agriculture, water availability, livestock breeding, ecosystems, and food
supply (144). Compound and cascading impacts that are often associated with droughts, such as
intensification of heat waves and a higher risk of wildfires and sandstorms, as well as the interac-
tion between these events and emerging threats, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can amplify
morbidity and mortality risks, particularly in vulnerable populations (59, 119). For instance, more
than 50 million people were simultaneously affected by climate-related hazards and COVID-19
in 2020, leading to escalating threats and new challenges in responding to health and economic
emergencies (97, 145). Moreover, these situations may occur with a lag in time and space, compli-
cating their identification and evaluation. An estimated 1.43 billion people were severely affected
by droughts between 2019 and 2020, and the damages associated with drought and floods reached
US$764 billion (27). However, these figures may be underestimated due to deficiencies in the
drought monitoring systems of poor countries, and these countries are usually the ones most
affected; knowledge of costs of indirect and long-term impacts is limited (45).
This article analyzes the observed and projected trends in drought occurrence, assesses the
main impacts of drought on health,and provides an overview of prevention and adaptation policies,
providing recommendations to address future threats of climate change and to enhance resilience.

drought from an integrative approach, which is addressed in depth in the following sections.
2. DROUGHT EVENTS IN A CHANGING CLIMATE
Whether drought has increased in recent decades is unclear because the assessment of recent
drought trends is complex (30, 117). Paradoxically, the availability of generalized meteorological,
hydrological, and environmental observations in the last century did not produce robust assess-
ments of drought trends due to highly complex and imprecise definitions of droughts (66) and
the variety of drought types. Drought is impact dependent and may refer to damages to agricul-
ture (e.g., crop yield failure) and ecosystems (e.g., tree mortality); the hydrological dimension,
including reductions in streamflow and reservoir or groundwater storage; and socioeconomic
implications. Common classification distinguishes between meteorological, agricultural, hydro-
logical, socioeconomic, and ecological (or environmental) droughts, preventing a straightforward
drought assessment (144). Moreover, drought cannot be directly measured, and a unique variable
to provide an absolute assessment of drought severity is lacking. Thus, various direct (e.g., pre-
cipitation, streamflow) or indirect drought metrics (e.g., vegetation measurements) may provide
different temporal anomalies and trends.
Drought quantification is usually based on climate data, as most events have a climatic origin,
and drought trends have usually been analyzed with climate drought indices (79). Precipitation is
the main variable controlling variability and trends; however, precipitation shows strong temporal
variability related to the influence of large-scale circulation mechanisms, such as El Niño–
Southern Oscillation, which mask the identification of trends associated with climate change
(30, 117). Global studies based on precipitation do not show trends in drought severity in recent
decades (30, 84, 107, 111).
Nevertheless, other variables trigger or exacerbate drought. The most important variable dur-
ing climate change is temperature increase, which has increased atmospheric evaporative demand
(AED) in recent decades (131). This increased demand has reinforced drought severity (a) by
increasing actual evapotranspiration (Et) in land areas and reducing soil moisture (115), water
storages (42), and streamflow (129, 132), and (b) by enhancing plant stress in ecosystems and agri-
cultural lands (6, 16). AED influence on drought severity has been particularly relevant during
the warm season in periods of precipitation deficits, when the effects of AED on water resources
and plants would be multiplicative (116). Global studies based on climate drought indices suggest
an increase in drought severity associated with higher AED (29, 31, 32, 109, 111), particularly in
subtropical and semiarid regions, such as West, Central, and Southern Africa, the Mediterranean,
Western North America, and regions of Australia, East Asia, and South America (Figure 2a).
Changes in drought severity have reinforced some drought impacts; however, few studies have
analyzed the influence of recent trends on changes in impacts. Nevertheless, studies on envi-
ronmental systems have stressed that stronger megafires (2) and more frequent forest mortality
episodes (7, 41) are consequences of drought events characterized by warmer conditions. These
findings are consistent with increased stress in agricultural systems, in which higher AED has re-
duced crop yields during periods of precipitation deficits (67). Agricultural and ecological drought

severity has increased in recent decades (107),causing a cascade of socioeconomic effects in regions
that strongly depend on agriculture and livestock (46).
The assessment of future drought projections is uncertain given the complexity of the processes
involved, which include radiative and physiological effects of atmospheric CO2 concentrations
and uncertainties in precipitation projections by Earth system models (59). Projections show a
reinforcement of meteorological droughts in some regions, such as the Mediterranean, South,
North, and Central America, southern Africa, and southern Australia (73, 107), due to projected
precipitation decrease (34). These projections would exacerbate soil moisture and hydrological
deficits (26, 153). The current scientific debate focuses on increased AED projected in scenarios of
high greenhouse gas emissions (130), which expands the areas affected by drought trends beyond
regions where precipitation deficits are projected (13).
Consensus finds that increased AED would increase the evapotranspiration deficit (i.e., the dif-
ference between land evapotranspiration and AED) and increase plant water stress. Therefore, the

limited increase in drought severity beyond areas of precipitation decrease, which is suggested by
projections of streamflow and soil moisture (26), seems to contradict impact model results, which
suggests a reinforcement of drought severity with strong agricultural and ecological implications
(6, 47, 147). Thus, reinforcement of drought severity is likely in areas that project a precipita-
tion increase. Precipitation projections for future climate scenarios show increased decadal and
interannual precipitation variability (90, 114); therefore, periods of precipitation deficits are also
expected in areas where precipitation is projected to increase. During these periods, higher AED
would exacerbate agricultural/ecological and hydrological drought severity. This pattern has been
observed in regions that showed precipitation increase in recent decades, such as the British Isles
and Scandinavia, which have been affected by extreme droughts associated with precipitation
deficits and increased AED (65, 91, 118).
Projections based on the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) (32, 152, 153) and Standard-
ised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) (23, 110, 138, 150) suggest greater drought
severity in future climate scenarios in more areas than indicated by projections of soil moisture and
streamflow in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). In the worst future climate
scenario, the main increase in drought severity is projected by these metrics in large areas, includ-
ing most of Europe, North and Central America, the Amazon basin, North Africa, the Middle
East, South Africa, Australia, and Southeast Asia (81, 107, 153) (Figure 2b).
The effects of this projected increase could go beyond the effects described above, affecting
the CO2 emissions from land areas (49), soil carbon storage (28), and air quality. Thus, Wang
et al. (139) estimated that the concentrations of O3 and PM2.5 would increase due to drought by
1.6% and 1.16%, respectively, in the United States by 2100. These projected changes could be
influenced by the combined effects of drought on natural emissions (e.g., increased frequency and
severity of wildfires, dust intrusions, volatile organic compounds), deposition (e.g., reduction of
dry ozone deposition to vegetation), and atmospheric chemistry (e.g., reduction of wet scavenging
of pollutants; changes in the production, loss, or lifetime of pollutants in the atmosphere) (139). In
addition, drought is often accompanied by high temperature events, which have substantial effects
on some pollutants such as tropospheric ozone (92). Furthermore, the frequency of hydrological
droughts and wildfires is projected to increase (59, 95) and periods of water scarcity are projected
to dramatically increase (135), with serious socioeconomic consequences.
3. DROUGHT IMPACTS ON HEALTH AND HUMAN WELL-BEING: A
COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH
While there is substantive literature on the impact of drought on agriculture and the environment,
studies on the effect of drought on human health are limited in part because drought-related health
impacts are essentially indirect, accumulative, and cascading and include various mechanisms, all
of which make assessment difficult (51, 103). Drought constitutes a significant concern for hu-
mankind, as it has been associated with health problems such as water- and vector-borne diseases,
cardiovascular and respiratory conditions, injuries, kidney conditions, esophageal cancer, food in-
security and malnutrition, mental health disorders, and mortality (11, 12, 36, 93, 112, 119, 134,
149). In particular, drought was one of the deadliest climate-related phenomena between 1970
and 2019, mostly in Africa (146).
Drought impacts on public health are unevenly distributed across countries, across territo-
ries within countries, and within population groups, exacerbating existing social inequalities and
influencing future vulnerability (59). Higher exposure and vulnerability (increased susceptibility
and/or reduced adaptive capacity) lead to higher risks related to drought (60). Differences in vul-
nerability and exposure usually arise from nonclimatic factors, such as socioeconomic status and
218
Salvador et al.

inequalities based on social constructs. Harmful effects of drought on health often fall dispropor-
tionately on children, the older population, pregnant women, chronic patients, outdoors workers,
marginalized individuals, and impoverished people or who are affected by other social determi-
nants of health (59, 62, 77, 105, 106, 119, 140). Evidence indicates that drought exposure during
pregnancy can affect a child’s health by reducing height and weight, especially among children
born to low-educated, poor, and rural mothers (62). Several studies indicate that older popula-
tions are often more at risk of drought-related mortality than are younger adults due to their
higher vulnerability (77, 101, 105); however, there can be some regional exceptions, as shown in a
recent study conducted in Nebraska, United States, where authors speculate that different outdoor
exposure levels could have influenced differences in drought risks on mortality by age (1). On the
other hand, drought can have different effects on women and men; women are especially vulner-
able in developing countries because they often face discrimination, as reflected in lower salaries,
limited education opportunities, and exclusion from political and decision-making processes (33,
119). In these countries, there are unequal power relationships between men and women, such that
women often have lower access to and control of resources to cope with extreme weather hazards
such as drought, a higher likelihood of lower health literacy, and lower socioeconomic positions,
all of which make them more vulnerable to drought events (119). Moreover, women often suffer
a higher work burden during drought events and harmful consequences linked to traveling long
distances in search of water for domestic uses (5, 140). However, current studies of drought effects
on mortality show inconsistent patterns, with larger mortality risks among women in Brazil (105)
and Nebraska (1) and among men in Lisbon (101). Lynch et al. (71) did not observe differences
in the association between drought and all causes of death between adult women and men across
the whole United States. Lynch et al. (71) and Abadi et al. (1) also suggest that race may be an
important predictor of social and environmental inequalities and a modifier of the effect.
3.1. Waterborne Diseases and Water-Related Effects
Drought influences the risk of waterborne diseases through its impact on water availability and
quality (11, 37, 100, 112). Drought effects on water quality are complex and depend on watershed
characteristics and climate and environmental conditions (75, 78, 131). The reduction of stream-
flow and groundwater levels during drought events favors stagnant water conditions and pollution,
such as chemicals, metals, and solid particles (21, 37, 112, 149). For instance, a recent study in the
United States predicted an increase in arsenic exposure in domestic wells that is associated with
drought (68). Nutrients and turbidity often decrease during droughts due to a lack of catchment
runoff, increase in sedimentation, and the influence of internal processes (e.g., biological uptake
of nutrients, denitrification due to longer water residence times); however, changes are dependent
on land-use settings and types of source pollution (75, 78, 119, 131). Drought can impact fecal co-
liform levels in streams, but studies show inconsistent effects; some results suggest an increase due
to higher stock use of waterways and lack of flushing flows, whereas others reveal a reduction (20,
78). However, drought events followed by intense rainfall conditions can lead to peaks in diseases
caused by pathogens, such as species of the genus Cryptosporidium, Campylobacter, or Escherichia coli
(43, 82, 149). Also, warmer and more stratified water often associated with drought events pro-
motes the growth of microorganisms, including an increase in toxic cyanobacterial blooms, such
as species of Anabaena and Microcystis, and a reduction in dissolved oxygen. Furthermore, drought
events have been associated with an increase in salt levels due to lower dilution and to the in-
trusion of seawater into freshwater aquifers, compromising water security (75, 78, 100, 119, 149).
Climate change is expected to increase future health risks associated with waterborne diseases and
cause the expansion of pathogens such as Vibrio sp. due to warmer and saltier water as a result of
increased temperatures and reduced precipitation (59).

A decreased water supply during drought combined with an increase in water demand for vari-
ous uses, such as residential, agricultural, and commercial uses as well as for energy and sanitation,
can lead to or exacerbate water scarcity (100, 119). Limited water resources during drought events
force people to use unsafe water for domestic uses or for irrigating fields and can lead to reduced
hygiene practices, increasing the risk of water- and foodborne diseases and skin and eye infections
(5, 8, 10, 21, 43, 54, 112). Populations with low socioeconomic status and limited access to ba-
sic services such as water and sanitation, as in Africa and Asia, are particularly vulnerable (5, 59,
119). A recent study showed a substantial effect of long-term drought exposure on the incidence
of diarrhea among children under age 5 in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which
was mediated in part by water, sanitation, and hygiene practices. Moreover, the climate zone, the
round-trip time to collect water, and the availability of water or soap/detergent for handwashing
were relevant risk modifier factors (137). Currently, 2.2 billion people lack access to safe drinking
water and ∼4.2 billion people have no access to safe sanitation services, with most of these pop-
ulations living in the least developed countries (125). Vulnerability in these regions is expected
to increase due to the expected population growth and increasing drought severity (59). Further-
more, prolonged severe droughts can affect power production and disrupt health services, such as
a break in the cold chain necessary to maintain medical supplies (50).
3.2. Food Insecurity, Malnutrition, and Other Health-Related Effects
Drought events have detrimental consequences for food security and nutrition, including in-
creased risk of malnutrition (including undernutrition and micronutrient deficits) and starvation,
which poses a significant threat to LMICs that have fewer resources to mitigate food scarcity,
fewer livelihood alternatives, poor transportation networks, and limited access to markets (5, 8,
55, 59, 76, 83, 119). In 2020, ∼1 in 3 people worldwide did not have access to adequate food,
which was an increase of nearly 320 million people compared to 2019, and nearly 12% of the
global population suffered from severe food insecurity, mostly in Africa, Latin America and the
Caribbean, and Asia (40). Furthermore, future climate change is expected to increase the risk of
food insecurity and malnutrition in 2050, exacerbating the existing scenario (59).
Drought events have been associated with a reduction in food supply, such as decreased crop
yields, livestock, and fisheries production (119), and changes in the quantity and quality of house-
hold diets (19,100).In India,drought conditions were associated with a less balanced diet,resulting
in a lower consumption of fruits,vegetables,legumes,and animal-sourced foods and a lower caloric
intake, including proteins and fats, mostly due to a reduction in household income (19). Drought
often results in increased food prices, which can lead to lower dietary diversity and consumption
levels (59, 119). Farmers, pregnant women, children under age five, older populations, people in
shelters, and individuals with low socioeconomic status are often more affected (8, 119). Undernu-
trition leads to a higher risk of morbidity and mortality and is the leading cause of child mortality
in sub-Saharan Africa (98). Children who survive undernutrition and those living in food-insecure
households suffer cognitive damage; negative effects on physical development; increased risk of
infections, such as malaria, pneumonia, and diarrheal diseases; and detrimental long-term conse-
quences. In addition, nutritional deficiencies during pregnancy increase the risk of preterm birth
and low birth weight (3, 98, 119).
Unavailability of food resources leads to an increased risk of mental health effects and declines
in well-being (39). The impacts of droughts on economic sectors, such as agriculture, livestock,
and other water-dependent sectors, and associated migration produce mental health effects,
especially among vulnerable populations such as rural communities and farmers (119, 133).
Socioeconomic impacts lead to higher levels of stress, anxiety, depression, and conflict situations
220
Salvador et al.

due to an increase in workload, unemployment, loss of income, and additional financial pressure
(15, 83, 100, 112, 119, 134). In extreme cases, drought can increase the risk of suicidal behaviors
(56, 103). Drought-related socioeconomic effects have caused forced migrations in dryland rural
areas of low-income regions, mainly in East Africa, followed by South Asia and West and South
Africa (59). Children’s education may be interrupted by parents who require their children to help
at home or in business, increasing uncertainty about the future and contributing to an increased
risk of negative mental health outcomes (15, 133). Differences in drought-related mental health
impacts can occur between men and women; this variation is partly linked to differences in gender
roles and responsibilities. A study in Northeast Brazil suggested that women suffered higher
levels of anxiety, whereas men had higher levels of emotional distress in a drought-affected area
compared to women and men, respectively, in another area unaffected by drought (25). However,
some evidence indicates that drought principally influences suicide among men, with most studies
conducted in Australia (56, 100, 119, 134, 140).
3.3. Vector-Borne Diseases
Drought affects transmission patterns of vector-borne diseases, such as dengue, chikungunya,
malaria, West Nile Virus (WNV), and Rift Fever Virus, particularly in sensitive regions where
vectors are endemic and control systems are weak (24, 59, 69, 89, 112, 134). The association be-
tween drought and an abundance of vectors is complex, as this phenomenon can either reduce the
number of mosquito vectors by decreasing breeding habitats or increase its abundance (e.g., Aedes
mosquitoes) by creating improvised breeding sites in water storage containers used to store limited
water resources during the drought. Moreover, drought may reduce the number of predators and
aquatic competitors of mosquito vectors, favoring the abundance of vectors under rewetting con-
ditions (12, 18, 112, 119). The prevalence of mosquitoes such as the Culex species, which transmits
WNV, may increase in drought conditions. Drought may lead to the aggregation of birds (reser-
voir host for WNV) in mosquito habitats and increase the risk of contact with humans (18, 89,
119). Lowe et al. (70) showed that drought effects on dengue risk lagged 3–5 months in Brazil and
depended largely on climatic, social, and ecological conditions, such as the availability and quality
of habitats for mosquitoes, household water supply, and water storage practices carried out by hu-
mans. Greater repercussions were observed in highly urbanized areas and regions with a higher
frequency of water supply shortages (70). Drought has been described as a potential contributing
factor for malaria mortality in developing countries, although its impact on malaria risk remains
unclear (10, 54, 112). In contrast, other vector-borne diseases transmitted by ticks are likely to de-
crease under drought conditions, as ticks are highly dependent on wet conditions to survive (18,
100, 113).
Changing spatial patterns of drought frequency and intensity, described above, and trends such
as population growth, migration, and urbanization are expected to redistribute the future burden
of vector-borne diseases unless effective mitigation and adaptation policies are adopted. Climate
change likely increases the risk of dengue and facilitates its global spread. In addition, the distri-
bution and vectorial capacity of malaria vectors are expected to increase in parts of sub-Saharan
Africa, Asia, and South America due to climate change (59).
3.4. Cardiovascular and Respiratory Diseases Associated
with Drought-Related Hazards
Drought often exacerbates the occurrence of climate and environmental factors with detrimental
effects on cardiorespiratory health (11, 59, 100). Drought is an important driver of air quality,
increasing the concentration of pollutants in the atmosphere (e.g., increasing the frequency and

severity of wildfires, dust intrusions) (131, 139), with larger mortality and morbidity impacts (8, 50,
99, 103). Drought events often result from persistent atmospheric blocking and high-pressure sys-
tems, which have been associated with the intensification of extreme temperatures and worsening
of air quality (61,86,92,131).Inhalation of air pollutants induces inflammatory and prothrombotic
processes, increasing the risk of illness and death (85, 128).
Drought combined with high temperatures has been associated with an increased risk of wild-
fires due to decreased humidity and streamflow and dry vegetation (83). These dry compound
hazards have been projected to increase in the Mediterranean and continental regions in Europe
(38), and they were the fuel for the recent fire disasters in the Amazon and the Pantanal in Brazil
(63, 80). Heat and wildfires are phenomena of great concern to public health and are associated
with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality due to all/nonexternal causes and respiratory
and cardiovascular diseases, mental health disorders, and adverse birth outcomes (44, 59, 108,
127, 148). Furthermore, urban environments are widely considered more at risk because they
have additional sources of air pollution from road traffic and the urban heat island effect.
As soils become drier during drought, dust and other particles are more likely to circulate in the
air, threatening respiratory and cardiovascular health (8, 11, 12). Droughts and high winds increase
the risk of dust storms, which transport pathogenic microorganisms, allergens, fungi spores, and
toxic substances that create and exacerbate respiratory problems due to the irritation of bronchial
passages and lungs after inhalation, increasing the risk of meningococcal disease, allergies, and
respiratory infections, such as bronchitis, pneumonia, and coccidioidomycosis (valley fever) (21,
37, 99, 119, 134, 149).
Recent studies have addressed mortality impacts associated with droughts in various parts of
the world, such as the United States (1, 14, 71), Iberia (101, 104), Brazil (105), and Bangladesh
(4). Most studies have found a positive association between drought events and all, nonexternal,
respiratory and circulatory mortality, especially in vulnerable groups. However, the comparison
between these studies is complex due to differences in study designs, data availability, modeling ap-
proaches,and the definition of the exposure variable,such as the drought index.Moreover,drought
plays an important role in mortality risks associated with exposure (4, 102, 105). Some studies have
addressed the association between drought exposure and cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity;
however, evidence is limited (14, 72, 108, 136). Drought positively influenced respiratory hospital
admissions in Brazil (72, 108) and China (mostly in children and adolescents) (136) but negatively
influenced admissions among older adults in the western United States (14). Although drought
effects on cardiovascular hospitalization were not significant among older adults in the western
United States, the risk was higher in counties with less frequent drought. Moreover, higher mor-
tality risk but lower cardiovascular hospitalization risk was found in rural counties compared to
urban counties for high-severity worsening drought, although differences were not significant
(14). There is a gap in the literature on differences in drought-related health outcomes between
rural and urban environments (1).
4. PREVENTION AND ADAPTATION MEASURES TO FACE DROUGHT
RISKS AND INCREASE POPULATION RESILIENCE
The most common policies to prevent negative drought effects are usually reactive measures,
which have been termed the hydro-illogical response (17) and are characterized by short-term
initiatives to address the crisis associated with droughts, providing additional resources to affected
populations and territories. Once the crisis is over, the action ends and no further actions are
taken to follow up on the underlying causes that transformed a natural hazard into a catastrophe.
Without attention to preparedness, monitoring, early warning, water demand reduction policies,
and other mitigation issues, the next drought is likely to be a new crisis (141, 142). Furthermore,

decisions are left to a single agency, which is ineffective (45) because this approach does not
account for the complex nature of drought and requires the involvement of many different actors.
International organizations have provided guidelines and recommendations to move from these
reactive approaches to proactive approaches. These organizations include the World Meteoro-
logical Organization (WMO), which hosts the Integrated Drought Management Programme
(IDMP; https://www.droughtmanagement.info/), and the Associated Programme on Flood
Management (APFM; https://www.floodmanagement.info/) with the support of the Global
Water Partnership (https://www.gwp.org/). The IDMP is structured by three pillars: (a) drought
monitoring and early warning, (b) vulnerability and impact assessment, and (c) drought prepared-
ness, mitigation, and response (143). The APFM describes a cascade of actions for risk reduction,
which includes watershed intervention, protection through infrastructure, land use regulation,
emergency response preparedness for floods, and recovery. The EPIC Response (17) is based on
five key elements: (a) enabling a setting of policies, laws, agencies, strategic plans, participation,
and information; (b) planning at multiple and nested geographical levels to ensure that mitigation
becomes a higher priority; (c) investing in healthy watersheds and water infrastructure; (d) con-
trolling water use and flood plain development to reduce exposure; and (e) responding better to
floods and droughts through more effective monitoring, response, and recovery. The 2021 Global
Assessment Report on drought (119) describes the physical and societal context of drought, as-
sociated impacts, and methods for risk assessment. After analyzing in depth several case studies,
this report provides guidelines for the transition from disaster compensation to more resilient
policies.
Common features appear in these and other approaches (35, 64), including the need to com-
bine short- and long-term policies to not only address the crisis but also strengthen structures
responsible for drought prevention and management. Monitoring and early-warning systems,
from satellite monitoring to local interactions, also require improvements. Improved land and
water management is another key element to reduce population vulnerability to drought-related
risks. This effort often involves the joint action of different government agencies working to-
gether at various levels, from national to local, the participation of private stakeholders, water
companies, academics, organized associations, and individuals, such as farmers or ranchers. Fur-
thermore, countries must move from short-term to more strategic planning, acting along the cycle
that connects the drought as a natural hazard with the disaster.Doing so cannot be possible without
institutional reinforcement of agencies involved in drought management, such as water agencies,
land planners, and meteorological agencies, though the necessary resources and trained staff are
currently lacking. The need for capacity building to adopt the multidisciplinary approach required
for the new vision of drought management is not limited to government agencies, however, but
includes all stakeholders.
In addition, this transformation requires adequate funding. More investment in services and re-
search to strengthen general health systems, enhance protection against specific climate-sensitive
exposure, and address the social and environmental determinants of health is essential to reduce
vulnerability and the risks associated with extreme weather hazards associated with climate change
(59). In particular, investigators must delve into the drought-specific health effects that require
more attention (e.g., mental health disorders, infectious diseases, cardiovascular and respiratory
morbidity, adverse birth outcomes) and consider different forms of drought and time periods in
which these effects can occur. It is necessary to deepen the knowledge of what type of drought
indices best reflect each of the health impacts and to learn how the environmental and social con-
texts and other individual characteristics interact with and intensify the health risks attributable to
drought (103). Funding and investment opportunities pose a big problem in LMICs, which often
lack the resources to maintain a reactive drought policy. Securing funding associated with climate

change adaptation and mitigation could be a critical step toward helping these countries transi-
tion to new drought policies. However, the situation of resource mobilization seems optimistic
after the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, which introduced a
broad decision, the Glasgow Climate Pact (124), and called for renewed efforts to raise ambition
on emission reduction, climate finance, adaptation, and loss and damage compensation (94). The
document challenges countries to raise their climate ambition; creates the Glasgow Dialogue on
funding for loss and damage, indicating climate change impacts that cannot be adapted and are
unavoidable or already occurred; and asks for a doubling of adaptation finance. However, little
progress was made along these lines. The finance target of transferring US$100 billion annually,
which was set more than a decade ago, has not been met, and the COP declared the need urgent
to meet by 2025, without giving further details (124). This lack of funding mobilization stands
in contrast with the actual needs of LMICs to face climate change risks. A recent assessment by
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Standing Com-
mittee on Finance (https://unfccc.int/SCF) concluded that these nations would require nearly
US$6 trillion through 2030, including domestic funds, to support just half of the actions in their
national determined contributions (NDCs) (123). The UN Environment Programme evaluated
annual adaptation costs for developing countries at US$70 billion but estimated that this figure
could quadruple by 2030 (120).
Moreover, it must be taken into account that the world is in the first phase of climate change,
and the changes in the coming decades are expected to grow. Currently, the average global tem-
perature, which is a measure of the energy available in the climate system, is around 1.1°C above
preindustrial levels. The Paris Agreement sets 1.5° and 2° as targets to minimize global change
impacts. However, the 1.5°C threshold is projected to be reached within the next decade (58, 122).
In fact, governments plan to produce in 2030 more than twice the fossil fuels that would be con-
sistent with limiting warming to 1.5° (121). The current production gap has remained unchanged
since 2019. Global fossil fuel production would need to start declining rapidly to meet the tar-
get; however, most major oil, gas, and coal producers maintain their plans to continue or increase
their production beyond 2030. The G20 countries have allocated more funds (US$300 billion)
to fossil fuels than to clean energy. Current policies should lead to a warming between 2.6°C
and 2.7°C (2°C–3.6°C) by the end of this century. If the countries meet their NDCs by 2030,
warming should fall to 2.4°C (1.8°C–3.3°C), and if the long-term net zero carbon agreements
are met, the reduction would be to 1.8°C (1.4°C–2.6°C) in 2100, with a peak of 1.9°C by mid-
century (57). Due to a warmer and more energic climate, this scenario will not be stationary. This
trend has severe implications, as the extreme intensity of events will continue to increase and
the return periods of extreme events, including droughts, will shorten. These future projections
may increase population vulnerability to subsequent extreme weather and climatic episodes linked
to effects such as shorter times between events for the population and health systems to fully re-
cover from previous episodes and less resilience (36). Thus, adaptation and mitigation policies will
need to be revised frequently to adapt to the evolving nature of climate change. In other words,
more robust and well-resourced management systems will be needed to cope with increasing
risks.
Because droughts are often associated with other hazards, such as heat waves, wildfires, and
pollution, and compound events are expected to increase due to climate change (37, 96), integra-
tive drought risk management must account for potential synergies between drought and other
climate-related events to better prepare for drought and effectively reduce major risks (64, 119).
In addition, providing special attention to vulnerable individuals, including addressing social and
environmental inequalities (e.g., gender inequalities) and supporting inclusive measures, is crucial
to increase population resilience.

5. CONCLUSIONS
Climate change has profound implications for public health, and drought is an extreme event
with significant health impacts. Previous studies show that drought severity has increased in recent
decades, which is mostly associated with changes in AED. The main increase has been observed in
subtropical and semiarid regions of the world.Environmental and agricultural impact data support
this observation, and the increase is predicted to continue in the coming decades. Climate change
projections show a dominant increase in drought frequency and severity in large regions of the
world. This increase will be associated with stronger precipitation variability worldwide, a decline
in precipitation in some regions, a general increase in temperature and atmospheric demand, and
loss of former agricultural land. Even in areas where precipitation is expected to increase, periods
of precipitation deficits are expected. Therefore, impact models project that droughts will result
in an increase in socioeconomic and environmental effects in future climate scenarios.
Drought exposure has far-reaching health impacts that affect millions of people around the
world, regardless of a country’s level of socioeconomic development, and includes various asso-
ciated causes and consequences. Drought impacts can last for long periods of time, and health
implications can lag. Drought’s negative repercussions on health could be related to an increased
risk of water-, food-, and vector-borne diseases and malnutrition as well as heat waves and higher
atmospheric pollution,leading to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and,ultimately,mortality.
Drought has also been linked to mental health disorders associated with economic loss, migration,
and social uprooting. Drought impacts are experienced unequally among communities and pop-
ulation groups: individuals with potentially higher vulnerability, such as children, older people,
women, and people with low socioeconomic status, and those who suffer higher hazard exposures
are often more affected. These impacts will be exacerbated with climate change.
Strategies to reduce drought-related health impacts are well defined and involve moving away
from crisis management to risk management. Integrative action plans should be implemented to
protect human health more effectively. Transferring resources to LMICs is crucial to reducing risk
and vulnerability and ultimately to enhancing the resilience of populations as the climate changes.
