Chapter 5. Indigenous Ways of Knowing
This chapter looks at how Indigenous peoples' traditional knowledge, skills and practices,
passed down from generation to generation, play a vital role in understanding climate action.
Indigenous peoples have been, and are leaders, of climate action; their roles in monitoring
climate change impacts and the environmental effects on their traditional lands and waters play
a critical part in our fight against climate change (NRCan p.117).
There is a great deal that we can learn from how Indigenous peoples have lived sustainably with
the Land for countless generations. Indigenous peoples have adapted by travelling throughout
their Land in creating a balance with food sources and balancing resource use, depending on
the season. We need to listen carefully to better understand how Traditional knowledge, and its
application, contribute to environmental sustainability and planning for the future. According to
the NRCAN report, incorporating diverse perspectives and sources of knowledge, such as
Indigenous Knowledge Systems, is also imperative for effective adaptation (NRCan all
chapters).

The National Issues Report identifies four key strengths of Indigenous and local knowledge
systems (NRCan p.118) in the context of understanding and responding to climate change,
including:
1.
understanding, monitoring and recording climate change impacts;
2.
enhancing adaptive capacity and building resilience;
3.
supporting sustainable risk reduction strategies; and
4.
informing decision-making and policy change.
In this inquiry, we suggest activities, books, and resources that explore various examples of
these Indigenous Ways of Knowing and how the teachings and learning is passed on from one
generation to the next. Indigenous communities have their own experts, elders, knowledge
keepers and ways of knowing; their knowledge is a valuable and essential resource for learning
how to adapt to climate change (NRCan.p.131). Indigenous Ways of Knowing is knowledge that
we need to value so we can learn what they understand to help the climate conversation and
actively seek it to guide us (NRCan p.115).
Mi’kmaq Elder Albert Marshall coined the phrase Etuaptmumk/“two-eyed seeing” this way:
(2004)
“I, you and we need to learn to see from one eye with the best or the strengths in the
Indigenous knowledges and ways of knowing… and learn to see from your other eye with the
best or the strengths in the (Western) knowledges and ways of knowing… but most
importantly, I, you, and we need to learn to see with both eyes together, for the benefit of all.”

Background Information for Educators  (Background info from ELWW 7-12)
The rapid and profound climate changes are putting lands and territories of many Indigenous
communities (Metis, Inuit and First Nations) on the front lines of mitigation and adaptation
efforts. According to Terry Teegee, regional chief of the BC Assembly of First Nations,
Indigenous communities are often the first to experience the impacts of climate change.
Indigenous communities have a strong dependence on and close relationship to the
environment and its resources. Threats to Indigenous ways of life due to the changing climate
are complex and wide-reaching. Specific experiences vary considerably based on the area or
region in which communities are located. One of the general impacts that climate change is
4
having on Indigenous communities in Canada includes an increased risk of physical harm
associated with traditions or activities including hunting and fishing. (NRC p.131) Very
experienced harvesters are being forced to alter hunting strategies and take into consideration
the lack of rescue facilities available (Canadian Geographic Indigenous Atlas of Canada).
Therefore many people are also experiencing a loss of food security in part due to altered
animal migration patterns as well as human travel routes impacting people's ability to access
country foods. Indigenous people may be experiencing threatened sovereignty and a loss of
communities and culturally significant locations due to rising sea levels, flooding, coastal
erosion, and melting permafrost. “Climate change impacts are dependent on a number of
connected factors that are rooted in specific places. As a result, climate change is impacting
individuals and communities in rural and remote areas across Canada in many different ways. It
is important that place-based knowledge systems—including local and Indigenous
Knowledge—be drawn upon in understanding and responding to climate change impacts. Both
local knowledge and Indigenous Knowledge Systems are based on long-term, ongoing
relationships between people and their natural environments. Such knowledge can provide
useful insights on changing climatic conditions and on the lived experiences of those affected by
climate change.” (NRCAN p.118)
How does climate change disproportionately affect Indigenous communities?
Indigenous people in Northern communities have historically demonstrated an incredible ability
to adapt to varied and changing circumstances.  However, as the impacts of climate change
intensify, successful adaptation becomes increasingly challenging. When considering climate
change and its effect on Canadian citizens, it is imperative to acknowledge the social and
cultural inequalities that exist when it comes to contribution, mitigation and adaptation. For
instance, according to the Government of Nunavut, despite the small contribution made by a
territory like Nunavut to national greenhouse gas emissions, the effects of the global excess are
felt heavily by the citizens.
Impacts and path forward in The Arctic - Inuit Peoples
According to the IPCC (2019), the cryosphere changes in the Canadian Arctic have negatively
impacted human health in several key ways. There have been dramatic increases in food and
waterborne diseases, malnutrition, injury and serious mental health challenges especially
among Indigenous people. Additionally, Indigenous peoples and other Arctic residents have had
to change the timing of various activities in response to seasonal changes and safety of travel
on ice, land and snow. Some coastal communities have planned for relocation due to failures
associated with flooding and thawing permafrost. According to the IPCC, "limited funding, skills,
capacity and institutional support to engage meaningfully in planning processes have
challenged adaptation." Inuit people have used and occupied Arctic and Subarctic Land, ice and
water for thousands of years, documenting use and reliance on the Land and waters for many
generations. It is imperative to recognize the critical role that Inuit people must play in
developing adaptation and mitigation strategies to address the many complex challenges that
define the Canadian North. 
Moving Away from indigenous stereotypes ('passive witnesses,' media portrayal)  
5
First Nations people have been and continue to be leaders in the fight against climate change.
Inuit leaders brought warnings about the impacts of climate change to the international stage as
far back as the Earth Summit in 1992. There are many groups working towards reconciliation in
Canada that recognize the leadership of Indigenous cultures when it comes to sustainability as
a central tenet of their relationship with the environment (Sustainable Canada Dialogues). ”Local
and Indigenous Knowledge are key to adaptation and understanding climate impacts. Residents
of rural and remote communities have a strong connection to the environments that they
depend on for their livelihood, sustenance, well-being and way of life. Place-based knowledge
systems, including local and Indigenous Knowledge, and lived experience are key to
understanding and adapting to climate change impacts in rural and remote communities and
areas.” (NRCAN p.117)
Due to the unique context of Indigenous rights and impacts, (governance, economy,
infrastructure and activities) many wide-spread solutions that policy makers have put forward do
not acknowledge that Indigenous communities are already engaged in important climate change
mitigation strategies that are deeply rooted in Indigenous customs and traditional practices (ICA,
2019). In many ways, Indigenous knowledge and practices can be an incredible resource for
learning strategies to adapt to climate change (NRCAN p.117). It is important to think critically
about the sources from which we gather information on indigenous rights. In too many
instances, a biased version of an event is told and shared widely through the media;
stereotyping indigenous activists and protestors, misconstruing actions and portraying a radical,
negative picture to the general public. 
According to the 2018 Indigenous Climate Action Report, the implications of culturally
embedded perspectives are significant: National "Environmental" policies often ask relatively
narrow questions about how to reduce emissions and mitigate or stall damage, whereas
Indigenous water walkers, for example, are asking us, "How do we get to a spiritually grounded
and more fully integrated way of life where we can swim, eat and drink from uncontaminated
lakes and rivers?" There is a great deal that we can learn from the way that Indigenous people
have lived harmoniously and sustainably with the Land for many years. Indigenous perspectives
should be a centra; a voice for policymakers and citizens of Canada to hear as we are adapting
and developing sustainable communities of the future.
General Introduction to the inquiries in this chapter:
Indigenous Ways of Knowing
This chapter offers three different structured and scaffolded inquiries to support Indigenous
Ways of Knowing. Indigenous People have passed on traditional knowledge from one
generation to the next to learn to live sustainably with the Land. These enquiries explore various
examples of these Indigenous Ways of Knowing and how the teachings and learning are passed
on from one generation to the next. Each of the three inquiries begins with a provocation
followed by numerous strategies and examples. These explorations can be completed in their
entirety as written; however, because we know inquiry is an organic and fluid process based on
student input, educators may wish to take aspects of each of the ideas presented and adapt,
modify or replace what’s suggested to create their inquiry with their class.  Therefore, it is
6
suggested that teachers review the whole chapter first to determine and plan what works best
with their particular group of learners.
The following three inquiries are connected to curricular concepts, as shown in this chart. These
curricular concepts are applicable across Canada.

Land Acknowledgement
Begin the inquiry by offering a land acknowledgment and discussing why we acknowledge the
land. It is essential to teach students that we must recognize the Indigenous land that the
school is on to learn about and from it.
As educators, recognizing that these lands are the traditional territories of Indigenous people
and that all Canadians benefit from the land plays an essential role in modelling reconciliatory
behaviour with your students. Reciting your school's land acknowledgement helps create a
foundation in students for learning about and from Indigenous people whose land we live on.
A land acknowledgement reinforces that we benefit from the land, and we all have a
responsibility to actively work towards honouring Indigenous Peoples as equal partners in
sharing the land. Land acknowledgments are only one step in cultivating greater respect for
and inclusion of Indigenous Peoples, with the understanding of the importance of our Treaty
responsibilities.

perspectives and connections to land and place as we work towards reconciliation to address
the Calls to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, particularly the call to
"integrate Indigenous knowledge and teaching methods into classrooms" (clause 62) and
"build student capacity for intercultural understanding, empathy and mutual respect" (clause
63).
Sharing stories is a way of sharing knowledge among Indigenous communities. Your classroom
materials should be culturally diverse and inclusive of Canada's three distinct Indigenous
groups. Here are a few examples of children's books that illustrate the importance of learning
from our Elders and include the three distinct Indigenous groups.

Teaching and discussing controversial and sensitive topics is essential because it helps
students think in-depth and fosters critical thinking. Many issues involving First Nation,
Métis and Inuit peoples are controversial (land claims, self-government, blockades,
hunting and fishing rights) or sensitive (residential schools, worldview). Building in and
addressing controversial or sensitive topics at an early age allows students to explore
and question in the safety of the classroom. Teachers may use some of the suggested
questions in this inquiry to introduce more sensitive issues regarding the inequalities
faced by Indigenous People.  Please keep in mind that Acts of Reconciliation and
Reclamation are fundamental as we move forward as a country.  Our acknowledgement,
and inclusion of Indigenous literature and media helps to create an understanding of the
history, diversity, and issues that many Indigenous peoples face.
It would be helpful for the learners to understand that traditional/cultural knowledge is passed as
an: I Do, We Do, You Do model.  This mentorship model provides the close watching and
coaching of the learner by the teacher.  This model would aid in learning from mistakes, as well
as identifying areas of strength and need for reflection.  This helps the person who is learning of
how knowledge is passed on, to connect with the sacredness of our relationship with Creator,
Mother Earth, the plants, animals, and all other animate and inanimate beings as part of the
Creators making. (Daniel Sylvestre)
A. Provocation 1: Book
To hook student interest, use the following provocation to initiate student thinking.
Book - Read aloud the Elders are Watching by David Bouchard or watch online
2
As Native elders have advised from time immemorial, this is a gentle plea to respect the
natural environment. A plea to respect the natural treasures of our environment and a
message of concern from indigenous leaders of the past to the people of the new millennium,
The Elder Are Watching has both a timelessness and an urgency that must be heard.
Vickers, Roy Henry, Cover Illustrations, The Elders are Watching by Bouchard, David, Raincoast Books, 2003
As you read the book, help students become aware of the knowledge, information and guidance
older people such as Elders, Knowledge Keepers, grandparents, teachers, uncles, aunts, or
mentors can offer. Students should be made aware that one must earn the right to become an
Elder or Knowledge Keeper in a First Nations community. Not all Elders or Knowledge Keepers
are seniors, nor are all old people Elders, and some Elders are younger. Elders or Knowledge
Keepers are honoured because they have gifts of insight and understanding and are willing to
share their knowledge. Discuss the role Elders or Knowledge Keepers play in Indigenous
communities, provide picture books and other media that illustrate the connection Indigenous
People have with the land to enhance the learning.
Discussion questions
⮚
What do you think the author means by The Elders are Watching?
⮚
What is an Elder or Knowledge Keeper? And what are they watching in this book?
⮚
Elders are often considered wise and share their Indigenous Knowledge, can you
explain why?
⮚
Identify one of the messages that the author is trying to portray in his book.
⮚
The last visual of the online book identifies different indigenous People. Name three
distinct Indigenous groups in Canada*?
⮚
Do all Indigenous People share the same traditions and knowledge*? In what ways do
Indigenous peoples continue to pass on traditional knowledge from generation to
generation?
⮚
Why is it important to hear the views and stories of other people?
⮚
Who do you have in your life that you would consider an Elder?
⮚
How do you show respect to your parents or other adults? How do you think respect is
shown in Indigenous cultures? Why do people not always respect Indigenous
knowledge?
⮚
Do you have an Elder, a grandparent, an uncle, an aunt or a mentor that shares
knowledge with you about the land, family traditions, family recipes?
* Cultural diversity within the Indigenous people is frequently misinterpreted. There is a
misconception that Indigenous People are one group who share the same culture, traditions,
language and knowledge. Take the time to identify the three distinct Indigenous groups—First
Nations, Metis and Inuit—and their unique connections to the land. Understand that these three
3
distinct groups are identified by the Federal Government, that each Indigenous group on Turtle
Island is distinct and that they all have their own distinct culture, traditions, language,
governance, education, laws, customs, and ways of knowing.  A small step students can take in
respecting Indigenous people, and their culture is learning the three Indigenous groups and their
unique traditions and knowledge.
B. Question Generation
At this point in the inquiry, we want to harness students' curiosity and build off of the
provocations that have captured their interest by generating meaningful questions to continue to
drive the learning process. This section will outline several pathways for question generation
depending on the provocation(s) that your class engaged with. 
⮚
5W's and H Questions - Students will be able to ask and answer questions using the
five Ws and an H (who, what, when, where, why, and how) to show understanding of key
details in a text.
⮚
Lead a whole-group discussion and brainstorm around the book's theme with the goal of
students generating questions about the role of Elders, their Indigenous Ways of
knowing and the message they are sharing with the readers
⮚
With younger students, review the pictures in the book and have them think about what
questions they would ask? Use the Creative Question Starts thinking routine to help
students generate a list of interesting questions.
⮚
Older students can work independently using the Ask Questions template to help
develop questions that provoke thinking and inquiry
Possible Questions
⮚Who do you have in your life that you would consider an Elder? Grandparent,
coach, teacher, uncle, aunt or mentor? What important things do you learn from
this adult?
⮚What do we need to know about the land to live on it? What do indigenous
People teach us about the land?
⮚How can knowledge from Elders help scientists study climate change?
⮚How can we apply the Elders understandings of sustainability to reduce the
effects of climate change?
⮚What can we learn from Elders to help us live sustainably in the face of climate
change?
⮚What messages are Elders trying to share? What changes have Elders seen in
life on the land?
⮚Research different ways Indigenous people have used their knowledge of living
things to meet their own needs.
⮚How has the weather affected the Elders’ community?
4
⮚What are some of the changes in birds, animals and insects in yours and other
communities?
⮚How have the weather patterns changed in the community?
⮚Can you identify some other pressing environmental issues that are currently
taking place in Canada? (Pipelines, clean drinking water in Northern
communities)
C. Knowledge Building  
At this stage, students may be ready to engage in a group knowledge-building activity. It will
encourage students to open their minds to many alternative ways of thinking about the
provocations and the ideas generated thus far in the inquiry process.
Community Expert - Sharing knowledge and storytelling is an integral part of Indigenous culture,
and a visit from an Elder is an excellent way to bring this experience to students. Indigenous
Elders, Knowledge Keepers and Cultural Advisors play a central role in Indigenous
communities; they are teachers within and beyond their communities. Elders, Knowledge
Keepers and Cultural Advisors are not self-taught individuals. They have been gifted with their
respective teachings by other Elders or Knowledge Keepers, typically over years of mentorship
and teaching.
⮚
Connect with your school's Indigenous Education department to speak to an Indigenous
education specialist and enquire about education or cultural programs available.  Also, to
inquire about who you can utilize in your classroom/school for the curricular concepts
that you feel need connections to Indigenous ways of knowing that will enhance inquiry
into environmental sustainability and relationships with Mother Earth.
⮚
Observe appropriate protocols and acknowledgements when including elders and
knowledge keepers in your school/classroom.
⮚
Plan a field trip that fosters a greater understanding of Indigenous Ways of Knowing.
In Indigenous cultures, the Elder is highly regarded as a role model in their community and is
considered the keeper of knowledge. A gift must be prepared by the person requesting the visit
and offered to the Elder at the time of the request. For more information regarding Elder
Wisdom in the Classroom
Umbrella Questions Brainstorm some umbrella questions with your students. An umbrella
question is developed to help ground the inquiry. The question should be focused – it's not
5
aiming to answer all aspects of an issue. The question should be of interest to the students and
also connect to the topic of the inquiry.
⮚
Who do you have in your life that you would consider an Elder? Grandparent, coach,
teacher, uncle, aunt or mentor? What important things do you learn from this adult?
⮚
How can the knowledge that the Elders share in the story help us learn about
climate change?
⮚
How can we apply the Elders understandings of sustainability to reduce the effects
of climate change?
⮚
What can we learn from Elders to help us live sustainably in the face of climate
change?
⮚
What are the Elders observing and learning by the changing seasons?
⮚
What wisdom and warnings are the Elders sharing regarding ways people are
abusing the land and resources?
⮚
What impact do people have on the land? How does that make you feel?
⮚
What type of knowledge did Elders need to know about their environment to survive
in it for thousands of years?
⮚
Can you create a list of the different things Indigenous people learned about to
survive on the land?
⮚
Can you identify some other pressing environmental issues that are currently taking
place in Canada? (Pipelines, clean drinking water in Northern communities)
⮚Research different ways Indigenous people have used their knowledge of
living things to meet their own needs.
⮚
What types of change have most affected First Nations, Métis and Inuit people?
Identify the changes for each distinct Indigenous group.
⮚
What can First Nations, Métis and Inuit peoples teach other Canadians about
sustainability?
D. Determining Understanding 
Use responses to inform and guide the learning process. They can provide insight into which
concepts need clarity, what many students are already well informed about, and a general
direction that many students want to pursue.
Knowledge Building Circles - A Knowledge Building Circle is a class discussion activity that is
specifically reserved for working out students' questions and ideas. The aim of the circle is to
help all students to improve their understandings as they share their learning, ideas and ask
questions, This communal activity deepens students' understanding through increased
exposure to the diverse perspectives of the class. The KBC aligns with the Indigenous
time-honoured tradition of the Talking Circle where individuals take turns sharing ideas.
6
With younger students, begin by viewing the book The Sharing Circle by elder and author
Theresa "Corky" Larsen-Jonasson. During your knowledge-building circle, use a talking stick
so students listen and share respectfully. The student holding the talking stick, and only that
student, is designated as having the right to share while the other students listen quietly and
respectfully. This Indigenous cultural tradition is used during ceremonies, storytelling and
sharing experiences with Elders.
Here is an example of Putting the Talking Stick into practice - use during speaking and
listening activities to allow students to interact with others, contribute to a class goal, share
ideas and opinions, and solve problems. Making a Talking Stick for the class.
Some Indigenous peoples use a rock when having a talking circle.  This connects students to
Grandfather Rock teachings, and to our connection with Mother Earth and our Ancestors.  We
seek guidance and wisdom when we include a rock in our talking circles, to ensure we are
moving forward in a good way, as Creator intended us to be, Kind and Compassionate.
KWHLAQ Chart – Have students complete a KWHLAQ chart. The chart provides teachers with
information regarding the student's learning process. The chart asks the following questions:
●
K – What students already KNOW about Indigenous ways of knowing or Elders?
●
W – WHAT students want to learn about Elders ways of knowing?
●
H – HOW they will research or find the information they want to learn?
●
L – What students have LEARNED about Indigenous knowledge after taking action?
●
A – How will students APPLY the Indigenous knowledge they've learned?
●
Q – What QUESTIONS do they still have or have thought of as a result of this inquiry?
E. Pursuing Learning
At this stage, students may begin research to pursue their umbrella questions, or some of the
following activities could be integrated into the process to ensure that students have an
understanding of foundational climate science. The activities listed below will enrich the
understanding of climate change.
Indigenous peoples have been and are leaders of climate action; their role in monitoring climate
change impacts and the environmental effects on traditional lands and waters play a critical part
in our fight against climate change. There is a great deal that we can learn from how Indigenous
peoples have lived sustainably with the Land for many years. They have adapted by travelling
7
throughout their Land in search of food and other resources depending on the seasons. We
need to listen carefully to better understand the value of Traditional knowledge and its
contribution to sustainability and planning for the future. Indigenous communities have their own
experts, elders, knowledge keepers and ways of knowing; their knowledge is an essential
resource for learning how to adapt to climate change. We need to value what they can bring to
the climate conversation and actively seek it to guide us.
Watch Norma’s Story an animated true tale of the profound effects of climate change on the
environment, culture and food security on the people and wildlife of the Arctic. What happens
when we do not respect the land, the environment?
Natural Inquirer – students use interview techniques to research and write about an animal or
plant affected by climate change
Arctic Survivor - Students role-play polar bears and the habitat components of food, water,
shelter and space to understand how polar bear populations are affected by changes in their
habitat. In the second part of the game, some possible impacts of climate change on the Arctic
habitat of polar bears are explored.
Climate Connections - Bring news reports of weather events that have happened in the world.
Discuss with the students the impact these events may have had on local habitats. Use the
climate connection picture cards to play a variety of non-competitive games that explore
connections between human actions, climate change, and positive and negative impacts on
wildlife habitat.
Observing Change - In this outdoor activity, students will complete a series of neighbourhood
walks with an observation chart over a period of a few months to predict and observe changes
in living and non-living components of the local ecosystems in order to understand the impact of
weather, climate and climate change. Discuss how humans can impact habitats in positive and
negative ways (e.g., provide water for plants; create diverse habitats in gardens; remove native
plants and in the process, risk destroying habitat for native animals; pollute water and soil, etc.).
Help the students to identify how to show respect for the environment and what actions they can
take to positively affect the school environment.
F. Consolidation
This step is designed to encourage students to integrate and synthesize key ideas. When
students make connections and see relationships within and across lessons, this helps them to
solidify knowledge and deepen understanding.
Doodling/Sketching
●
Share news reports of major weather events that have happened in the community,
province, country or the world. Discuss with the students the impact these events may
8
have had on local habitats, cities, towns, ecosystems. Have students make a now and
then community comparison picture.
Consolidation Discussion
●
Ensure that every student can describe what they did, why they did it, and what they
found out regarding Indigenous Ways of Knowing or the importance of listening to and
respecting Elders wisdom.
Think-Pair-Share
●
Have students write a thank-you letter to the land, the seasons, Elders, grandparents or
other adults who teach them things about your culture or nature. Describe how and why
you are thankful.
●
Students reflect on their learning by reading their letter or sharing their picture/sketch
and simply turn around and share with one other person
Assessment Ideas
●
Tableau - In this activity, students create a still picture, without talking, to capture and
communicate the meaning of a concept. Students must truly understand the meaning of
a concept or idea to communicate it using physical poses, gestures, and facial
expressions rather than words. Use Tableau to check for understanding or see what new
insights students have gained during the inquiry.
●
Assess students' knowledge and understanding by inviting them to write a text about an
Elder in their life
●
Invite students to brainstorm the teachings that their elders have shared with them and
how these teachings connect us with others, the land, histories, and our ancestors (to
show we are accountable and that our decisions that we make affect others and the
future generations).
●
Assess students thank you letters to verify the learning between Elders and the land
●
Connect with another class/school in the Arctic virtually. Learn how climate change is
affecting their schoolyard and community and how their elders share knowledge with
them.
●
Students could write letters, send emails to pen pals or connect virtually to other
classrooms around the globe to explore and explain how climate change affects their
communities explaining how climate change affects their community
●
Have students create a poster informing how Mother Earth provides for them and what
they can do to protect her. Share the posters with other students by posting them on the
classroom bulletin board or in the school hallway/entryway.
9
●
Gather evidence of learning with observations, thumbs up thumbs down, listening to
conversations, anecdotal notes and comments, rough drafts
●
Conference with students - conversations can also include written evidence such as
journals in which educators can read what students have to say about their learning
rather than listening
●
Have older students complete a What I Learned Today self-assessment
(eftoassessments.ca)
●
Have students express different ways to act in forests, parks, and other natural areas to
show you respect the land in the medium of their choice.
Take Action:
Allowing time for students to take action is an essential part of the learning process on climate
change, as it empowers students and eases their eco-anxiety. Ask the students what they
want to do to positively impact climate change. List their ideas and come up with a plan to put
their action in place.
Ideas for Taking Action:
●
Create a video or presentation urging others to take action. Presentations can be in the
classroom or at a school assembly
●
Have students create a poster informing how Mother Earth provides for them and what
they can do to protect her. Share the posters with other students by posting them in the
school hallway
●
Organize a Cleanup in your schoolyard or nearby park
●
Bottled water-free day: educate your school about bottled water and its impact on the
environment. Commit to reducing the use of bottled water at school and consider selling
reusable water bottles for students to purchase as a fundraiser.
●
Waste-free lunches: school lunches are a significant source of waste in schools. Reduce
the amount of food and packaging waste heading to the landfill by hosting a waste-free
lunch day. Take it a step further and host these days regularly on "Trashless Tuesdays"
or "Wasteless Wednesdays".
●
Have regular “No-Tech” days.  Encourage the understanding of how tech usage has an
invisible drain on our electric infrastructure.  Also include the need for our reliance upon
our local environments, as opposed to a virtual one.  This will help our students mental
and physical health, to ensure that they can “turn-off” to reflect and recharge without
distraction.

Walk for water - When senior students at Seven Oaks Met School learned that the local
community of Shoal Lake 40 First Nation (the very community where most of Winnipeg's
drinking water is sourced!) has been under a boil water advisory for over 20 years, they
were inspired to take action. They organized speakers and elders from Winnipeg and
Shoal Lake to educate the audience about the water crisis. The event raised over $7,000
for the Shoal Lake 40 First Nation community and spread awareness across the region.

The Shaughnessy Medicine Wheel Garden in Winnipeg was designed as a teaching
garden, incorporating the medicine wheel's circle teachings, including fire, Water, air, and
Earth. The plants and flowers reflect these elements and colours in each quadrant and
feature Manitoba's traditional medicines and indigenous plants. Thirteen boulders
encircle the garden to represent the 13 moons of the year, and seven cedar benches will
represent the seven teachings. Providing an outdoor learning space for students and a
natural setting to enjoy the environment for the local community.

MMHS Arboretum, Community, Indigenous and Medicinal Plant Gardens Students, staff,
community members and partners began planting trees, shrubs and wildflowers at
Milliken Mills High School in 1994. Since that time, the arboretum and associated
gardens have been enhanced and have flourished. This year we have made every effort
to expand the nature of the gardens with an interpretive guide created by students
across the curriculum. This, while the physical and plant make-up of the garden
continues to evolve. This year, despite the challenges of face-to-face learning and
participation, we established the indigenous medicinal plant garden and created a strong
cross-departmental partnership in the school, which will see the roots truly become
shoots as the project will become stewarded through teamwork.
●
The Herb Campbell Public School has created a visual landscape plan for a Medicine
Wheel Garden Outdoor Classroom on our school site, which includes: A centred
medicine wheel garden with indigenous plants surrounded by stone seating and an
outdoor classroom frame; 9 local food gardens including six raised-bed gardens (for
herbs, vegetables, fruit, and edible flowers) and three in-ground gardens (a Three
Sisters garden, an indigenous berry garden, and a pumpkin patch); 4 outer garden areas
with indigenous plants, shrubs, and trees connected to the four cardinal directions of our
centred Medicine Wheel Garden; A wildlife observation/inquiry area with feeders, water
supply, and log stump seating; Interpretative learning signs; Pathways connecting to our
natural forest, meadow, and wetland habitats and other planting areas.
●
Oak Park Outdoor Indigenous Learning Place created an outdoor Indigenous learning
space that allows students, staff, and the community to connect with nature and
celebrate Indigenous culture, tradition, and teaching. This project has many
stakeholders, including Indigenous and non-Indigenous students, Indigenous knowledge
keepers (academics, community members, Elders), and various divisional staff. To have
all staff and students embrace Indigenous ways of knowing, doing, and being; to
enhance our Indigenous students' engagement and success in school. Having a
teaching space in front of our school demonstrates our commitment to our school goal
and reconciliation. It will also create endless opportunities for teaching and learning that
honours, centres, and celebrates Indigenous culture.

Land Acknowledgement
Begin the inquiry by offering a land acknowledgment and discussing why we acknowledge
the land. It is essential to teach students that we must recognize the Indigenous land that
the school is on to learn about and from it.
As educators, recognizing that these lands are the traditional territories of Indigenous
people and that all Canadians benefit from the land plays an essential role in modelling
reconciliatory behaviour with your students. Reciting your school's land acknowledgement
helps create a foundation in students for learning about and from Indigenous people whose
land we live on.
A land acknowledgement reinforces that we benefit from the land, and we all have a
responsibility to actively work towards honouring Indigenous Peoples as equal partners in
sharing the land. Land acknowledgments are only one step in cultivating greater respect
for and inclusion of Indigenous Peoples, with the understanding of the importance of our
Treaty responsibilities.
Chapter 5 Indigenous Ways of Knowing recognizes the importance of Indigenous
perspectives and connections to land and place as we work towards reconciliation to
address the Calls to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, particularly the
call to "integrate Indigenous knowledge and teaching methods into classrooms" (clause
62) and "build student capacity for intercultural understanding, empathy and mutual
respect" (clause 63).
Sharing stories is a way of sharing knowledge among Indigenous communities. Your
classroom materials should be culturally diverse and inclusive of Canada's three distinct
Indigenous groups. Here are a few examples of children's books that illustrate the importance
of learning from our Elders and include the three distinct Indigenous groups.

Teaching and discussing controversial and sensitive topics is essential because it helps
students think in-depth and fosters critical thinking. Many issues involving First Nation,
Métis and Inuit peoples are controversial (land claims, self-government, blockades,
hunting and fishing rights) or sensitive (residential schools, worldview). Building in and
addressing controversial or sensitive topics at an early age allows students to explore
and question in the safety of the classroom. Teachers may use some of the suggested
questions in this inquiry to introduce more sensitive issues regarding the inequalities
faced by Indigenous People.  Please keep in mind that Acts of Reconciliation and
Reclamation are fundamental as we move forward as a country.  Our acknowledgement,
and inclusion of Indigenous literature and media helps to create an understanding of the
history, diversity, and issues that many Indigenous peoples face.
It would be helpful for the learners to understand that traditional/cultural knowledge is passed as
an: I Do, We Do, You Do model.  This mentorship model provides the close watching and
coaching of the learner by the teacher.  This model would aid in learning from mistakes, as well
as identifying areas of strength and need for reflection.  This helps the person who is learning of
how knowledge is passed on, to connect with the sacredness of our relationship with Creator,
Mother Earth, the plants, animals, and all other animate and inanimate beings as part of the
Creators making. (Daniel Sylvestre)
A. Provocation 2: Video
To hook student interest, use the following provocation to initiate student thinking.
Video – Maq and the Spirit of the Woods by Phyllis Grant
Maq and the Spirit of the Woods is the story of Maq, a Mi’kmaq boy who realizes his potential
with the help of inconspicuous mentors. When an elder in the community offers him a small
piece of pipestone, Maq carves a little person out of it. Proud of his work, the boy wants to
impress his grandfather and journeys through the woods to find him. Indigenous people
traditionally honour their elders. Their life experiences, combined with the knowledge passed
on from previous generations, make them experts and teachers. This information was not
2
written down but passed down orally to each generation. Maq and his grandfather have a
close relationship where they can speak honestly, respectfully and with empathy.
Phyllis Grant, “ Maq and the Spirit of the Woods”, NFB. 2006,8 mins
After viewing, discuss with students the importance of the knowledge, information and guidance
older people such as Elders, Knowledge Keepers, grandparents, teachers, uncles, aunts, or
mentors can offer. Students should be made aware that one must earn the right to become an
Elder or Knowledge Keeper in a First Nations community. Not all Elders or Knowledge Keepers
are seniors, nor are all old people Elders, and some Elders are younger. Elders and Knowledge
Keepers are honoured because they have gifts of insight and understanding and are willing to
share their knowledge. Discuss the role Elders or Knowledge Keepers play in Indigenous
communities, provide picture books and other media that illustrate the connection Indigenous
People have with the land to enhance the learning.
Post viewing discussion questions
⮚
What lessons did Maq learn along his journey? How did Maq develop his self-confidence
during his trip?
⮚
Maq is a Mi’kmaq boy. Which distinct Indigenous group is Mi’kmaq?
⮚
Name three distinct Indigenous groups in Canada*?
⮚
Do all Indigenous People share the same traditions and knowledge*? In what ways do
Indigenous peoples continue to pass on traditional knowledge from generation to
generation?
⮚
Who do you have in your life that you would consider an Elder? What are the virtues that
they practice and live by?
⮚
Elders are often considered wise and share their Indigenous Knowledge, can you
explain why?
⮚
Why is it important to hear the views and stories of other people? What lessons can we
learn from Elder's storytelling?
⮚
Who do you have in your life that you would consider an Elder? What qualities do they
have that show they are humble, obedient, and have respect?
⮚
How do you show respect to your parents or other adults? How do you think respect is
shown in Indigenous cultures? Why do people not always respect Indigenous
knowledge?
⮚
Do you have an Elder, a grandparent, an uncle, an aunt or a mentor that shares
knowledge with you about the land, family traditions, family recipes?
3
*Cultural diversity within the Indigenous people is frequently misinterpreted. There is a
misconception that Indigenous People are one group who share the same culture, traditions,
language and knowledge. Take the time to identify the three distinct Indigenous groups—First
Nations, Metis and Inuit—and their unique connections to the land. Understand that these 3
distinct groups are identified by the Federal Government, that each Indigenous group on Turtle
Island is distinct and that they all have their own distinct culture, traditions, language,
governance, education, laws, customs, and ways of knowing.  A small step students can take in
respecting Indigenous people, and their culture is learning the three Indigenous groups and their
unique traditions and knowledge.
B. Question Generation
At this point in the inquiry, we want to harness students' curiosity and build off of the
provocations that have captured their interest by generating meaningful questions to continue to
drive the learning process. This section will outline several pathways for question generation
depending on the provocation(s) that your class engaged with. 
KWL Chart – Have students use a KWL chart to organize their learning during the question
generation activity. In the first section, What We Know, students will activate prior knowledge,
lessons they have learned or memories spent with grandparents, Elders, adults, uncles, aunts,
teachers. Students can complete the What we Know section individually or in small groups.
kwl chart handout, www.facinghistory.org
2017
In the second section of the template, What do you want to know about Indigenous Ways of
Knowing or What do we want to know about learning from our Elders, some students may not
know where to begin if they don't have much background knowledge on this subject. To help
generate questions, use the 5W's and H Questions - Students will be able to ask and answer
questions using the five W's and an H (who, what, when, where, why, and how) to show
understanding of key details of the video.
4
Think, Puzzle, Explore is similar to a KWL chart; it activates students' prior knowledge and helps
them generate questions and stimulates their curiosity. This thinking routine provides you with a
snapshot of what students may already know about the subject or topic.
Possible Questions
⮚
Who do you have in your life that you would consider an Elder? Grandparent, coach,
teacher, uncle, aunt or mentor? What important things do you learn from this adult?

Canada?
Take time to explore and research
5
C. Knowledge Building  
At this stage, students may be ready to engage in a group knowledge-building activity. It will
encourage students to open their minds to many alternative ways of thinking about the
provocations and the ideas generated thus far in the inquiry process.
Complete a Gallery Walk. Invite students to draw a picture of something they have learned from
an Elder. An Elder could be a grandparent, an uncle, an aunt or a mentor or teacher. Suggest to
the students that the drawing could represent a tradition/knowledge shared by the adult or
mentor. Display images on the classroom walls so they are easily visible to students. Have
students get up out of their seats and circulate the room.
The gallery walk can happen silently or be an opportunity for peer discussions or a writing
activity. During this activity, students can practice important discussion moves,
including building on each others' ideas, asking clarifying questions, respectfully agreeing and
disagreeing, and providing meaningful and actionable feedback.  Have students practice
being respectful when viewing other students' pictures; the diversity of cultures and
traditions in your classroom is an excellent opportunity for a teachable moment.
Provide an opportunity for students to share what they saw, thought, and wondered during the
Gallery walk. Students can look at the drawings silently while circulating, respond in
conversation with a gallery walk partner, or write their comments or questions on post-it notes
and paste them next to the drawings.
Umbrella Questions - Brainstorm some umbrella questions with your students. An umbrella
question is developed to help ground the inquiry. The question should be focused – it's not
aiming to answer all aspects of an issue. The question should be of interest to the students and
also connect to the topic of the inquiry.
⮚
How can the knowledge that the Elders share help us learn about climate change?
⮚
How can we apply the Elders understandings of sustainability to reduce the effects
of climate change?
⮚
What can we learn from Elders to help us live sustainably in the face of climate
change?
⮚
What are the Elders observing and learning by the changing seasons?
⮚
What wisdom and warnings are the Elders sharing regarding ways people are
abusing the land and resources?
⮚
What impact do people have on the land? How does that make you feel?
⮚
What type of knowledge did Elders need to know about their environment to survive
in it for thousands of years?
⮚
Can you create a list of the different things Indigenous people learned about to
survive on the land?
⮚
Can you identify some other pressing environmental issues that are currently taking
place in Canada? (Pipelines, clean drinking water in Northern communities)
6
⮚
Research different ways Indigenous people have used their knowledge of living
things to meet their own needs.
⮚
What types of change have most affected First Nations, Métis and Inuit people?
Identify the changes for each distinct Indigenous group.
⮚
What can First Nations, Métis and Inuit peoples teach other Canadians about
sustainability?
D. Determining Understanding 
Use responses to inform and guide the learning process. They can provide insight into which
concepts need clarity, what many students are already well informed about, and a general
direction that many students want to pursue.
Knowledge Building Circles - A Knowledge Building Circle is a class discussion activity that is
specifically reserved for working out students' questions and ideas. The aim of the circle is to
help all students to improve their understandings as they share their learning, ideas and ask
questions. This communal activity deepens students' understanding through increased
exposure to the diverse perspectives of the class. The KBC aligns with the Indigenous
time-honoured tradition of the Talking Circle where individuals take turns sharing ideas.
With younger students , begin by viewing the book The Sharing Circle by elder and author
Theresa "Corky" Larsen-Jonasson. During your knowledge-building circle, use a talking stick so
students listen and share respectfully. The student holding the talking stick, and only that
student, is designated as having the right to share while the other students listen quietly and
respectfully. This Indigenous cultural tradition is used during ceremonies, storytelling and
sharing experiences with Elders.
Here is an example of Putting the Talking Stick into practice - use during speaking and listening
activities to allow students to interact with others, contribute to a class goal, share ideas and
opinions, and solve problems. Making a Talking Stick for the class
Some Indigenous peoples use a rock when having a talking circle.  This connects students to
Grandfather Rock teachings, and to our connection with Mother Earth and our Ancestors.  We
seek guidance and wisdom when we include a rock in our talking circles, to ensure we are
moving forward in a good way, as Creator intended us to be, Kind and Compassionate.
3-2-1 Strategy – this strategy is an easy way to check for student's understanding and use their
responses to guide teaching decisions. 3-2-1 allows students to summarize their learning by
identifying three things they have learned about Indigenous Ways of Knowing, two things that
7
interest them about learning from Elders and that they would like to learn more about and one
question they still have about Indigenous Ways of Knowing
Concept Maps allow students to share their learning and knowledge with visual representations.
Encourage the students to draw, incorporate words, messages, ideas anything they have
learned about Indigenous Ways of Knowing. The concept map allows you to see how students
understand the content. Example below.
Indigenous Perspectives Mind Map
E. Pursuing Learning
At this stage, students may begin research to pursue their umbrella questions, or some of the
following activities could be integrated into the process to ensure that students have an
understanding of foundational climate science. The activities listed below will enrich the
understanding of climate change.
Indigenous peoples have been and are leaders of climate action; their role in monitoring
climate change impacts and the environmental effects on traditional lands and waters
play a critical part in our fight against climate change. There is a great deal that we can
learn from how Indigenous peoples have lived sustainably with the Land for many years.
They have adapted by travelling throughout their Land in search of food and other
resources depending on the seasons. We need to listen carefully to better understand
the value of Traditional knowledge and its contribution to sustainability and planning for
the future. Indigenous communities have their own experts, elders, knowledge keepers
and ways of knowing; their knowledge is an essential resource for learning how to adapt
8
to climate change. We need to value what they can bring to the climate conversation and
actively seek it to guide us.
Watch Norma’s Story an animated true tale of the profound effects of climate change on the
environment, culture and food security on the people and wildlife of the Arctic.
These next two outdoor activities can help students understand the essential question How can
Indigenous Ways of Knowing help scientists study climate change?
The Walking Curriculum provides the opportunity to take your students outdoors. The suggested
walks introduce an indigenous perspective to the learning activities. For example, the What's
Under Foot Walk relates the walk to Indigenous Peoples sense of the interconnectedness of all
things. There is an understanding of the importance of taking care of the land and it will take
care of you. Indigenous knowledge tells of an understanding of life cycles, sustainable
harvesting practices and only taking what you need.
Strangers in a Strange Land – helps students appreciate the value of traditional knowledge in
understanding the impacts of climate change on nature. Each student interviews several
long-term members of the community who have spent a lot of time out of doors. Then, have the
class share survey outcomes and compare and analyze the results. 
Have student list ways in which climate affects his or her community. For example, fall weather
brings salmon upstream and allows us to fish, winter snow makes it possible to ski, spring rain
floods the fields where we grow crops, the break-up of sea ice in summer brings bowhead
whales close to shore.
Encourage students to write down what they observe in their schoolyard, look at both the big
and the small, and examine plants, rocks, and insects up close. Have them make a record in
their journal of what they experience with each of their senses. Ask students to draw and label
their pictures. Have them note the changes during the different seasons at different times of the
year. Have them note/draw any changes they have observed over the school year and if the
changes were caused by climate change.
F. Consolidation
This step is designed to encourage students to integrate and synthesize key ideas. When
students make connections and see relationships within and across lessons, this helps them to
solidify knowledge and deepen understanding.
Triangle-Square-Circle - This strategy encourages students to reflect on their learning and
process information presented in this inquiry. This strategy should be used with the whole group
9
rather than as an independent task with the teacher charting ideas. Students share important
pieces of information they have learned during the inquiry and question anything they don't
completely understand.
1.
Draw a triangle - next to it write three important points from the video or Elders
2.
Draw a square - next to it write down anything that students agree with or squares with
their thinking
3.
Draw a circle - next to it write down anything that is still circling in their heads
Headlines – this activity allows students to reflect on their learning, understanding and beliefs.
They examine how and why their thinking has changed and come to some tentative
conclusions. What have the students learned from the video and activities throughout the
inquiry. Have students share their headlines and create a bulletin board to display the learning.
I used to think...but now I think this activity helps students reflect on their thinking about an issue
or topic and explore how and why their thinking has changed. It is important to encourage
students to reflect on their learning as they investigate the impacts of climate change through
diverse perspectives.
Assessment Ideas
Doodle it - Have students quickly draw a picture of what they understand instead of writing it.
Create a collective poster depicting what students have learned from the Elders, stories and
activities throughout the inquiry.
⮚
Assess students' knowledge and understanding by inviting them to write a text about an
Elder in their life
⮚
Invite students to brainstorm the teachings that their elders have shared with them and
how these teachings connect us with others, the land, histories, and our ancestors (to
show we are accountable and that our decisions that we make affect others and the
future generations).
⮚
Assess students thank you letters to verify the learning between Elders and the land
⮚
Connect with another class/school in the Arctic virtually. Learn how climate change is
affecting their schoolyard and community and how their elders share knowledge with
them.
⮚
Students could write letters, send emails to pen pals or connect virtually to other
classrooms around the globe to explore and explain how climate change affects their
communities explaining how climate change affects their community
⮚
Have students create a poster informing how Mother Earth provides for them and what
they can do to protect her. Share the posters with other students by posting them on the
classroom bulletin board or in the school hallway/entryway.
⮚
Gather evidence of learning with observations, thumbs up thumbs down, listening to
conversations, anecdotal notes and comments, rough drafts
10
⮚
Conference with students - conversations can also include written evidence such as
journals in which educators can read what students have to say about their learning
rather than listening
⮚
Have older students complete a What I Learned Today self-assessment
(eftoassessments.ca)
⮚
Have students express different ways to act in forests, parks, and other natural areas to
show you respect the land in the medium of their choice.
Take Action:
Allowing time for students to take action is an essential part of the learning process on climate
change, as it empowers students and eases their eco-anxiety. Ask the students what they
want to do to positively impact climate change. List their ideas and come up with a plan to put
their action in place.
Ideas for Taking Action:
Find a resource or field guide that describes how Indigenous communities have used plants for
medicine, food or cultural purposes.
●
Create a video or presentation urging others to take action. Presentations can be in the
classroom or at a school assembly
●
Have students create a poster informing how Mother Earth provides for them and what
they can do to protect her. Share the posters with other students by posting them in the
school hallway
●
Organize a Cleanup in your schoolyard or nearby park
●
Bottled water-free day: educate your school about bottled water and its impact on the
environment. Commit to reducing the use of bottled water at school and consider selling
reusable water bottles for students to purchase as a fundraiser.
●
Waste-free lunches: school lunches are a significant source of waste in schools. Reduce
the amount of food and packaging waste heading to the landfill by hosting a waste-free
lunch day. Take it a step further and host these days regularly on "Trashless Tuesdays"
or "Wasteless Wednesdays".
●
Have regular “No-Tech” days.  Encourage the understanding of how tech usage has an
invisible drain on our electric infrastructure.  Also include the need for our reliance upon
our local environments, as opposed to a virtual one.  This will help our students mental
and physical health, to ensure that they can “turn-off” to reflect and recharge without
distraction.

Walk for water - When senior students at Seven Oaks Met School learned that the local
community of Shoal Lake 40 First Nation (the very community where most of Winnipeg's
drinking water is sourced!) has been under a boil water advisory for over 20 years, they
were inspired to take action. They organized speakers and elders from Winnipeg and
Shoal Lake to educate the audience about the water crisis. The event raised over $7,000
for the Shoal Lake 40 First Nation community and spread awareness across the region.

Earth. The plants and flowers reflect these elements and colours in each quadrant and
feature Manitoba's traditional medicines and indigenous plants. Thirteen boulders
encircle the garden to represent the 13 moons of the year, and seven cedar benches will
represent the seven teachings. Providing an outdoor learning space for students and a
natural setting to enjoy the environment for the local community.

The Herb Campbell Public School has created a visual landscape plan for a Medicine
Wheel Garden Outdoor Classroom on our school site, which includes: A centred
medicine wheel garden with indigenous plants surrounded by stone seating and an
outdoor classroom frame; 9 local food gardens including six raised-bed gardens (for
herbs, vegetables, fruit, and edible flowers) and three in-ground gardens (a Three
Sisters garden, an indigenous berry garden, and a pumpkin patch); 4 outer garden areas
with indigenous plants, shrubs, and trees connected to the four cardinal directions of our
centred Medicine Wheel Garden; A wildlife observation/inquiry area with feeders, water
supply, and log stump seating; Interpretative learning signs; Pathways connecting to our
natural forest, meadow, and wetland habitats and other planting areas.

Land Acknowledgement
Begin the inquiry by offering a land acknowledgment and discussing why we acknowledge
the land. It is essential to teach students that we must recognize the Indigenous land that the
school is on to learn about and from it.
As educators, recognizing that these lands are the traditional territories of Indigenous people
and that all Canadians benefit from the land plays an essential role in modelling reconciliatory
behaviour with your students. Reciting your school's land acknowledgement helps create a
foundation in students for learning about and from Indigenous people whose land we live on.
A land acknowledgement reinforces that we benefit from the land, and we all have a
responsibility to actively work towards honouring Indigenous Peoples as equal partners in
sharing the land. Land acknowledgments are only one step in cultivating greater respect for
and inclusion of Indigenous Peoples, with the understanding of the importance of our Treaty
responsibilities.

Sharing stories is a way of sharing knowledge among Indigenous communities. Your classroom
materials should be culturally diverse and inclusive of Canada's three distinct Indigenous
groups. Here are a few examples of children's books that illustrate the importance of learning
from our Elders and include the three distinct Indigenous groups.

Teaching and discussing controversial and sensitive topics is essential because it helps
students think in-depth and fosters critical thinking. Many issues involving First Nation,
Métis and Inuit peoples are controversial (land claims, self-government, blockades,
hunting and fishing rights) or sensitive (residential schools, worldview). Building in and
addressing controversial or sensitive topics at an early age allows students to explore
and question in the safety of the classroom. Teachers may use some of the suggested
questions in this inquiry to introduce more sensitive issues regarding the inequalities
faced by Indigenous People.  Please keep in mind that Acts of Reconciliation and
Reclamation are fundamental as we move forward as a country.  Our acknowledgement,
and inclusion of Indigenous literature and media helps to create an understanding of the
history, diversity, and issues that many Indigenous peoples face.
It would be helpful for the learners to understand that traditional/cultural knowledge is passed as
an: I Do, We Do, You Do model.  This mentorship model provides the close watching and
coaching of the learner by the teacher.  This model would aid in learning from mistakes, as well
as identifying areas of strength and need for reflection.  This helps the person who is learning of
how knowledge is passed on, to connect with the sacredness of our relationship with Creator,
Mother Earth, the plants, animals, and all other animate and inanimate beings as part of the
Creators making. (Daniel Sylvestre)
A. Provocation 3: Community Expert – Elder Visit
To hook student interest, use the following provocation to initiate student thinking.
Sharing knowledge and storytelling is an integral part of Indigenous culture, and a visit from an
Elder is an excellent way to bring this experience to students. Indigenous Elders or Knowledge
Keepers play a central role in Indigenous communities; they are teachers within and beyond
their communities. They have been gifted with their respective teachings by other Elders or
Knowledge Keepers, typically over years of mentorship and teaching.
2
⮚
Invite an Elder to share their knowledge and experience with the students. Ask them to
share a traditional legend through oral storytelling or to lead a nature walk around your
schoolyard or nearby park.
⮚
Connect with your school's Indigenous Education department to speak to an Indigenous
education specialist and enquire about education or cultural programs available.  Also, to
inquire about who you can utilize in your classroom/school for the curricular concepts
that you feel need connections to Indigenous ways of knowing that will enhance inquiry
into environmental sustainability and relationships with Mother Earth.
⮚
Observe appropriate protocols and acknowledgements when including elders and
knowledge keepers in your school/classroom.
⮚
Plan a field trip that fosters a greater understanding of Indigenous Ways of Knowing.
In Indigenous cultures, the Elder is highly regarded as a role model in their community and is
considered the keeper of knowledge. A gift must be prepared by the person requesting the visit
and offered to the Elder at the time of the request. For more information regarding Elder
Wisdom in the Classroom
Discuss with students the importance of the knowledge, information and guidance older people
such as Elders, Knowledge Keepers, grandparents, teachers, uncles, aunts, or mentors can
offer. Students should be made aware that one must earn the right to become an Elder or
Knowledge Keeper in a First Nations community. Not all Elders or Knowledge Keepers are
seniors, nor are all old people Elders, and some Elders are younger. Elders and Knowledge
Keepers are honoured because they have gifts of insight and understanding and are willing to
share their knowledge. Discuss the role Elders or Knowledge Keepers play in Indigenous
communities, provide picture books and other media that illustrate the connection Indigenous
People have with the land to enhance the learning.
Prepare questions for the Elder’s visit, some possible questions are:
⮚
What is an Elder or Knowledge Keeper? Why are they an important natural resource?
⮚
What is the difference between an Elder and Knowledge Keeper?
⮚
What have you learned from living off the land? What can we learn from Elders to help
us live sustainably?
⮚
What changes have you noticed in life on the land or in the seasons?
⮚
Have any of the changes on the land been good or bad for your community?
⮚
Why is it important for humans to connect to the land?
⮚
How can we as students connect to the land, plants and animals and share their space?
⮚
How have the changes in the weather affected you and your community? What will
happen if the weather keeps changing?
⮚
What messages are Elders trying to share?
⮚
What changes have Elders seen in life on the land?  How is this “lived” experience
different than that of statistical data?
3
B. Question Generation
At this point in the inquiry, we want to harness students' curiosity and build off of the
provocations that have captured their interest by generating meaningful questions to continue to
drive the learning process. This section will outline several pathways for question generation
depending on the provocation(s) that your class engaged with. 
The Q-Chart is designed to help students in generating deep, relevant, inquiry questions. The
goal is to ask the questions at the bottom right corner of the matrix. These questions require
higher thinking and produce answers that are deeper and more complex.

Wonder Wall or Wall of Inquiry offers the students the opportunity to post their questions on a
bulletin board using post-it notes. By adding words and photos to the Wonder Wall, this
provokes students to think about Indigenous Ways of Learning. Students use the post it notes to
write questions about the Elder visit, photos and words. As a class, brainstorm different types of
questions that work well for inquiry learning and post them as examples on the bulletin board.
C. Knowledge Building  
At this stage, students may be ready to engage in a group knowledge-building activity. It
will encourage students to open their minds to many alternative ways of thinking about
the provocations and the ideas generated thus far in the inquiry process.

Inside /Outside Circles – Use this discussion technique to give students the opportunity
to discuss what they enjoyed or learned during the Elder Visit. During the second round,
students can discuss who they have in their life that they would consider an Elder?
Grandparent, coach, teacher, uncle, aunt or mentor? What important things do you learn
from this adult?
D. Determining Understanding 
Use responses to inform and guide the learning process. They can provide insight into which
concepts need clarity, what many students are already well informed about, and a general
direction that many students want to pursue.
Concept Maps allow students to share their learning and knowledge with visual representations.
Encourage the students to draw, incorporate words, messages, ideas anything they have
learned about Indigenous Ways of Knowing. The concept map allows you to see how students
understand the content.

Indigenous Perspectives Mind Map
Doodling/Sketching strategy
●
Ask students to draw some of the significant people in their lives and how and what they
learn from those people. (an Elder, a grandparent, a teacher, a coach). Have students
draw out their understanding using the doodle/sketching strategy
●
Draw this significant person in their role in the community; how does this person help
you, how does this person help others in your community?
E. Pursuing Learning
At this stage, students may begin research to pursue their umbrella questions, or some of the
following activities could be integrated into the process to ensure that students have an
understanding of foundational climate science. The activities listed below will enrich the
understanding of climate change.
Indigenous peoples have been and are leaders of climate action; their role in monitoring climate
change impacts and the environmental effects on traditional lands and waters play a critical part
in our fight against climate change. There is a great deal that we can learn from how Indigenous
peoples have lived sustainably with the Land for many years. They have adapted by travelling
throughout their Land in search of food and other resources depending on the seasons. We
need to listen carefully to better understand the value of Traditional knowledge and its
contribution to sustainability and planning for the future. Indigenous communities have their own
experts, elders, knowledge keepers and ways of knowing; their knowledge is an essential
resource for learning how to adapt to climate change. We need to value what they can bring to
the climate conversation and actively seek it to guide us.

Watch Norma’s Story an animated true tale of the profound effects of climate change on the
environment, culture and food security on the people and wildlife of the Arctic.
Step Inside activity helps students view a place, situations, events or things through different
lenses and points of view. Ask students to imagine themselves in the role of an elder and
note/describe what they can see, observe or notice. Students can identify what elders believe,
care about, wonder or question. Allow students to use visuals or words for their responses on
the Step Inside template. For this activity the students responses can be in response to the
Elder visit or they can respond to an Elder/adult in their life such as a grandparent, coach,
teacher or mentor.
The Walking Curriculum provides the opportunity to take your students outdoors. The suggested
walks introduce an indigenous perspective to the learning activities. For example, the What's
Under Foot Walk relates the walk to Indigenous Peoples sense of the interconnectedness of all
things. There is an understanding of the importance of taking care of the land and it will take
care of you. Indigenous knowledge tells of an understanding of life cycles, sustainable
harvesting practices and only taking what you need.
Ask students to identify how climate change affects their schoolyard or local environment.
Brainstorm with the students the needs of a plant such as the sun, water, soil nutrients,
pollinators, etc. Discuss how plants are affected by climate change.
Watch the Plant Adaptations video, then have students draw a garden full of plants that could
adapt to a changing climate. Discuss which plants they would plant and why? Awesome
Adaptations How do plants adapt to their environment
F. Consolidation
This step is designed to encourage students to integrate and synthesize key ideas. When
students make connections and see relationships within and across lessons, this helps them to
solidify knowledge and deepen understanding.
Neighbourhood Walk
Walk and explore the neighbourhood and have students use their senses to explore trees and
plants. Draw a map with the students of plants, trees, shrubs in the schoolyard. Identify any
changes in the schoolyard that may have been affected by climate change.
Accountable Discussion
Conduct a class discussion by defining accountable talk. During the discussion students
contributing to the discussion are held accountable to give reasons and evidence for opinions.
8
Before the discussion allow students to complete the accountable cards templates to record
their reasons and evidence. The cards can be completed individually or in groups.
Ex: I believe climate change is because certain provinces in our country are being afflicted by
wildfires and floods.
I agree with the Elder because having lived on the land his wisdom is knowledge that we
humans can use to guide us in protecting the land.
Assessment Ideas
●
Poster - Have students create a poster informing how Indigenous Ways of knowing can
provide us with respectful ways to protect the planet. Share the posters with other
students by posting them on the bulletin board in the school hallway.
●
Assess students' knowledge and understanding by inviting them to write a text about an
Elder in their life
●
Invite students to brainstorm the teachings that their elders have shared with them and
how these teachings connect us with others, the land, histories, and our ancestors (to
show we are accountable and that our decisions that we make affect others and the
future generations).
●
Assess students thank you letters to verify the learning between Elders and the land
●
Connect with another class/school in the Arctic virtually. Learn how climate change is
affecting their schoolyard and community and how their elders share knowledge with
them.
●
Students could write letters, send emails to pen pals or connect virtually to other
classrooms around the globe to explore and explain how climate change affects their
communities explaining how climate change affects their community
●
Have students create a poster informing how Mother Earth provides for them and what
they can do to protect her. Share the posters with other students by posting them on the
classroom bulletin board or in the school hallway/entryway.
●
Gather evidence of learning with observations, thumbs up thumbs down, listening to
conversations, anecdotal notes and comments, rough drafts
●
Conference with students - conversations can also include written evidence such as
journals in which educators can read what students have to say about their learning
rather than listening
●
Have older students complete a What I Learned Today self-assessment.
(eftoassessments.ca)
●
Have students express different ways to act in forests, parks, and other natural areas to
show you respect the land in the medium of their choice.

Take Action:
Allowing time for students to take action is an essential part of the learning process on climate
change, as it empowers students and eases their eco-anxiety. Ask the students what they
want to do to positively impact climate change. List their ideas and come up with a plan to put
their action in place.
Ideas for Taking Action:
Get outside and learn the names of the plants and animals in your area with local indigenous
and non-indigenous groups. Look for plants that can be used for simple home remedies.
●
Participate in the Planting for Change program, which helps your school create a
schoolyard planting site that acts as a mini-climate change outdoor classroom/lab.
●
Have students create a poster informing how Mother Earth provides for them and what
they can do to protect her. Share the posters with other students by posting them in the
school hallway
●
Students can collect data on the health and yearly growth of their tree plantings as they
explore issues surrounding climate change locally and globally.
●
Bottled water-free day: educate your school about bottled water and its impact on the
environment. Commit to reducing the use of bottled water at school and consider selling
reusable water bottles for students to purchase as a fundraiser.
●
Waste-free lunches: school lunches are a significant source of waste in schools. Reduce
the amount of food and packaging waste heading to the landfill by hosting a waste-free
lunch day. Take it a step further and host these days regularly on "Trashless Tuesdays"
or "Wasteless Wednesdays".
●
Have regular “No-Tech” days.  Encourage the understanding of how tech usage has an
invisible drain on our electric infrastructure.  Also include the need for our reliance upon
our local environments, as opposed to a virtual one.  This will help our students mental
and physical health, to ensure that they can “turn-off” to reflect and recharge without
distraction.
●
Walk for water - When senior students at Seven Oaks Met School learned that the local
community of Shoal Lake 40 First Nation (the very community where most of Winnipeg's
drinking water is sourced!) has been under a boil water advisory for over 20 years, they
were inspired to take action. They organized speakers and elders from Winnipeg and
Shoal Lake to educate the audience about the water crisis. The event raised over $7,000
for the Shoal Lake 40 First Nation community and spread awareness across the region.
●
The Shaughnessy Medicine Wheel Garden in Winnipeg was designed as a teaching
garden, incorporating the medicine wheel's circle teachings, including fire, Water, air, and
Earth. The plants and flowers reflect these elements and colours in each quadrant and
feature Manitoba's traditional medicines and indigenous plants. Thirteen boulders
encircle the garden to represent the 13 moons of the year, and seven cedar benches will
10
represent the seven teachings. Providing an outdoor learning space for students and a
natural setting to enjoy the environment for the local community.
●
MMHS Arboretum, Community, Indigenous and Medicinal Plant Gardens Students, staff,
community members and partners began planting trees, shrubs and wildflowers at
Milliken Mills High School in 1994. Since that time, the arboretum and associated
gardens have been enhanced and have flourished. This year we have made every effort
to expand the nature of the gardens with an interpretive guide created by students
across the curriculum. This, while the physical and plant make-up of the garden
continues to evolve. This year, despite the challenges of face-to-face learning and
participation, we established the indigenous medicinal plant garden and created a strong
cross-departmental partnership in the school, which will see the roots truly become
shoots as the project will become stewarded through teamwork.
●
The Herb Campbell Public School has created a visual landscape plan for a Medicine
Wheel Garden Outdoor Classroom on our school site, which includes: A centred
medicine wheel garden with indigenous plants surrounded by stone seating and an
outdoor classroom frame; 9 local food gardens including six raised-bed gardens (for
herbs, vegetables, fruit, and edible flowers) and three in-ground gardens (a Three
Sisters garden, an indigenous berry garden, and a pumpkin patch); 4 outer garden areas
with indigenous plants, shrubs, and trees connected to the four cardinal directions of our
centred Medicine Wheel Garden; A wildlife observation/inquiry area with feeders, water
supply, and log stump seating; Interpretative learning signs; Pathways connecting to our
natural forest, meadow, and wetland habitats and other planting areas.
●
Oak Park Outdoor Indigenous Learning Place created an outdoor Indigenous learning
space that allows students, staff, and the community to connect with nature and
celebrate Indigenous culture, tradition, and teaching. This project has many
stakeholders, including Indigenous and non-Indigenous students, Indigenous knowledge
keepers (academics, community members, Elders), and various divisional staff. To have
all staff and students embrace Indigenous ways of knowing, doing, and being; to
enhance our Indigenous students' engagement and success in school. Having a
teaching space in front of our school demonstrates our commitment to our school goal
and reconciliation. It will also create endless opportunities for teaching and learning that
honours, centres, and celebrates Indigenous culture.
