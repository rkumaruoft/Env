Abstract
This paper uses Lorenz curve and Gini index with adjustment to per capita historical cumulative emission to
construct carbon Gini index to measure inequality in climate change area. The analysis shows that 70% of carbon space
in the atmosphere has been used for unequal distribution, which is almost the same as that of incomes in a country with
the biggest gap between the rich and the poor in the world. The carbon equity should be an urgency and priority in
the climate agenda. Carbon Gini index established in this paper can be used to measure inequality in the distribution
of carbon space and provide a quantiﬁed indicator for measurement of carbon equity among diﬀerent proposals.
Keywords: climate change; carbon equity; long-term mitigation goal; cumulative emission per capita; carbon Gini

1 Introduction
One of the key issues of addressing climate change
is to enact a reasonable global long term emission
reduction target and implement the equal allocation
of CO2 emission space. The quantitative global long
term target will certainly limit the global CO2 emis-
sion space. The unequal allocation of the limited CO2
emission space would largely restrict the future emis-
sion space of developing counties. The earth’s atmo-
sphere is human’s public natural resource, and reason-
able emission space is indispensable for human devel-
opment.
Therefore, we should allocate and use the
emission space under the principle of global carbon
equality. This is the cornerstone of global cooperation
in addressing climate change.
Chinese scholars [Chen et al., 2005; Ding et al.,
2009; He et al., 2007; 2009] developed the cumula-
tive CO2 emission per capita index and revealed the
diﬀerent historical responsibilities for developed and
developing countries.
Moreover, they proposed the
guideline based on the principle of cumulative emis-
sion per capita convergence. Under this principle, Chi-
nese scholars proposed the carbon budget and carbon
emission account methods [Pan, 2008; PTDRCSCC,
2009] as the emission space allocation system design.
Although cumulative emission per capita reveals the
diﬀerent historical responsibilities for diﬀerent coun-
tries, it cannot provide a comprehensive index which
covers every country’s cumulative emission per capita,
nor can it provide a general measurement of emis-
sion space allocation equality. Therefore, many studies
used income equality measurement method, and mea-
sured emission equality with diﬀerent income equality
index. Hedenus and Azar [2005] measured emission in-
equality across countries by the well-known Atkinson

index. Duro and Padilla [2006] applied the decompos-
able Theil index of inequality to emissions and showed
convincingly that global inequality in per capita emis-
sions was largely due to inequalities in per capita in-
come across countries. Heil and Wodon [1997; 2000]
used the Gini index to measure the inequality of emis-
sion across countries. Groot [2010] established the car-
bon Lorenz curves and carbon Gini coeﬃcient based on
the annual per capita emission. The aforementioned
literatures measured the emission space equality with
income equality measurement indices, but they were
all based on the annual per capita emission. The con-
tribution of this paper is to reestablish the carbon
Lorenz curves and Gini indices based on the historical
cumulative emission per capita which has essential dif-
ference with the annual per capita emission measure-
ment. First, the life time of greenhouse gas (GHG) in
the atmosphere is more than a century; the cumulative
emission can show a country’s climate change histor-
ical responsibility more clearly than annual emission.
Consequently the historical cumulative emission per
capita can represent the carbon equality better. Sec-
ond, emissions of GHG within a certain period of time
determine the temperature rise.
The equality is to
be a measurement of the overall emission allocation in
the certain period, rather than that of annual emission
allocation.
2 Carbon equality and measurement
The essence of carbon equality is to measure the
allocation diﬀerence of emission space. Although allo-
cation diﬀerence is a new topic in climate change stud-
ies, it has been thoroughly investigated in the income
allocation equality researches [Wan, 2009; Xu, 2008].
The commonly used resident income allocation diﬀer-
ence indices are variation coeﬃcient, Gini coeﬃcient,
Generalized Entropy index, and Atkinson index. The
Gini coeﬃcient is the most widely used index. Such in-
dices are usually used to statically mapping the wealth
allocation and social stability of a certain country or
district.
The Lorenz curve was initially proposed by
Lorenz in 1907. It indicates the relations between pop-
ulation shares and income shares. Cumulative income
shares are on the vertical axis, and cumulative pop-
ulation shares are on the horizontal axis. The curve
reﬂects the relations between income shares and popu-
lation shares. If the population shares are not equal to
the income shares, inequality exists. If the allocation
is perfectly equal, then Lorenz curve is the straight line
with the slope of 45◦. That is the “perfect equal al-
location curve” (Fig. 1). Based on the Lorenz curve,
Gini proposed the equality level measurement index
which is called Gini index. Deﬁne the area between
the actual allocation curve and perfect equal alloca-
tion curve as X, the area below the actual allocation
curve as Y . Then the Gini index equals to X/(X +Y ).
The economical meaning of Gini index is that the in-
equality level of the income allocation equals to the
income used for unequal allocation among total resi-
dential income. Gini index is a real number between
0 and 1. The Gini index for a perfect equal allocation
is 0, while the Gini index for a totally unequal alloca-
tion is 1. Gini index is a general index, which reveals
a general level of the allocation equality. According to
the United Nation’s deﬁnition, Gini index <0.2 repre-
sents perfect income equality, 0.2–0.3 relative equality,
0.3–0.4 adequate equality, 0.4–0.5 big income gap, and
above 0.5 represents severe income gap. Therefore, the
warning level of Gini index is 0.4. This paper uses the
above division of Gini index to investigate the carbon
inequality issue. How to use Gini index to provide a
more meaningful division is still an issue for further
research, since this involves the welfare meanings of
the carbon space allocation.

Lorenz curve and Gini index reﬂect the relations
between income shares and population shares. When-
ever the income shares and population shares are not
equal to each other, inequality exists.
The conver-
gence of cumulative per capita proposed by Chinese
scholars reﬂects this principle for equality. This idea
applied with the Lorenz curve and Gini index means
that once everyone has the same cumulative emission
space there will be no carbon inequality.
Developed countries had emitted large amount of
GHG in their industrialization process. The GHG cu-
mulated in the atmosphere, not only enhanced the
greenhouse eﬀect, but also led to global warming and
many other climate changes. Moreover, GHG emitted
by developed countries occupied the emission space
and made developing countries face a more restricted
emission limit. Therefore, Gini index can also mea-
sure equality situation of diﬀerent emission allocation
plans.
In this application of the Lorenz curve and
Gini index, horizontal axis is changed from households
to population, while vertical axis is changed from in-
come to emissions. This paper calculates the carbon
equality with historical cumulative emission statistics.
Based on such statistics we will establish the “car-
bon Lorenz curve” to reﬂect diﬀerent countries’ un-
equal emission allocation levels. According to “carbon
Lorenz curve”, we can calculate the “carbon Gini in-
dex” to quantitatively measure the emission inequality
of diﬀerent countries.
3 Carbon Lorenz curve and carbon Gini
index calculation
When investigating diﬀerent countries’ historical
cumulative emission situation, this paper focuses on
the CO2 emission from energy activities. Baumert et
al. [2005] suggested that CO2 is the main GHG, CO2
emission from energy activities contribute more than
2/3 of the world GHG total. This paper calculates the
historical cumulative emissions by simply adding the
emissions, which is a widely used method.
In order to understand how the historical cumu-
lative emission per capita Lorenz curve is established,
ﬁrst we deﬁne the following variables for country n:
Gn
i is the CO2 emission in i th year of country n,
P n
i
is the population of country n in the i th year,
pn
i =
P n
i
P
m
P m
i
is the population share of country n in
the i th year.
Considering the period between i th year and j
th year, Cn
ij =
jP
k=i
Gn
k is the historical cumulative CO2
emission from i th year to j th year for country n,
cn
ij =
Cn
ij
P
m
Cm
ij
is its share of historical cumulative CO2
emission from i th year to j th year, and C
n
ij is its
historical cumulative CO2 emission per capita from i
th year to j th year.
C
n
ij is the most important emission equality mea-
surement index proposed by the authors of this paper.
It will also be the basis to sort the data in establish-
ing the Lorenz curve. There are two ways to calculate
C
n
ij. One is to add up the annual emission per capita.
Another is to calculate cumulative CO2 emission Cn
ij,
and then divide Cn
ij by P n
j . Although two methods
yield diﬀerent values, the results are essentially the
same. Moreover, this paper will use population share.
It is not suitable to calculate cumulative populations.
Accordingly, we adopt the latter method.

Table 1 provides historical cumulative CO2 emis-
sion, population, and the historical cumulative emis-
sion per capita for major countries between 1850 and
2006. All the data were from Climate Analysis Indi-
cators Tool (CAIT), Version 7.0 (http://cait.wri.org ).
From Table 1 we can see that the USA is the world’s
largest CO2 emission country since the industry revo-
lution, its historical cumulative emission is 30% of the
world total.
The historical cumulative emission per
capita for developed countries such as the USA and
UK was more than tens of times of those for developing
counties such as China and India. The historical cu-
mulative emission per capita can reﬂect the inequality
of carbon space allocation. Comparing with developed
countries, developing countries’ industrialization came
late and is on a lower level. Developing countries are
allocated with less resource in the constrained carbon
space, but they have larger populations in general. As
a result, residents in developing countries cannot enjoy
equal rights in GHG emission.

When we focus on the CO2 emission from i th
year to j th year for each country, in order to con-
struct the Lorenz curve, we need to sort the countries
in ascending order by their historical cumulative emis-
sions per capita C
n
ij and assign a sequence number s.
After sorting the countries in ascending order, set cu-
mulative population of j th year on the horizontal axis,
and set cumulative historical cumulative emission per
capita from i th year to j th year on the vertical axis. It
should be noted that “cumulative” in this context is re-
ferring to summing up of emissions by those countries
whose sequence number is less than s. Therefore, the
coordinates (ps, cs) refer to ps = P
t⩽s
pt
j, cs = P
t⩽s
ct
ij.
Connecting the diﬀerent countries’ points in the
coordinate system with a smooth curve, we established
the Lorenz curve based on the historical cumulative
emission per capita from i th year to j th year. Figure
2 shows the carbon Lorenz curve started from 1850
and lists the positions of diﬀerent countries. As the
carbon Lorenz curve is sorted by the historical cumu-
lative emission per capita, the country’s position is
closer to the upright, the higher its historical cumu-
lative emission per capita is, the bigger historical re-
sponsibility that country should take in climate change
issue. Moreover, from Figure 2 we can learn that de-
veloping countries have 82% population of the world,
but they contributed merely 25% cumulative emission
of world’s total. On the other hand, developed coun-
tries have 18% population of the world, but their cu-
mulative emissions account for 75% of the world’s to-
tal.

year
Based on the carbon Lorenz curve, we can cal-
culate the carbon Gini index. Similar to the income
Gini index calculation, we use two methods. One is
the area method; the other is mean variance method.
The area method is derived straightly from the
deﬁnition of Gini index. As mentioned before, since
(X + Y )=0.5, we have
G =
X
X + Y = 0.5 −Y
0.5
= 1 −2Y
(2)
The main diﬀerence between various area calcula-
tion methods is in the calculation of area Y . One way
is to select a suitable ﬁtting Lorenz curve, and then
use integration to calculate the area. Another way is
to divide Y into several trapezoids. The sum of the
trapezoidal area is a close approximation to the area
Y (Fig. 3).

Apparently, when S is big enough, the result above is
almost the same as real value.
Another commonly used method is mean diﬀer-
ence method. We deﬁne the absolute mean variance
as ∆= E|C
a
ij −C
b
ij|, relative mean variance as ∆/Cij,
where a and b is the sequence number of two diﬀerent
countries, and Cij is the historical cumulative world
emission per capita. Gini index is the half of the rela-
tive mean variance. Therefore,

One of the most important things in carbon equal-
ity and carbon budget is to set the starting year. Many
researches conﬁrmed that the earlier the starting year
was, the more historical responsibility is reﬂected. But
they did not provide a quantitative analysis of the var-
ious starting years’ impacts on the historical responsi-
bility. In this paper we try to use the carbon Lorenz
and carbon Gini index to quantitatively analyze the
impact of the starting year on historical responsibil-
ity.
Figure 4 shows the carbon Lorenz curves with
diﬀerent starting years.
Table 2 shows carbon Gini
index results with diﬀerent starting years in various
calculation methods.
We can see that diﬀerent cal-
culation methods do not aﬀect the carbon Gini index
value much, but the diﬀerent starting years have big
inﬂuence on the carbon Gini index value. The latter
the starting year, the lower the carbon Gini index is.
That means as the starting years become bigger, the
carbon space allocation inequality would be concealed.
On the global level, carbon Gini index does not change
much when comparing the 1850 starting year calcula-
tion with the 1900 starting year calculation. But the
1950 starting year calculation and 1990 starting year
calculation largely underestimate the carbon inequal-
ity. The 1950 calculation results in a 4% underestima-
tion of the carbon space allocation inequality, while
the 1990 calculation accounts for a 14% underestima-
tion of the carbon space allocation inequality. From
1850 to 2006, 70% of the cumulative emission space
has been allocated unequally, but when starting from
1990 this ﬁgure decreases to 60%. No matter what the
starting year is, the inequality of carbon space alloca-
tion needs to be concerned. According to the World
Bank statistics, three countries’ income Gini indices
are above 0.6 in the 182 countries in the world. The
biggest income gap is in Namibia which has the in-
come Gini index of 0.74. The Gini index of carbon
space allocation is 0.70 if the starting year is 1850.

4 Conclusions
Economics and sociology are focused more on the
inequality in terms of economical parameters, espe-
cially the income inequality, since income is a key fac-
tor which determines the welfare. In the ﬁeld of cli-
mate change, the unequal allocation of carbon emis-
sion space is an issue of great importance, but the
study of the measure of this inequality is rather limited
in both theory and application. The quantiﬁcation of
the carbon allocation inequality has great signiﬁcance.
Through the quantiﬁcation, we can investigate an in-
equality issue in climate change from a diﬀerent angle
or underlying layer. For example, measuring the in-
equality level and trends will be beneﬁcial to look for
the root cause of the inequality. The income allocation
related literatures have provided many meaningful in-
dices and tools for inequality research.
With some
adjustment, such indices and tools can be applied to
the emission space allocation related carbon inequality
issue. In this paper, based on the historical cumula-
tive emission per capita, the authors established the
carbon Lorenz curve and carbon Gini index to quanti-
tatively analyze the emission space allocation inequal-
ity issue.
Several implications of the historical cumulative
emission per capita based on carbon Gini index pro-
posed by the authors in this paper are the following:
1) historical cumulative emission per capita based car-
bon Gini index reﬂects the severe inequality of current
emission allocation in a more general way, it helps
policy makers and the public to know the emission
allocation inequality level; 2) carbon Gini index can
not only be used to analyze the current situation of
the emission space allocation inequality, but also can
be employed to compare the emission space allocation
inequality of diﬀerent future allocation plans, thus it
can reveal the equality ramiﬁcation of diﬀerent future
emission allocation plans and provide guidelines in
establishing future allocation plans; and 3) by using
the carbon Gini index and carbon Lorenz curve, we
can further understand the deep-seated factors in car-
bon inequality by factor decomposition.
The result of the carbon Gini index based on the
historical cumulative emission per capita shows that
current emission space allocation is severely unequal.
The inequality situation is on the same level as a coun-
try with the biggest income gap.
In the 1850–2006
calculation period, carbon Gini index reaches 0.70
which is far beyond the warning level in the case of
income inequality. This result indicates that 70% of
the world total emission space is allocated unequally
and such space has been excessively occupied by de-
veloped countries.
The carbon Gini index has con-
ﬁrmed that developed countries had excessively occu-
pied the emission space. According to the principle
of UNFCCC, developed countries should take the lead
to reduce their emissions to redress the unequal situ-
ation.
The selection of starting year has great inﬂuence
on the carbon Gini index. The inequality of carbon
space allocation has been concealed as the starting
year becomes more recent. However, even year 1990 is
used as the starting year, the carbon Gini index can
still reach 0.60 which is far beyond the warning line.
Carbon Gini index can be used as a static index to
measure the inequality of emission allocation. It also
provides a quantitative index for international carbon
equality discussion. At present, many institutes and
scholars have proposed various plans to allocate future
CO2 emission space. It is diﬃcult to compare diﬀe-
rent plans. The carbon Gini index presented in this
paper can reveal the equality implication of diﬀerent
allocation plans, and compare and contrast diﬀerent
