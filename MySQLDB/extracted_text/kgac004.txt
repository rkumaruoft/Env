ABSTRACT
In 2017, the Swedish parliament adopted a new climate policy framework that lays the foundations for an ambitious decar-
bonization of all sectors in Swedish society. To live up to the Paris Agreement’s temperature targets, the parliament decided
that Sweden should arrive at net zero emissions of greenhouse gases by year 2045 and thereafter aim for net negative emis-
sions. This progressive climate policy agenda is embedded in a strong collaborative discourse. To begin the transition to a
fossil-free society, the Swedish government has invited a wide array of actors to join forces in the formulation and
implementation of low carbon initiatives. In this article, we examine the fossil-free society as a powerful socio-technical
imaginary that underpins this collaborative effort. We trace the promise attached to this future dreamscape and how it is
mobilized by the government initiative fossil-free Sweden (FFS) to gain support for industrial decarbonization in the pre-
sent. Our study draws upon roadmaps produced by FFS together with the Swedish steel, cement and petroleum industry, as
well as semi-structured interviews with selected industry actors. We ﬁnd that the FFS roadmaps work as powerful ‘techni-
ques of futuring’ that invite industry actors to anticipate the risks and opportunities attached to the fossil-free society and
at the same time contribute to shaping that society. While effectively involving incumbent actors in the political project of
decarbonization, our study suggests that the roadmaps consolidate around an imagined future that is a techno-optimistic
extension of the fossil-intensive present.
Key words: promissory legitimacy; future-making; fossil free; climate politics.
INTRODUCTION
In August 2020, the HYBRIT demonstration site for fossil-free
steel production was launched in the city of Lulea˚ in northern
Sweden. The event was attended by representatives of govern-
ment and industry and celebrated as important step towards
the goal of turning Sweden into the first fossil-free welfare
state. As highlighted in the opening speech by former Swedish
Prime Minister Stefan Lo¨fve´n, the decision to decarbonize the
Swedish steel industry is bold, but necessary. To address the
climate crisis, he argued, government and industry need to
come together and invest in a future with green jobs, world-
leading technology and zero emissions [1].
The HYBRIT launch event illustrates the power of imagination
in contemporary climate politics and policymaking. To gain public
support for the rapid and deep decarbonization required to meet
the temperature targets of the Paris Agreement, decision-makers
in the global North are today formulating promises of a carbon

neutral society yet to come. The European Green Deal, Joe Biden’s
clean energy revolution and Boris Johnson’s green industrial revo-
lution all project visions of a prosperous, green and low carbon so-
ciety that will take shape by 2050 [2]. When justifying investments
in this future, imagination works as a powerful cultural resource
that extends climate policy debate beyond the immediate and
tangible politics of the present. As suggested by Jasanoff [3], any
vision of a future world requires ‘a leap into a fictive, unrealized
landscape of dreams’ (p. 30). In this imaginative space, established
patterns of social life can be reconfigured and new forms of behav-
iour take form. However, far from all imagined futures win peo-
ple’s allegiance and enable action. To mobilize society around the
political project of deep decarbonization, Beckert [4] reminds us
that future promises must invoke expectations that a broad
enough set of actors can realistically hope for. The credibility of
imaginaries is thus key to public support and a central element of
what Beckert calls the ‘promissory legitimacy’ of public policy [4].
In this article, we examine the fossil-free society as a power-
ful imaginative space in Swedish climate policy discourse and
practice
which
takes
shape
in collaboration
between
the
Swedish government and industry actors. We make use of
Beckert’s concept of ‘promissory legitimacy’ as a heuristic de-
vice to trace how this future dreamscape is imagined and mobi-
lized by the Swedish government to justify and catalyze
industrial decarbonization in the present. Until recently, cli-
mate mitigation has been challenging for the energy- and
resource-intensive industry in Sweden. The market incentives
for low-carbon investments have been weak and the govern-
ment has struggled to create policy conditions that do not harm
the industry’s global competitiveness [5]. The fossil-free society
is a ‘socio-technical imaginary’ that promises to resolve this di-
lemma by opening-up new markets for green products and jobs
[6]. In this imagined future, investments in fossil-free technolo-
gies are good for business and form the ground for a prosperous
and sustainable welfare society.
Our study draws upon policy documents and roadmaps pro-
duced by the government initiative fossil-free Sweden (FFS) in
collaboration with three industry sectors of historical impor-
tance to the Swedish welfare state; the steel industry, the ce-
ment industry and the petroleum industry. To contextualize
these documents, we also attended two webinars organized by
FFS in 2021 and conducted interviews with representatives from
FFS, the steel company SSAB, the cement producer Cementa
and the petroleum company Preem. While these three compa-
nies currently top the list of industrial emitters in Sweden [7],
they have recently positioned themselves as leaders of the
fossil-free transition. As such they are of empirical interest for
our study. When analysing our empirical material, we asked
what expectations of the good society that are projected into
Sweden’s fossil-free future, how this socio-technical imaginary
gains traction and support among industry actors and ulti-
mately how it shapes what counts as credible and attainable
decarbonization pathways in the present.
The paper is organized as follows. First, we place our study
in the expanding literature on the politics of climate future-
making and the power of imagination to catalyse transforma-
tive social change. As a second step, we introduce our empirical
material and clarify how we conducted our qualitative analysis.
Finally, we present our empirical findings and outline how the
fossil-free roadmaps help to negotiate collective visions of the
future and create corporate will to attain them. While effec-
tively involving incumbent actors in the political project of
decarbonization, our study suggests that the roadmap process
has consolidated around a socio-technical imaginary that is
conditioned by Sweden’s industrial past and present. Hence,
rather than representing a radical departure from contemporary
forms of social and political life, the fossil-free society comes
across as a techno-optimistic extension of the same.
PROMISSORY LEGITIMACY AND THE POLITICS
OF CLIMATE FUTURE-MAKING
To anticipate and govern future events is a central task and
source of legitimacy for the modern administrative state. Since
the dawn of modernity, public officials have made active use of
scientific projections and long-term strategic planning to map
and order uncertain futures through actions in the present [8].
Climate change belongs to the complex and unforeseeable
events that extend policymaking into the future. Faced with the
dangers of a rapidly warming world, policymakers are today
turning to science to assess future climate risks and to identify
viable mitigation and adaptation pathways. While technical ca-
pacities to explore possible climate futures are improving, risks
are part and parcel of this development. In contrast to the test-
able politics of the here and now, climate policymaking is about
mobilizing public support for visions of the future that are not
attributable with certainty to a particular course of action or in-
action [3].
‘Socio-technical
imaginaries’
are
a
concept
coined
by
Jasanoff and Kim [6] to critically examine which collective
visions and expectations of future possibilities that inform
nation-specific scientific and technological projects. The con-
cept denotes ‘collectively held, institutionally stabilized, and
publicly performed visions of desirable futures, animated by
shared understandings and forms of social life and social order,
and attainable through, and supportive of, advances in science
and technology’ [9, p. 4]. Drawn from the reservoir of cultural
meanings, norms and discourses, socio-technical imaginaries
enact collective visions of what is good, desirable and worth
attaining for a political community. As such they operate at the
intersection of thought and action, discourse and decision, pub-
lic opinion and state policy [6, p. 123].
In recent years, a growing scholarship has drawn upon this
concept to explore how environmental futures are made present,
known, pre-empted and prepared for [10, p. 7]. Some of these
studies have demonstrated how socio-technical imaginaries en-
code historical ideas of nationhood and national progress [11, 12].
Rather than offering a radical departure from the past, Kuchler
and Bridge [11, p. 138] find that imagined energy and climate
futures often are populated with cultural representations and ma-
terialities of the present and/or past. Other studies have critically
examined the power of scientific expertise to render the future
present through various anticipatory techniques [13]. Numerous
scholars have illustrated how scientific efforts to probe uncertain
climate futures (through, for instance, integrated assessment
models) channel the political imagination and limit the possibility
corridor for climate policy action [14–16]. Rather than offering neu-
tral representations of possible climate futures, anticipatory tech-
niques are here approached as sites of politics that make some
policy priorities and governance trajectories thinkable while fore-
closing others. While these studies have highlighted the perfor-
mative power of imagination to structure decision-making and
social organization in the present, Oomen et al. [17] note that we
still do not know enough about the processes that determine
which socio-technical imaginaries that gain traction and enable
action. To that end they invite scholars to draw attention to the
practical ‘techniques of futuring’ that allow imagined futures to

become collectively held and inform shared orientations for ac-
tion. Such techniques, they argue, negotiate meanings and legiti-
macy, embed knowledge, engage publics and create relations of
trust [17, p. 3].
In the following we make use of this active account of
future-making when tracing the ‘promissory legitimacy’ of
Swedish climate policy discourse and practice. Informed by
Beckert’s [4] conception of the term, we examine how the prom-
ise attached to the fossil-free future gains credibility among in-
dustry actors and is used to justify industrial decarbonization in
the present. Promissory legitimacy, argues Beckert [4], refers to
the credibility of promises that political leaders make about fu-
ture developments. Policy processes do not only gain legitimacy
from following accepted procedural rules (input legitimacy) or
from achieved outcomes (output legitimacy) [18–20]. When
justifying political decisions in view of uncertain futures,
decision-makers also activate the collective imagination and
project culturally embedded meanings, norms, hopes and fears
into the future. Public policy gains legitimacy when it invokes
promises that a broad set of actors can realistically hope for [4,
p. 327]. While credible promises of imagined futures can mobi-
lize society around the political project of transformation,
exhausted promises cause disorientation, discontent and the
de-legitimation of political authority.
MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY
Our study rests upon three primary sources of empirical mate-
rial: (1) policy documents, roadmaps and sustainability reports;
(2) semi-structured interviews with government and industry
actors and (3) FFS webinars (for a full list of our empirical mate-
rial, see Table 1). The documents were retrieved from govern-
ment and industry webpages. The empirical weight is on
documents produced by the Swedish government initiative FFS,
including three fossil-free roadmaps produced in collaboration
with the Swedish steel, cement and petroleum industries. In ad-
dition, we analyzed an external evaluation of FFS and three sus-
tainability reports produced by the steel company SSAB, the
cement industry Cementa and the oil refinery Preem.
The interviews were conducted with a government official
from FFS, a former Swedish minister involved in the set-up of
FFS and management level representatives at SSAB, Cementa
and Preem, respectively. The interviews were semi-structured
and lasted between 45 min and 1 h [21]. Due to pandemic-
related travel restrictions, we conducted most of the interviews
via
Microsoft
Teams
(between
March
and
June
2020).
Information about the project and how data would be handled
was provided beforehand and a consent form was also signed
by
the
interviewees.
All
interviews
were
recorded
and
transcribed.
The documents and interviews were analysed in parallel.
Texts and interview transcripts were inserted into the software
NVivo to assist qualitative analysis and the material was coded
both inductively and by research question themes [22–24]. The
files were categorized (file classification) by actor and type, and
we used word frequency queries per file classification to get a
better understanding of key words. We also conducted an in-
ductively oriented reading, applying analytical techniques in-
spired
by
qualitative
content
analysis;
keyword
searches,
identification of repetitions as well omissions and unexpected
statements [25]. This allowed us to identify themes that we
were not sensitized to [23]. The analysis was structured around
the following questions: (1) how do actors describe the fossil-
free society and their role in it; (2) what expectations, hopes and
desires do they project into this imagined future; (3) which prob-
lems do they see on the road to this future and (4) what trans-
formative actions are required to get us there. We studied the

webinars using the same analytical questions, but we also paid
special attention to how the roadmaps were invoked in these
settings. The combination of these approaches resulted in a
number of themes (nodes) which both reflected the research
questions (e.g. ‘Challenges and problems’ and ‘Action required’)
and more analytically generated ones (e.g. ‘win–win discourse’
or ‘Sweden/company as international leader’). The themes
identified were then contrasted with previous research to in-
form our concluding discussion.
DECARBONIZING SWEDISH STATE–INDUSTRY
RELATIONS
Industries in the forest, mining and steel sectors have devel-
oped in close interplay with the Swedish welfare state. By proc-
essing
resources
of
strategic
importance
for
industrial
manufacturing and providing jobs for rural populations, energy-
and
resource-intensive
industries
have
been
central
to
Sweden’s economic development and tied to the state through
public ownership [26]. Although many of these industries were
privatized during the 1990s and today function as multinational
corporations, they have maintained strong relationships to the
Swedish state. Over the years, governments have sought to pro-
tect their international competitiveness by subsidizing energy
provisions and offering tax exemptions [5]. As providers of eco-
nomic growth and employment, they have also gained a privi-
leged position in Swedish environmental policymaking. As
outlined by Lundqvist, Swedish environmental governance has
since the 1990s been characterized by close cooperation with or-
ganized economic interests [27]. By inviting incumbents to par-
ticipate in policy formation and implementation, Swedish
governments have sought to convince industry that the per-
ceived conflict between economic growth and environmental
protection can be overcome.
While this corporatist organization of state–industry rela-
tions has been central to the development of Sweden’s climate
policy objectives [28], the governance of industrial decarboniza-
tion has proven difficult. Hildingsson et al. [5] offer a detailed
analysis of the structural constraints that complicate the reduc-
tion of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from Sweden’s energy-
and resource-intensive industry sectors [5]. Due to their large
energy demand, industrial processes today account for approxi-
mately 30% of Sweden’s territorial GHG emissions [7]. Since the
technological shifts required to bring the emission down in-
volve high investment costs, many industries have over the
past decades favoured
incremental change and efficiency
improvements over technological transformation. Although the
GHG emissions resulting from these industries are regulated by
the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the carbon price has
thus far not been high enough to incentivize industrial renewal.
New policy instruments and support structures have thus been
called for to effectively govern industrial decarbonization [5].
In this study, we focus on three sectors—steel, cement and
petroleum—that currently top the list of Sweden’s industrial
emitters [7]. While these industry sectors have been historical
veto players in Swedish climate policymaking, leading compa-
nies have recently begun to decarbonize their production pro-
cesses [28]. Table 2 offers an overview of three companies that
now position themselves as frontrunners in the fossil-free tran-
sition. SSAB is a state-owned steel company that seeks to revo-
lutionize
the
steel
industry
by
replacing
a
coal-intensive
production process with green hydrogen. HYBRIT is the pilot
plant
where
this
fossil-free
steel
technology
currently
is
developed and tested. Cementa is a cement producer that
aspires to develop the first carbon-neutral cement plant in Slite
on Gotland by 2030. Finally, Preem is an oil refinery that prom-
ises to go carbon neutral by 2035 by investing in renewable bio-
fuels and equipping their refineries with CO2 capture facilities.
The recent commitment to transformative climate action dem-
onstrated by these companies has unfolded in close interplay
with the government initiative FFS, to which we turn next.
FFS AS CATALYST OF INDUSTRIAL
DECARBONIZATION
A large majority in parliament stand behind the climate goals,
business and unions generally collaborate around the roadmaps’
industrial transformation, and municipalities, regions, environ-
ment and consumer movements are already engaged and active
in climate work. Now let the Swedish collaborative model take
new steps for the climate and go from tango to square dance [29,
p. 4].
In 2017, the Swedish parliament adopted a new climate policy
framework that lays the foundations for an ambitious decar-
bonization of all sectors in Swedish society. To live up to the
Paris Agreement’s objective to keep global mean warming well
below 2C, the parliament decided that Sweden should arrive at
net zero emissions of GHGs by year 2045 and thereafter aim for
net
negative
emissions
[30].

Table 2: Company background information
SSAB
While the history of the Swedish steel industry dates
back to the 19th century, the state owned Svenskt
Sta˚l AB (SSAB) was formed in 1978. The company
produces high strength steels (AHSS) and
Quenched & Tempered Steels (Q&T), construction
solutions and strip, plate and tube products. SSAB
is an international company with employees in 50
countries and operations in Sweden, Finland and
the USA. The operations in Sweden are located in
Lulea˚, Borla¨nge, Oxelo¨sund and Finspa˚ng,
employing 14 300 people in total. The Lulea˚ plant
reﬁnes iron pellets from LKAB into 200 different
kinds of steel, employing roughly 1100 people
Cementa
Cementa was founded in 1871 and is today part of
the Heidelberg Cement Group. The company’s
main operations in Sweden are located in Slite on
the island of Gotland. In total, 230 people are
directly employed at the Slite production site and
an additional 200 people work with the operations
as hired entrepreneurs. A signiﬁcant number of
people are also indirectly dependent on the
operations for their livelihood, as is the case with
all the cities where the companies have
operations.
Preem
Preem was formed in 1996 as a result of a merger
between the two companies Texaco and OK
Petroleum. Today, Preem covers around 80% of
Sweden’s reﬁning capacity and has two oil
reﬁneries, one in Lysekil (since 1975) and one in
Gothenburg (since 1967)—employing 950 people in
total. Together the reﬁneries have a capacity of
more than 18 million m3 of crude oil every year.
The company has 570 fuel stations in Sweden and
products include gasoline, diesel and renewable
fuels.

framework
was
prepared
in
the
cross-parliamentary
Environmental Objectives Committee during 2014–2016. In the
final report presented to the Swedish parliament in June 2016,
the committee highlighted the importance of long-term and
stable strategies for decarbonization that give Sweden’s energy-
and resource-intensive industries a clear investment horizon
[31]. While Sweden should act as international role model by
setting ambitious domestic climate targets and channeling cli-
mate finance to developing countries, the committee noted that
the low carbon transition needs to go hand in hand with
strengthened international competitiveness and the creation of
sustainable jobs. To that end, intensified state–industry collabo-
ration was called for [31, p. 90].
The
establishment
of
the
government
initiative
FFS
responds to this call. This multi-stakeholder initiative was
launched at the 2015 UN Climate Conference in Paris and was
given the organizational form of a governmental inquiry at the
Swedish government office. The initiative has since then oper-
ated through a team of around seven employees, led by a
National Coordinator who previously held the position of secre-
tary general of the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation.
Since the initiative is not organizationally situated within a
ministry or government agency, it operates with a great deal of
freedom to develop collaborative forms of governance in close
dialogue with private actors [32, 33]. The initiative’s purpose, as
stated by the committee directives is to support Sweden’s tran-
sition to a fossil-free society through cross-sectoral collabora-
tion, communication and knowledge exchange [34, 35]. Acting
as a catalyst and hub for transformative climate action, FFS
should facilitate dialogue on viable decarbonization pathways
and showcase good examples for domestic and international
audiences. While industrial decarbonization is at the heart of
FFS’ activities, this multi-stakeholder platform also aims to in-
spire actors from other areas of society (e.g. municipalities,
NGOs and smaller businesses) to contribute to the goal of turn-
ing Sweden into the first fossil-free welfare state [34–36].
Nasiritousi and Grimm [37] describe FFS as an orchestrator that
seeks to facilitate the achievement of Sweden’s climate policy
goals by actively involving non-state actors in the political project
of decarbonization. In contrast to command and control, FFS
works through soft and catalytic forms of governance that are
designed to nudge intermediary actors to voluntarily pursue
shared policy objectives. Roadmaps for fossil-free (or climate neu-
tral) competitiveness represent a central instrument in this cata-
lytic process. In 2017, FFS invited organized sector interests to
imagine ‘how they can enhance their competitiveness by going
fossil free or climate neutral’ [38]. In the development of sector-
specific roadmaps, broad industry constellations were asked to
think through opportunities and obstacles on the road towards
the fossil-free society and what policy actions that they would like
to see and they themselves can pursue to get there.
To date, 22 roadmaps for fossil-free competitiveness have
been handed over to the Swedish government. (The roadmaps
cover the following areas: the aggregates industry; the agricultural
sector; the automotive industry—heavy transport; the automotive
industry—passenger cars; the aviation industry; the cement in-
dustry; the concrete industry; the construction and civil engineer-
ing sector; the digitalization consultancy industry; the electricity
sector; fast-moving consumer goods industry; the food retail sec-
tor; the forest sector; the gas sector; the heating sector; the heavy
road haulage industry; the maritime industry; the mining and
minerals industry; the petroleum and biofuel industry; the recy-
cling sector; the ski resort sector and the steel industry.) Although
industry has been in the ‘driving-seat’ in the development of these
documents, Nasiritousi and Grimm [37] find that FFS has carefully
guided the roadmap process and balanced the different demands
of its members and their respective stakeholders [39]. Through
open meetings, workshops and roundtable discussions, FFS has
involved a broad range of actors in the imagining of possible and
desirable climate futures and hereby managed to build broad coa-
litions in support of decarbonization. At the centre of this catalytic
process is a socio-technical imaginary that draws upon nation-
specific understandings of socio-economic progress and prosper-
ity to convince industry to take action. In the next section, we
delve deeper into this imaginary and what promise it projects into
the future.
IMAGINING DECARBONIZATION: THE PROMISE
OF FFS
The promise of the fossil-free society is central to FFS’ catalytic
mode of governing. To incentivize ambitious and bold corporate
climate action, the initiative works actively with positive
images of the prosperous, competitive and sustainable welfare
society yet to come. Sweden’s role as international role model
and leader of the fossil-free transition is central to this socio-
technical imaginary. Sweden has a unique opportunity to show
the world that it is possible to reduce GHG emissions without
compromising economic development, employment and wel-
fare. In this sense, FFS has global ambitions:
The most important thing a small export dependent country in
the outskirts of northern Europe can do in order to reduce global
emissions is to quickly develop technical solutions that can be
used for the transition in the whole world [29, p. 3].
The vision is to make Sweden a permanent world exhibition for
new technology so that more countries can discover the path to
fossil-free development [40, p. 323].
Instead of depicting the journey to the fossil-free society as a
threat to socio-economic development, FFS presents the project
of decarbonization as a business opportunity and step towards
strengthening competitiveness [41]. The story of the fossil-free
society rests upon a green industrial vision that is intended to
engage and mobilize a broad range of actors across society. FFS
projects a green industrial future where investments in low car-
bon technologies will open up new markets and pave the way
for sustainable jobs and socio-economic welfare [32–35]. In this
imagined future, emission reductions are no longer a burden for
industry. Instead, they form part of a successful business and
export strategy. The roadmaps for fossil-free competitiveness
fill this imaginary with confidence and promise, as exemplified
by this quote from the National Coordinator of FFS:
There are many companies in the roadmaps that are bearers of
the vision and transition. We cannot overestimate how these sto-
ries affect societal development and our mental attitude to
whether it’s possible to create a fossil-free world. That’s why it’s
great to continue to sift out the big industry projects where we can
be useful and make it easier for the big industries to go off. We run
between business and government, depending on what is needed.
We want to help. We think that it is one of the founding bolts of
the new Swedish story about the green new industrialism [39].
According to FFS’ National Coordinator, the roadmaps demon-
strate that ‘a change of mindset has taken place in many parts of
the business world in recent years where reducing greenhouse
gas emissions is no longer considered a burden; instead, it is a nat-
ural step towards strengthening competitiveness’ [41, p. 2].
Sweden is the first country in the world where industry sectors

voluntarily are leading the way to the fossil-free future, while at
the same time increasing their competitiveness [41]. Although
synergies and mutual gains are central to this socio-technical
imaginary, FFS recognizes the shrinking time horizon for indus-
trial decarbonization (cf. [40, 42]). Thus far, the strategies sug-
gested in the roadmaps do not add up. The strategy on bioenergy
and biomass from 2021, for example, compiled and analysed the
bio-related requirements from all the 22 roadmaps, explicitly
seeks to prevent disagreement and polarization from slowing
down political processes and investments [42]:
The total need for bioenergy and biomass that is expressed in the
roadmaps would, according to our assumptions, demand a sharp
increase in biofuels import. It might seem strange and unsustain-
able that a forerunner like Sweden with quite a lot of forest would
vacuum the market for biofuels to fulfil the Swedish climate goals.
This strategy shows instead that efficiency measures, new tech-
nology and an increased processing of Swedish biomass with the
help of the price mechanism can increase Swedish export of tech-
nical solutions and bio-based products so that emission reduc-
tions in other countries can also be speeded up [42, foreword].
Increased efficiency and technological innovation should lead the
way and enable other countries to reduce their emissions through
importing
technical
solutions
and
bio-based
products
from
Sweden. The vision of Sweden as a permanent world exhibition
for new technology does not have room for the importing of bio-
mass from other countries. Successful mitigation in Sweden,
according to FFS, should not occur at the expense of other coun-
tries’ biological resources. To reach net zero emissions by 2045,
rapid and deep decarbonization of entrenched social, economic
and technological systems will be required. FFS notes that many
parts of society remain locked into carbon-intensive production
and consumption patterns, and not everyone is on board [29, 32,
36]. FFS therefore calls upon incumbent actors to accelerate their
investments in low-carbon technologies. While such investments
are necessary for Swedish industry to stay competitive and rele-
vant in the long run, they are costly and may even increase indus-
trial emissions in the short run [36, 43].
The dilemma facing the Swedish government is thus how to
create policy conditions that give energy- and resource-intensive
industries enough time and incentives to take the risk. FFS
responds to this dilemma by promising a future that makes the
risk worthwhile by helping its members to identify viable solu-
tions to get there and expanding their visibility nationally and in-
ternationally within a progressive climate action discourse. FFS
describes itself as a broker of sorts that aims to strengthen the
communication between the private sector and the government
[32]. By responding to the structural problems identified in the
roadmaps and reducing bureaucratic hurdles, FFS seeks to con-
vince fossil fuel incumbents to commit to the fossil-free society
even though the intended effects of Sweden’s climate policy
framework remain unrealized. The promissory legitimacy of FFS
hinges on the credibility of its future promise and ability to con-
vince its members that there is light at the end of the tunnel [4, p.
320]. In the following, we examine if this indeed is the case. We do
so by analysing how the Swedish steel, cement and petroleum in-
dustries imagine the journey towards the fossil-free society.
THE PROMISE RECEIVED AND
REARTICULATED: CONDITIONING THE
FOSSIL-FREE FUTURE
When analysing our interview material and the roadmaps for
fossil-free
competitiveness,
we
find
widespread
industry
commitment to Sweden’s net-zero emissions goal by 2045. The
Swedish steel, cement and petroleum industries all depict the
fossil-free transition as a necessary step towards a sustainable,
climate resilient and competitive welfare society [44–46]. All in-
dustry sectors also present their own products and services as
key in the making of that society. Carbon neutral cement, green
steel and renewable biofuels form the building blocks of the
fossil-free society yet to come. Although the development of
these climate smart products will incur high investment costs,
all three industry sectors are ready to take the lead and decar-
bonize their production processes [44–46]. Market incentives are
presented as the primary motive for such climate leadership, as
exemplified by Preem management at a webinar about the
roadmaps:
We made a big transition last fall [referring to 2020]. We ditched the
project we had been working on for quite some time for the benefit
of a 100% focus on our green projects [. . .] This is entirely driven by
commercial forces. It feels extra good that the moral and commer-
cial aspects go hand in hand pushing for transition [39].
However, all three industry sectors included in this study count
on the government to support their decarbonization journey. To
make the fossil-free transition possible, politicians need to be
brave and make bold decisions that guarantee longevity [47–49].
Thus far, the result has been mixed and Swedish government is
both depicted as an enabler of, and an obstacle to, a competitive
low carbon industry transition. All three industries present
themselves as more future-oriented than the government.
Nonetheless, they remain positive to the catalytic ambition of
FFS:
This platform (FFS) has enabled the expression of preconditions,
possibilities, demands and expectations one has as an industry or
actor [. . .] It has been a very positive platform from our perspec-
tive, enabling us to reach a broader set of stakeholders, and actors
that of course also need to act on our road to transition [49].
Also, Preem and SSAB present FFS as an important platform for
collaboration, feedback and learning. It is an initiative that has
managed to build momentum for industrial decarbonization by
supporting its members’ sustainability work, showcasing good
examples and informing and influencing the government [47,
48]. However, all three companies call for intensified industry–
government collaboration on the road towards the fossil-free
society. To meet the 2045 net-zero emissions goal, political
visions
and
market
incentives
must
go
hand
in
hand.
Disagreement on policy direction and ambition generates un-
certainty and decreases the industry’s appetite for costly low
carbon investments [49]. Hence, while the Swedish steel, ce-
ment and petroleum industries embrace the promise of the
fossil-free society, their commitment is conditional and hinges
on government support. To contain the uncertainties and risks
of the fossil-free future, these industry sectors project a socio-
technical imaginary that is conditioned by Sweden’s industrial
past and present. Three narratives cut across our material,
which we discuss below.
MAINTAINED GLOBAL LEADERSHIP
The Swedish industries included in this study all underscore
that their operations must be viewed in an international per-
spective. Drawing upon images of Sweden as an environmental
frontrunner, they portray themselves as international leaders of
sustainability and climate action [46, 48, 49]. The petroleum and
biofuels industry presents itself as a world leading industry that

is ready to contribute to a carbon-neutral and competitive
Sweden [44].
Our contribution to the Swedish and international climate goals
follow three main tracks; to increase our production of liquid re-
newable fuels with sales in Sweden and abroad; to develop our
production to include more environment- and climate adapted
products; and develop over all solutions for reduced emissions
from our refineries and supply chain [50].
Preem’s ambition is to lead the transition to a sustainable soci-
ety where the needs of current and coming generations are met
[48, 51]. The Swedish steel industry also highlights their pio-
neering role in developing the world’s first fossil-free steelmak-
ing technology. SSAB aims to ‘revolutionize steelmaking’ by
replacing coking coal, traditionally needed for ore-based steel-
making, with fossil-free electricity and hydrogen [52]. In their
fossil-free roadmap, the Swedish steel industry states that they
are already offering global climate benefits. By supplying re-
source efficient and climate-smart steel products to the global
market, they are bringing global emissions down every day:
‘The global climate would therefore benefit from more steel be-
ing produced in Sweden [. . .] The best climate policy is to sup-
port a full value chain in Sweden’ [46, p. 4].
The leadership narrative is less pronounced in the roadmap
produced by the concrete industry. While this industry sector
maintains that Sweden’s high policy ambitions can produce
global climate gains, it insists that domestic emission reduc-
tions should not come at the expense of socio-economic welfare
and industrial production. Continued access to sustainable con-
crete products will be ‘decisive in the building of a climate-safe,
sustainable Sweden of the future’ [53, p. 5].
TECHNOLOGICAL SHIFTS REQUIRE PUBLIC
SUPPORT
The power of technological innovation, resource efficiency and
recycled materials guides the imagining of the fossil-free transi-
tion for the Swedish steel, cement and petroleum industry. It is
through technological breakthroughs and more efficient use of
materials that Sweden’s net-zero emissions goal will be realized.
However, the development of pioneering technologies come at
high costs and risk for an export-dependent Swedish industry.
Hence, to secure the return of investment and maintained inter-
national competitiveness, all three industry sectors insist that
public support will be necessary. The petroleum industry calls
upon the Swedish government to ensure that domestic traffic pol-
icy will remain technologically neutral and to work actively within
the European Union to safeguard a future market for biofuels [44].
Similarly, the concrete industry calls upon the Swedish govern-
ment to stimulate demand for carbon neutral cement products:
‘Technically, we have a clear idea of the road to transition, but it’s
about how we achieve the transition competitively [...] We have
to create structures that de facto increase the demand for more
climate efficient products’ [49].
In their roadmap, this industry sector promises to halve the
climate impact of Sweden’s concrete buildings by 2023 and to
provide climate neutral concrete on the market by 2030 [45].
Since this industry currently lacks a competitive alternative to
the fossil intensive production process, Carbon Capture and
Storage (CCS) is presented as the primary technological means
to reach carbon neutrality. However, decarbonization cannot
come at the expense of profitability. Using CCS as part of the so-
lution entails large costs and the cement industry therefore
highlights the need for government support and co-financing.
To stimulate demand for climate neutral products, the govern-
ment should also instruct its agencies to use the power of pro-
curement more proactively [47, 49, 53].
A similar narrative is found in the roadmap produced by the
steel industry. By 2050, the Swedish steel industry envisions
that only ‘socially beneficial products’ will leave their produc-
tion facilities [46, p. 8]. SSAB anticipates a more circular future:
We can see that the improvement that would be necessary for the
steel industry to be able to follow the Paris Agreement are so ex-
tensive that there is no possibility to trim and tinker with current
facilities—we have to push for a technical shift [47].
However, SSAB’s fossil-free transition is also conditioned by
what is commercially viable. Since Swedish steel industry oper-
ates on a highly competitive international market, increased
prices need to be compensated for. The production of green
steel therefore hinges on a stable supply of renewable energy,
competitive taxes and a well-functioning transport infrastruc-
ture [46].
FLEXIBLE AND COST-EFFICIENT
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION
To support a fossil-free future while maintaining global compet-
itiveness, the industries included in this study call for more
flexible and cost-efficient environmental regulations [46–49, 54].
A recurring argument is that an efficient decarbonization of
value chains is better supported by international pricing mecha-
nisms and market arrangements such as the EU-ETS than by
adding domestic regulations. A global carbon tax is preferable
but deemed unlikely in the near future [40].
All three industry sectors highlight the Swedish environ-
mental permit process as one of the major obstacle to a success-
ful fossil-free industry transition. The legal requirements for
new industry operations and installations are too strictly for-
mulated in the Swedish Planning and Environmental Codes,
they argue, and the environmental permit process is too long,
complex and unpredictable for companies to take the risk [47,
49]. The message is clear. Unless the government grants indus-
try permits to develop low carbon production processes and
technologies, the 2045 net-zero emissions goal is beyond reach.
THE PROMISSORY LEGITIMACY OF FFS:
NARROWING FUTURES?
The future is an important stage for contemporary climate poli-
tics and policymaking. Projections of rising temperatures, melt-
ing
glaciers,
declining
freshwater
resources
and
extreme
weather are regularly mobilized to justify transformative cli-
mate action in the present.
To gain legitimacy for a transition to the fossil-free society,
the Swedish government has realized the power of imagination
and the importance of a good story that a broad enough set of
actors can cling on to. In order to let go of a fossil-intensive past
and present, we need a promise of better future yet to come.
In this article, we have traced the promise articulated by the
Swedish government initiative FFS to gain industry support for
the deep decarbonization required to reach net-zero emission
by 2045. This promise works through images of the prosperous
and sustainable welfare society where industry actors gain
competitive advantage by offering carbon-neutral products and
materials to global and domestic markets. Although concerns
about the urgency of mitigation action are voiced by both FSS

and the industry actors studied, the fossil-free promise appears
to have had forceful catalytic effects thus far as measured by
the number of roadmaps produced, the number of actors mobi-
lized and action taken thus far. Across the Swedish steel, ce-
ment and petroleum industries, decarbonization efforts are
unfolding and technologically optimistic imaginaries are gain-
ing hold. The socio-technical imaginary has proved productive
and the industries affiliated with FFS generally perceive the ac-
tivities of the initiative as legitimate and relevant in relation to
their climate strategies and operations, something which was
also found in an external evaluation commissioned in 2019 [55].
However, the promise of the fossil-free society is not uncon-
ditionally embraced. The imagined future projected by FFS con-
tains considerable economic risks for Sweden’s energy- and
resource-intensive industry and it remains uncertain if the
promised outcomes indeed will be realized. If the fossil-free
transition turns out to require more radical change than indus-
tries expect, Nasiritousi and Grimm [37] warn that a crisis of le-
gitimacy may follow (p. 10). Furthermore, although there is
broad political agreement surrounding the 2045 goal, a change
of government could also affect the realization of this ambition.
The promissory legitimacy of the fossil-free society hinges
on a vision of the good society where ambitious climate action,
socio-economic welfare and a thriving expert industry go hand
in hand. This involves creating enough certainty about the fu-
ture so that industry actors can anticipate the risks and costs of
climate actions pursued in the present. While all three industry
actors to a certain extent question the fossil-free promise, they
accept the transition as inevitable and support the national cli-
mate goals. The Covid-19 pandemic, for example, had negative
economic effects on all three companies. Nonetheless, all inter-
viewees maintain that their sustainability and climate work is
essential and remained prioritized [47–49].
Although the roads towards decarbonization are paved dif-
ferently for the three companies, they consolidate around a
fossil-free future that is a techno-optimistic extension of the
fossil-intensive present. The paths charted by these energy-
intensive industry sectors are characterized by incremental
changes conditioned by the technological past and present.
Informed by ‘narratives of necessity’ [56] such as sustained
global competitiveness and profitability, our study suggests that
these industry actors do not imagine profound transformations
of entrenched social or economic systems. Technical shifts will
strengthen Swedish industries as international role models, en-
abling the export of climate neutral solutions. The fossil-free fu-
ture thus appears intact and stable. The envisioned changes do
constitute the leap into unrealized landscapes that Jasanoff [3]
speaks of. The roadmaps constitute powerful techniques of
futuring [17] giving meaning and shape to this future by en-
abling certain paths while simultaneously ruling out other tra-
jectories, constraining the number of futures available. By
inviting industry actors to anticipate the risks and opportunities
attached to the fossil-free society, the roadmaps are also in-
volved in performing that society.
The fossil-free imaginary has gained traction, but what
forms of agency and subjectivity are created on the road to the
fossil-free society? For whom is the promise articulated? The
roadmaps are in practice highly political documents in terms of
imagining potential futures, but they do not capture the broader
political preconditions at play. The lack of political contestation
in this material is reflective of this fact. Actively minimizing
space for discussing goal conflicts and potential losses in the
FFS process may have catalysed wider industry action, but tran-
sitions
and
transformations
require
co-creation
and
the
contrasting views of many stakeholders in order to be legiti-
mate, sustainable and just (cf. [57, 58]). Returning to Beckert [4],
climate policy making includes mobilizing public support for fu-
ture visions, hence in order for the government to strengthen
the promissory legitimacy of the fossil-free society more
broadly, potential costs, goal conflicts and losses have to be in-
creasingly addressed. Furthermore, it remains to be seen how
Sweden’s national climate policy and roadmap implementation
fare in the face of current geopolitical developments.
Further studies of interest on this topic include place-based
analyses of transition and transformation, encompassing both
acts of (explicit) representation and the associated material lo-
cal assemblages, including the views and ideas of a broader set
of stakeholders. The international dimensions of FFS would
also be a relevant subject of further study; what does it entail to
be a display window for the rest of the world and how do low-
income country settings fit into this equation?
