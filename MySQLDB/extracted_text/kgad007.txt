Abstract
Adequate and regular levels of precipitation are fundamental to the sustained success of civilizations based on early agricultural pro-
duction technologies, but palaeoclimate studies have concentrated on temperature. Potentially important insights into the fates of
early civilization can be gained, however, from long term records of precipitation. Patterns in precipitation over the past 5000 years
recorded by the ice accumulation balance in the GISP 2 ice core on the Greenland plateau appear to be correlated with major events
in European and Mediterranean history. Near Greenland, Viking raids coincided with a major step-wise precipitation increase after
600 CE. Viking settlement of Greenland coincided with a precipitation low. During the Egyptian Old Kingdom period of pyramid-
building precipitation was higher than when the New Kingdom tombs were excavated. The Old Kingdom and Akkadian Empire both
failed as precipitation descended into the same prolonged precipitation low. The end of the New Kingdom and of the other Bronze
Age civilizations in the eastern Mediterranean and around the Aegean Sea coincided with the lowest ice accumulation rate in the
past 5000 years. The Roman ‘Imperial Good Times’ coincided with a precipitation high. The brief 2nd century imperial reigns and
those of late New Kingdom pharaohs accompanied precipitation lows, as did the Antonine and Justinianic plagues. A trans-Alpine
‘production see-saw’ hypothesis, in which the same precipitation levels generated opposite effects, ﬁts the sequence of successes
and failures of western civilizations.
Lay Summary
Global warming captures the headlines and occupies global research programmes, but precipitation is a key factor in food production
now and even more so in the past. Until recently the margin between seed harvested and seed sown was very low: drought or ﬂoods
could eliminate it entirely. Most climate studies relating to the past 5000 years in Europe and the Mediterranean are local in scope.
There is no overall pattern against which to interpret regional historic events. Ice accumulation (balance between precipitation and
evaporation) through time on the Greenland plateau may provide an overarching perspective on the precipitation history of these
areas. Preliminary comparisons of the well-dated ice accumulation record with dates of signiﬁcant historical events such as the col-
lapse of Bronze Age civilizations, the Viking diaspora, and pandemics suggest that the events were correlated with lows and highs of
Greenland ice accumulation. An ‘Alpine see-saw’ model may be useful in understanding why changes in the fortunes of communi-
ties north and south of the mountains were often in opposition. Finally, events can be correlated without one causing the other. The
examples canvassed here meet accepted criteria for their being a causal relationship between precipitation and the fates of
civilizations.

Introduction
Possible interactions between climate change and social sys-
tems have attracted much attention recently. Mayewski et al.
drew attention to ‘six periods of significant climate change’ and
that ‘several intervals coincide with major disruptions of civili-
zation’ [1]. Periods of change on regional and local geographic
scales have been interpreted using proxies such as pollen
records of vegetation change, isotopic chemistry of speleo-
thems, geochemistry and dust records in ice and ocean cores.
One ice core in particular, GISP2, taken from the summit of the
Greenland ice cap (72.6 N, 38.5 W; 3200 m a.s.l.) has provided
key long-term information on climate change over the past
200 000 years [1–3].

The GISP2 proxies, and those of the Greenland GRIP core whose
records are comparable to that from GISP 2, have been applied in
discussions of hemispheric climate change and in Holocene climate
in general [1, 4–6]. However, while recognizing that temperature
and precipitation are linked. Meese et al. interpreted the d18O of the
core layers in terms of fluctuations in atmospheric temperature [2].
The record that ice accumulation provides of precipitation in areas
affected by the North Atlantic (and rainfall fluctuations elsewhere)
has received less attention, although significant events in human
history over the past 5000 years, such as the sudden end of the east-
ern Mediterranean Bronze Age, and—in more detail—over the past
2500years have been related in part to changes in precipitation pat-
terns [7–12]. Drought episodes such as the one contemporary with
the end of the Akkadian Empire and a protracted drought around
Galilee in the 13th and 12th centuries BCE recorded in local pollen
from a Sea of Galilee bed core, contemporary with the ‘Systems col-
lapse in the Aegean’, provide support for precipitation being a major
driver of human events [13–18]. For example, McCormick et al. pro-
vided a comprehensive review of climate change and cultural issues
during and after the Roman Empire, recording higher rainfall (evi-
denced by records of Tiber flooding) during the core of their ‘Roman
Optimum’ [19].
Terrestrial climate signals for such episodes, including pollen
analysis of vegetation changes, speleothems, and peat bog water
tables can usually detect severe events [15, 20–22]. Human food
supplies can be affected by more subtle changes in the amount
and seasonality of precipitation. The margin between food and
hardship was often slender [23–25]. Precipitation—too little or too
much—is important to most cultures, especially those whose ag-
ricultural environments are marginal. Regional records, such as
that for the drought around Galilee in the 13th and 12th centuries
BCE, provide evidence for local effects [15]. Only long-term
records of precipitation can reveal any overall patterns.
Accumulation of ice on large plateau such as that of Greenland
offers a potential source of such information if the records can be
shown to apply more generally, and not just in adjacent regions.
Temperature can modulate the rate and magnitude of ice accumu-
lation if there is snowfall to generate ice. The GISP2 ice core accu-
mulation record (GIA, hereafter) then indicates the availability of
atmospheric moisture in northern latitudes. Mayewski et al. an-
chored their review of climate variability in the Holocene to the
‘well-dated, high resolution’ GISP 2 chemistry series, noting that
those records are correlated globally with glacier fluctuations [1, 3].
While Mayewski et al. cautioned against assuming that the GISP 2
chemistry series can ‘capture every possible RCC [rapid climate
change] in the Holocene’, they suggested that using the annual
layers, several periods of climatic fluctuation can be identified in
the Holocene, including large perturbations at 4200–3800 and
3500–2500 BP [1].
Relevance of the GIA to social events farther afield would be
supported by repeated associations between patterns in the GIA
record and historical events. On the view that human affairs are
affected as much, if not more, by precipitation than temperature,
I explored the possibility that patterns in the GIA record accord
with significant historical trends and cultural events over the
past 5000 years in regions near and at a distance from Greenland
(Fig. 1). If some or all do accord with sociological events, the GIA
can augment and extend local records, such as those from spe-
leothems in Italy and the Levant [20, 21, 26]. Rohling et al. cau-
tioned, however, that some proxies from Levantine cave systems
may not reflect conventional understanding of isotopic responses
to climate [27].
As is implicit in the title, the comparisons drawn herein are em-
pirical. None of the following is meant to imply that the sign of the
changes in precipitation throughout the area of interest was always
the same as that in Greenland. However, the LOESS-smoothed GISP
2 record is an integration of the annual or near annual accumula-
tions and significant trends through decades and centuries, which
may allow for sufficient temporal coincidence between regions at
these longer timescales.

smoothed using local regression (LOESS) analysis in Past 3.26b V
R
[28–30]. Different LOESS smoothing factors were explored to ob-
tain an informative balance between noise reduction and reten-
tion of basic patterns and significant excursions. All smoothing
factors were applied to the ice accumulation records for the three
ice retreat models (50 km, 100 km, 200 km) in the GISP2 data.
Patterns in the chosen curve were then compared with dates
for significant cultural events highlighted in major reviews of
European and eastern Mediterranean history and late prehistory
[16–19, 31]. Most if not all of the events covered are basic features
of any history of the western world. The process was simply to
compare parallel chronologies of major historical events with
that of the GIA record. These parallel chronologies were assem-
bled as potentially fruitful topics for future investigation. Four
‘case study’ periods were explored in more detail, as were the
timing of major plagues and the first records of infective agents.
It is generally accepted that statistical analyses of cause and
effect, extracting evidence for causation from multiple examples
of correlation, is difficult [32]. Complex Bayesian methods are
now available, including Granger Causality, which has been used
in exploring climate teleconnections [33]. However, such analyses
were not felt to be appropriate at this stage. Statistical analysis
reported here is confined to regressing dates for four key events
against the dates for the onset of extreme lows of GIA. Dates for
the events and local minima were also plotted relative to the date
of onset of the low excursion. Relationships between events and
finer detail of the GISP record were visualized by comparison of
the chronology of cultural events discussed in ref [19] employing
a 0.01 smoothing factor LOESS curve (Appendix 1).
The first case study was of events in the first and second mil-
lennia CE in Scandinavia and its environs. These are the regions
closest to Greenland and subject to much the same weather pat-
terns at present. The Viking age presents special problems of
cause, context, and timing because of the paucity of written
records,
which
are

surrounding
areas
and
not
Scandinavia itself [16–18].
Moving from the area closest to Greenland to those farthest,
the GIA chronology was set against dates for activities within,
and the decline and end of, the Egyptian Old Kingdom. Egypt’s
productivity was controlled by Nile flood waters fed by monsoon
rains in the highlands of Ethiopia [34]. Staying in Egypt but mov-
ing on 1500 years, the GIA chronology was then compared with
that of events in the periods encompassing the end of the
Egyptian Middle Kingdom, the rise and flowering of the New
Kingdom, and its fall. This period also saw the end of the Bronze
Age civilizations of Mycenae, the Hittites, and of other polities of
the eastern Mediterranean. Fourth, the GIA patterns during the

Europe and the surviving Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire
were examined.
Although events before 5000 BP are less well known, new data
from ancient DNA analyses provide a parallel chronology whose
patterns are examined in light of those from later, better
recorded, history. Finally, results from ancient genetics were
added to known and suspected periods of plague and famine in
relation to major patterns in the GIA.
Results
Comparison of LOESS-smoothed ice accumulation records based
on three models of ice retreat showed differences only in overall
magnitude (Fig. 2). The most extreme—200 km retreat—model
was used in the analysis. A smoothing factor of 0.04 was chosen
as a compromise between generating a ‘noisy’ record and obliter-
ating potentially interesting pattern. The overall pattern in the
0.04 LOESS curve is of extended periods of relatively minor fluc-
tuations, punctuated by episodes of extremely low accumulation,
around a mean of 23.05 6 0.04 cm a1 (variance ¼ 0.0016) until
the second half of the first millennium; after 640 CE GIA rose
step-wise, peaking c. 800 CE and then fluctuated around a higher
mean
(24.264 6 0.058 cm,
variance ¼ 0.00341)
(Fig.
3).
Three
Egyptian chronologies were included for comparison with the
GIA curve during periods 2 and 3 (Fig. 3) [35–37].
Before 640 CE the GIA was more regular (CV ¼ 17.36 versus
24.06 after 640 CE) and the variances were highly significantly dif-
ferent (Levene’s test P (same) ¼ 1.91E-77). The 7th century CE in-
crease

The ‘Dark Ages’, Vikings, and the Middle ages:
500–1500 CE (Fig. 4)
During this period the fourth lowest GIA minimum, at 560 CE, was
followed by the highest sustained increase in GIA in the past
5000years, reaching a maximum c. 800 CE. The period of increas-
ing GIA encompassed the change in behaviour of Scandinavian
seafarers, from trading, to raiding, to a diaspora to eastern Europe,
the Mediterranean, Iceland, and Greenland [38]. During a period of
lower GIA (lower precipitation) that lasted until c. 750 CE, Norse
had occupied trading colonies on islands such as Eigg in the Inner
Hebrides [38]. After 750 CE, the dramatic increase in GIA coincided
with the change to Viking raiding. The sack of the Lindisfarne
monastery in 793 CE marked the beginning of a century of violent
attacks, culminating in permanent Viking settlement of England
and Normandy [16–18, 38].

England in 865 CE, when the GIA was still higher than at any time
in the previous 3500 years.
Viking trading centres were established along the major rivers
flowing south into the Black Sea in the 750 s CE as the GIA rose
steeply. They were lucrative outlets for slaves captured in the
north and sold as far south as Baghdad. As the Vikings moved
south, they besieged Constantinople in 860 CE, during the pro-
longed first post-Justinian peak GIA. The Rus campaigns of con-
quest took place as Viking raiding declined in the west, and as
GIA declined in the 10th century CE [38]. After 1000 CE, Viking
settlers
from
Iceland
reached
Greenland,
and
then
Newfoundland [40]. The Viking population of Greenland was
highest during the period of low GIA between 1150 and 1300 CE.
The colonies declined to extinction at the same time as GIA in-
creased towards a new maximum c. 1400 CE [41–43].
Contemporary with the GIA decline after 1000 CE, but before
its lowest point c. 1200 CE, Vikings achieved a brief over-lordship
of England. That was followed by a brief return to Saxon rule.
Finally, in 1066 CE a Norman (French Viking) king assumed the
English throne and established a permanent presence. The detail
is important here because the Normans immediately instigated,
amongst many other things, a massive cathedral building pro-
gramme to consolidate their rule, regardless of the stress on the
local population. Although the French had invented Gothic
cathedrals, most of the great French cathedrals were founded
nearly a century after the peak of English cathedral establish-
ment, during the period of lowest GIA (Fig. 4).
Egyptian Old Kingdom (Fig. 5)
The colossal burial pyramids for Fourth Dynasty pharaohs from
Sneferu to Menkaure were built during a peak in GIA. Continuous
grain surpluses would have been required to sustain the perhaps
20 000 workers engaged in the pyramid building itself plus as
many more in mining, smelting, and transporting the copper re-
quired for the mason’s chisels and in the local and regional trans-
port systems [44–46]. The subsequent decline in the size and
quality in the pyramids coincided with a falling GIA. The end of
the Sixth Dynasty coincided with a major fall in GIA (Fig. 5), soon
after the onset of the 4.2 ka ‘event’ [47]. The long reign of Pepy II
encompassed both this fall and the declining fortunes of the dy-
nasty itself (Fig. 5) [46]. The duration of the GIA low corresponded
to that of the Egyptian First Intermediate Period (Fig. 5) [36, 46].
Many studies record a ‘multi-centennial’ drought c. 4200 BP,
contemporary with both the end of the Sixth Dynasty and a pe-
riod of very low GIA [14, 20, 48–51]. None of the studies associated
the drought with the contemporary GIA low. Drysdale et al. noted

that the relationship between the drought and ice rafted debris
event 3 (IRD3) is unclear [20].
During the Fourth to Sixth Dynasties, the Fayum Lake, fed by
a branch of the Nile had been deep, during times when GIA was
high. In the period of low GIA corresponding to the First
Intermediate Period the feeder stream seems to have silted up,
and ‘may even have been choked with sand’ [46: p. 472]. As the
Middle Kingdom progressed, the Nile flow increased, in concert,
apparently, with the increase in GIA. In the reign of Amenemhat
III Nile floods were 6 m higher than during the Intermediate
Period and were damaging food production. The channel was
cleared and the Fayum used as a buffer, taking some of the flood
waters, storing them and releasing them gradually as the flood
subsided. This would have both solved the problem of high floods
and prolonged the supply of useful water [46].
Reasons proposed for the sudden and complete end of the Old
Kingdom and its dynasties have included stagnation of society
during Pepy II’s ‘overly-long’ reign, and exhaustion of the dynasty
itself [46, 52, 53].
The Old Kingdom ended at the same time as the Akkadian
Empire fell, during a prolonged drought that coincided with an
extended extreme low in GIA. The Mesopotamian drought impli-
cated in the Akkadian collapse is recorded in the mineralogy of a
marine sediment core from the Gulf of Oman, and isotopes in
Oman corals and farther west by pollen in Cyprus [47, 54, 55]. But
low Nile floods would have been necessary to affect production
along the Nile. Lower floods require diminution or even failure of
the East African monsoon with lower rainfall in the headwaters
of the Blue Nile, the flood source [34]. Lower East African rainfall
at that time has been reported in several studies [56–61].
Significant drought is recorded by dust horizons in ice cores on
Mt Kilimanjaro [62]. Farther afield, and suggesting hemispheric
teleconnections, during the ‘4.2 ka event’ the Indian summer
monsoon weakened, there was a cold period in Japan and a se-
vere drought in continental North America [47, 63–65].
Egyptian New Kingdom and the ‘Collapse of the
Bronze Age’ (Fig. 6)
Written accounts and archaeological records for a multiplicity of
cultures around the eastern Mediterranean during the late
Bronze Age allow a more detailed comparison of GIA with the
chronology of major cultural events there (Fig. 6) [16–18, 66].
The
end
of
the
Egyptian
New
Kingdom—and
of
the
Mediterranean Bronze Age—coincided with the lowest GIA of the
past 5000 years. Reviews invoke drought as a potential factor in a
Bronze Age ‘systems collapse’ [15–18, 67]. The GIA suggests that
the drought at that time was unprecedented in the histories of
these cultures.
The end of the Mycenaean cities, of the Hittite Empire, of
Cyprus, and many Levantine city states coincided with the dramatic
drop in GIA (Fig. 6) [68]. The extreme GIA low coincided with the ‘3.2
ka event’ with a protracted drought in Galilee [15, 47]. In the North
Atlantic it coincided with IRD2 [69].
Details in the Egyptian written record can be associated di-
rectly with the timing of major trends in the GIA record. GIA had
already dropped significantly when Pharaoh Merneptah fought
the so-called Sea Peoples in their first incursion (Fig. 6). It had
fallen still further when Ramesses III fought invaders ‘on both
land and sea’, as recorded on the walls of his mortuary temple at
Figure 5. The Fourth to Sixth Dynasties of the Old Kingdom, Egypt, including the pre-Dynastic and early Dynastic periods and the First Intermediate
Period, against the GISP 2 GIA record.

Medinet Habu [16, 17]. Genetic evidence has confirmed the move-
ment of people south and east from the Aegean at this time [31].
In sharp contrast to the 40–50 000 quarrymen, masons, copper
miners and smelters, ship-builders, and sailors supported by
Egyptian grain production to build the great pyramids, the New
Kingdom supported just 500 people to cut and decorate the royal
tombs in the Valleys of the Kings and Queens [44, 46, 70]. The tombs
excavated, however beautiful and complex they might be, were, in
comparison to the pyramids, inexpensive structures beneath the
natural pyramid of the Qurn (Egyptian ‘Meretseger’). In 1155 BCE
the Egyptian state granaries had difficulty supporting even those
500 workers and their families in Deir el Medina (Fig. 6).
The tomb makers staged the first recorded strikes in an effort
to get their rations re-instated [70]. At the time of GIA records ex-
tremely low precipitation, there was no signal in the Italian cave
speleothem proxies of a drought at this time, except perhaps a
brief spike in the calcite d18O [20]. However the same proxy from
a stalagmite in Mavri Trypa Cave, on the southwest Peloponnese
recorded increasingly dry conditions after c. 3250 BP ¼ 1300 BCE,
which continued until an 800 year hiatus in stalagmite formation
at the site [21]. The onset at c. 1300 CE corresponds to the begin-
ning of the major dip in GIA (Fig. 6), but the stalagmite record
suggests that the
recovery
in precipitation in
the eastern
Mediterranean was after that in Greenland.
The hard times in Egypt culminated in the devastation of
the Year of the Hyaenas (Fig. 6) [70]. Before the GIA had risen
again, Egyptians starved and the temples were desecrated [70].
The GIA peaked again in the period of Ramesses XI’s ‘re-birth’
of Egypt [70]. The return of the GIA to previous levels coincided
too
with
the
re-establishment
of
polities
in
the
eastern
Mediterranean [18].
The migrations of peoples at the end of the Bronze Age, during
the extreme GIA low, are in sharp contrast to the situation in the
8th and 9th century CE Viking diaspora, which took place at an
extreme GIA high. The difference may reflect the different ‘nor-
mal’ of the migrants’ homelands. There is little indication that
the ‘Sea peoples’ came from outside the Mediterranean basin
where a period of sustained lower precipitation in a normally dry
(whether hot or cold) environment would potentially cripple agri-
cultural production. Viking agriculture, in a normally humid en-
vironment, would have faltered under higher rather than lower
precipitation.
Roman Empire and Late Classical Europe (Fig. 7)
The Roman Empire peaked in the early 2nd century CE, when
Emperor Hadrian ended its expansion [71]. Earlier, the final years
of the Republic were characterized by civil war, and coincided
with an increasing GIA, which
peaked just after Emperor
Augustus’s death. The Republic was followed by a period when
great wealth was accumulated and spent by emperors such as
Nero. By the time Vesuvius destroyed Pompeii and Herculaneum,
GIA was falling. The start of a decline to a minimum at 200 CE co-
incided with the first of the Five Good Emperors [72]. Although
not recognized among the late Holocene climatic ‘events’ and
less deep than during the 4.2 ka and 3.2 ka ‘events’, the fall in GIA
(1.5 cm a1) from its preceding high was greater than that leading
to the 3.2 ka ‘event’ GIA low (1.0 cm a1) (Fig. 3).While these are
small reductions in absolute terms, they represent 40% and 27%
of the total LOESS filtered range for the past 5000 years, respec-
tively. Hence, the ‘Roman low’ in GIA was as great a change from
‘normal’ for Roman farmers as had been the 3.2 ka ‘event’ low for
the Hittites and others around the eastern Mediterranean.

Over the next 150 years the silver content of Roman coinage
dropped from nearly 100% to near zero (Fig. 7) [73, 74]. Silver van-
ished from the currency a few decades after the GIA minimum.
As one of the few metrics of the Imperial economy available to
us, this provides a background to the testimony of the edicts to
stifle the movement of peasants to urban areas. That movement
may have had as one of its causes lower production as lower pre-
cipitation reduced crop success. Taxes began to be collected in
kind rather than in cash. Other factors, of course, were operating
at this time, including the staunching of the flow of spoils and
slaves from new conquests after the Imperial boundaries were
stabilized by Hadrian. His wall in northern Britannia was built as
the GIA reached a new low. The Antonine Plague had ravaged the
Empire just before the lowest GIA. The reigns of successive
emperors in this period were seldom longer than 2 years (Fig. 7),
which parallels the short reigns of Egypt’s 20th Dynasty (Fig. 6).
Written records suggest that Tiber floods were more frequent
in Augustus’s reign and a little after (Appendix 1) [19]. This sug-
gests that rainfall was generally higher in central Italy at that
time: McCormick et al. note also that temperatures on the
Greenland plateau were higher too at that time [19]. The higher
temperatures coincided with the GIA peak. Warmer tempera-
tures would have enhanced evaporation and so snowfall must
have been particularly high at that time. Three hundred and fifty
years later the GIA high c. 400 CE coincided with the Dulan-
Wulan drought in China [19].
Emperor Diocletian (284–305 CE) reigned as the GIA was rising
again. The pattern of association between climate and success,
crisis, and partial recovery of the Empire echoes the pattern of
GIA over the same period (Fig. 7) [19]. At this new GIA peak,
Germanic tribes crossed the Rhine, and the Romans left Britain
soon after [18]. The last Western Emperor was deposed by
Germanic invaders in 476 CE at a time when GIA had declined
one-third towards its next, late 6th century CE, minimum.
Emperor Justinian, in Constantinople, capital of the Eastern
Roman Empire, had to deal with the ‘Justinianic’ Plague that
struck in 541/542 CE, just before, as with the earlier Antonine
Plague, the GIA approached another major low [31]. After that
low, GIA began its longest continuous and most significant rise in
the past 5000 years, peaking c. 800 CE. The highest GIA saw not
only the onset of Viking raiding, it saw also the emergence and
success of the House of Islam, which in a few decades, carried by
Arab armies, reached the Atlantic, the Pyrenees, and beyond.
Plagues (Fig. 8)
Norrie has posited disease as having been a major factor in east-
ern Mediterranean history [75]. The earliest bubonic plague path-
ogen known at present was isolated from an individual who died
in eastern Europe late in the Egyptian First Intermediate Period
[31]. This post-dated the GIA low which coincided with the ends
of the Egyptian Old Kingdom and the Akkadian Empire. The
‘Plague of Athens’ occurred during the recovery from a GIA low
(Fig. 8) [76]. There were significant interactions between climate,
disease, and the activities and success of the Roman Empire [77].
As noted above, both the Antonine and Justinianic plagues im-
mediately preceded the lowest points of extreme GIA lows. The
lowest GIA had coincided with the collapse of polities in the east-
ern Mediterranean, at the end of the Bronze Age. That towns and

cities were abandoned at that time, apparently without evidence
of violence, may suggest the presence of a lethal pandemic dis-
ease [75]. Indeed, Krause & Trappe place the ‘Hittite Plague’ at
this time [31].
The best known historical plague to have afflicted Europe, the
Black Death of 1346 CE onwards, followed—not preceding as with
the previous two—a GIA minimum. Its relationship to the mini-
mum is therefore not the same as the previous ones, but it took
place in much-changed social, political, and economic environ-
ments. It was just 25 years, a generation, after the end of the
‘Great Famine’ (1315–1322), which was closer to the GIA mini-
mum.
Before 5000 BP (Figs 9 and 10)
Events in European and Mediterranean pre-history have become
clearer with the development and application of ever more so-
phisticated high-speed genomic sequencing and analyses [31].
Major events such as the migrations of peoples, sometimes into
apparently vacant landscapes which the Yamnaya seem to have
encountered when moving west into Europe, and the appearance
and sustained presence of pathogens between 9000 BP and 5000
BP seem to be related to patterns in the GIA similar to those in
the record after 5000 BP (Fig. 9) [31]. The first known occurrences
of plague and of bubonic plague both immediately follow GIA
lows (Fig. 10).
The advance of Anatolian farmers into Europe followed the
steep post-Younger Dryas rise in GIA, and was followed immedi-
ately by an abrupt c.500-year GIA low (Fig. 9). After that, the
movement north from the Zagros Mountains to north of the
Caucasus occupied a GIA high bracketing 5500 BCE. Then, the
westward migration of the Yamnaya followed a significant GIA
low. As noted above, the first evidence for bubonic plague imme-
diately post-dates that low, but itself is likely to post-date the
first occurrence of the pathogen. That may have coincided with
the GIA low. The Yamnaya westward expansion from the steppe
was contemporary with the sharpest peak (Fig. 10) in an extended
1000-year GIA high (Fig. 9).
Discussion
Most discussions of relationships between long-term (mostly as-
tronomical) and short-term (volcanogenic) climatic patterns and
human affairs focus on temperature. Individual events have
been related to variation on local or regional precipitation, espe-
cially drought (e.g. the Akkadian and Galilean droughts), but not
to long-term trends or greater geographic extent. The local focus
may result from the perceived absence of long-term precipitation
records relevant to areas such as the eastern Mediterranean.
This in turn may result partly from the necessary reliance on
palynology, dendrochronology, and local speleothems for assess-
ing the environmental effects of fluctuations in precipitation.
However, the margin between good and bad harvests in pre-
industrial grain production exposed populations to famine at lev-
els of precipitation change which even if they lasted a decade
would be unlikely to be signaled by changes in local or regional
vegetation. Subtle long-term fluctuation as recorded in the GIA
may offer the kind of long-term record of use in interpreting the
basis of changes that are widely recognized in ancient civiliza-
tions. Of course, the parallel records presented here do not of
themselves constitute evidence of causation.
However, repeated patterns, and a general ‘consilience’ of
associations of features of the GIA and major events in human

history, suggest that further investigation of potential linkages
may be fruitful. The concept of consilience will be discussed be-
low, but first, in a highly influential paper, Hill listed nine aspects
of association that together should be considered ‘before deciding
that the most likely interpretation. . . is causation.’ [32]. Although
not all are relevant to the present data, these are: (1) most impor-
tantly, the strength of association; (2) the consistency of the ob-
served association, i.e. has it been repeatedly observed in
different places, circumstances, and times? (3) Specificity: is the
association limited to particular situations? Hill cautions against
over-emphasizing this characteristic. (4) Temporality: the tempo-
ral relationship of the association (‘which is the cart and which
the horse?’); (5) Biological gradient—which may be relevant to the
occurrence of plagues; (6) Plausibility: ‘It will be helpful if the cau-
sation we suspect is biologically plausible—‘But this is a feature
I am convinced we cannot demand’. (7) Coherence: the cause-
and-effect interpretation should not contradict with generally
known facts. (8) Experiment: this can only be invoked in terms of
‘natural experiments’ with the present data sets; are the same
circumstances appearing later in history associated with the
same results? (9) Analogy: In some circumstances it would be fair
to judge by analogy.
Dealing with these in turn in relation to the chronological
associations identified here, the first aspect, strength of associa-
tion can probably be seen as ‘strong’. Each low GIA was associ-
ated with a significant decline in the fortunes of one or more
cultures; in contrast, GIA highs were associated with the shift
from trading to raiding and settlement by the Vikings in the late
8th century CE, Viking settlement of Greenland, and the Roman
‘Imperial Good Times’ or ‘Optimum’ [19]. The association be-
tween cultural declines and plagues and extreme lows in GIA is
consistent
(feature
2).
The
cultural
declines
around
the
Mediterranean are specific to GIA lows (feature 3). As shown by
the regressions in Fig. 11A and the plots of dates of events versus
start, minimum, and recovery dates for GIA lows in Fig. 11B, there
is a clear pattern of potential result following potential cause
(feature 4).
Feature 5, biological gradient, is not applicable to these data sets.
Feature 6 is, however, entirely relevant. Events in recent history
such as the climatic effects of the Tambora eruption on European
food production caused by persistent heavy rains and the droughts
in the Mid-West of the 1930s show that precipitation is a significant
influence on human affairs. Both those examples were short-lived,
but it is entirely plausible based on those experiences—and sup-
ported by increasing scientific evidence—that the centennial span
of the late 2nd millennium BCE drought could cause the demise of
Bronze Age civilization. Equally it is plausible that the protracted
low GIA associated with the low Nile floods that spelled the end of
colossal pyramids is a viable example of cause and effect.
For feature 7, coherence, the cause-and-effect interpretation
does not contradict generally known facts about the influence of
precipitation on the success of cultures. Feature 8, experimentation,
is not relevant to the present data. However, feature 9, analogy,
could be invoked in comparing, for example, the mass migration of
people from the ‘Dust Bowl’ to California during a decadal drought
with the mass movements of peoples preceding the end of the
Bronze Age, some of whom have gone down in history as the ‘Sea
Peoples’.
The concept of consilience—literally ‘jumping together’ or
‘concordance of several’—was introduced by the ‘natural
philosopher’ William Whewell in 1840. Although probably little
known
in
the
physical
sciences
today,
Whewell
was
an
influential historian and philosopher of science in the early
19th century. Amongst many other contributions in diverse

fields, he invented the terms ‘anode’, ‘cathode’, and ‘ion’ for
Faraday and the word ‘scientist’ in 1833 [78].
Consilience was used to effect by Darwin in developing his
arguments for natural selection [79, 80]. The term refers to ‘proof
by coordination of so many otherwise unrelated consequences
under a single causal explanation that no other organization of
data seems conceivable’ [80: p. 104]. Gould shaped the definition
in this way to explicate his view that Darwin employed consil-
ience as a ‘principal tactic of bringing so many points of evidence
on a single subject, that history wins assent by overwhelming
confirmation and unique coordination’ [80: p. 104].
Substituting ‘precipitation’ for ‘history’ allows the patterns
presented here to be seen in a different, although non-statistical,
light. The probability of a causal association increases rapidly as
instances accumulate. On this basis, it should, at the very least,
be fruitful to explore further the potential associations of historic
events with the GIA record. In presenting this view, I take
Darwin’s point that ‘False facts are highly injurious to the
progress of science, for they often endure long; but false views, if
supported by some evidence, do little harm, for every one takes a
salutary pleasure in proving their falseness.’ [81].
A potential avenue for assessing the ability of Greenland ice
accumulation to reflect overall precipitation in Europe and west-
ern Asia and hence on the human history of the region is the con-
cept of an ‘Alpine precipitation and production see-saw’. Soils
and crops north and south of the main mountain ranges respond
in opposite senses to the same level of rainfall (Fig. 12). Higher
precipitation on the heavy soils north of the Alps would limit
production there. It is possible that the ‘Dark Ages’ high precipita-
tion may even have led to the development of strip field ‘ridge
and furrow’ agriculture, which matured between 850 and 1150
CE, during the period of high GIA [82]. The part of the crop in the
wet furrows may have been sacrificed to ensure production on
the ridges.
Generally
higher
precipitation
would,
in
contrast,
have
benefited production from the dry, light Mediterranean and
Middle Eastern soils. The opposite effects would accompany
generally lower precipitation: production would be higher in the
north and lower, and more fickle, in the south.
The effects on human populations would be different rates of
population growth and incentives to migrate north and south of the
mountains (Figs 12 and 13). For example, during periods of general
low precipitation, droughts in the south would limit populations
and ‘wealth’, whereas populations in the north would grow, only to
face difficulties when precipitation increased and the higher
population would be hard to feed. Each successive event would not
necessarily repeat the earlier ones as the ‘players’ would have been
changed. For the south, the compounding effects of prolonged
drought and potential consequences are set out in Figs 12 and 13.
The processes involved in generating higher and lower precipi-
tation in the areas of the hypothesized production see-saw are
complex and still not well understood. It is difficult to model past
patterns in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), one of the major
drivers of—particularly winter—climate in the North Atlantic
Basin Europe and the Mediterranean Basin by controlling the
direction and speed of prevailing winds [83–85]. Especially
significant for this study, the NAO is seen as a major forcing
factor in precipitation patterns in the Mediterranean [86].
The GISP2 core record is presently influenced by the Icelandic
Low and storms from Davis Strait and Baffin Bay, with another
influence on isotopic signals in the ice being via the winter tempera-
ture seesaw between Greenland and northern Europe [87]. A strong
positive NAO index is presently associated with above normal pre-
cipitation in northern Europe, a condition for lower production

there, and below average precipitation in southern Europe, again
potentially a condition for lower production. A negative index, with
lower precipitation in northern and higher in southern Europe,
would on this model enhance productivity in both. Winter rainfall
is therefore unlikely to be a determinant of production mismatch
north and south of the Alps. Any trans-Alpine production see-saw
would then depend on regional summer rainfall, during the crop-
ping season, over multiple growing seasons.
Other factors, of course, such as cycles in solar radiation [88]
and periodic individual or clusters of major volcanic eruptions,
can affect climate on shorter or longer timescales [88, 89]. Here, I
draw attention to an apparently little used integrated record of
precipitation from a core whose geochemistry had been main-
tained to be an important source of climatic information, includ-
ing events triggered or groomed by such factors [87]. The ice
accumulation provides a background precipitation record that
may be useful in interpreting mooted interactions between
climate and social systems on at least a regional scale.
Conclusions
Early agrarian communities and even great early civilizations
and ‘empires’ were at the mercy of the weather—and climate—
for food production. They traded with others for the necessities
such as materials and tools, and swapped luxuries to keep those
sources open. They were nascent polities, but are seen now
through the lens of modern city states with economies, budgets,
debts, and surpluses, and the trained bureaucracies that did not
exist—or existed then in only very rudimentary forms [36, 45, 46,
90, 91].
The consistent correspondences between highs and lows in
the rate of ice accumulation in Greenland and events such as
migrations, the fall of civilizations, and periodic plagues suggest
that Greenland preserves a valuable record of precipitation over
a far wider geographic area than is appreciated at present. The
variations in precipitation recorded in the ice core, particularly
the extreme lows, seems to have their consequences in the suc-
cess or otherwise of European and Mediterranean cultures
throughout the Holocene.
