“Flood-readiness is key to 
societal resilience. By learning 
from one another, these cities 
could make much-needed 
progress on climate resilience. 
This would include maintaining 
a city-level risk management

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Climate Change and the Preparedness of 16 Major Canadian Cities to Limit Flood Risk
2
EACH YEAR, SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS INCLUDING FLOODS, 
wildfires, windstorms, droughts, hail and destructive 
thunderstorms, pose a serious risk to cities across 
Canada. These events are growing in frequency and 
intensity, causing an impact in terms of insurance 
claims, economic losses, mental/psycho-social stress, 
and in some cases, fatalities. Although each city 
faces a unique combination of climate change related 
challenges, flooding has become the most widespread 
and costly natural disaster across Canada (IBC 2019).

In Canada, flood management is the responsibility of 
the provinces and territories, however, this responsibility 
is often legislatively delegated to municipal goverments. 
Therefore, flood management activities including 
mapping, planning, preparation, response and recovery are 
typically executed at the local rather than at the provincial, 
territorial, or federal level. As such – and as a complement 
to the report Climate Change and the Preparedness 
of Canadian Provinces and Territories to Limit 
Flood Risks (Feltmate et al. 2020), that addressed the 
preparedness of provincial and territorial governments to 
address flood risk – this report instead focuses on how the 
municipal governments of 16 major Canadian cities self-
assess their efforts to reduce the severity of flood impacts 
on their jurisdictions and citizens.
The flood preparedness of fourteen cities spread across the 
ten Canadian provinces was evaluated relative to criteria 
1-7 presented in Table 1, while two cities located within 
two territories, namely, Yellowknife in the Northwest 
Territories and Iqaluit in Nunavut, were evaluated relative 
to 5 factors (viz., these two cities determined that Flood Risk 
Assessment and Residential Property Risk Mitigation were not 
applicable to their communities). Each of the criteria was 
self-assessed by the jurisdictions using a five-point scale, 
ranging from ‘A’ for a high state of flood preparedness, 
‘E’ for a low state of preparedness, and with the good, 
significant, and incipient states of preparedness denoted as 
‘B’, ‘C’ and ‘D’, respectively (see Appendix A for a detailed 
description of the scoring protocol). Response scores 
were determined and recorded during interviews 
with designated representatives of municipal 
governments (e.g., City Managers, Directors, 
Senior Planners, etc.) and in some cases with the 
representatives of public utilities and conservation 
authorities, who had appropriate expertise relative 
to the specific criterion under consideration. 
In total, 53 interviews were conducted with such 
representatives starting in November 2018.
TABLE 1:	
Criteria utilized to assess the flood preparedness of selected Canadian cities
No.
Criteria
Description
1
Flood Risk Assessment
Flood risk assessments define the probability that floods occur in a given area and the 
consequences of flooding for people, properties, and infrastructure. 
2
Land Use Planning
Land use planning manages development activities to minimize the risk of flooding to 
life, property, and infrastructure.
3
Urban Drainage Assessment
Urban drainage assessments evaluate the risk-based performance in terms of the 
reliability, resiliency, and vulnerability of an urban drainage system.
4
Residential Property Risk 
Mitigation
Residential flood mitigation measures include the assessment of existing risk factors and 
the implementation of flood risk protection actions.
5
Critical Infrastructure Risk 
Mitigation
Critical Infrastructure (CI) flood risk mitigation measures include the identification of 
vulnerabilities of existing CI to flooding and the implementation of actions to enhance 
their flood resilience.
6
Public Health and Safety
Public Health and Safety assessments focus on the flood risks affecting healthcare 
facilities, chemical facilities and dams.
7
Emergency Management
Emergency management assessments focus on flood risks affecting emergency response 
and recovery operations including contingency planning for businesses and infrastructure 
owners/operators.
8
Chief Resilience Officer
A Chief Resilience Officer is a top-level advisor responsible for establishing and 
activating a city’s risk resilience strategy.
An additional 8th level of evaluation focused on the 
presence (or absence) of a Chief Resilience Officer 
(or equivalent), as a top-level advisor overseeing 
city resiliency.
On the basis of the above criteria, the average score of 16 
major Canadian cities on flood preparedness for 2019/20 
was C+, with the highest score being B+, and the lowest 
score being D (see Figure 1).

FIGURE 2.	 Flood Preparedness Scores of 15 Major Canadian Cities, 2015.
Average flood preparedness scores were calculated for 
cities within the western and central provinces (British 
Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, 
and Quebec) as distinct from the cities located within the 
Atlantic provinces (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince 
Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador) (see 
Figure 3). As the government of Whitehorse, located 
within the Yukon Territory, declined to participate, the 
average flood preparedness score for the territorial capital 
cities was not calculated. Therefore, Northern Canada 
is represented by two cities, namely, Yellowknife in the 
Northwest Territories and Iqaluit in Nunavut.
The three groupings (Western and Central, Atlantic, 
and Northern regions) were in part based on (1) direction 
from the city governments of the Atlantic provinces, 
that stated that their flood risk factors are unique due 
to their proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as (2) 
the territorial cities declaring that their climate risks are 
influenced by a unique set of climate change related factors 
relative to the rest of Canada.

Note: As Whitehorse, Yukon, declined to participate 
in this study, an average score for the cities located in 
Northern Canada was not calculated. The scores for 
Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, and Iqaluit, Nunavut, 
are presented in Figure 3.3.1.
While the Canadian average score on flood preparedness 
has not changed since 2015 – and remains C+ in 
2019/20 – all surveyed cities recognized the need to 
prepare for pending climate change and associated 
extreme weather events.
Notably, Vancouver, Surrey, Fredericton and Halifax 
conducted risk assessments to identify areas that are most 
at risk from riverine and/or coastal flooding, and where 
applicable took into account climate change and sea level 
rise. Despite the fact that nearly all cities demonstrated 
strengths in flood risk assessment related to riverine 
and/or coastal flooding, only half of the cities reviewed 
– namely Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, Ottawa, 
Montréal, Québec City, Halifax, and St. John’s – reported 
assessing risk of pluvial (e.g., sewer back-up) flooding.
In addition, nearly all surveyed municipal governments 
reported a similar level of strength with respect to 
their Urban Drainage Assessment efforts, including 
the amendment of engineering standards to meet 
performance expectations under increasingly challenging 
climatic conditions as well as initiatives focused at 
rebuilding and upgrading stormwater infrastructure.
Representatives of municipal governments reported 
that they utilize many instruments to govern land 
use planning, including bylaws, codes, policies, plans, 
standards and guidelines. However, as noted by many 
survey respondents, Canadian cities are under the 
obligation to comply with provincial or territorial 
land use regulations, and therefore, it is necessary for 
municipalities to request the Provincial legislature to pass 
applicable amending legislation before the municipality 
can enact any meaningful changes within their own 
jurisdictional governing tools (Van Der Brink 2016). In 
Canada, as the provinces/territories exercise exclusive 
control over their cities and municipalities, the powers 
that each municipality possesses depends almost entirely 
on the powers the province/territory deems necessary to 
grant. Therefore, only a few of the studied cities, namely 
Ottawa, Iqaluit, Fredericton, and St. John’s, stated that 
new development is actually prohibited within their 
respective floodplains, or within the 20-year flood zone 
in the case of Montréal and Québec City. Significantly, 
even those cities that did report having designated 
floodplains, noted that their designation was based on 
floodplain standards established provincially and that were 
delegated down to cities and municipalities. For example, 
Ottawa reported that its Official Plan and Zoning By-law 
prohibits development within the one-hundred-year flood 
plain. Therefore, even when the results of conducted risk 
assessments identified areas that are at risk of flooding 
that are outside of presently regulated floodplains, cities 
have no legal power to update their formal floodplain 
regulations and thereby enforce adherence to updated, 
risk-based standards.
Municipal governments reported moderate strength 
in emergency management relative to flood risk, and 
more specifically in maintaining the continuity of fuel 
supply and emergency communications. However, only 
a few cities, specifically Surrey, Ottawa, Fredericton and 
Halifax, demonstrated strength in the operation and 
maintenance of alert/warning systems, and indicated that 
they are currently in the process of updating their existing 
emergency alert/warning systems to include the provision 
of services for people with special needs based on social 
vulnerability studies.
In regard to municipally owned Critical Infrastructure 
(CI) Risk Mitigation, the survey results indicated strength 
across cities only in the domains of Critical Electrical-
Powered Infrastructure and Water Infrastructure 
and Services. Conversely, the survey results revealed 
a prevalent limitation in the ability of municipalities 
to mitigate the flood vulnerability of existing Critical 
Telecommunication-Reliant Systems, Food Systems 
and Financial Services. This pattern of weakness 
coincides with what was demonstrated by the provinces 
and territories in the 2019 study Climate Change and the 
Preparedness of  Canadian Provinces and Territories to Limit 
Flood Risks (Feltmate et al. 2020), particularly regarding 
assessment of infrastructure interdependencies.
“	All surveyed cities recognized 
the need to prepare for pending 
climate change and associated 
extreme weather events”
Climate Change and the Preparedness of 16 Major Canadian Cities to Limit Flood Risk
14
The primary vulnerability consistently 
demonstrated by the studied cities was risk 
exposure of residential properties to flooding. 
Of the 16 studied cities, only Edmonton reported 
significant strength in this important domain 
of flood preparedness. While most cities indicated 
that they provide information to their residents to allow 
them to determine whether their property is located 
in a riverine and/or coastal flood-prone area, only 
Edmonton stated that it provides free home flood 
assessments for any homeowner through its 
municipally owned utility, EPCOR.
Although most cities perceived the risk of pluvial flooding 
(which may include storm and sanitary sewer back-
up flooding) as significant, only Edmonton indicated 
the highest level of preparedness relative to this factor. 
Regina, Halifax, Charlottetown and St. John’s reported 
that they provide information to residents to allow them to 
determine whether their property may be at risk of pluvial 
flooding, but stated that they do not subsidize home flood 
assessments. The remaining cities reported that they are 
only in the process of considering different approaches 
to inform residents on pluvial flood prevention and 
recommended maintenance activities.
Basement flood mitigation is another key aspect of 
reducing the risk exposure of  residential properties. 
Installation of  backwater valves can reduce the risk of 
sewer back-up water flowing into a house during extreme 
precipitation events for properties that are connected to 
combined sanitary and storm sewer systems.
Table 2 below presents a summary of  municipal 
responses to the following question: “For newly 
constructed homes, does your city mandate the installation of  
backwater valves?”

Table 3 below presents a summary of municipal 
responses to the following question: “For existing homes, 
does your city offer a financial subsidy for the installation of  
backwater valves?”
Yellowknife stated that the use of back flow preventers 
is highly problematic in the North and their use has 
historically caused issues when they have failed or when 
they were incorrectly installed. In short, the extreme 
temperatures that are endemic to this part of Canada 
severely impact the effectiveness of this equipment. 
Simultaneously, the city noted that as it does not have 
combined sewer systems, thus the risk of stormwater 
infiltration into the wastewater system is relatively low.
Iqaluit stated that almost all houses in Nunavut, 
including within Iqaluit, are constructed on steel pile 
systems that are drilled into the permafrost or bedrock 
layer, with water and sewer services provided by either 
shallowly buried insulated piping, or by means of  tanker 
truck. Although the city stated that it recognizes the 
sensitivity of  its sewer pipes to permafrost thawing, 
it nevertheless does not enforce the installation of 
backwater valves.
Another key challenge for resilience efforts 
of Canadian cities is the trend of rapid growth. As 
urbanization progresses across Canada, it is important for 
city governments to consistently improve their ability to 
deal with stresses, including flooding.
In 2013, The Rockefeller Foundation (New York, USA) 
launched the 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) program that 
offered a $100 million USD prize that was split between 
100 cities around the world that agreed to establish a 
Chief Resilience Officer (CRO) position. Vancouver, 
Calgary, Toronto and Montréal each established this 
position within their respective city governments, to lead 
each city’s resilience efforts, funded by the aforementioned 
program which ended in 2019.

Over half of major Canadian cities employ an individual 
or a group of individuals charged with ensuring the safety 
of their respective communities and their risk adaptability, 
even if there is no formal Chief Resilience Officer 
designation.
For a more formal assessment of oversight regarding 
resilience, Table 4 (below) presents responses of 
participating cities to the following question: “Does your city 
have a full-time “Chief  Resilience Officer” (or equivalent)?”
On average, the state of flood preparedness of Canada’s 
major 16 cities was not materially better or worse over the 
time frame 2015 to 2019/20. However, individual cities 
(notably Edmonton, Regina, Fredericton, and Halifax) 
did show strong improvement and overall preparedness 
to address flooding over this four year time frame – as such, 
other Canadian cities may wish to consider some of the 
actions of these cities as described in the body of this report.
The rate at which Canadian cities address flood risk 
must improve, considering the wide range of  stressors 
to which they are exposed – including the evolving 
risk of  climate change, loss of  natural infrastructure, 
population growth, and aging municipal and housing 
infrastructure, amongst others. The good news for 
Canada is that flood risk mitigation guidelines 
and standards are well established and thus, with 
appropriate resolve to deploy flood risk mitigation 
practices, a score of  “A” is within reach for most – if  not 
all – Canadian cities.

Background
The purpose of this report is to quantify the state of 
flood preparedness of 16 major Canadian cities, and 
in so doing provide guidance that may alleviate current 
and future flood risk. As of 2019, according to Statistics 
Canada, 88% of all Canadians live in municipalities with 
populations of 5,000 or greater, while slightly over half 
of Canadians (55%) live in cities with a population of 
100,000+. As such, the importance of flood preparedness 
to the economic, social and environmental well-being of 
Canadian cities, and Canada, cannot be overstated.
Although the risks to which individual cities are exposed 
are diverse in nature, flooding remains one of the costliest 
perils for communities across Canada, thus rendering it 
the subject of this report. Subjected to increasing demand 
for infill development, city governments face increasing 
pressures to grant development permits within flood-prone 
areas. This trend, along with changes in the frequency 
and intensity of extreme flood events, is increasing the risk 
of significant disruptions to economic activity, physical 
damage to residential and commercial properties, and 
losses of critical infrastructure and essential services, while 
also posing a threat to the health and well-being of city 
populations (Moudrak and Feltmate 2019).
According to the National Working Group on Financial 
Risk of Flooding, flooding accounts for roughly three 
quarters of federal Disaster Financial Assistance (DFAA) 
payments, “with residential losses accounting for 5-15% 
of that total while a greater portion by far, perhaps 
as much as 70%, is spent on the recovery of public 
infrastructure.” Notably, DFAA payments cover only a 
portion of the costs incurred due to natural disasters. 
An overview of the escalating costs of extreme events is 
illustrated in Figure 4, which profiles insurable losses 
for Canadian catastrophic (CAT) events between 1983 
and 2020. There is a discernable upward trend in losses 
covering the period, with a material proportion of 
growing costs attributable to flooding. The upward trend 
in claims is not solely attributable to extreme weather – for 
example, loss of natural infrastructure, aging municipal 
infrastructure, and housing construction practices that 
did not incorporate flood resiliency also contributed to 
escalating claims (Moudrak and Feltmate 2019).

“	Disruption of a single infrastructure 
during flooding can produce ripple 
effects of disruption in interdependent 
infrastructures, resulting in significant 
and adverse economic, social, 
and environmental impacts within 
a community”
Cities across Canada are exposed to different types of 
floods, including coastal, fluvial, pluvial, surface water 
floods, glacial lake outburst floods and floods caused by 
dam failure. The complex interrelated processes that 
cause and influence floods can lead to compounding 
flood risks, thereby resulting in increased flood damages. 
Moreover, populations of modern cities are becoming 
highly dependent on the resiliency of an increasingly 
complex and highly interconnected system that is 
composed of critical infrastructures (CIs) including 
water, information and telecommunications, energy, 
transportation, banking and finance, and emergency 
services. Disruption of a single infrastructure during 
flooding can produce ripple effects of disruption in 
interdependent infrastructures, resulting in significant 
and adverse economic, social, and environmental impacts 
within a community – for example, power outages can 
trigger failures of communication systems. Accordingly, 
the report examines flood vulnerability from a systems 
failure/interdependencies perspective. The stress of 
system failures related to flood risk is manifesting in an 
increasing number of flood-related lawsuits involving 
homeowners, developers, municipal governments, 
conservation authorities, Indigenous people, provinces, 
and private businesses (Moudrak and Feltmate 2019).
Each city examined in this report should take solace in 
areas where flood preparedness is well developed, while 
simultaneously striving to remedy areas of weakness 
relative to flood preparedness.
With this purpose in mind, the structure of this report is 
as follows:
•	 Chapter 2 defines the scope of the study;
•	 Chapter 3 presents the findings for each criterion and 
its components across the municipal governments;
•	 Chapter 4 profiles recommendations and next steps 
that may be taken to limit future flood risk in Canada; 
and
•	 Appendix A provides a copy of the study 
questionnaire.

CHAPTER 2
PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The areas of focus of the study 
reflected the core themes of the 
United Nations Sendai Framework 
for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), 
to which Canada is a signatory. DRR 
is a systematic, whole-of-society 
approach to identifying, assessing, 
and analyzing the causal effects of 
disasters and reducing the resultant 
risks and impacts on the basis of risk 
assessments.

Most emergencies in Canada are managed by 
municipalities and communities, or at the provincial or 
territorial level (PSC 2019). This study was administered 
over an eight-month period (starting in November 
2018), with the intention to gain insight into the efforts 
of municipal governments to minimize the negative 
consequences of current and future floods, and to reduce 
climate-related risks in the Northern region of Canada. 
During this period, a series of phone interviews were 
conducted with representatives from municipal 
governments, conservation authorities, and public 
utilities who were responsible for the management of 
flood and climate-related risks, as well as with emergency 
management personnel.
The areas of focus of the study reflected the core themes 
of the United Nations Sendai Framework for Disaster 
Risk Reduction (DRR), to which Canada is a signatory. 
DRR is a systematic, whole-of-society approach to 
identifying, assessing, and analyzing the causal effects of 
disasters and reducing the resultant risks and impacts on 
the basis of risk assessments. The framework highlights 
the need for an integrated, all-hazard, and multi-sectoral 
approach to disaster risk management (PSC 2017) relative 
to four key pillars:
1)	 Understanding disaster risk;
2)	 Strengthening disaster risk governance to manage 
disaster risk;
3)	 Investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience; and
4)	 Enhancing disaster preparedness for effective 
response and to “Build Back Better” through recovery, 
rehabilitation, and reconstruction (Canada 2017).
The criteria utilized within this study were not exclusively 
derived from the DRR, but also drew from the 
Canadian Emergency Management Framework (PSC 
2017), which outlines the roles and responsibilities of 
Canadian governments.
2.1
Study Design and Methodology
The flood preparedness criteria utilized in the current 
study were informed, in part, by a 2015 study of the 
preparedness of 15 Canadian cities to limit flood damage 
(Feltmate and Moudrak 2015). Some of the criteria and 
their components were redesigned for the present study, 
to reflect the evolution toward proactive prevention and 
mitigation efforts in emergency management practices, 
and to incorporate the efforts of municipal governments 
to adapt to climate change.
The criteria designed to assess the flood-related 
commitments of municipal governments are presented 
in Table 5. Some criteria consisted of a single dimension 
(e.g., Land Use Planning) whereas other factors consisted 
of sub-components (e.g., Flood Risk Assessment).

N/A
Note. N/A (Not Applicable) indicates that the specific criterion is standalone and therefore does not have any components.
Data/information regarding the criteria identified in 
Table 5 was collected in a similar manner as in a prior 
flood preparedness study (Feltmate and Moudrak 2016). 
Specifically, the data was primarily collected utilizing 
telephone interviews with key government officials. Prior to 
the initiation of each phone interview, all study participants 
were informed that their personal judgements or opinions 
were not sought in regard to the adequacy of the flood 
preparedness efforts of their respective jurisdictions. 
Instead, the stated goal of the phone interviews was to 
collect information on the specific measures, practices, 
and policies that were in place within each jurisdiction. 
Responses were only considered final/accurate 
after written confirmation by study participants.

2.2
Study Questionnaires
Study questions for the municipal governments were 
formulated relative to the criteria specified in Table 5. 
Moreover, to enable complementarity between the present 
study and the provincial and territorial flood assessments 
conducted in 2019 (Feltmate et al. 2020), the questions 
and response options were consistent in design.
Several preliminary interviews were conducted with 
municipal officials to ensure interview questions were clear 
and unambiguous.
Similar to the prior study conducted in 2015 (Feltmate 
and Moudrak 2015), the present survey was designed 
using questions that were primarily quantitative in 
nature. However, the study also incorporated qualitative 
techniques to enable a detailed understanding of the 
state of municipal flood preparedness. The municipal 
questionnaire consisted of a total of 24 questions. 
These questions were split into sections on the basis 
of the various flood preparedness criteria to which 
they corresponded.
All 24 survey questions that were presented to city officials 
are included in Appendix A. A sample survey question is 
provided in Section 2.4 Data Analysis.
2.3
Sample Population
Participants in this study represented the municipal 
governments of 16 major Canadian cities, which included 
the capital cities of all provinces and two territories (the 
city of Whitehorse, Yukon, declined to participate) as well 
as 4 additional major cities which demonstrated high risks 
of flooding, whether coastal, riverine or pluvial.
Researchers established a database of 
117 municipal contacts, all of whom held 
responsibilities related to climate change and 
flood risk adaptation efforts, including emergency 
management representatives. Initial invitations 
were sent to city managers, chief resilience officers, chief 
planners and/or other senior city staff.
Following conveyance of initial invitations, city officials 
appointed representatives to collect information from 
within their departments. Appointed officials included city 
managers, as well as the heads of departments of planning, 
community development, public works, transportation, 
engineering, emergency management, and public health. 
In addition, several interviews were conducted with 
representatives of conservation authorities and public 
utilities who were responsible for the management of 
municipal water, wastewater and stormwater systems.
Interviews were conducted with 53 jurisdictionally 
designated representatives (see Table 6 for a 
breakdown of the number of interviewees per city).

Data Analysis
To enable comparability between the municipal flood 
preparedness scores that were obtained in the present 
study vs. the aforementioned study conducted in 2015, 
identical methods were applied to data collection and 
analysis in both studies.
The survey utilized closed-form questions, each of which 
had five response options ranging from optimal (‘A’) to the 
low (‘E’), with the good, significant and incipient options 
in between, respectively. During interviews, respondents 
were asked to self-report which option out of the five 
response options best captured the level of preparedness 
of their respective jurisdiction. For example, in order to 
gauge the level of involvement of municipal governments 
in the development and regular update of riverine and 
coastal flood risk assessments, participants were asked to 
select the most appropriate option (or combination of 
options) in response to the following question:
How does the city develop and update riverine and/or coastal flood 
risk assessments? (Select between the following options):
•	 A - The city has recently (within the past 5 years) conducted a 
flood risk assessment identifying areas at risk of  riverine and/
or coastal flooding (considering impacts of  climate change on 
identified flood hazards). On the basis of  this assessment, the 
city updates flood risk maps and flood mitigation strategies and 
implements mitigation projects as needed.
“	Several preliminary 
interviews were 
conducted 
with municipal 
officials to ensure 
interview questions 
were clear and 
unambiguous.”

•	 B - The city has recently (within the past 5 years) conducted a 
flood risk assessment identifying areas at risk of  riverine and/
or coastal flooding (considering impacts of  climate change on 
identified flood hazards). On the basis of  this assessment, the city 
updates flood risk maps and flood mitigation strategies for flood-
prone areas and is currently developing mitigation plans.
•	 C - The city has recently (within the past 5 years) conducted a 
flood risk assessment identifying areas at risk of  riverine and/
or coastal flooding (considering impacts of  climate change on 
identified flood hazards). The city has updated flood risk maps 
and is in the process of  developing flood mitigation strategies.
•	 D - The city has recently (within the past 5 years) conducted a 
flood risk assessment identifying areas at risk of  riverine and/
or coastal flooding (considering impacts of  climate change on 
identified flood hazards). The city is currently in the process of  
updating flood risk maps.
•	 E - The city is currently in the process of  conducting a flood risk 
assessment of  riverine and/or coastal flooding.
For data analysis, the selected response options were 
codified through the assignment of a numerical value 
for each respective option: A=5, B=4, C=3, D=2, and 
E=1. In some instances, respondents chose to utilize the 
non-applicable option instead of any of the above letter 
grades. In such cases, no numeric value was assigned 
to such responses. Data analyses were then performed 
by calculating means/averages for each participating 
jurisdiction. Criteria means were calculated by summing 
the response options selected for each component 
divided by the number of component questions within 
the criterion.
Criteria means were subsequently transcribed by 
converting numeric values to letter grades. However, no 
data transformation was performed and consequently the 
resultant values represent the jurisdiction’s own judgments 
in reference to their respective levels of preparedness. 
Finally, average scores were calculated for cities located 
in Atlantic Canada, in Western and Central Canada, 
and for Canada as a whole, by summing the individual 
preparedness values and dividing by the number of 
jurisdictions in each respective geographical category. 
No average score was calculated for the cities located in 
Northern Canada as Whitehorse declined to participate 
and therefore only two cities were assessed.
The commentary provided by study participants was also 
analyzed with a qualitative lens. Qualitative data analyses 
were performed primarily to validate the collected 
data and to ensure the accuracy of the quantitative 
data scoring.
The study incorporated several open-ended questions, 
to allow for additional input on flood mitigation efforts 
– exercised by municipal governments, conservation 
authorities and public utilities – that might be overlooked 
based on quantitative analyses alone. Data that was 
obtained using qualitative data collection methods was 
neither coded nor scored and was consequently included 
in text format in Chapter 3.

CHAPTER 3
MUNICIPAL FINDINGS
This chapter provides an overview of 
the major findings pertaining to the 
state of preparedness of Canadian 
cities relative to flood and climate-
related risks.
Climate Change and the Preparedness of 16 Major Canadian Cities to Limit Flood Risk
30
To effectively present the performance of municipal 
governments, the report made use of the following three 
jurisdiction groupings:
The Cities of Western and Central Canada, 
encompassing 10 major cities, located in the Provinces 
of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, 
Ontario and Quebec;
The Cities of Atlantic Canada, encompassing the 
capital cities of the Provinces of Newfoundland and 
Labrador, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and 
Nova Scotia; and
The Cities of Northern Canada, encompassing the 
city of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, and Iqaluit, 
Nunavut (Whitehorse, Yukon, declined to participate).
The following uniting factors explain each geographic 
grouping of cities.
The cities of Western and Central Canada have an 
important similarity in that nearly all have high population 
densities, ranging from 5,492 people per square kilometre in 
Vancouver to 1,173 people per square kilometre in Québec 
City. Only Ottawa has a significantly lower population 
density with only 335 people per square kilometre.
It is projected that future population increases will 
continue to be concentrated largely in the major urban 
areas of Canada. This will lead to a continued rise in 
built-up areas and dwelling densities, while also causing a 
decrease in the size of metropolitan area ecosystems. The 
continual transformation of the natural environment into 
the built environment in highly populated cities negatively 
impacts hydrological and ecological systems and thereby 
exacerbates the pre-existing flood vulnerability of 
these areas.
Similarly, the cities of Atlantic Canada share unique 
geographical specifics which make all of them susceptible 
to the impacts of climate change ((Natural Resources 
Canada 2015). It is expected that due to rising sea level 
and the increasing frequency of storm events, storm surge 
events may become more frequent and more extreme 
in Atlantic Canada. Taken as a whole, the contributing 
factors of sea level rise, storm surge and King Tides will 
increase the risks of flooding, erosion and other related 
negative impacts, thereby stressing Atlantic communities, 
infrastructure and ecosystems.
The most noteworthy uniting factor for the cities of Northern 
Canada is that climate change is already significant 
and manifests itself through the reduction of sea ice, 
degradation of permafrost, changing precipitation levels, 
and increasing frequency of ice-jam floods.
Based on the above factors that highlight natural 
groupings of cities, the major findings of the study are 
presented in the following three subsections:
Subsection 3.1 profiles the findings for the cities of 
Western and Central Canada;
Subsection 3.2 profiles the findings for the cities of 
Atlantic Canada; and
Subsection 3.3 profiles the findings for the cities of 
Northern Canada.
3.1
Selected Cities within the 
Provinces of Western and 
Central Canada
Population increases across Western and Central Canada 
are projected to occur primarily within existing major 
urban centres, with Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, 
and Alberta already being the most populous provinces 
in Canada, ordered by their respective population size 
(Statistics Canada 2019). Population growth will lead to 
an increase in built-up areas and dwelling densities, while 
simultaneously causing metropolitan area ecosystems to 
decrease in size. In addition, the population growth in the 
major cities increases the number of persons that could 
be potentially affected by floods. Notably, urban flooding 
is one of the costliest types of flooding in Canada, with 
damages including both insured and uninsured property 
damage, damage to public infrastructure, as well as 
productivity and business losses.
This section presents an overview of the responses provided 
by the municipal officials of the cities of Vancouver and 
Surrey (British Columbia), Calgary and Edmonton (Alberta), 
Regina (Saskatchewan), Winnipeg (Manitoba), Toronto and 
Ottawa (Ontario), and Montréal and Québec City (Quebec).
Cities were selected for inclusion in the study based on 
their population and/or jurisdictional, economic or 
legislative importance.

of Vancouver.
Climate Change and the Preparedness of 16 Major Canadian Cities to Limit Flood Risk
32
As shown in Figure 3.1.1, Vancouver demonstrated 
strength in flood preparedness, specifically in terms of 
Flood Risk Assessment, Urban Drainage Assessment and 
Emergency Management.
Regarding Flood Risk Assessment, Vancouver reported 
that it had conducted its first flood risk assessment in 
2013-2014, which included the impacts of climate change. 
The city also remarked that this assessment had a major 
impact on the city’s subsequent policy and emergency 
planning efforts. The assessment was last updated in 2016 
and included both social and economic factors.
Relative to Urban Drainage Assessment, the City stated 
that it uses future projections in terms of rain projections 
and Intensity, Duration and Frequency (IDF) curves, in 
anticipation of future redevelopment of its shoreline 
areas. Moreover, Vancouver stated that it is planning 
to reconfigure its stormwater drainage infrastructure 
to ensure that this infrastructure does not have a 
confounding effect on existing shoreline infrastructure.
In terms of Vancouver’s Emergency Management, the 
city reported that it has conducted risk assessments, 
and on the basis of their results found that there is no 
critical emergency response infrastructure within city 
flood zones. Vancouver stated that it has no major 
transportation routes within its flood risk areas. Moreover, 
the city operates its own gas stations and owns fuel tanks 
which thereby allows the city to continue operating 
generators at critical facilities across Vancouver during 
emergency events.
Vancouver is involved in the Public Safety Broadband 
Network (PSBN) initiative and stated that it is currently 
discussing emergency management prioritization on 
the Bell telephone network. Presently, the city’s first 
responders have access to a dedicated resilient public 
safety radio network which is run by E-Comm 911. The 
city also has a formalized relationship with VECTOR, 
which is an emergency communications amateur radio 
society that was created as a joint initiative between the 
City and Vancouver Police. Additionally, the city performs 
joint emergency response exercises with VECTOR and 
provides them with space and tools within the city’s 
Emergency Operations Centre.
The city has conducted flood modelling city-wide to 
understand the potential impacts of flooding across 
Vancouver for both coastal and riverine flooding. 
The city’s current plans include the dissemination of 
information through the use of regular and social media. 
Additionally, the city has some planning in place regarding 
some of its homeless populations which are of significant 
size in areas of Vancouver, such as in East Hastings. Also, 
the city is engaged in expanding its alerting capability and 
reported that it will be leveraging the new AlertReady 
system once the Province includes the ability for local 
governments to issue alerts, which is something that is 
expected to be available in 2020/2021. The city’s police 
and fire departments are also able to deliver additional 
notifications through the use of their field units.
Conversely, Vancouver’s performance was found to be 
beneath the regional average in terms of its initiatives in 
the areas of Land Use Planning, Critical Infrastructure 
(CI) Risk Mitigation, and Public Health and Safety.
In regard to Land Use Planning, the city stated that it 
presently allows both redevelopment and development 
on floodplains, although it does require higher flood 
construction levels for developments within these areas. 
More concerning, Vancouver reported that British 
Columbia is currently constructing a hospital in 
the city’s floodplain.
To mitigate risk to its CI, Vancouver stated that it is in 
the early stages of understanding CI interdependencies 
and has redundancies in place for some of its electrical 
system components, but not for its wastewater systems. 
The city’s efforts in relation to mitigating the flood risk of 
its telecommunications systems is limited to preliminary 
discussions. Vancouver has also not yet secured funding to 
assess the flood risk of its transportation systems.
With regard to Public Health and Safety initiatives, 
Vancouver reported that although it does engage with 
the owners and operators of healthcare facilities, it 
only collaborates with them and has no capability to 
require them to conduct any specific efforts. In terms of 
preventing the release of harmful chemicals, the owners 
of most potential releasing sites are federally controlled 
and are therefore outside of the city’s jurisdiction – 
accordingly, the city is unable to mandate safety reviews. 
The city also reported that a great deal of hazardous 
materials come through the Port of Vancouver, noting 
that it is not able to regulate this site and how flood risk 
and hazardous waste might convey compounding and 
pervasive risk.

AVERAGE OF ALL WESTERN AND CENTRAL CITIES
Figure 3.1.2. Flood Preparedness for Surrey. The benchmark score, calculated as the average of the results of all major 
cities of Western and Central provinces (viz. Vancouver, Surrey, Calgary, Edmonton, Regina, Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa, 
Montréal, and Québec City) is depicted with a dashed line. The green area depicts the preparedness score of Surrey.
Surrey was amongst the first cities in Canada to adopt a 
Climate Adaptation Strategy that included an initiative 
to increase the community’s resilience to future flood 
risks, including the risks of coastal and riverine flooding. 
Accordingly, the City developed floodplain maps 
for future conditions, incorporating climate change 
projections and land-use changes for 2040, 2070, 2100 
and 2200 time horizons. When compared to other 
Canadian municipalities, Surrey is at the forefront of 
implementing a multifaceted climate adaptation plan 
that includes both structural and non-structural flood 
mitigation measures.
As Figure 3.1.2 demonstrates, Surrey reported strengths 
in several domains of its flood preparedness, specifically 
in terms of Land Use Planning, Urban Drainage 
Assessment, Public Health and Safety and Emergency 
Management.
With regard to its Land Use Planning policies, the city 
stated that no new residential developments are permitted 
within the city’s flood-prone areas. Developers are 
responsible for building to the flood construction level per 
the Floodplain Management Bylaw requirement, and only 
city council has the power to override this requirement.
Another notable achievement is that Surrey’s forward-
thinking land-use regulation policy has ensured that 
floodplain areas largely contain agricultural lands rather 
than high density developments. The city has invested 
considerable effort to bring low-lying coastal areas 
and river floodplains, which are primarily agricultural 
lowlands, to acceptable flood protection standards.
Regarding Urban Drainage Assessment, the city noted 
that it is implementing a $25 million comprehensive 
Stormwater Management Strategy for Crescent Beach 
to help prepare the community for the increased risk of 
coastal floods.
With respect to Public Health and Safety, Surrey reported 
that the responsibility for healthcare facilities lies with 
the Fraser Health Authority and moreover that most 
healthcare facilities are located outside of floodplain areas. 
The city also stated that it has a hazardous materials 
team and that Surrey has an all-hazards response and 
Climate Change and the Preparedness of 16 Major Canadian Cities to Limit Flood Risk

evacuation plan that is focused on preventing the release 
of hazardous materials. In terms of dam safety, the city 
reported that it monitors dams, reviewing and updating 
action items annually.
In regard to its Emergency Management efforts, the city 
stated that it has developed new LIDAR mapping and 
is consequently aware of the availability of emergency 
routes within its territory and also stated that there is only 
a small flood-impacted area within the city.
Pertaining to the continuity of fuel supply, Surrey noted 
that it has established relationships with fuel contractors 
and that it conducts annual reviews and business 
continuity exercises with them. The city also has a biofuel 
facility that provides Surrey with renewable natural gas as 
an alternative fuel for many of its vehicles.
Surrey reported that it is heavily involved in the 
development of the Public Safety Broadband Network 
(PSBN) and had co-written a letter that urged further 
development of this project. The city also conducts 
monthly testing of its emergency communications networks 
and participates in workshops to develop the PSBN.
Finally, the city has conducted a vulnerability assessment 
throughout its food section. It noted that its Agriculture 
Enhancement and Protection Strategy manages some 
of the risks of extreme weather by ensuring reliable 
connections and relationships between agriculture and 
urban residents.
Conversely, Surrey’s performance was found to be 
beneath the regional average for initiatives in relation 
to Flood Risk Assessment, Residential Property Risk 
Mitigation, and Critical Infrastructure Risk Mitigation.
In reference to Flood Risk Assessment, Surrey reported 
that it develops so-called “unofficial maps.” These maps 
are not verified by the province of British Columbia as 
the city does not apply to the province to have these maps 
formalized. Surrey stated that this is because it “does not 
recognize the benefit of doing this.” Surrey also reported 
that its city council has not enclosed the creeks within the 
residential parts of its territory which give rise to flooding.
Regarding Residential Property Risk Mitigation, Surrey 
reported it has areas within the city where there are 
large quantities of flood-vulnerable historical residential 
developments. In addition to this, Surrey remarked 
that some of the floodplains within the city remain less 
protected than others, and moreover that some parts 
of the City are sinking. Surrey does not mandate the 
installation of backflow prevention valves for new homes 
and lacks a subsidy program for existing homes.
Finally, in regard to Surrey’s Critical Infrastructure, the 
city stated that its traffic signals can be vulnerable to 
power loss and that it also has limited ability to mitigate 
this issue as the lighting and power supply systems are 
owned by an independent hydro utility. The city went on 
to state that there are key railways from the United States 
as well as numerous infrastructure corridors of regional, 
provincial and national significance that go through the 
floodplain adjacent to the city. For example, BC Hydro’s 
main transmission line goes through the floodplain 
adjacent to the city en route to the United States, and as 
Surrey confirmed, this infrastructure is not flood-proofed. 
Although Surrey has repeatedly asked to adjust the line’s 
route, the city reported that the Utility has repeatedly 
strongly opposed this request.
“	Surrey does not mandate the 
installation of backflow prevention 
valves for new homes and lacks a 
subsidy program for existing homes.”

Figure 3.1.3. Flood Preparedness for Calgary. The benchmark score, calculated as the average of the results of all major 
cities of Western and Central provinces (viz. Vancouver, Surrey, Calgary, Edmonton, Regina, Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa, 
Montréal, and Québec City) is depicted with a dashed line. The green area depicts the preparedness score of Calgary.
As shown in Figure 3.1.3, Calgary reported areas of 
strength in terms of its flood preparedness, primarily in 
the domains of Urban Drainage Assessment, Critical 
Infrastructure Risk Mitigation, Public Health and Safety, 
and Emergency Management.
Regarding Urban Drainage Assessment initiatives, 
Calgary operates a Community Drainage Improvement 
Program to assess and provide flood-related infrastructure 
upgrades to older neighborhoods that require them.
In reference to Critical Infrastructure (CI), Calgary 
reported that it cooperates with electrical utility providers 
in ensuring that electrical infrastructure is waterproof.
In addition, Calgary reported that it has assessed 
infrastructure interdependencies.
In terms of telecommunications systems, most pieces 
of CI of this type have back-up systems in place with 
multiple redundancies. Calgary’s critical response 
infrastructure is thoroughly protected which allows 
the city’s emergency response operations to continue 
to operate even during internet and electrical outages. 
Additionally, Calgary has redundant communications 
systems in place, which were used in 2013 when the city 
lost power causing a telecommunications outage.
In relation to Calgary’s food systems, the city reported 
that it had completed a macro-level all-risk assessment in 
addition to flood-specific risk assessments for all critical 
food infrastructure that is located within the city’s flood 
hazard area.
Calgary regulates the elevations of key transportation 
infrastructure that passes through flood zones. The city 
builds resilience into such infrastructure as well, for 
instance by installing flood-proof doors for subterranean 
subway stations.
In regard to Calgary’s Public Health and Safety 
initiatives, the city reported that it prevents the 
construction of new healthcare facilities in zones at 
risk of flooding, although some existing institutions are 
located in borderline areas and therefore have evacuation 
plans in place. Moreover, the design standards for new 
buildings must meet stringent guidelines that are above 
the 1:500-year flood event mark.
Climate Change and the Preparedness of 16 Major Canadian Cities to Limit Flood Risk
36
The city has a dedicated program that aims to prevent 
hazardous chemical releases, with procedures to identify, 
characterize and abate associated risks. Regarding 
dam safety, Calgary reported that dams in Alberta are 
regulated provincially with a discrete and extensive set of 
requirements.
In reference to Emergency Management policies, Calgary 
stated that it has developed a detailed flood emergency 
manual which is updated annually, and which specifies 
the actions and operations that are to be undertaken 
during flood events of varying extremes. The city is also 
conducting work to protect its river flood risk zones, and 
has secured funds and established planning for most of its 
critical areas.
Conversely, the City of Calgary’s efforts were below the 
regional average with respect to several domains of flood 
preparedness. Specifically, these gaps were found in the 
City’s Land Use Planning and Residential Property Risk 
Mitigation policies.
In terms of Land Use Planning, Calgary stated that it 
does not prohibit development on floodplains, allowing 
development to proceed in the flood fringe, provided that 
such developments are flood-proofed.
In regard to Residential Property Risk Mitigation, the city 
stated that there are no home flood assessments conducted 
on a property-specific level, although there is a flood 
preparedness program that includes self-assessments and 
educational programs. The City also identified basement 
damages as a significant risk and is assessing approaches 
to refine regulations for development of below grade 
space, beyond current requirements for sump pumps and 
sewer backflow preventers in flood prone areas. Calgary 
also reported that the development of a property-level 
mitigation and flood risk awareness program is underway 
as part of an overall flood resilience strategy, but the City 
is currently placing primary importance on the installation 
of structural components.

Ottawa, Montréal, and Québec City) is depicted with a dashed line. The green area depicts the preparedness score 
of Edmonton.
Climate Change and the Preparedness of 16 Major Canadian Cities to Limit Flood Risk
37
As indicated in Figure 3.1.4, Edmonton demonstrated 
strength in terms of all domains of its flood preparedness, 
thereby earning it one of the highest scores of any city 
in Canada.
Relative to Flood Risk Assessment initiatives, Edmonton 
reported that it had assessed flood risks with a project 
that was conducted by EPCOR (Edmonton Power 
Corporation). The city also completed a full safety 
assessment from the standpoint of public safety and the 
risk of drowning. Edmonton’s risk framework considers 
health, safety and the environment, as well as financial 
and social/service impacts.
In reference to Land Use Planning policies, the city has 
enacted zoning bylaws which designated parts of its 
territory as floodplains. Edmonton is updating its zoning 
bylaws which may lead to new or altered restrictions 
in regard to development within the city’s designated 
floodplain zones.
In regard to Urban Drainage Assessments, Edmonton has 
completed a stormwater infrastructure assessment as part 
of its recent city-wide risk assessment. The results of this 
assessment subsequently led to the City prioritizing certain 
city areas for future mitigative actions.
In terms of Residential Property Risk Mitigation, 
Edmonton stated that it had assessed property risk 
mitigation efforts recently and that since 1998, the city’s 
bylaws have required all new homes to install backwater 
valves. Moreover, EPCOR has a backwater valve subsidy 
program to financially assist the city’s residents on 
installing this type of equipment.
Regarding the City’s risk mitigation efforts for its 
Critical Infrastructure (CI), Edmonton reported that 
it has received grant funding toward mitigating its 
electrical infrastructure. The city’s water treatment plants 
have received funding for mitigating their electrical 
equipment and to harden their infrastructure and move 
equipment where necessary. The City conducted a 
supplementary pluvial flooding assessment for 
all of its electrical substations. Edmonton is actively 
engaged with the owners and operators of its power 
and water treatment plants to continue the process of 
hardening CI throughout the city.
In regard to Public Health and Safety initiatives, 
Edmonton reported that the ownership of healthcare 
facilities had been recently transferred to the Province 
of Alberta. However, EPCOR has developed a plan 
called the Source Water Protection Plan which included 
the evaluation of risks to the water supply of the city. 
Edmonton also reported that it closely cooperates with the 
oil and gas sectors, reviewing plans on an annual basis and 
conducting various joint exercises. The city also reported 
that there are no dams located immediately within 
the city.
Finally, with respect to its Emergency Management 
initiatives, Edmonton reported that it has developed maps 
which indicate riverine risk in terms of the continuity 
of access to parks, hospitals, emergency shelters and fire 
stations. Currently, the city is outfitting its emergency 
response stations with additional flood protection 
infrastructure. The City also has fuel continuity plans and 
mutual aid agreements in place.
“	The City conducted a 
supplementary pluvial 
flooding assessment for all 
of its electrical substations.”

cities of Western and Central provinces (viz. Vancouver, Surrey, Calgary, Edmonton, Regina, Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa, 
Montréal, and Québec City) is depicted with a dashed line. The green area depicts the preparedness score of Regina.
As shown in Figure 3.1.5, Regina demonstrated strength 
in multiple domains of flood preparedness, specifically 
in terms of Urban Drainage Assessment, Critical 
Infrastructure Risk Mitigation, Public Health and Safety, 
and Emergency Management.
In reference to Flood Risk Assessment, Regina reported 
that it has developed flood risk maps and that it is 
currently completing a full upgrade of its Drainage 
System Model. This upgrade will include 2D modelling to 
identify overland flows and underground pipes city-wide. 
The City has also upgraded its drainage systems to enable 
them to handle more extreme events.
In regard to Urban Drainage Assessments, Regina 
reported that it has invested substantially into upgrading 
its drainage and stormwater systems, performing between 
one to two projects annually in this regard. Also, the city 
has created new detention ponds, has moved some of its 
drainage infrastructure, and has installed new culverts.
In terms of city-owned Critical Infrastructure, the 
city reported that it has performed vulnerability 
assessments of its water infrastructure and has focused 
on increasing the resiliency of electrical supply to its 
water treatment plants. Moreover, the city stated that all 
key telecommunications infrastructure within Regina is 
located well away from any flood zones. The city also has 
agreements in place with amateur radio operators for 
assistance during major disasters.
The city has agreements in place with the Canadian 
Red Cross and is therefore able to provide emergency 
shelter for its citizens when necessary. The city 
also has agreements with contractors to assist with 
the supply of food. Finally, Regina has an all-
encompassing, non-flooding-specific plan in place for its 
transportation system.
In regard to Public Health and Safety initiatives, Regina 
reported that it regularly improves its healthcare facilities 
to make them more flood resilient. The city has also 
conducted two joint full-scale exercises with oil companies 
that focused on dealing with potential releases of toxics 
into water bodies.
Climate Change and the Preparedness of 16 Major Canadian Cities to Limit Flood Risk
39
Regarding Emergency Management, Regina stated 
that it has developed a flood response plan which 
is updated annually. The city also has its own radio 
system and works with the Provincial Public Safety 
Telecommunications Network operated by the province 
of Saskatchewan. Moreover, Regina utilizes a municipal 
mass notification system and distributes information 
through the city’s website as well as through other social 
media platforms.
Regina’s efforts were below the regional average relative 
to Land Use Planning and Flood Risk Assessment.
In reference to Regina’s Land Use Planning policies, 
the city reported that mechanisms exist through 
which developers can apply to create developments 
on floodplains. Such developments may require flood-
proofing measures, but development on floodplains is 
not explicitly prohibited in Regina, in contrast to what is 
mandated in some other Canadian jurisdictions.
In relation to the risk mitigation of its residential 
properties, Regina reported that it has no comprehensive 
subsidy program for the installation of backflow 
prevention valves, except for within a small area of the 
city which was identified as being at high risk of flooding.

Montréal, and Québec City) is depicted with a dashed line. The green area depicts the preparedness score of Winnipeg.
As indicated in Figure 3.1.6, Winnipeg demonstrated 
strength in some domains of flood preparedness, 
particularly in reference to Land Use Planning. More 
specifically, Winnipeg stated that although it reviews 
relevant Land Use Planning plans regularly, there are 
no city-specific land-use related bylaws, with regulations 
instead stemming directly from the province of Manitoba. 
If a building is found to be within the flood fringe, 
Winnipeg either builds dykes or extends primary dykes 
to isolate the area within which the structure is located. 
In brief, the city stated that it restricts new development 
through legislation enacted provincially.
Climate Change and the Preparedness of 16 Major Canadian Cities to Limit Flood Risk
40
Regarding Flood Risk Assessments, Winnipeg reported 
that riverine flood risk mapping is conducted by the 
Province of Manitoba rather than by the city, and 
indicated N/A options for most components of the Flood 
Risk Assessment criterion.
Alternatively, Winnipeg’s performance was found to be 
below the regional average regarding Urban Drainage 
Assessment, Residential Property Risk Mitigation, Critical 
Infrastructure (CI) Risk Mitigation, Public Health and 
Safety, and Emergency Management Initiatives.
For Urban Drainage Assessments, Winnipeg reported 
that it has limited capacity to address issues identified for 
existing developments within the city. Moreover, Winnipeg 
reported that it has not conducted any assessments on its 
stormwater infrastructure within the last five years.
The city also stated that it currently has no active program 
for the installation of backflow prevention valves for 
existing homes, although such a program did exist in 
the past.
Regarding the risk mitigation of its CI, Winnipeg reported 
that it has not conducted any specific work on its food 
systems to address their potential vulnerability to flooding. 
The city also reported that although some work has been 
performed in terms of assessing its financial sector, this 
work has not been specific to flood risk.
In terms of Public Health and Safety, Winnipeg stated 
that it generally lacks policies regarding the release of 
hazardous chemicals as well as in relation to dam safety.
Relative to Emergency Management efforts, Winnipeg 
reported that it has not factored the impacts of climate 
change into its discussions in regard to risk assessments. 
Moreover, Winnipeg’s emergency fuel supply plans were 
not developed to deal with the risk of flooding.
Finally, Winnipeg stated that it maintains a public safety 
radio network for emergency responders with mitigative 
measures for hazard situations, including anticipated 
flood impacts. In addition, the city partners with an 
amateur radio operator society to provide emergency 
communications if required.

41
As shown in Figure 3.1.7, Toronto demonstrated strength 
in some domains of flood preparedness, specifically 
Flood Risk Assessment, Critical Infrastructure (CI) Risk 
Mitigation, and Public Health and Safety.
Regarding Flood Risk Assessment, Toronto reported that 
it updated its G. Ross Lord Dam Emergency Preparedness 
Plan, which analyzed the state of a dam that could 
impact the city substantially if it were to fail. Toronto also 
conducts social vulnerability assessments which consider 
the economic and social impacts of flooding.
In terms of risk mitigation of CI, Toronto reported that 
it assessed the potential of flooding for its critical water 
facilities. The city has also installed dual power feeds to 
its most critical electrical-powered infrastructure, with 
standby generators. Toronto is upgrading its water plants 
to reduce their exposure to flood risk.
Toronto also reported that it had conducted a high-level 
vulnerability assessment of its food systems relative to 
the impacts of climate change. As part of this process, 
Toronto analyzed three types of extreme weather events, 
specifically: significant rain and flooding events, extended 
heatwaves, and major winter ice storms. Toronto is 
working with stakeholders to disseminate the results of 
its vulnerability assessments and is developing a food 
resilience coordination plan.
Relative to its transportation network, Toronto is 
developing plans, and prioritizing actions, to ensure the 
integrity of it transport system in anticipation of major 
flood events.
In regard to Toronto’s Public Health and Safety initiatives, 
Toronto reported that it has developed a thorough plan 
through Toronto Water to deal with hazardous chemical 
releases. The city responds to such releases by setting 
up booms and other interception devices to attempt to 
remove harmful substances from watercourses. For the 
cases when owners cannot be immediately identified, 
Toronto stated that it responds itself. In some instances, 
the public-at-large may also be notified. In addition 
to this, Toronto has a Source Protection Plan that was 
developed to mitigate potential threats to the city’s 
drinking water intakes. Toronto also has established 
emergency preparedness plans for its dams.
Conversely, the performance of the city was found to be 
lower than the regional average in terms of its initiatives 
in relation to Residential Property Risk Mitigation and 
Emergency Management.
In regard to the mitigation of risk to residential 
properties, Toronto reported that it has no clear legislative 
requirements in relation to riverine flooding, and that 
this responsibility is delegated to the Toronto and Region 
Conservation Authority (TRCA).
Finally, in relation to Emergency Management, Toronto 
stated that it was not certain whether the development of 
Emergency Routes for the City had been completed. The 
City also stated that its efforts in terms of developing flood 
warning systems are presently limited.
“	The performance of the city was found 
to be lower than the regional average 
in terms of its initiatives in relation to 
Residential Property Risk Mitigation 
and Emergency Management.”

major cities of Western and Central provinces (viz. Vancouver, Surrey, Calgary, Edmonton, Regina, Winnipeg, Toronto, 
Ottawa, Montréal, and Québec City) is depicted with a dashed line. The green area depicts the preparedness score 
of Ottawa.
As shown in Figure 3.1.8, Ottawa demonstrated strength 
in some domains of its flood preparedness, specifically in 
terms of Land Use Planning, Critical Infrastructure Risk 
Mitigation, and Emergency Management.
In regard to Land Use Planning, Ottawa reported that 
its policies conform with Ontario’s Provincial Policy 
Statement (PPS), and are more comprehensive than those 
required by the PPS. Specifically, the city’s zoning bylaw 
prohibits all development within the floodplain, except 
for minor forms of development such as small additions 
(subject to size limitations). Ottawa also has a separate set 
of policies and zoning provisions for areas at reduced risk, 
while prohibiting lot creation in both types of areas.
In reference to Critical Infrastructure, the city has 
conducted some work on mitigating flood risk relative to 
electrical infrastructure. Ottawa also reported that it has 
established plans to ensure redundancy for the generating 
capacities of some telecommunications facilities. The city 
has also reviewed some vulnerabilities for its food systems, 
and has assessed parts of its road network.
Regarding Emergency Management initiatives, Ottawa 
reported that none of its emergency response resources 
are at significant risk of flooding. The city mentioned 
that it has a just-in-time fuel supply system and is 
discussing the deployment of the Public Safety Broadband 
Network (PSBN ) within the city. Ottawa also stated that 
it cooperates with local amateur radio providers and 
operates a P25 public safety radio system that includes all 
first responders and city agencies. Finally, the city’s flood 
warning system is based on the AlertReady system.
Conversely, the performance of the city was found to be 
lower than the regional average in relation to the domains 
of Flood Risk Assessment, Urban Drainage Assessment, 
and Public Health and Safety.
Regarding Flood Risk Assessment, Ottawa reported that 
the remediation portion of its flood risk initiatives is not in 
place, as the entire area of the city had not yet been fully 
assessed, ranked and prioritized – however, these efforts 
are in progress. The city’s assessments do not include the 
economic impacts of flooding.
Climate Change and the Preparedness of 16 Major Canadian Cities to Limit Flood Risk
43
Relative to Urban Drainage Assessment, the city reported 
that not all areas are analyzed to the same extent.
In regard to Public Health and Safety initiatives, Ottawa 
stated while the risk assessments that the City carries 
out do encompass its healthcare facilities, funding and 
planning are under the jurisdiction of the Province, 
although the city does collaborate with the province on 
planning initiatives.
Finally, Ottawa reported that it is not confident about the 
exact extent of the dam failure mapping for city-adjacent 
dams, as this mapping is performed by the operators of 
the dams rather than by the City itself.

Figure 3.1.9. Flood Preparedness for Montréal. The benchmark score, calculated as the average of the results of all 
major cities of Western and Central provinces (viz. Vancouver, Surrey, Calgary, Edmonton, Regina, Winnipeg, Toronto, 
Ottawa, Montréal, and Québec City) is depicted with a dashed line. The green area depicts the preparedness score of 
Montréal.
As shown in Figure 3.1.9, Montréal demonstrates 
strength in some domains of its flood preparedness, 
specifically in terms of Flood Risk Assessment, Land Use 
Planning, and Urban Drainage Assessment.
In reference to Flood Risk Assessments, the city reported 
that it uses aerial and ground surveys for risk assessments 
and has validated information collected during the 2017 
Montréal floods. Moreover, the risks of flooding are 
incorporated in its planning initiatives and the city is 
currently reviewing and analyzing its drainage, sewer and 
land use plans. Montréal also stated that there are very 
few floodplain areas within its territory and therefore the 
City has no flood protection infrastructure.
Regarding Land Use Planning, the city’s policies fall 
under a provincial regulation Protection Policy for 
Lakeshores, Riverbanks, Littoral Zones and Floodplains 
(PPLRI). This policy was incorporated into city bylaws, 
and includes a minimal regulatory framework that all 
municipalities within Quebec must apply. As directed by 
this policy, existing buildings can be maintained in the 
0 to 20-year flood zone, however they cannot be rebuilt 
following a flood disaster. In addition, new construction 
would be prohibited in the flood zone. Non-protected 
construction is prohibited within the 20-to-100-year 
flood zone.
Climate Change and the Preparedness of 16 Major Canadian Cities to Limit Flood Risk
44
Relative to Urban Drainage Assessment, Montréal 
reported that it is currently conducting work on its 
stormwater infrastructure from the perspective of 
improving and adapting to the effects of climate change. 
All new designs for stormwater infrastructure within 
Montréal are based on new rainfall conditions that 
consider the impacts of climate change.
Montréal’s efforts were found to be below the regional 
average with respect to several domains of flood 
preparedness. Specifically, these weaknesses were found 
relative to Residential Property Risk Mitigation, Critical 
Infrastructure Risk Mitigation, Public Health and Safety, 
and Emergency Management.
In terms of Residential Property Risk Mitigation, 
Montréal provides information on a case-by-case basis to 
residents who apply for building permits, but otherwise is 
not involved in riverine flood mitigation initiatives. The 
city also lacks a subsidy program for the installation of 
backflow prevention valves for existing homes.
In regard to gaps in the city’s risk mitigation initiatives 
relative to its CI, Montréal stated that it has not 
conducted any risk assessments on its electrical and food 
systems. Also, the city has no risk assessment, action 
plan, nor discussion regarding vulnerability of the city’s 
financial sector – interventions with respect to this sector 
are made on an ad-hoc basis.
Regarding its Public Health and Safety initiatives, 
Montréal stated that it lacks a comprehensive plan in 
reference to the potential releases of hazardous chemicals. 
Similarly, the city stated that it does not have the power to 
mandate the owners or operators of dams to conduct risk 
monitoring activities.
Finally, Montréal reported that in terms of its Emergency 
Management policies, the integration between the 
forecasting and flood warning systems operated by 
Quebec and those operated by the city are ongoing. This 
integration is a necessary and important initiative as the 
St. Lawrence River watershed that could affect the city 
is material.

As shown in Figure 3.1.10, Québec City demonstrates 
strength in some domains of its flood preparedness, 
specifically with respect to Flood Risk Assessment, Land 
Use Planning, Urban Drainage Assessment, and Critical 
Infrastructure (CI) Risk Mitigation.
Relative to Flood Risk Assessment, Québec City stated 
that it has conducted risk mitigation projects, such as the 
reconstruction of bridges and the construction of water 
retention structures for the Lorette River.
Regarding Land Use Planning, the city stated that, 
similar to Montréal, it is obligated to incorporate the 
provincial Protection Policy for Lakeshores, Riverbanks, 
Littoral Zones and Floodplains (PPRLPI) into its land use 
planning bylaws. However, Québec City reported that 
certain exceptions to this policy are possible, although they 
are difficult to obtain and require several authorizations.
Relative to Urban Drainage Assessment, the city 
mandates the application of Future Climate IDF curves 
for all civil engineering projects (since 2007 onward).
In reference to the city’s Critical Infrastructure, Québec 
City stated that all of its existing essential electrical 
infrastructure has been equipped with redundancy systems 
such as back-up generators and that all such infrastructure 
is elevated above the flood level. Furthermore, a risk 
assessment of this infrastructure is ongoing. The city 
also has a Civil Security Plan (CSP) which includes 
redundancy measures for its telecommunication systems. 
On the other hand, Québec City indicated that its 
financial institutions are treated in the same manner as all 
other buildings during disaster events.
Finally, with respect to the city’s transportation network, 
Québec City stated that its CSP includes a Road Network 
Management activity, which addresses the transportation 
of people and goods.
Conversely, the city’s efforts were found to be below the 
regional average in terms of Residential Property Risk 
Mitigation, Public Health and Safety, and Emergency 
Management.
For instance, Québec City indicated that it has no grant 
programs to support home protection assessments.
In terms of Public Health and Safety, the city stated that 
it does not have any significant policies in relation to the 
potential releases of hazardous chemicals.
Finally, in regard to Emergency Management initiatives, 
Québec City has incorporated renewable energy aspects 
for some, but not all, of its administrative units with 
respect to the continuity of fuel supply. The city stated that 
it has not adapted its flood warning system to address the 
heightened need and concerns of vulnerable populations.

Selected Cities within the Provinces of Atlantic Canada
The cities of Atlantic Canada share unique geographical 
specifics which makes them all susceptible to the impacts 
of climate change. It is predicted that the region will 
experience more frequent storm events, increasing 
intensity of storms, rising sea levels, storm surges, coastal 
erosion and more frequent flooding due to climate change 
(Lemmon et al. 2016).
This section provides an overview of the responses 
provided by the municipal officials of the cities of 
Fredericton (New Brunswick), Halifax (Nova Scotia), 
Charlottetown (Prince Edward Island) and St. John’s 
(Newfoundland and Labrador).
The cities which are located within these provinces were 
selected for the study on the basis of their population 
and/or jurisdictional, economic and/or legislative 
importance.

AVERAGE OF ALL ATLANTIC CITIES
Figure 3.2.1. Flood Preparedness for Fredericton. The benchmark score, calculated as the average of the results of all 
capital cities of the Atlantic provinces (viz. Charlottetown, Fredericton, Halifax and St. John’s) is depicted with a red 
dashed line. The blue area depicts the preparedness score of Fredericton.
As demonstrated in Figure 3.2.1, Fredericton has areas 
of strength in flood preparedness, particularly in the 
domains of Flood Risk Assessment, Land Use Planning, 
Urban Drainage Assessment and Critical Infrastructure 
Risk Mitigation.
Fredericton was built on the banks of the Saint John 
River, which effectively splits the city through its 
downtown area. In reference to Flood Risk Assessment, 
Fredericton reported that although the Saint John River 
watershed is being studied by the province of New 
Brunswick, the city also conducts independent flood 
assessments. The city is working on pluvial flood risk 
assessments and has identified a number of infrastructure 
issues. The city follows a management system based on 
identifying problems, resolving them, and then moving 
back to the identification step. Utilizing this process, the 
city has elevated some key roadways and is continuing to 
identify areas where there could be long-term impacts of 
continual flooding.
The city created Environmental Open Space zoning 
to protect low lying or flood prone areas from being 
developed. In response to Urban Drainage Assessment, 
the city stated that it added an additional 20% to its 1-in-
100-year flood preparedness standard for culverts and 
bridge replacements. There is also a minor storm sewer 
system that the city is constructing to a 10-year standard.
In regard to Critical Infrastructure Risk Mitigation, the 
city reported that it addresses the risks of its electrical, 
telecommunications, food, financial and transportation 
systems. Fredericton is working on protecting its electrical 
infrastructure through an infrastructure renewal project 
which includes upgrading city roads and lift stations. 
Additionally, the city has completed assessments of what 
specific pieces of telecommunication infrastructure would 
be impacted by flooding. Fredericton has also installed 
SCADA systems that provide monitoring data for its water 
systems, and allow the city to manually update traffic 
signals during telecommunications disruptions.
Fredericton has installed back-up power for its food 
storage facilities, and has a partnership in place with 
the Salvation Army which had constructed a shelter to 
provide temporary food and hospitality services during 
Climate Change and the Preparedness of 16 Major Canadian Cities to Limit Flood Risk
48
emergencies. The city also noted that there are no 
financial institutions within its immediate floodzone.
In terms of Fredericton’s transportation network, the city 
has identified areas that are vulnerable to flood risk – in 
response, as these areas are upgraded during the normal 
course of refurbishment, an elevated level of resilience 
will be met.
Fredericton was below the regional average regarding 
Residential Property Risk Mitigation. The city reported 
that it has no property-specific program in place to convey 
flood-proofing information to home owners. Also, the city 
does not mandate the installation of backwater valves for 
residential housing.

Figure 3.2.2. Flood Preparedness for Halifax. The benchmark score, calculated as the average of the results of all 
capital cities of the Atlantic provinces (viz. Charlottetown, Fredericton, Halifax and St. John’s) is depicted with a red 
dashed line. The blue area depicts the preparedness score of Halifax.
As demonstrated in Figure 3.2.2, Halifax reported areas 
of strength regarding flood preparedness, particularly in 
the domains of Flood Risk Assessment, Urban Drainage 
Assessment, Residential Property Risk Mitigation, Public 
Health and Safety and Emergency Management.
Regarding Flood Risk Assessment initiatives, Halifax 
reported that it regularly conducts hydrological 
assessments of its developed areas, and based on findings, 
reviews and amends zoning plans as appropriate. The city 
has identified ten priority areas as being at risk from 
riverine, coastal and other forms of flooding.
In reference to Urban Drainage Assessment, Halifax 
reported that it is amending its engineering standards 
to account for the impacts of climate change – this 
information factors into asset and infrastructure 
management plans that are updated every five years.
The city’s Residential Property Risk Mitigation initiatives 
are comprehensive in comparison to the regional average. 
Climate Change and the Preparedness of 16 Major Canadian Cities to Limit Flood Risk
49
Halifax provides advice to its residents on how they can 
best protect their homes against the adverse impacts of 
flooding. The city has planning designations in some 
areas that delineate flood-prone properties, and the city 
has introduced mandatory setbacks from watercourses. 
Finally, the city mandates flood protection for all fixtures 
located below street-level.
Regarding Public Health and Safety, Halifax collaborates 
with local hospitals and healthcare facilities. The city also 
stated that while it has no dams within its limits, a dam 
safety assessment was conducted on dams that are located 
well outside the city.
Relative to Emergency Management efforts, Halifax 
stated that it has installed a joint communications 
system and reported that the testing of the Public Safety 
Broadband Netwwork (PSBN) remains on-going. Halifax 
has conducted a social vulnerability assessment for its 
citizens and utilizes its AlertReady system in addition to 
the 3-1-1 system to distribute messaging to residents.
Conversely, the Critical Infrastructure Risk Mitigation 
initiatives of Halifax were weak in terms of its overall 
preparedness. Halifax has not yet conducted a complete 
flood risk assessment on all of its critical electrical 
infrastructure, and moreover, the city lacks a formalized 
approach to address this area of potential vulnerability. 
Similarly, the city conducts risk assessments of its 
telecommunications networks on an ad hoc basis.
Halifax reported that it has not focused on the flood 
vulnerability of its food supply systems. The city also 
stated that financial infrastructure is outside of the 
municipal mandate in Nova Scotia, and is therefore not 
considered by the city. Overall, Halifax noted that the 
authority and mandate of all municipalities within the 
Province of Nova Scotia is very limited.

50
As Figure 3.2.3 demonstrates, Charlottetown reported 
areas of strength with respect to its flood preparedness in 
the domain of Residential Property Risk Mitigation and 
Emergency Management.
Specifically, Charlottetown reported that it has emergency 
response plans in place to ensure the continuity of 
access during emergencies. The city has established 
agreements to ensure continuity of fuel supply during 
flood events. The city also reported that it is aware of 
the general capabilities of the local fuel supply industry. 
Charlottetown has direct agreements with Esso Fuels to 
supply the city during emergencies.
The city stated that it has ensured that emergency 
responders, including the RCMP, municipal police, fire 
department, provincial ambulances, and the provincial 
EMO, all have 2-way radio systems to allow for the 
continuity of communications during emergencies. 
The city operates its own mass notification and alert 
system that it uses to provide the public with emergency 
information. The city has also developed and deployed a 
digital radio network. Finally, Charlottetown mentioned 
that riverine flooding is not a significant concern. The city 
reported that it relies on weather service forecasts as well 
as sanitary pump alarms for forecasting flood emergencies.
Conversely, Charlottetown’s performance was found 
to be below the regional average with respect to 
certain domains of flood preparedness. Specifically, its 
performance was found to be lower than the regional 
average in terms of Flood Risk Assessment, Urban 
Drainage Assessment, Residential Property Risk 
Mitigation, Critical Infrastructure Risk Mitigation, and 
Public Health and Safety.
In reference to Flood Risk Assessments, Charlottetown 
stated that it does not formally assess pluvial flood risk, but 
does perform ad hoc evaluations. The city reported that it 
has not completed calculations on the potential economic 
and social impacts of flooding. Similarly, Charlottetown 
stated that it has never conducted a formal assessment in 
relation to its stormwater infrastructure, but rather relies 
on the “working knowledge” of its vulnerable areas.
Regarding Residential Property Risk Mitigation, 
Charlottetown stated that it provides neither educational 
materials nor subsidies to its residents. Moreover, city 
residents are required to install backflow prevention 
valves only if they have services below ground level. 
Charlottetown advises its citizens to use backflow 
prevention, but neither mandates this nor conducts 
inspections of whether its residents complete this action. 
The city also lacks a subsidy program for the installation 
of backflow prevention valves for existing homes.
In terms of Critical Infrastructure Risk Mitigation, 
Charlottetown reported that it has never conducted 
a risk assessment on its electrical infrastructure and is 
also not involved in assessing its food supply networks. 
Additionally, the city has not directed attention to its 
financial sector and is involved with mitigating the risk to 
its transportation networks only in an unofficial capacity.
Finally, in regard to Public Health and Safety 
initiatives, Charlottetown stated that it does not guide 
the development of emergency plans for private 
agencies in reference to the prevention of hazardous 
chemical releases.
“	The city reported 
that it relies on 
weather service 
forecasts as 
well as sanitary 
pump alarms for 
forecasting flood 
emergencies.”

AVERAGE OF ALL ATLANTIC CITIES
Figure 3.2.4. Flood Preparedness for St. John’s. The benchmark score, calculated as the average of the results of all 
capital cities of the Atlantic provinces (viz. Charlottetown, Fredericton, Halifax and St. John’s) is depicted with a red 
dashed line. The blue area depicts the preparedness score of St. John’s.
As demonstrated in Figure 3.2.4, St. John’s has strength 
regarding flood preparedness, primarily in the areas 
of Flood Risk Assessment, Land Use Planning and 
Residential Property Risk Mitigation.
Regarding Flood Risk Assessment, the city reported that 
the province has recently updated flood risk mapping, 
and all new developments are required to use the new 
floodplain mapping where applicable. In addition, the city 
independently conducts dam break analyses on nearby dam 
infrastructure, incorporating social and economic impacts of 
failures. The city reported that the Province of Newfoundland 
and Labrador completes other types of flood risk assessments 
province-wide and shares that data with the city.
In regard to Land Use Planning, St. John’s stated that it 
prohibits new developments within flood hazard and flood 
risk areas.
In reference to mitigating the risk to its Critical 
Infrastructure (CI) facilities, the city reported that it has 
conducted a comprehensive risk assessment on its electrical 
infrastructure as part of Emergency Business Continuity 
plans that were established for all electrical facilities.
In terms of Public Health and Safety, St. John’s provides 
advice to regional and provincial healthcare authorities 
in reference to flood risk, has mitigation policies in place 
to prevent the release of hazardous chemicals, and is 
generally well-prepared in regard to dam safety.
Conversely, St. John’s reported weaknesses with respect 
to food system and financial service risk mitigation and 
Emergency Management efforts.
For Residential Property Risk Mitigation, the city reported 
that it lacks a subsidy program for the installation of 
backflow prevention valves for existing homes.
Finally, in regard to the city’s Emergency Management 
efforts, St. John’s reported that its involvement in 
providing flood warning services for its residents is 
limited. However, the city has agreements in place 
with a group of amateur radio operators, specializing 
in emergency communications. These volunteers can 
provide direct radio communications links to evacuation 
centres and backup communications at the emergency 
operations centre and operational command centres 
as required.

Selected Cities within the Northern Canada
Northern Canada is comprised of three territories: 
Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Yukon. Climate 
change is one of the most serious environmental, 
economic and political issues affecting residents of 
Northern Canada.
This section provides an overview of the responses 
provided by the municipal officials of Yellowknife 
(Northwest Territories) and Iqaluit (Nunavut). Whitehorse 
(Yukon) declined to participate in the study.
This study investigated and compared Yellowknife and Iqaluit 
relative to their flood risk management initiatives and flood 
risk reduction capacities. These cities were selected based 
on their large population (relative to northern communities) 
and jurisdictional, economic and legislative importance.

Yellowknife, Northwest Territories D
One of Canada’s most contaminated industrial sites, 
Giant Mine, is located close to Yellowknife, about 5 
km from city centre. There are eight open pits located 
within the central valley where Baker Creek flows, two 
of which are in close proximity to Yellowknife Bay, on 
which Yellowknife is located. These open pits pose risks 
to the safety of the public as well as to the environment, 
given the possibility that Baker Creek may flood the 
area, affecting underground arsenic chambers. These 
chambers are filled with 237,000 tonnes of arsenic 
trioxide in a frozen state, while an additional 95-hectare 
surface site is polluted with 13.5 million tonnes of arsenic-
contaminated tailings.
The Giant Mine Remediation Project considers 
flood protection measures to mitigate the potential of 
inundation and uncontrolled flows to the underground 
mine during extreme weather events. The city stated that 
a Qualitative Risk Assessment (QRA) is being completed 
by the Giant Mine Remediation Team evaluating not 
only flood risk, but all scenarios that could result in a 
breach of the tailings ponds and/or underground arsenic 
containment areas. One of these scenarios includes 
flooding of the various mine components. As Yellowknife 
reported, if the mine’s storage chambers were ever to 
be flooded, thus causing a thawing of the frozen arsenic 
trioxide, this could lead to a release of the substance 
which would result in its infiltration into Yellowknife’s 
groundwater supply as well as lead to contamination 
of the water within Great Slave Lake which is the tenth 
largest lake in the world. This is a particularly important 
concern considering the fact that arsenic trioxide is 
a highly water-soluble substance and is also odorless, 
tasteless, and transparent. The City stated that the 
quantity of arsenic trioxide that is currently 
contained within the chambers of Giant Mine 
would be sufficient to eliminate the entire world’s 
population several times over.
As demonstrated in Figure 3.3.1, the City of Yellowknife 
possesses certain areas of strength in terms of its 
flood preparedness, primarily in the domain of 
Emergency Management.
Yellowknife reported that it has considered the 
community’s vulnerability to various hazards, particularly 
as they may be exacerbated by the impacts of climate 
change. Yellowknife deals with its Critical Infrastructure 
(CI) facilities, such as hospitals, as dictated by the 
circumstances of a given threat. Yellowknife has planned 
work with fuel and other suppliers and has established 
arrangements to ensure business continuity. The city 
also has its fuel supply while its local hospital has its own 
arrangements and sources. Yellowknife also services 
its own radio systems and therefore ensures a level of 
robustness in maintaining public communication during 
extreme events.
Yellowknife’s Emergency Management department is 
planning to collaborate with amateur radio volunteers 
to help with the provision of some emergency 
communications services. Cellular service communications 
providers are also part of the city’s emergency 
communications arrangements as is the territorial utility. 
Yellowknife confirmed that it has participated in national 
emergency public alerting exercises.
Yellowknife was not designated as a flood risk community 
under the defunct Flood Damage Reduction Program, 
and therefore does not consider itself to be flood prone 
in regard to riverine events. However, the city reported 
that it can be exposed to hazards caused by overland and 
spring flooding, as well as potential high-water levels in 
Great Slave Lake and other large bodies of water in its 
vicinity. The city also stated that periodically, significant 
changes in water levels do occur, a factor that can damage 
or disrupt the city’s infrastructure and its provision 
of services.
Conversely, Yellowknife’s performance was found to be 
limited in regard to Critical Infrastructure Risk Mitigation 
as well as Public Health and Safety initiatives.
For Public Health and Safety, the city reported that it is 
aware of some facilities within its territory that utilize 
hazardous chemicals such as chlorine. In regard to dam 
safety, Yellowknife stated that a failure at one of the 
hydroelectric facilities that are located close to the city 
could have a significant impact city-wide – the city is 
built close to the Yellowknife River which would receive 
increased flow volumes following a dam breach. The city 
reported that it has no regulatory authority over the local 
power utility.
Climate Change and the Preparedness of 16 Major Canadian Cities to Limit Flood Risk
54
In terms of its Critical Infrastructure, Yellowknife 
reported that it does not regulate power generation or 
distribution within its territory. Alternatively, the city has 
installed backup power for 12 out of its 14 lift stations.
In regard to the city’s telecommunications sector, Yellowknife 
is not involved in regulating the businesses that operate within 
it. The city expects business owners and operators to address 
their own vulnerabilities but has no specific regulatory 
role that mandates that this takes place. Yellowknife also 
reported that no flood mitigation work has been conducted 
on its community garden plots and that grocers are likewise 
responsible for their own safety provisions.
Although Yellowknife has no jurisdiction over local 
banking and financial institutions, there have been efforts 
to focus on emergency planning and business continuity 
of the local financial system.
With regard to the City’s transportation sector, Yellowknife 
is in the early stages of assessing its transportation 
vulnerabilities from the perspective of flood risk.
The city has considered the vulnerability of its water 
supply to flood risk, and as a consequence has submitted 
a request for a major capital project to replace the 
submarine water line which is currently the source of 
the city’s drinking water. Arsenic trioxide stored in above 
ground tailings ponds and underground storage chambers 
in the abandoned site at Giant Mine poses a significant 
threat for any municipal water source in Yellowknife, 
given the mine’s proximity to the city.
Iqaluit, Nunavut C+
As demonstrated in Figure 3.3.1, Iqaluit has significant areas 
of strength in terms of its flood preparedness, primarily in 
Urban Drainage Assessment and Land Use Planning.
With respect to Urban Drainage Assessments, Iqaluit 
reported that it has completed a master drainage plan 
spanning its territory.
In terms of Land Use Planning, Iqaluit stated that flood 
policies that apply throughout its area stem from the 
territorial government rather than from the city. Iqaluit 
reported that the federal government also plays a role in 
the development of these policies.
Conversely, Iqaluit’s performance was found to be limited 
in regard to Critical Infrastructure Risk Mitigation, Public 
Health and Safety and Emergency Management.
In terms of Critical Infrastructure Risk Mitigation, Iqaluit 
is installing a back-up generator to power City Hall, 
and emergency services to provide continuity of services 
during power outages. Iqaluit’s power generation and 
distribution systems have built-in redundancies and the 
city itself has back-up sources of power.
In regard to Iqaluit’s food supply sector, food retailers 
maintain warehouses for the storage of food, and the city 
also has a small greenhouse used to grow lettuce. Iqaluit 
collaborates closely with its food supply sector, particularly 
during emergencies. The city’s food suppliers have their own 
supply chains which are independent from one another, 
which implies that food can be delivered to Iqaluit from 
different locations rather than being reliant on a single route.
In terms of Iqaluit’s financial sector, the city has 
conducted some discussions in regard to business 
continuity planning. Iqaluit has also conducted risk 
assessments for flood disasters that could result in lengthy 
power outages, major storms and dam breaks. The city’s 
dam break risk assessments are updated every few years. 
In terms of the city’s transportation systems, by-pass 
options and detours exist for most of its roads. Iqaluit is 
working on a transportation master plan.
Regarding Public Health and Safety, Iqaluit reported 
that it participates in interagency group discussions 
applied to the emergency management of healthcare 
facilities. Additionally, regional hospitals have their own 
emergency management plans. The development and 
update of these plans is supported by funding from the 
territorial government, as the responsibility for hospitals 
lies with Nunavut. In relation to the prevention of the 
release of hazardous chemicals, the city has performed 
some mitigation work by utilizing retention ponds to store 
run-off. In regard to dam safety, Iqaluit conducts regular 
inspections and has detailed evacuation plans.
Finally, in terms of Emergency Management, the city 
reported that it does not yet have a formal flood alert 
system, and lacks the ability to distribute text messages to 
its citizens – Iqaluit is working to remedy this issue.

CHAPTER 4
EMERGING TRENDS AND 
CONCLUSIONS
The purpose of this study, and its 
2015 analogue, was to determine 
the state of flood preparedness of 
16 Major Canadian cities. 
Climate Change and the Preparedness of 16 Major Canadian Cities to Limit Flood Risk
56
The findings of this study indicate that there has been 
no significant progress in terms of the flood 
preparedness of Canadian cities over the period 
2015 to 2019/20 – the Canadian average score on 
flood preparedness has not changed and remains 
C+ as of 2019/20.
Areas of strength in terms of city flood preparedness 
include Flood Risk Assessment, Urban Drainage 
Assessment, Flood Risk Mitigation for Drinking and 
Wastewater Infrastructure, Public Health and Safety 
(specifically in the Dams Sector), and Emergency 
Management (specifically in the domains of Continuity 
of Fuel Supply and Continuity of Emergency 
Communications).
Areas of weakness in city flood preparedness initiatives 
include Flood Risk Mitigation for Residential Property 
(specifically in the domain of Pluvial Flooding), Critical 
Infrastructure Risk Mitigation (particularly in the Food 
and Financial Sectors), and Public Health and Safety 
(particularly in the Chemical Sector).
Although most Canadian cities have made progress in 
identifying areas vulnerable to flood risk, most indicated 
an inability to prohibit or restrict development in high risk 
areas, as this responsibility fell under provincial control. 
Even when municipal governments had developed their 
own floodplain maps – that incorporate climate change 
projections, sea level rise and land-use changes – they 
often lack the ability to restrict development within areas 
at risk of flooding, and could only offer advice on flood 
protection strategies.
Another limitation that characterized many cities 
pertained to the flood vulnerability of Critical 
Infrastructure (CI) and essential services. As was 
demonstrated in the 2019 study (Feltmate et al. 2020), 
nearly all provincial and territorial governments 
indicated that they are not involved in mitigating the risk 
exposure of electrical, telecommunications, and pipeline 
infrastructure. At the same time, cities indicated that they 
were largely powerless to halt infrastructure development 
in known areas of high flood risk. Importantly, many 
cities reported difficulties in discussing required protection 
measures with owners of CI, built on floodplains, located 
within or close to cities.
The broad findings of this study indicated that to limit the 
adverse effects of ongoing flood damage, Canadian cities 
need to make significant improvements in three areas of 
flood preparedness:
•	 Risk Mitigation for Residential Property
•	 Critical Infrastructure Risk Mitigation, and
•	 Public Health and Safety
Climate Change and the Preparedness of 16 Major Canadian Cities to Limit Flood Risk
57
Risk Mitigation for 
Residential Property
Of the 16 studied cities in this report, only Edmonton 
reported that its utility, EPCOR, provides information 
to residents to allow them to determine if their property 
is located in a flood-prone area – subsequently, upon 
request, home owners may request a complimentary 
home flood assessment. Most other cities indicated that 
they only provide high-level information for residents to 
allow them to learn whether their property is located in 
a riverine and/or coastal flood-prone area, and generally 
less information is available pertaining to urban or pluvial 
flood assessment.
Despite the fact that urban/pluvial flooding is becoming 
increasingly frequent – and its impact in terms of damage, 
disruption, and threat to life is escalating – most cities 
reported that they do little in terms of addressing this risk, 
with the exception of Edmonton. The cities of Regina, 
Halifax, Charlottetown and St. John’s reported that they 
provide information to residents to allow them to learn 
whether their property may be at risk of pluvial (urban) 
flooding, but stated that they do not subsidize home 
flood assessments.
Although many survey respondents indicated that while 
most cities offer educational programs to residents living 
in floodplains and in areas at high risk of flooding, 
during real estate transactions there is no legal 
requirement to disclose information that a 
given property had experienced, or is at risk of 
experiencing, flood damage. Real estate transactions 
are regulated by provincial governments, thus the specific 
rules governing such disclosures vary across Canada. 
While some Canadian provinces, including Manitoba, 
Quebec and New Brunswick do query property sellers on 
whether a given property had sustained prior damage due 
to flooding, only Ontario’s Seller Property Information 
Statement includes a specific question about the current 
flood exposure of the property. Notably, for all provinces, 
sellers are not legally obligated to provide property 
flood disclosure statements to buyers, even if requested 
(Henstra and Thistlethwaite 2018). In short, there is a 
gap in provincial policy, across Canada, which should 
be addressed to protect property buyers and reduce the 
financial and social costs of flooding.
Critical Infrastructure 
Risk Mitigation
Critical Infrastructure (CI) is the foundation upon which 
daily life of Canadians is built – accordingly, flood 
damage to energy systems, transportation networks, 
telecommunication systems, water supply and wastewater 
systems, as well as other lifeline infrastructure systems, has 
far-reaching societal impacts.
Most Canadian cities showed substantial flood resilience 
in reference to maintaining the integrity of Water 
Infrastructure and Services. Conversely, many cities 
are striving to limit flood risk of Electrically Powered 
Infrastructure and Transportation Infrastructure. More 
concerning, survey results indicated a prevalent limitation 
in city efforts to mitigate the flood vulnerability of existing 
Critical Telecommunication-reliant Systems, Food Systems 
and Financial Services. Notably, out of the 16 cities 
reviewed, only Edmonton, Regina and Toronto reported 
strength in addressing the vulnerability of city food supply 
systems to flooding. Toronto conducted a high-level 
vulnerability assessment of climate change impacts on its 
food system in 2018, which allowed the city to identify 
the most significant risks to food processing, distribution 
and access. The city also stated that it is working with 
community-based organizations to develop community food 
resilience action plans for its vulnerable neighborhoods.
The pattern of weakness in the domains of risk mitigation 
to CI coincides with the findings of a prior study (Feltmate 
and Moudrak 2020), the results of which indicated the 
presence of significant gaps throughout Canada in terms 
of addressing CI flood risks, including interdependencies.
Additionally, many cities reported that there are 
significant numbers of rail lines, highways and utility 
corridors of regional, provincial and national importance 
– as well as critical assets such as hospitals, electric power 
substations and communication facilities – that are located 
within floodplains inside city boundaries. While cities are 
making efforts to communicate flood risk information 
to CI owners, they reported a lack of a mutual desire to 
minimize the flood risk exposure of CI. Notably, while 
some cities reported their involvement in discussions with 
the owners and operators of CI on how to mitigate the 
vulnerability of CI to flooding, most responders indicated 
that measures to protect individual CI sectors, systems 
Climate Change and the Preparedness of 16 Major Canadian Cities to Limit Flood Risk
58
or assets would be the responsibility of the individual 
owners and operators of CI, and that they would assume 
no involvement.
Simultaneously, while cities stated that they recognize the 
importance of avoiding the placement of any additional 
CI within floodplains, the majority of responders indicated 
that municipalities are powerless to halt infrastructure 
development within risk areas. For instance, a healthcare 
facility is being built on a city floodplain, as decided by the 
province, and the city was powerless to stop it.
Public Health and Safety
Naturally, the Canadian health sector plays a significant 
role in the response and recovery efforts that take place 
during and following natural and manmade disasters. 
However, although most cities indicated that they provide 
advice to regional and provincial authorities regarding 
vulnerabilities of the healthcare sector to floods, they hold 
no formal authority over them.
Additionally, cities reported weak performance to address 
the vulnerability of their populations to hazardous 
chemical releases. Chemical spills from refineries, 
wastewater treatment plants and hospitals during floods 
can directly lead to the contamination of drinking water 
sources, wherein the prompt coordination of actions 
would be required to protect the health and safety of the 
public. Notably, out of the 16 studied cities, only Calgary, 
Edmonton, Regina and Toronto demonstrated significant 
strength in planning for, and managing, potential spills 
of hazardous materials. While all cities indicated that the 
responsibility for a spill/discharge of hazardous waste lies 
with the owner of the facility from which the discharge 
originates, only four aforementioned cities reported that 
they are engaged with owners of facilities to identify, 
characterize and abate associated risks.
Conclusions
With the average flood preparedness score for Canada’s 
major cities remaining C+ over the period 2015 to 
2019/20, it is evident that there is considerable margin 
for improvement in flood preparedness for most of the 
surveyed jurisdictions.
Recognizing that climate change is effectively irreversible 
(ECCC 2019), which in turn will exacerbate future 
extreme weather, Canadian cities must elevate their 
resolve to mitigate flood risk. On a positive note, 
Edmonton, Regina and Toronto scored well in terms of 
their efforts to limit the impacts of flooding, which could 
guide, and perhaps serve as a model for, other cities to 
emulate their efforts where appropriate.
A key factor that many cities identified to limit flood 
risk was the need for provinces/territories to incentivize 
municipal actions to reduce current exposure, and to limit 
risks linked to new development and re-development in 
low-lying coastal areas and on floodplains.
Cities indicated that they can only limit development 
within provincially-defined risk areas in accordance with 
the provincially-defined regulatory flood standard. Even 
where municipal governments developed floodplain maps 
which incorporated climate change projections, sea level 
rise, and land-use changes, they lack the ability to restrict 
development within identified risk areas, and can only 
offer advice regarding flood protection strategies.
Ironically, while the prime statutory responsibility of 
municipal policymakers is supposed to be to consider the 
well-being and interests of their community, one study 
participant noted that “in a cost-benefit analysis of flood 
risk, the only [parties] that win are the ones who put a lot 
of people in the floodplain.” This participant, along with 
“	A key factor that many cities identified to limit flood risk was the 
need for provinces/territories to incentivize municipal actions 
to reduce current exposure, and to limit risks linked to new 
development and re-development in low-lying coastal areas and 
on floodplains.”

several others, noted that municipalities are exposed to 
backward incentives in relation to the topic of floodplain 
mapping – municipalities are often incentivized to not 
create flood maps, as this thereby enables them to avoid 
financial and political accountability when flooding does 
occur. Instead of restricting the municipalities which 
fail to develop floodplain mapping from receiving funds 
following a flood, municipalities without flood maps 
often find it easier to apply for, and consequently receive, 
federal recovery funding. Therefore, it is currently the 
case that municipalities directly and immediately benefit 
from not developing floodplain maps and thus clearly 
have little to no incentive to develop and keep them up-
to-date. To redress this limitation, survey respondents 
recommended that up-to-date and comprehensive 
flood maps be made a requirement to receive 
federal recovery support following catastrophic 
flooding events.
Lack of appreciation for the interdependencies of critical 
infrastructure systems– where one failure may cascade 
to another, and another beyond that – was also an area 
highlighted as a point of concern by survey respondents. 
The potential for cascading impacts may prove more 
challenging in the future, as Canada is continuing to 
experience increasing urbanization that will convey higher 
concentrations of population and economic activity within 
cities. As such, a failure or degradation of essential services 
provided by critical infrastructure, that can often be located 
outside cities, could affect the health, safety, security, 
and economic well-being of communities. Some survey 
respondents suggested that future analysis to identify and 
protect against system level failures might be the purview 
of such organizations as the Big City Mayors’ Caucus 
and/or the Federation of Canadian Municipalities.
This study demonstrates that municipal governments must 
build upon generalized messaging on flood mitigation, 
to provide more detailed localized hazard information, 
as well as develop ‘flood literacy’ by fostering local 
knowledge about flooding. For example, there is both a 
need and a means by which home owners can protect 
their homes from flooding: that is by adopting home 
flood protection measures. The implementation of 
home flood protection is relatively inexpensive 
(generally less than a few hundred dollars per 
home), is technically straightforward, and is 
generally quick to deploy. As such, respondents 
suggested that concerted efforts to promote home 
flood protection offered a readily available option 
to mitigate flood risk for which there was only an 
upside.
Recognizing that the costs of flooding are on the rise for 
virtually all Canadian cities, some respondents suggested 
that citizens themselves demand action by mayors and 
councilors to be more pro-active in promoting flood risk 
mitigation. Survey participants suggested that “as much 
as it is the duty of Canadian governments to inform their 
citizens, it is equally the duty of every citizen to demand 
to be informed [on flood risk mitigation]”.
A recurring theme highlighted by the 53 city managers, 
directors, and senior officers interviewed for this report 
was the need for cities to move more aggressively 
to prepare for flood risk. As climate change and the 
associated risk of flooding increases, stasis on flood 
preparedness, as indicated by an unchanged 
average score of C+ over the time frame of 2015 
to 2019/20, is not acceptable. Canadian cities must 
therefore move much quicker to prepare for flood risk, by 
building on the momentum of such leaders as, but not 
limited to, Edmonton, Regina and Toronto. As suggested 
by survey participants, it is not possible to cheat on flood 
preparedness – to do so will result in management by 
disaster scenarios. Canadian cities must draw upon the 
momentum of leaders who not only understand the 
importance of flood preparedness, but also the need 
to act with urgency.
“	Stasis on flood preparedness, as indicated by an 
unchanged average score of C+ over the time frame of 
2015 to 2019/20, is not acceptable.”

A.1 Flood Risk Assessment
The extensiveness of the consequences of a flood depends 
on a variety of factors including how exposed a given 
community is to floods as well as how vulnerable its 
people, property, and infrastructure are to the adverse 
impacts of flooding.
Risk assessments identify the social, economic, and 
environmental impacts that flood events can have on a given 
community, including identifying the specific flood hazards, 
compounding hazards, community and infrastructure 
vulnerabilities, risk tolerance or “risk threshold,” in addition 
to the overall flood risk profile for said community.
For cities with increasing population densities which 
commonly experience significant pressure to continue 
development in high-risk areas, flood risk assessments play 
an important role in increasing public awareness, thereby 
helping people make informed decisions on where to 
live and which preventive actions to take. Mapping the 
extent and depth of flooding associated with current and 
future flood scenarios is a key component in assessing the 
vulnerability of people, buildings, infrastructure, and the 
economy to flood events.
Historically, flood risk management in Canada has mainly 
concentrated on river, coastal, and ice related flooding, 
yet there are also other significant sources of flooding 
such as pluvial, stormwater, sewer, groundwater flooding, 
as well as flooding caused by the failure of artificial water 
retention structures.
The present study assesses the declared commitments 
of municipal governments pertaining to the following 
components of Flood Risk Assessment criteria:
•	 Riverine and/or Coastal;
•	 Pluvial; and
•	 Flooding due to potential structural failures or breaches 
of flood protection and water retaining infrastructure.

A.2 Land Use Planning
Land use planning is a critical component of an 
integrated approach to flood risk management. It offers 
many opportunities to reduce the impacts of floods such 
as through the prohibition of development in high-risk 
areas and the accommodation and incentivization of 
urban growth and expansion in flood-safe areas.
The Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation (ICCA) 
report released in 2019 indicated that “due to changing 
planning policies across Canada, which have the objective 
of reducing urban sprawl, increasing development 
efficiencies, and reducing infrastructure-servicing costs, 
many municipalities are increasing population densities 
within their urban limits. This approach, over time, 
can lead to [the] intensification of development and 
re-development in within, or in close proximity to, 
floodplains, exacerbating neighbourhood exposure to 
flood risk.” (Moudrak and Feltmate 2019).
Although cities across Canada have traditionally 
managed their exposure to flood risk through the use of 
1 In some communities, there are designated SPAs (Special Policy Areas), within which development that encroaches on the floodplain and/or 
coastal areas can still proceed, subject to certain flood proofing/protection measures. Such measures may include mandates that require elevated 
building openings, raising electrical and mechanical systems above the regulatory flood level, the installation of backflow valves, and the use of 
flood damage resistant materials in basements.
regulatory instruments such as zoning regulations and 
building codes, the aforementioned changes in planning 
policies can have the unintended effect of increasing, 
rather than decreasing, the flood vulnerability of 
Canadian communities.
The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 
2015–2030 underscores the importance of land use 
planning and policy to address rapid urbanization, 
poor land management, and weak enforcement of 
land use regulations. Therefore, Canadian cities have 
a responsibility to incorporate said recommendations 
in their regulations and policies to reduce their existing 
exposure to flood risk as well as to prevent the creation of 
new risks that are linked to infill, intensification, and the 
re-development of low-lying coastal areas and floodplains.
To address this criterion, participants from municipal 
governments were asked to select the most appropriate 
option (or combination of options) in response to the 
following question:
2	
Relative to land use planning, how does the city regulate floodplain and/or coastal encroachment 
including infill, intensification, and re-development?
ANSWER 
KEY

(designated) floodplains. 
B

to some exemptions.1
D
The city has policies that support the restriction of new development and re-development in regulatory floodplains.
E
Currently, the city does not have bylaws prohibiting or restricting new development and re-development within 
regulatory floodplains.

A.3 Urban Drainage Assessment
Across Canada, tremendous urban development has taken 
place in various watersheds and in coastal areas. Drastic 
land use changes due to the removal of vegetation and 
soil, gradation of the land surface, and the construction 
of drainage networks increase water runoff to streams 
due to rainfall and snowmelt. As a result, the peak 
discharge, volume, and frequency of floods increases in 
nearby streams. Moreover, permeable soil is replaced by 
impermeable surfaces such as roads, roofs, parking lots, 
and sidewalks that store little water, reduce the infiltration 
of water into the ground, thereby producing higher peak-
flows in drainage channels.
The most common consequences of urban development 
are increased peak discharges and more frequent floods. 
Despite studies that have supported the link between the 
trend of urbanisation and the increasing risk of flooding, 
developments and re-developments within, or in close 
proximity to floodplains continues to take place at a rapid 
rate, consequently exposing communities to increasing 
flood hazards (Nirupama and Simonovic 2006)
Urban stormwater management systems are typically 
designed to meet performance standards that are based 
on historical climate events. However, if precipitation 
patterns continue to change, the historically reliable 
designs developed on the basis of probabilistic models 
may cease to be adequate in the future, and stormwater 
management systems within the built environment will 
therefore need to meet performance expectations under 
climatic conditions that are significantly different from the 
historically-experienced climate in a given area.
In order to reduce their exposure to the risk of flooding, 
cities need to develop and implement integrated 
stormwater management and urban drainage strategies 
that consider the impacts of climate change, population 
growth, and future land cover changes.
To address this criterion, participants from municipal 
governments were asked to select the most appropriate 
option (or combination of options) in response to the 
following question:
3	
Regarding the upgrading and rebuilding of stormwater infrastructure, how does the city address 
the impacts of climate change?
ANSWER 
KEY
A

infrastructure that identified the impacts of climate change on identified flood hazards. Based upon the developed/
updated long-term city flood mitigation strategy, a number of flood mitigation projects have been implemented or are 
scheduled for implementation throughout the city.
B
The city has recently (within the past 5 years) conducted a risk-based performance assessment of stormwater drainage

A.4 Flood Risk Mitigation for 
Residential Property
As the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation (ICCA) 
report indicated, “in recent years, the financial and social 
costs of natural catastrophes in Canada have escalated 
beyond historical levels. Residential flooding has been 
a key driver behind this trend, which has led to upward 
pressure on residential insurance premiums, mental health 
stress for homeowners impacted by flooding, potential 
increases in residential mortgage defaults, and lawsuits 
directed to builders and municipalities that fail in their 
fiduciary duty to anticipate and mitigate flood risk.” 
(Moudrak and Feltmate 2019).
It is widely agreed that effective and ongoing 
communication of flood information to residents is an 
essential component of any initiative aimed at reducing 
flood losses over the long term. A particularly important 
time when potential flood risk needs to be communicated 
is during real-estate transactions. Disclosing hazard 
information to potential buyers can reduce the odds that 
an individual or a family would be caught by surprise and 
would be unprepared if and when their homes were to be 
flooded or damaged.
Programs addressing the risks of residential properties to 
flooding are increasingly being implemented throughout 
Canadian municipalities, including educational programs 
that aim to inform residents on flood prevention and 
recommended maintenance activities. It is especially 
important that the general public has quick and easy 
access to user-friendly flood risk maps and other risk-
related information. An increased awareness of flood 
risks amongst the general population can also lead to an 
increase in flood-resilience initiatives that are undertaken 
by residents in existing communities, particularly for more 
economical solutions that are dependent on active and 
enthusiastic homeowner participation and support.
The present study assesses the declared commitments 
of municipal governments pertaining to the following 
components of Flood Risk Mitigation for Residential 
Property criteria:
•	 Risk Assessments; and
•	 Backwater Valve Installation.
The following four subsections present how the level of 
engagement of municipal governments is assessed in 
terms of their engagement in programs addressing the 
risks of residential properties to flooding.
Residential Property Risk Mitigation: 
Riverine and/or Coastal Flooding
To address this criterion, participants from municipal 
governments were asked to select the most appropriate 
option (or combination of options) in response to the 
following question:
4a	 How does the city mitigate the vulnerability of existing residential property to riverine and/or 
coastal flooding?
ANSWER 
KEY
A
The city provides information for residents to allow them to learn whether their property is located in a flood-prone area 
and subsidizes home flood assessments for residents who desire such assessments.
B

but does not provide subsidies for home flood assessments. 
D
The city is currently developing a program that would allow residents to assess riverine and/or coastal flood risk at 
a property-specific level. The city also provides guidance and educational materials on flood risk and prevention to 
homeowners.
E

Climate Change and the Preparedness of 16 Major Canadian Cities to Limit Flood Risk
66
Residential Property Risk Mitigation: 
Pluvial Flooding
Thousands of Canadians have experienced flooding, 
including those who reside far away from bodies of water. 
This is the case because flooding can occur in any urban 
area, even in higher elevation areas that lie above coastal 
and river floodplains. A pluvial flood, sometimes referred 
to as an urban flood in this context, takes place when 
heavy rainfall causes a flood event to occur, unrelated to 
the overflow of a water body. It has been suggested that 
pluvial floods may become increasingly frequent due to 
the effects of climate change.
Pluvial flooding effects can include street flooding, 
basement flooding, as well as flooding in low-lying 
areas caused by the overflow of local drainage systems. 
Throughout Canada, the responsibility for managing this 
type of flooding falls to the municipalities, where such 
exist. In other areas which may lack municipalities, the 
responsibility for managing these floods may fall to the 
provincial government but regulation with respect to this 
issue is typically scant.
While almost any structure located within urban areas 
is at some risk of experiencing damages from extreme 
precipitation and sewer backups, much of this damage can 
be prevented by interventions that can be implemented by 
municipalities, utilities, and other relevant authorities in 
order to reduce flood risk for communities in Canada.
Pluvial flooding often occurs in conjunction with coastal 
and fluvial floods and can therefore lead to significant and 
compounded property damages. The development of 
risk mitigation strategies, including strict building codes 
and restrictive zoning laws, can help prevent such losses, 
provided that these codes are adhered to and relevant 
laws enforced.
To address this criterion, participants from municipal 
governments were asked to select the most appropriate 
option (or combination of options) in response to the 
following question:
4b	 How does the city mitigate the vulnerability of existing residential property to pluvial flooding?
ANSWER 
KEY
A
The city provides information for residents to allow them to learn whether their property is at risk of pluvial flooding 
and subsidizes home flood assessments for residents who desire such assessments.
B

and subsidizes home flood protection assessments for only those properties that are at a high risk.
C

does not provide subsidies for home flood assessments. 
D
The city is currently developing a program that would allow residents to assess pluvial flood risk at a property-specific 
level. The city also provides guidance and educational materials on flood prevention to homeowners.
E
The city provides guidance and educational materials on flood prevention to homeowners.

Backwater Valve Installation
When heavy rainstorms flush debris into the mainline 
storm and sanitary sewers operated by communities, 
these sewers consequently can back up into homes and 
businesses, particularly if these systems are not designed 
with sufficient capacity. A mainline backwater valve 
(i.e., backflow prevention devices) on storm and/or 
sanitary sewer laterals can help prevent sewer water from 
backflowing into the basements of city residents.
The National Building Code of Canada developed by 
the National Research Council of Canada requires every 
new Canadian home to have a Backwater Valve (BWV) 
installed on both the storm and sanitary sewer service 
laterals. However, it should be noted that it is a codified 
best practice and therefore, Canadian municipalities are 
not mandated to adhere to it, instead following their own 
respective provincial building codes.  In some provinces, 
the installation of BWVs for new homes is optional rather 
than mandatory.  For municipalities, the requirement for 
the installation of backwater valves is defined in the City’s 
Sewer Design Guidelines and/or applicable bylaws, if 
either exist.
To address Backwater Valve Installation criteria, 
participants from municipal governments were asked to 
select the most appropriate option (or combination of 
options) in response to the following questions:
4c	 For newly constructed homes, does your city mandate the installation of backwater valves?
ANSWER 
KEY
	
 Yes
	
 No
	
 For some homes, dependent on the location of the home and its consequent exposure to flood hazards
4d	 For existing homes, does your city offer a financial subsidy for the installation of backwater valves?
ANSWER 
KEY
	
 Yes
	
 No
	
 For some homes, dependent on the location of the home and its consequent exposure to flood hazards

A.5 Flood Risk Mitigation for 
Critical Infrastructure and 
Essential Services
According to Public Safety Canada, Critical Infrastructure 
(CI) refers to the “processes, systems, facilities, 
technologies, networks, assets, and services [that are] 
essential to the health, safety, security, or economic 
well-being of Canadians and the effective functioning 
of government.”
The loss of CI components such as those within energy 
systems, transportation networks, telecommunication 
systems, water supply and wastewater systems, as well as 
other lifeline infrastructure systems can have far-reaching 
societal impacts, and damage to these critical assets may 
well have significant impacts on emergency response and 
recovery efforts. Therefore, it is very important that cities 
regularly review the vulnerability of municipal CI systems 
and services to flooding.
Perhaps the most important aspect of assessing Critical 
Infrastructure and essential services is identifying and 
analyzing the dependencies and interdependencies of 
CI. Failing to consider the interconnected nature of 
infrastructure and consequent interdependencies will 
result in ineffectiveness in terms of emergency response 
to disasters.
The present study assesses the declared commitments of 
municipal governments pertaining to the identification of 
vulnerabilities including infrastructure interdependencies 
for the following types of Critical Infrastructure and

Electrical-Powered Infrastructure
The functional continuity of the electrical grid is critical 
to the operations of emergency and human safety 
systems, since almost all critical infrastructure sectors 
are directly dependent on electricity and a loss of power 
would instantly affect a wide range of key power-reliant 
infrastructure operations. A serious degradation of 
electrical power can produce interdependent failures 
across a variety of CI sectors, a phenomenon generally 
referred to as a “ripple effect.”
To address these criteria, participants from municipal 
governments were asked to select the most appropriate 
option (or combination of options) in response to the 
following questions:
5a	 How does the city mitigate the vulnerability of existing critical electrical-powered infrastructure 
(such as wastewater plants, water treatment plants, pumping stations, etc.) to flooding, including 
the vulnerability to infrastructure interdependencies?
ANSWER

Telecommunication-Reliant Infrastructure
Communications infrastructure, which includes terrestrial, 
satellite, and wireless transmission systems is critical for 
the continued operation of all businesses, public safety 
organizations, and governments. It is closely linked to 
other CI systems, among them emergency services, 
which depends on communications for the direction of 
resources, the coordination of emergency response, the 
operation of public alert and warning systems, and the 
ability to receive emergency calls.
To address this criterion, participants were asked to select 
the most appropriate option (or combination of options) 
in response to the following question:
5b	 How does the city mitigate the flood vulnerability of existing critical telecommunication-reliant 
systems (such as monitoring of critical infrastructure, emergency communications, traffic signals, 
etc.), including the vulnerability to power loss?
ANSWER 
KEY

71
Food Systems
Food systems include all processes and infrastructure 
components that ensure that city populations continue 
to have access to food. These systems include growing, 
processing, storing, transporting, and disposing of food. 
Extreme weather events including flooding can cause 
significant damages and disruptions to this type of Critical 
Infrastructure, especially in terms of the transportation, 
storage, and processing of food. In addition, the access 
of citizens to food can also be impaired due to supply 
shortages and disruptions of transportation networks.
Moreover, the ability of citizens to access food can be 
limited due to a variety of failures in other types of CI 
such as electrical, telecommunication, transportation, 
and water systems. Therefore, planning in relation to 
the continuity of the food supply sector must include 
preparedness initiatives, communications during and 
after emergency events, and food inspections that occur 
throughout and following such events.
To address this criterion, participants were asked to select 
the most appropriate option (or combination of options) 
in response to the following question:
5c	 How does the city mitigate the flood vulnerability of food systems (encompassing transportation 
and food supply networks) including the vulnerability to power loss?
ANSWER 
KEY

Financial Services
The Financial Services sector represents a vital 
component of Canada’s Critical Infrastructure. This 
sector comprises of thousands of depository institutions, 
investment product providers, insurance companies, 
financing institutions, as well as the providers of the 
critical financial utilities and services that support the 
continual functioning of these various organizations.
Extreme weather events, including flooding, can cause 
damages to buildings that house financial/banking 
services in some cases. However, the dependency of this 
sector on computer, telecommunication, and wireless 
networks can lead to the immediate degradation and/
or interruption of services following disruptions of 
the electrical grid and telecommunication networks, a 
problem which is exacerbated when back-ups to these 
services are not established. For example, large swaths of 
Northern Canada rely solely on satellite communication 
and when this is disrupted, which occurs quite often, 
financial systems are commonly rendered inoperable 
as well.
To address this criterion, participants were asked to select 
the most appropriate option (or combination of options) 
in response to the following question:
5d	 How does the city mitigate the vulnerability of the financial sector to disruptions of critical financial 
services caused by flooding, including the vulnerability to infrastructure interdependencies?

Transportation Infrastructure and Services
The accurate assessment of risk is critical to efficient 
flood management, particularly within the transportation 
sector. Floods, and the physical response of channels 
and floodplains to them, constitutes a primary hazard of 
concern. Floodwaters and other flood-related hazards 
may severely damage transportation infrastructure (i.e. 
bridges and roadway embankments), thereby diminishing 
the ability of emergency responders to deliver services 
in addition to reducing the ability of the public to leave 
dangerous areas in the event of extreme rain events, 
2 Provincial highways, airports, CN/CP railways, and maritime transportation are out of the scope of this study.
coastal or riverine flooding, or flooding caused by the 
failure of dams or other flood protection infrastructure.
Flooding of roads, especially in low-lying areas (e.g. 
underpasses), is a special area of concern for first 
responders and emergency services, particularly during 
telecommunication disruptions as communicating 
information about the accessibility of emergency routes 
can become difficult or impossible.
To address this criterion, participants were asked to select 
the most appropriate option (or combination of options) 
in response to the following question:
5e	 How does the city mitigate the vulnerability of existing transportation infrastructure and service 
systems to flooding (including public transit and road networks)2?

Climate Change and the Preparedness of 16 Major Canadian Cities to Limit Flood Risk
74
Water Infrastructure and Services
Canadians depend on provincially regulated municipal 
water and wastewater facilities for their household water 
supplies and waste removal. Water and wastewater 
facilities are critical infrastructure and their potential for 
failure as a consequence of any hazard has emergency 
preparedness implications.
Both drinking water and wastewater infrastructure can 
be significantly impacted by extreme precipitation events. 
The impacts to such infrastructure can include power 
losses, severe asset damage, and dangerous conditions 
for the personnel of these facilities. As extreme weather 
events become more frequent and intense and as sea 
levels continue to rise, flooding will remain an ongoing 
challenge for drinking water and wastewater utilities.
Water systems are dependent on and interdependent 
with many other sets of CI. Specifically, drinking 
water facilities depend on an uninterrupted supply of 
electricity and chemicals in order to maintain the supply 
of potable water to citizens. Similarly, the wastewater 
system depends on utilities including gas, water, electricity, 
telecommunications, and chemical/equipment suppliers.
Disruptions within water systems or in the infrastructure 
with which water infrastructure is interdependent 
creates a complex system of impacts, and in some cases 
can magnify costs to human life, health, and welfare. 
Therefore, the analysis of interdependencies between the 
water sector and other sectors of CI is crucially important.
To address this criterion, participants were asked to select 
the most appropriate option (or combination of options) 
in response to the following question:
5f	 How does the city mitigate the vulnerability of existing drinking and wastewater infrastructure and 
services to flooding?

A.6 Public Health & Safety
“Disasters resulting from natural hazards such as floods can 
cause severe environmental and infrastructural disruption and 
significant economic losses. Disasters can also directly affect 
human health through injuries, death and disease outbreaks, 
and longer-term impacts may include non-communicable 
diseases, psychiatric morbidity and disabilities” (World 
Health Organization 2018). Natural hazards can trigger 
chemical releases as well as dam incidents, significant water 
releases, or significant changes in releases.
The integration of disaster risk management into 
municipal emergency planning becomes ever more 
important as the frequency and unpredictability of 
extreme weather events continues to increase.
The present study assesses the declared commitments 
of municipal governments pertaining to understanding 
and mitigating risks posed by potential hazards to the 
following critical sectors:
•	 Healthcare;
•	 Chemical; and
•	 Dams Sector.
The following three subsections present how the level of 
preparedness of municipal governments is assessed in 
terms of their ability to deal with the disruption of these 
sectors and subsequently to minimise the physical and 
psychological impacts of such disruptions to communities, 
as well as to reduce private and public losses.
Healthcare Sector
The Canadian health sector naturally plays a significant 
role in the response and recovery efforts that occur 
during and following natural or manmade disaster events. 
Damages to health facilities not only cost lives, but also 
can cause disruptions to health systems, facilities, and 
services, critically leaving many without access to health 
care when it is most needed, that is during emergencies.
Understanding and mitigating the risks that are posed by 
potential hazards to the healthcare sector can greatly contribute 
to ensuring that the necessary capacity is put into place to 
safeguard the resilience of communities in regard to coping 
and recovering from the impacts of disasters, including floods.
Notably, the healthcare system is highly dependent on 
other CI systems for the continuity of its operations 
and service delivery, amongst them telecommunication, 
energy, transportation, water, and food systems.
To address this criterion, participants were asked to select 
the most appropriate option (or combination of options) 
in response to the following question:
6a	 How does the city mitigate the vulnerability of existing healthcare facilities to flooding (such as 
hospitals, clinics, retirement homes, outpatient care centres, and assisted living facilities)?
ANSWER 
KEY
A
The city has recently (within the past 5 years) conducted a risk assessment to identify the vulnerability of existing 
healthcare facilities and their dependencies to flooding. The city has subsequently secured funding and developed plans

healthcare facilities to flooding. Engagement with healthcare facilities is currently limited to preliminary discussions.
E
The city addresses the vulnerability of existing healthcare facilities to flooding on an ad-hoc basis (e.g. following large 
flood events), but not on a regular basis.
Climate Change and the Preparedness of 16 Major Canadian Cities to Limit Flood Risk
76
Chemical Sector
In addition to causing significant economic and social 
damages, floods can trigger technological disasters, 
exacerbating impacts on the environment and on 
human health due to the potential releases of hazardous 
materials, as well as the possibility of fires and explosions. 
The assessment of potential chemical release risks 
associated with floods affecting the chemical sector 
is critically important due to the potential of major 
accidents. The chemical sector encompasses a wide range 
of facilities that manufacture, store, use, and transport 
potentially dangerous chemicals upon which a wide range 
of other critical infrastructure sectors rely.
A technological accident can cause the release of 
dangerous chemicals from manufacturing facilities, oil and 
gas pipelines, storage sites, transportation links, waste sites, 
and mines. Large-scale releases are particularly likely to 
occur from pipelines and at fixed chemical installations, 
where underground and aboveground fuel, chemical 
tanks, and connecting pipes can be damaged by floods.
Chemical spills from refineries, wastewater treatment 
plants, and hospitals can directly lead to the contamination 
of drinking water sources, wherein the prompt coordination 
of actions would be required in order to protect the 
health and safety of people. Furthermore, the ability of 
local authorities and services to respond to such chemical 
releases can be severely curtailed due to the other impacts 
of flooding, including blocked, damaged, or flooded 
transportation routes as well as potentially overwhelming 
rescue demand. Moreover, chemical releases themselves 
may prevent or hinder rescue operations because of the 
additional risks posed to emergency-response personnel.
Disruptions in the chemical sector can create complex 
systems of impacts, and in some cases, can also magnify 
the costs to human life, health, and welfare. Therefore, the 
analysis of interdependencies between the chemical sector 
and other CI sectors is crucially important.
To address this criterion, participants were asked to select 
the most appropriate option (or combination of options) 
in response to the following question:
6b	 How does the city mitigate the vulnerability of its population to hazardous chemical releases (such 
as oil spills and other chemical releases from pipelines carrying hazardous materials, industrial 
facilities, landfills, and water treatment plants) during floods?
ANSWER 
KEY
A
In collaboration with the owners/operators of facilities that produce, transport, store, or use toxic chemicals, the city 
identifies potential chemical release risks associated with flooding; mandating, controlling, and validating mitigation 
efforts against any potential threat to the lives, health, and safety of its population.
B
The city provides guidance on flood risk assessment and management to the owners/operators of facilities that produce, 
transport, store, or use toxic chemicals, and subsequently approves the implementation of mitigation measures.
C
The city mandates the owners/operators of facilities that produce, transport, store, or use toxic chemicals to review and 
update their emergency response plans that address contamination risks during and following flood events.
D
In collaboration with the owners/operators of facilities that produce, transport, store, or use toxic chemicals, the city 
guides the development of emergency plans that address contamination risks during and following flood events.
E
The city coordinates emergency and response planning with the owners/operators of facilities that produce, transport, 
store, or use toxic chemicals to ensure the safety of its population.
Dams Sector
There are over 15 000 dams in Canada, of which 933 are 
categorised as ‘large’ dams as defined by the International 
Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD). Such dams may 
be owned by a variety of different organizations, including 
federal, provincial, and municipal governments, provincial 
or local utilities, industrial and mining companies, and 
even private individuals. Canadian hydroelectric and 
mine tailings dams are amongst the largest dams in the 
world, with some particularly large dams located in the 
Province of Quebec and used for hydroelectric purposes. 
Climate Change and the Preparedness of 16 Major Canadian Cities to Limit Flood Risk
77
Unlike some other countries, Canada lacks a central 
regulatory authority to guide and develop requirements that 
would outline how dams are to be managed in a safe manner.
Significant dam failures lead to floods of varying extremity. 
Climate change, erosion, variations in volume and 
waterway flows due to precipitation changes and upstream 
development, as well as the increasing occurrence of 
extreme weather events can negatively affect the integrity 
of dams and lead to dam overtopping and dam breach 
emergencies. Moreover, dams are exposed to the risk of 
deliberate sabotage which would result in the most extreme 
consequences out of all possible dam-related emergencies.
The responsibility for emergency planning for dams lies 
primarily with dam owners and also local authorities. The 
former group has the duty to provide timely warnings, 
whereas downstream local authorities are responsible for their 
own emergency planning relative to dam-related emergencies. 
Inundation maps along with flood arrival details are to be 
prepared by dam owners so as to allow emergency responders 
to plan their own response actions. Local authorities must 
also ensure that local emergency plans include current, all-
inclusive inundation maps, supported by the inundation maps 
provided by dam owners. These emergency plans should 
also include an inventory of impacts to the people and 
properties that are located within the inundation zone.
The term ‘inundation zone’ refers to the area that would 
be impacted downstream of the dam in the event of a 
dam failure or an uncontrolled release of water that is 
generally significantly larger than a normal river or stream 
flood event. Notably, this term is broader than a ‘regulated 
flood area’ (such as a 1-in-100-year flood) and keeping 
accurate stock of the extent of such zones is perhaps 
even more critically important than the routine update of 
regular floodplain maps. This is the case because floods 
caused by dam breaches or failures are typically more 
sudden and dangerous than regular flood events.
Nevertheless, the requirements of how inundation maps 
are kept up-to-date and how these are shared not only 
with emergency response agencies but also with the 
general public is inconsistent across the various Canadian 
jurisdictions. Inundation maps being publicly available is 
particularly important seeing as the consequence of such 
floods can include the flooding of major infrastructure 
and transportation routes, leading to difficulties with 
evacuations, if such become necessary.
To address this criterion, participants were asked to select 
the most appropriate option (or combination of options) 
in response to the following question:
6c	 How does the city mitigate the vulnerability of its population to the negative impacts of controlled 
releases and/or dam failures that may occur during floods?
ANSWER 
KEY
A
For dams that may affect the city during floods, the city in partnership with the province and/or conservation/watershed 
authorities carries out regular dam safety surveillance, water level monitoring, and other relevant activities that are 
related to dam pre-releases and extra discharges during heavy rainfall events. Dam failure inundation maps and/or 
evacuation maps, incorporating the impacts of climate change were recently (within the past 5 years) updated.

evacuation maps, were updated more than 10 years ago.
C
For dams that may affect the city during floods, the city mandates the owners/operators of these dams to regularly (at 
least every 10 years) update dam failure inundation maps (for dams with high risks of failure) and/or evacuation maps as 
applicable, incorporating the impacts of climate change. 
D
For dams that may affect the city during floods, the city mandates the owners/operators of these dams to regularly (at least 
every 10 years) update dam failure inundation maps (for dams with high risks of failure) and/or evacuation maps as applicable.
E
The city addresses the potential safety risks of controlled releases and/or dam failures during floods on an ad-hoc basis 
(e.g. following large flood events), but not on a regular basis.

A.7 Emergency Response
The mission of emergency response operators is to 
save lives, protect property and the environment, assist 
communities impacted by disasters, and aid recovery 
during emergencies.
Emergency operation assets include the Government 
Operations Centre, housed at Public Safety Canada as 
well as regional offices located in all of the provinces and 
in the North. Emergencies are managed first at the local 
level – for example, by first responders such as medical 
professionals and hospitals, fire departments, the police, 
and public works departments.
To ensure the safety of their residents, as well as the safety 
of emergency professionals and volunteers, municipal 
governments need to assess the vulnerability of their 
emergency services and assets so as to manage the 
assistance required for both the operation and protection 
of the assets and facilities that provide Emergency Social 
Services assistance during emergency events.
The emergency response sector has dependencies 
and interdependencies with multiple other 
Critical Infrastructure sectors and the analysis of 
interdependencies between this sector and the other CI 
sectors is crucially important for emergency management.
The present study assesses the declared commitments of 
municipal governments pertaining to the identification of 
vulnerabilities including infrastructure interdependencies 
for the emergency response sector focusing on the 
following domains:
•	 Emergency Response Operations;
•	 Continuity of Fuel Supply;
•	 Continuity of Emergency Communication; and
•	 Public Alerting.
The following four subsections present how the level of 
preparedness of municipal governments is assessed in 
terms of their ability to deal with emergency situations 
and subsequently ensuring the continual stable delivery of 
essential services.
Emergency Response Operations
Emergency services play a crucial role during the flood 
response process, as they are central to rescue and relief 
efforts. The resilience of critical response and recovery 
facilities, including police, fire, emergency health centres, 
and Emergency Social Services (ESS) reception centers plays 
a crucial role in emergency response and recovery activities.
The main target of the hazard risk and vulnerability 
assessments of emergency response operations is the 
prevention of injury and loss of life of emergency services 
personnel, members of volunteer organizations, and 
members of the public, as well as ensuring the ability of 
emergency services to respond efficiently and effectively 
during emergencies.

Continuity of Fuel Supply
A fuel supply shortage (“fuel‟ refers to refined petroleum 
products, such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and heating 
oil but not crude oil) can be caused by failures in the 
distribution system (e.g. due to pipeline damage) and/or 
major disruptions to refinery operations (e.g. significant 
electrical outages or flooding). During a declared 
emergency, supplies of fuel may become a government-
controlled commodity in order for communities and 
critical infrastructure (CI) sectors to maintain essential 
services.
The availability of fuel for emergency service backup 
generators is critical for continued operations of hospitals 
and emergency services, telecommunications systems 
and transportation hubs such as airports and public 
transportation services. During emergencies, the demand 
for fuel supply can increase dramatically, therefore, local 
business continuity planning should adopt measures in 
order to mitigate the effects of fuel shortages during 
flooding events.
To address this criterion, participants were asked to select 
the most appropriate option (or combination of options) 
in response to the following question:
7b	 How does the city ensure the continuity of fuel supply (gas, oil, and diesel) including fuel supply for 
emergency coordination centres, emergency first response operations, and hospitals during flood 
events?

The city maintains designated emergency fuel depots and has mutual aid agreements with the owners/operators of 
critical infrastructure to mitigate the effects of fuel shortages during flooding events. 
D
The city mandates the owners/operators of critical infrastructure to arrange agreements with fuel suppliers, validating 
and controlling the implementation of their business continuity plans. 
E
The city provides guidelines and tools for emergency planning to assist the owners/operators of critical infrastructure in 
the development and implementation of their emergency fuel contingency plans.
Continuity of Emergency Communication
In a situation like a flood, the ability of first responders to 
communicate is of paramount importance, and continuity 
of communications is especially essential during 
emergency operations. The loss of communications, 
whether due to destruction or loss of service due to 
power failure, places the lives and safety of all people in a 
disaster-affected area at a significantly greater risk.
Emergency communications are defined as the ability of 
emergency responders to exchange information via data, 
voice, and video as authorized, to carry out their work, 
and to complete their missions. Unanticipated congestion 
on commercial wireless networks during unplanned events 
can result in degradation of service, thereby impeding the 
ability of emergency managers, local officials, residents, 
and businesses to make decisions on how to best respond 
to threatening conditions. Seeing as all telecommunication 
networks are extensively power-reliant, power outages 
immediately and directly impact the continuity of 
telecommunications services.
To address this criterion, participants were asked to select 
the most appropriate option (or combination of options) 
in response to the following question:
Climate Change and the Preparedness of 16 Major Canadian Cities to Limit Flood Risk
81
7c	 How does the city ensure the continuity of communications between emergency response agencies 
and organizations during flood events?
ANSWER 
KEY
A
The city actively participates in the testing of the public safety broadband network to enhance communications between 
emergency response agencies during flood events.
B
The city collaborates with cellular communication service providers to ensure the continuity of wireless priority service 
for communications between emergency response agencies during flood events.
C
The city collaborates with an amateur radio operator society to provide reliable communications between emergency 
response agencies during flood events.
D
The city has deployed a Public Safety Radio Network to provide reliable communications between emergency response 
agencies during flood events.
E
The city, in partnership with the province, and/or conservation/watershed authorities is working with providers to assess 
the provision of critical services and to understand the limitations of the current services.
Public Alerting
Public alerting in Canada, like all emergency 
management functions, is a collaborative initiative 
between federal, provincial, territorial, and municipal 
governments, as well as industry partners.
As the climate becomes increasingly variable, the 
ability of disaster management teams to anticipate the 
occurrence of extreme weather events will become ever 
more challenging. There may also be a trend of growth in 
the potential for disasters to occur with very little warning 
or with sudden, unanticipated intensities. Therefore, 
building a safe and reliable public alerting system 
empowers individuals and organizations to minimize 
disaster damages and losses of life by providing residents 
of disaster-prone areas with advance warning of possible 
emergency events.
Current methods for assessing social vulnerability to 
emergencies, including flooding, assume that social 
deprivation is a good proxy of vulnerability to a flood. For 
municipal governments, social vulnerability assessments 
are an important step in building robustness against 
emergency and flood risks. Mapping the distribution of 
social vulnerabilities is a beneficial add-on to existing 
emergency alert/warning systems as it allows planning 
efforts to include consideration for the inclusion of 
services for people with special needs (e.g., visually, 
hearing, or physically impaired, infirm, illiterate, 
individuals who do not speak the primary local language, 
etc.) residing in flood prone areas.
To address this criterion, participants were asked to select

A.8 Chief Resilience Officer
One of the evolving challenges for Canadian cities 
concerned about resilience and emergency preparedness 
is the trend of rapid population growth in most major 
Canadian metropoleis. As urbanization progresses 
across Canada, it is important for city governments to 
consistently improve their capacity to deal with various 
shocks and stresses resultant from a wide range of 
causal factors.
In 2013, The Rockefeller Foundation (New York, USA) 
launched the 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) program 
that offered a $100 million USD prize that was split 
between 100 cities around the world that agreed to 
establish a Chief Resilience Officer (CRO) position. In 
Canada, the cities of Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, and 
Montréal had each established such a position within their 
respective city governments in order to lead each city’s 
resilience efforts. These four cities formed the “Team 
Canada Committee,” a working group on resilience best 
practices that collaborated on shared challenges “in public 
health, immigration, social resilience, and adaptation to 
climate change” (City of Montréal 2018).
The 100RC program ended in 2019, with all four 
participating Canadian cities launching their respective 
Resilient City Strategies and related action plans.
While many other communities across Canada may 
have an individual or a group of individuals that are 
responsible for the respective community’s safety and 
capacity to adapt and/or react to risks, the titles held by 
such individuals may be different. Therefore, nearly all 
major Canadian communities do address the issue of 
resilience in some manner.
To address this criterion, participants were asked to select 
the most appropriate option (or combination of options) 
in response to the following question:

Definitions
A catastrophic event (CAT): an event that affects 
multiple policies and causes more than $25 million of 
insured damage.
Climate: the average weather, usually expressed in terms 
of the parameters temperature, precipitation, and wind.
Climate Change: a change in the mean and/or the 
variability of climate parameters over a period of time 
ranging from months to thousands or millions of years
Coastal Flooding: flooding associated with a defined 
shoreline along an ocean or a lake. Can occur due to a 
combination of high water levels, high tides, storm surges, 
waves, tsunamis, rising sea levels.
Disaster: essentially a social phenomenon that results 
when a hazard intersects with a vulnerable community in 
a way that exceeds or overwhelms the community’s ability 
to cope and may cause serious harm to the safety, health, 
welfare, property or environment of people; this may be 
triggered by a naturally occurring phenomenon or by 
human action or error.
Emergency communications: the ability of 
emergency responders to exchange information via data, 
voice, and video as authorized, to carry out their work and 
complete their missions.
Floodplain: an area adjacent to a lake, river or coast, 
which can be expected to be regularly inundated or 
covered with water. It typically includes two zones:
Floodway: the channel of the river or stream 
and the adjacent land that must remain free from 
obstruction so that the regulatory flood can be safely 
conveyed downstream.
Flood Fringe: the remaining portion of the floodplain, 
where flood depths, flow velocities, or wave energies 
are relatively lower and some development may be 
permitted, if adequate levels of flood protection are 
provided. Flood Mechanisms: the condition, which causes 
a specific type of flood (e.g., blocked culvert leading to 
overland flooding).
Flood Mitigation: a sustained action taken to reduce 
or eliminate long-term risk to people and property from 
flood hazards and their effects. Mitigation distinguishes 
actions that have a long-term impact from those that are 
more closely associated with preparedness for, immediate 
response to, and short-term recovery from specific events.
Flood Risk: flood risk is a combination of the likelihood 
of occurrence of a flood event and the social or economic 
consequences of that event when it occurs.
Flood Risk Map: maps that contain the flood hazard 
or inundation delineations along with additional socio-
economic values, such as potential loss or property 
vulnerability levels. These maps serve to identify the 
social, economic and environmental consequences to 
communities during a potential flood event.
Flood Protection: any combination of structural and 
non-structural improvements, additions, changes, or 
adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate 
risk of flood damage to real estate or improved real 
property, water and sanitation facilities, or structures with 
their contents.
Fluvial Flooding: excess stream flow in a watercourse, 
such that land outside the normal banks is submerged 
or inundated. Riverine flooding can be caused or 
exacerbated by extreme rainfall, snowmelt, physical 
conditions (e.g., ice, sediment and debris jams, 
watercourse configuration and capacity limitations), as 
well as elevated water levels in receiving waterbodies.
Hazard: a potentially damaging physical event, 
phenomenon, or human activity that may cause the loss 
of life or injury, property damage, social and economic 
disruption or environmental degradation.
Infill: development within urban boundaries not related 
to large-scale development plans, but rather smaller scale 
development in remnant vacant parcels.

Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curve: a 
graphical representation of the probability that a given 
depth of rainfall will occur, shown in rainfall intensity 
(e.g., in millimeters per hour) with respect to rainfall 
duration (e.g., hour). Lateral: any pipe from a building 
connected to the main sewer.
Peak Flow: the maximum flow rate occurring during a 
specified flood event measured at a given point in a river, 
overland, or in a pipe system.
Permafrost: rock or soil that remains below 0°C for at 
least two consecutive years. Surface conditions including 
vegetation, organic cover and snow thickness can 
influence permafrost temperatures. Permafrost thickness is 
related to the air temperature, soil characteristics and the 
geothermal gradient as well as the geological history of 
the area.
Pluvial Flooding: the inundation of the built 
environment by rainfall, overwhelming the capacity of 
stormwater management systems.
Re-development: conversion of existing urban uses 
of lower value and significance to other preferred uses 
per a community plan (e.g. brownfield redevelopment to 
residential uses).
Regulatory Flood: the defined flood event used to 
delineate areas prone to flooding for the purposes of 
regulating land use. The minimum regulatory flood 
criteria standard in Canada is the 100-year return period 
flood, which is the peak flood flow with a one percent 
chance of occurring in any given year. Some regions, 
provinces, and territories implement standards that are 
more stringent.
Resilience: capacity of people and systems to 
absorb negative impacts and respond to changing 
climate conditions.
Risk: a combination of the likelihood (probability of 
occurrence) and the consequences of an event.
Risk Management: a systematic approach to setting 
the course of action under conditions of uncertainty, by 
applying management policies, procedures, and practices 
to the analysis, evaluation, control, and communication 
about risk issues.
Runoff: the amount of water deriving from 
precipitation/ snowmelt, not otherwise evapotranspirated 
or stored, that flows across the landscape.
Sanitary Sewer: part of the public sewage works for 
the transmission of sanitary sewage (includes human 
and industrial waste, and septic waste, but not typically 
stormwater).
Stormwater: precipitation that washes off driveways, 
parking lots, roads, yards, rooftops, and other surfaces.
Stormwater Management: the planning, design 
and implementation of systems that mitigate and 
control the impacts of man-made changes to runoff 
and other components of the hydrologic cycle. 
Stormwater management is also referred to as “rainwater 
management” in much of the world.
