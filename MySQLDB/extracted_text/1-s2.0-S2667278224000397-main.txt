Climate change presents an urgent and growing threat to the health and well-being of people and the planet.
More frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts and ﬂoods are breaching critical ecosystem boundaries,
causing cascading impacts that are increasingly complex to govern. Unsustainable development pathways
and economic choices that are fueling the climate crisis are also directly engendering global health issues.
Furthermore, the global response to climate change has been uneven and the lack of a conceptual framework
for loss and damage has allowed developed countries the latitude to adopt differing takes on its framing,
undermining the urgency and progression of the loss and damage mechanism to the detriment of developing
countries. Current research on the governance of climate ethics posits that while economic and legal consid-
erations largely inﬂuence climate policies, decision-making processes in climate adjacent sectors such as
health need to be further grounded on ethically sound principles. Framing the health impacts of climate
change as a moral issue can therefore be viewed as an effort to reshape the current political discourse with a
humanistic lens and move the international community and state-level actors to action. The framing of this
issue is particularly important as it recenters the focus on human health as an imperative for effective climate
policies rather than as a contributor to the cache of peripheral co-beneﬁts. It also underscores climate change
as an ethical issue, in which failure to respond to the climate impacts can worsen health inequities, especially
for socially and economically marginalized communities and vulnerable groups.

1. Introduction
Climate change presents an urgent and growing threat to the
health and well-being of people and the planet. More frequent and
intense heatwaves, droughts and ﬂoods are breaching critical ecosys-
tem boundaries, affecting the ability of plants and animals to tolerate
environmental change [1]. This also leads to cascading impacts that
are increasingly complex to govern. According to the Lancet Commis-
sion on Planetary Health, humans have been mortgaging the health
of future generations and exploiting natural resources to capitalize
on current economic beneﬁts and development gains [2]. That is to
say −unsustainable development pathways and economic choices
that are fueling the climate crisis are also directly engendering global
health challenges, the opportunity cost of which will be felt for many
years to come [3]. At the same time, climate threats have exposed
millions to acute food and water insecurity, particularly in regions
across Africa, Asia, Central and South America, Small Islands and the
Arctic [4]. This demonstrates the uneven and unmitigated burden of
climate
stressors,
including
non-economic
health
losses
that
disproportionately affect low-income countries. Conceptually, non-
economic losses cover a broad spectrum of losses that cannot be eas-
ily accounted for monetarily or valued as commodities or assets com-
monly traded in markets [5]. This will be explored further in the next
section.
Over time, climate hazards have caused losses and damages to
both humans and natural ecosystems, with impacts disproportion-
ately distributed across systems, regions, and sectors [1]. Climate
impacts have most affected the economically and socially marginal-
ized, providing a compelling rationale for why ethical considerations
should frame the building blocks of climate actions and sustainable
health systems. Current research on the governance of climate ethics,
which explores the principles and normative aspects that guide ethi-
cal decision-making in climate change responses, suggests that while
economic and legal factors largely inﬂuence climate policies, deci-
sion-making processes in climate-adjacent sectors such as health
should be further grounded on ethically sound principles [6]. The log-
ical basis for placing health ethics on equal footing to economic prin-
ciples is to recenter the focus on human health as an imperative for
effective climate policies rather than as a contributor to the cache of
peripheral co-beneﬁts.

Findings suggest that within health research, there is little recog-
nition of the need for health policy to address ethical challenges [7].
For instance, the ways in which acceptability inﬂuences decisions on
health-related cost management (or compensation and determining
who should be liable for the assumed costs) is complexly ethical and
consequential. Moreover, transparency regarding the valuation and
rationale when determining compensation for climate-related loss
and damage is key [7]. While current literature recognizes the exten-
sive normative challenges in health-oriented climate change policy
and research (e.g., intergenerational justice and the wellbeing of
future generations), it also points to limitations in ethical theory
including practical pathways and policy options useful for public
health practitioners and researchers [8]. This perspective paper
therefore attempts to reconcile prevailing ethical considerations for
climate change and health policy and practice within existing schol-
arship by (1) examining the barriers in political agenda setting in
which health considerations have been largely siloed, (2) discussing
the ethical considerations of the loss and damage debate, and (3)
highlighting aspects of health equity and climate justice with the aim
of accelerating progress towards achieving planetary health [9].
2. Understanding non-economic health losses under the Warsaw
International Mechanism for loss and damage
As a starting point, loss and damage refers to the adverse impacts
that result from the unavoidable risks of climate change [10]. As the
main apparatus under the auspices of the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Warsaw International
Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change
Impacts (WIM) was established to assist developing countries avert,
address, and minimize loss and damage associated with climate
change impacts, including extreme weather events, and slow onset
events which emerge gradually overtime such as drought or sea-level
rise [11]. Within this, non-economic losses form the basis upon
which health considerations can be assessed in the aftermath of cli-
mate disasters, extreme weather- and slow-onset events that cannot
be addressed through further adaptation or mitigations measures
[12].
Non-economic losses may “impact individuals (e.g., loss of life,
health, mobility), society (e.g., loss of territory, cultural heritage,
indigenous or local knowledge, societal or cultural identity) or the
environment (e.g., loss of biodiversity, ecosystem services)” [5].
Expanding on this point, non-economic health losses arising from cli-
mate change involve both direct and indirect impacts. Direct losses
cover injury, illness, and mortality resulting from climate-related nat-
ural hazards, while indirect losses extend to broader environmental
health determinants such as physical and mental health effects stem-
ming, for example, from the loss of territory, cultural identity, or eco-
system services [13].
A considerable amount of health impacts are quantiﬁable, such as
the impact of heat stress on occupational health safety or the ﬁnan-
cial burden of climate stressors on health systems [9]. Still, in the con-
text of loss and damage, the assessment and valuation of non-
economic losses is complex due to much uncertainty on the role of
value judgements and the process of quantifying total non-economic
losses that depend on various metrics such as disability adjusted life-
years (DALYs) [14]. DALYs are primarily a measure of non-economic
costs that reﬂect the burden of disease [15]. While the economic cost
of DALYs due to injuries can be estimated, including potential pro-
ductivity losses or healthcare costs associated with climate-induced
disasters, it is very difﬁcult to compute. Complexities in measure-
ment, such as limited access to pre-disaster health data and chal-
lenges
in
the
valuation
of
incomparable
data,
are
further
compounded by the systemic nature of disaster events. This is partic-
ularly evident in low-resource settings where analytical capacity
remains constrained, rendering it difﬁcult to register aggregate
damage in a single estimate of “total non-economic loss” [14]. It is for
these reasons that the distinction between non-economic loss and
economic
loss
is,
at
times,
opaque.
As
a
result,
governance
approaches that address loss and damage are likely to focus on eco-
nomic losses and damages that are more easily measurable [16].
Given the complexity of valuing non-economic losses −Willetts,
2022 points to critical accounting tools useful for non-economic
losses such as health impact assessments that factor both environ-
mental and health metrics, alongside improved vulnerability map-
ping layered to climate exposure risks [17].
3. Ethical considerations of the loss and damage debate
3.1. Spotlighting ethical considerations in multilateral climate
agreements
The Rio Declaration, born out of the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de
Janeiro, introduced the concept of “common but differentiated
responsibility”, and serves as a cornerstone for several global climate
frameworks, including the Paris Agreement, the UNFCCC and the
Kyoto Protocol. It champions the principles of fairness and equity,
while highlighting the rights of individuals to lead healthy, produc-
tive lives in harmony with nature [18]. Similarly, the “polluter pays
principle” holds accountable those who pollute the environment,
requiring them to compensate for the damage caused to human
health or the integrity and stability of natural ecosystems [19].
Despite uncertainty regarding the application of these ethical princi-
ples and perceived barriers to their effective implementation, they
have gained prominence in global climate negotiations in an effort to
uphold climate justice and health equity for those most affected by
climate change. What is more, the United Nations Educational, Scien-
tiﬁc and Cultural Organization’s Declaration of Ethical Principles in
relation to Climate Change recognizes climate change as an ethical
issue, in which failure to respond to climate impacts can fuel the cli-
mate crisis [20]. It acknowledges that decarbonization efforts alone
are insufﬁcient to achieve the targets outlined in the Paris Agree-
ment, while effective adaptation measures cannot avert all losses and
damages [1,21]. Further to this, maladaptive responses can exacer-
bate risk and vulnerabilities, underscoring the unequal power
dynamics inherent in the system [22].
3.2. The uneven global response to loss and damage
On a global scale, countries have been urged to enhance interna-
tional cooperation and scale up action, including through ﬁnancing,
technology transfer and capacity-building to assist developing coun-
tries to avert, minimize and address loss and damage [11]. Even so,
the global response to the impacts of climate change has been
uneven, with a research survey of advanced economies echoing
mixed reviews on its broader, collective response [23]. For decades,
intergovernmental dialogues on the provision of funding to address
loss and damage were struggling to take wing. Despite being party to
the WIM, negotiations between developed and developing countries
have been punctuated by value conﬂicts underpinned by differing
priorities and perspectives [24]. Historically, these differences arise
from contrasting beliefs and interests about responsibility, equity,
and justice on compensation, notably the reluctance of developed
countries to accept any notion of ﬁnancial liability.
3.3. Gaps in the loss and damage mechanism
The lack of a conceptual framework for loss and damage has also
allowed developed countries the latitude to adopt differing takes on
its framing, undermining the urgency and progression of the loss and
damage mechanism to the detriment of developing countries [25].
Moreover, amid competing interests, developed countries have
M. Teshome

2
advocated for optimizing the use of traditional funding sources, pro-
posing the allocation of resources for loss and damage from existing
climate funds and insurance schemes. Despite preceding challenges,
COP27 marked a signiﬁcant turning point by endorsing the establish-
ment of a dedicated fund for loss and damage. It also laid the ground-
work to streamline ﬁnance ﬂows towards low emissions and climate
resilient development, with an emphasis on developing countries
[26,27].
3.4. Upholding a human rights-based approach
Of particular concern −in what appeared to be a backward step −
the co-chair’s proposal for the ﬁfth meeting of the Transitional Com-
mittee for operationalizing the new funding arrangements to
respond to loss and damage, omitted provisions on a “human rights-
based approach” from the terms of reference that had been previ-
ously prioritized in an earlier version of the proposal [28]. That not-
withstanding, the United Nations Human Rights Ofﬁce of the High
Commissioner (OHCHR) recently published key messages on human
rights and loss and damage. In it, OHCHR explores equity-based
approaches and solutions to address loss and damage. It also guides
states to “adopt innovative measures to ﬁnance efforts to address
loss and damage including equitable and progressive carbon taxes;
wealth taxes; levies on certain sectors, e.g. fossil fuels, aviation, and
shipping; and legal and policy measures to increase the accountabil-
ity of businesses for climate change related harms” [29].
4. Recentering health within the climate policy landscape
4.1. Reorienting health priorities in climate policies and decision-
making processes
Increased exposure to natural hazards reveals the myriad ways in
which climate change affects the health and well-being of vulnerable
populations, including the adverse effects of extreme stress on natu-
ral ecosystems [21]. Scientiﬁc evidence further points to a negative
relationship between income levels and disaster death tolls. For
instance, low-income countries which account for less than 10 % of
the world’s population exceedingly bear the burden of 23 % of global
disaster-related deaths [30]. Certainly, improved risk governance,
better infrastructure, enhanced surveillance systems, and reduced
exposure to natural hazards can signiﬁcantly improve protection in
countries as income levels rise [30]. Focusing on the human condition
within the context of climate change thus illuminates the health
inequities, socio-economic disparities and exposure to climate-
related hazards faced by at-risk communities.
Going further, neoliberal ideologies linked to policies or practices
that prioritize, for example, the privatization of healthcare systems
tend to depict healthcare as an economic commodity, where health
inequities are regarded as a biproduct of disparities linked to individ-
ual choices and lifestyle behaviors, instead of as an issue that should
be addressed through state-level interventions [31]. Framing the
health impacts of climate change as a moral issue can therefore be
viewed as an effort to reorient the current political discourse with a
humanistic lens and move the international community and state-
level actors to action. The framing of this issue is particularly impor-
tant as it upholds principles of fairness, justice, and human rights. It
also underscores climate change as an ethical issue, in which failure
to respond to the climate impacts can worsen inequities, especially
for socially and economically marginalized communities and vulner-
able groups [20]. In practical terms, the new framing calls attention
to ethical concerns regarding the distribution of climate risks and
burdens, promotes equitable access to healthcare services alongside
the allocation of resources for climate-related loss and damage.
4.2. Transforming words into action
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2022 two
thirds (63 %) of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) included
health-speciﬁc adaptation actions or plans [32]. In that same period,
sixty percent of all NDCs referred to at least one climate-sensitive
health risk or outcome, while only one tenth (11 %) of all NDCs explic-
itly mentioned the concept of “loss and damage” in relation to human
health. As an example, countries such as Antigua and Barbuda, Cam-
bodia, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Vanuatu have highlighted this link
in their NDCs. Going further, as of May 2024, 50 out of 55 multi-sec-
toral National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) submitted to the UNFCCC
have identiﬁed health as a priority sector vulnerable to climate
change [33]. Although climate change adaptation strategies are
becoming increasingly intersectional, the implementation of health-
focused adaptation interventions remains limited compared to other
key economic sectors [34]. Equally, despite the inclusion of the “right
to health” in the Preamble to the Paris Agreement, a health-oriented
focus is fundamentally lacking in its operational mechanisms [3]. One
approach to address these operational gaps with respect to loss and
damage is to accelerate the implementation progress of health-
informed climate change policies and programmatic approaches by
leveraging existing mechanisms.
Strong collaboration among actors to ensure policy coherence
across relevant global frameworks (e.g., vis-a-vis the WIM, the Sendai
Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the Paris Agreement, the
WHO Health Emergency and Disaster Risk Management Framework,
and the Global Framework for Climate Services) has the potential to
increase technical effectiveness. This could be realized in a number of
ways, for example, through better accounting systems (e.g., for indi-
rect deaths); improving the accuracy of weather forecasts and cli-
mate models; streamlining risk and capacity assessments; and
promoting the interoperability of multi-sectoral data across various
loss and damage platforms (i.e., integrated systems designed to cover
all aspects of end-to-end disaster data services) [30]. Generally
speaking, effective management of emergency and disaster risks by
all stakeholders is expected to signiﬁcantly enhance community and
national resilience, bolster health security, and promote sustainable
development.
Worth mentioning is that the United Nations Ofﬁce for Disaster
Risk Reduction (UNDRR), the United Nations Development Pro-
gramme (UNDP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)
are working together to develop the next generation disaster losses
tracking system that will supersede the existing DesInventar (a ﬁrst
generation disaster losses and damages tracking system that provides
tools for systematic data collection, documentation, analysis, and
reporting) with a more wide-ranging and interoperable tracking sys-
tem [35]. The system will focus on breaking down data silos across
sectors (including health) and prioritizing disaggregation of national
and local data [36]. Another prominent disaster information manage-
ment system with a focus on loss and damage is the International
Disaster Database (EM-DAT) managed by the Centre for Research on
the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED). Platforms such as DesInventar
and EM-DAT not only serve as valuable resources for compensation
but also provide a scientiﬁc basis for creating climate change and
health policies [36].
Beyond this, the Santiago Network can support the provision of
knowledge, resources and technical assistance needed for effectively
averting, minimizing and addressing loss and damage [37]. Whereas,
multi-donor grant facilities, such as the Global Shield Solutions Plat-
form (GSSP), can leverage technical assistance and ﬁnancial support
to scale up action for vulnerable communities facing increased risk of
climate-related loss and damage [38]. The GSSP, which “fosters the
development of needs-based and ﬁnancially sustainable climate risk
ﬁnance and insurance solutions in developing and emerging coun-
tries” [38], acknowledges the unequal burdens and risks that climate

3
vulnerable countries face, while bearing the least responsibility for
the climate crisis [39]. Practically-speaking, health professionals
could use the GSSP to access the needs-based ﬁnancial grants and
insurance solutions to strengthen health systems and health infra-
structure in climate vulnerable countries.
5. Working towards health equity and climate justice in the
pursuit of planetary health
5.1. Harnessing multi-sectoral co-beneﬁts in the race to net-zero
Against mounting climate shocks and associated health emergen-
cies, ethical considerations are increasingly important in positively
shaping current climate discourses, approaches and response mecha-
nisms that ensure equitable health and well-being. Taking equity
into account, it is crucial to acknowledge that developing countries,
which have historically contributed the least to the climate crisis,
bear the brunt of its impacts. What is more, they are restricted to
using the remaining carbon budget, thus reinforcing principles of cli-
mate injustice [37]. According to recent ﬁndings, a key consideration
in the climate policy landscape is decision-making that can accelerate
progress to net-zero. This involves leveraging short-term co-beneﬁts,
such as health equity and sustainable development, while mitigating
the adverse effects of climate change [40]. Adhering to universally
accepted deﬁnitions of loss and damage and planetary health pro-
vides a basis to hold climate and health negotiations on equal footing.
The Rockefeller Foundation−Lancet Commission, for instance, deﬁnes
planetary health as “the health of human civilizations and the natural
ecosystem on which they depend” [41]. In effect, the Commission
posits that planetary health goes beyond examining the impacts of
environmental change on human health and surveys the political,
economic, and social systems that govern and inﬂuence those effects
[41]. Similarly, some authors have suggested that addressing climate
threats can broaden the scope for social and economic co-beneﬁts
[7,40]. This they say, can be achieved through mitigation policies that
foster climate resilient development while promoting positive social
and health equity outcomes across diverse socioeconomic settings.
To give an example, in 2019 the renewable energy sector contributed
to the creation of nearly 12 million jobs globally, which assisted gov-
ernments in halving emissions while generating social and economic
beneﬁts [42]. To protect and improve human health through inclu-
sive and just transition measures, the World Health Organization
(WHO) recommends that transition planning and health impact
assessments should be undertaken jointly. The importance of apply-
ing rigorous multidisciplinary science and technical evidence is fur-
ther emphasized in climate dialogues, calling upon the WIM and
other bodies to develop indicators to measure loss and damage and
consider both economic and non-economic losses [37].
5.2. Addressing challenges in sustaining post-disaster healthcare
Equally relevant are post-disaster initiatives aimed at protecting
the long-term health and well-being of affected populations. While
health equity is crucial for reducing the health impacts of climate dis-
asters, few studies have explored the long-lasting effects of disasters
on at-risk communities and vulnerable groups. In fact, many studies
either lack the pre-disaster data needed to assess the health out-
comes of disasters, or simply monitor local survivors transiently fol-
lowing a hazardous event, often overlooking their long-term health
effects [43]. For instance, research indicates that while the prevalence
of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is likely to decrease over
time in the general population, the impacts of trauma among high-
risk groups such as low-income minorities, mental health patients, or
speciﬁc ethnic groups, may persist [44]. To lessen the impacts of cli-
mate disaster on long-term disease burden or mortality, it is vital to
prioritize primary prevention and anticipatory action of exposure to
climate shocks. This entails investing in climate resilience, imple-
menting comprehensive risk management solutions and deploying
risk ﬁnance mechanisms [43]. Additionally, eliminating barriers to
emergency response such as ensuring timely evacuation in the event
of a major disaster, including accessible and continuous post-disaster
healthcare, remains critical [43]. According to the IPCC, “adaptation
and mitigation actions that prioritize equity, social justice, climate
justice, rights-based approaches, and inclusivity, lead to more sus-
tainable outcomes, reduce trade-offs, support transformative change,
advance climate resilient development”, and could enhance co-bene-
ﬁts for health and well-being [1].
5.3. Intersectionality in the context of climate change and health
Understanding intersectionality in the context of climate change
and health is foundational for creating inclusive and effective adapta-
tion, mitigation and loss and damage strategies that respond to the
speciﬁc needs and priorities of diverse communities. The intersec-
tionality of gender, class, ethnicity, and other demographic factors
merits careful consideration, particularly in climate vulnerable, low
resource settings. Intersectionality, which creates interacting and
compounding forms of discrimination that exacerbate inequity and
perpetuate injustice, requires comprehensive analysis and targeted
interventions to mitigate adverse effects on vulnerable groups
[13,45,46]. To give an example, a case study examining local climate
responses in Bangladesh highlighted the experiences of women who
encountered a wide range of non-economic losses and damages,
especially to their mental and physical health [47]. Other factors,
such as limited access to culturally appropriate foods and challenges
performing religious rituals due to incurred losses and damages, fur-
ther exacerbated the plight of these women. According to ﬁndings,
their vulnerability stemmed from household responsibilities and
high exposure to saline water, resulting in skin disease and gyneco-
logical issues. Given that response mechanisms entail additional
costs, such solutions would impose additional ﬁnancial strain on an
already economically vulnerable populace. Actions aimed at address-
ing loss and damage could therefore alleviate this monetary burden
by providing ﬁnancial assistance to strengthen local responses [47].
6. Conclusion
This perspective paper has considered the barriers in political
agenda setting, in which health considerations have been largely
siloed, thus diminishing the cross-sectoral signiﬁcance of health pri-
orities [9]. Fragmented approaches among development actors in
responding to diverse hazard types, together with practices that
place little emphasis on anticipatory action and primary prevention,
has hampered countries’ capacities to realize public health gains [48].
From a global health perspective, health actors could beneﬁt from
integrating a thorough analysis of the political economy of health
and ecology. This would lead to a better understanding of post-
growth principles critical for advancing planetary health and avoid
reinforcing capitalist logic [49]. According to van Woerden et al., this
approach would also propel the planetary health ﬁeld towards priori-
tizing the interconnectedness of the environment, the economy, and
health while incorporating the principles of ecological economics
(i.e., equitable balance of human needs within planetary boundaries)
[49]. Broader expected development gains include employment crea-
tion in various sectors capable of fostering a net-zero economy across
energy, housing, recycling, and food systems [40], taking into consid-
eration social-ecological and public health co-beneﬁts.
Identifying both the direct and indirect exposure pathways of cli-
mate threats and their impacts on health and well-being also helps
factor in complex interactions and feedback loops between human
and natural systems and is key for designing effective evidence-based
adaptation, mitigation, and loss and damage action plans and policies

[50]. Moreover, approaches that account for the complex ethical,
social, and cultural variances, while highlighting equity, rights-based
approaches and inclusivity have the potential to lower trade-offs.
They can also facilitate transformative change; enhance resilience of
health systems to shocks; accelerate climate resilient development;
and positively shape the decisions that govern adaptation, mitigation
and loss and damage [1,3,7]. Ultimately, human health hinges on
planetary health, highlighting the need to recognize, assess, and pri-
oritize a systems approach at all levels of economic, environmental,
climate and public health governance.
