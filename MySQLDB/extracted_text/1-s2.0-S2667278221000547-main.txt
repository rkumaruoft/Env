Introduction: Climate change is impacting the life, health, and security of people worldwide with poor com-
munities and displaced populations at particular risk due to lack of awareness and mitigation plans. The
Tigray war in Ethiopia has forced thousands of refugees to ﬂee and seek safety and shelter in Sudan.
Methods: We investigated the impacts of climate change on this displaced population with a focus on the
conditions experienced by Ethiopian humanitarian refugees who ﬂed from the Tigray war in Ethiopia and
settled in the Gedaref state, East Sudan. We analyzed data regarding the displaced population and climate-
related weather effects in Sudan.
Results: Sudan is currently hosting over 63 thousand Ethiopian refugees who arrived between November
2020 and April 2021. These refugees were exposed to severe weather conditions including heavy rains,
strong storms, severe ﬂoods, and heat waves which resulted in over 50% loss of their shelters and belongings,
and around two thousand latrines were destroyed. Furthermore, an outbreak of Hepatitis E virus is ongoing
among refugees with nearly one thousand cases reported. Massive and routine vaccination campaigns were
launched to avoid the spread of locally transmitted diseases among the refugees including COVID-19, polio,
cholera, and measles.
Conclusion: The living conditions and lack of reliability of essential services among the displaced populations
are increasing their vulnerability to the negative impacts of climate change on their life, health, and security.
We recommend incorporating a mitigation and adaptation plan to climate change into humanitarian
response plan and strategies, including raising awareness and training, in order to prepare a well-developed
contingency plan that takes these factors into account.

1. Introduction
Sudan is one of the countries that has suffered greatly from the
effects of climate change, highlighted by unanticipated severe
weather events including droughts, ﬂooding, rainstorms, and dust
storms [1]. The phenomenon of climate change has been observed
extensively in Sudan with serious impacts on vulnerable communi-
ties [2,3]. These impacts include famine resulting from drought in
western Sudan that is expected to reoccur [1,2]. Also, climate change
is increasing the emergence of diseases and shifting their burden [4
−6]. A recent study predicts a substantial increase in rainfall in the
coastal and subcoastal region of East Africa including Eastern Sudan
(Red Sea, Kassala, and Gedaref states) [7]. In 2020, heavy rains and
massive ﬂooding affected most of the country and over 170,000 indi-
viduals including refugees from South Sudan, Internally Displace Per-
sons (IDPs) and other vulnerable people suffered greatly and needed
emergency assistance [8]. Previous massive ﬂooding and heavy rains
in 2019 affected more than 190,000 individuals and totally or par-
tially destroyed over 34,000 houses throughout Sudan [9]. This pro-
duced extreme shortage in health and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene
(WASH) services [9].
According to the African Union Peace and Security Council (AU
PSC), climate change has drastic effects on peace, security and stabil-
ity in Africa. Moreover, the AU PSC has identiﬁed Sudan as a hotspot
for climate change effects [10]. Previous studies implemented by dif-
ferent United Nations (UN) agencies highlight the unpredictable
weather events in Sudan due to climatic change in the area, which in
turn affects human health, economic stability, and security in the
region [11]. Additionally, Sudan is hosting over 1.1 million refugees,

mainly from South Sudan, Central African Republic, Eritrea, Ethiopia,
Yemen, Chad, and Syrian Arab Republic [12,13].
We hypothesisized that the effects of climate change would exac-
erbate challenges to the health, security, and welfare of displaced
populations, and our research focused on the experience of the Ethio-
pian humanitarian refugees who are escaping from the Tigray war in
Ethiopia to seek refuge and safety in Sudan. We explored the addi-
tional hazards of unpredictable and extreme weather events on their
circumstances and health outcomes.
2. Material and methods
Data about extreme weather events and their impacts on the health,
security, and living conditions of Ethiopian’s humanitarian refu-
gees who recently arrived in Sudan toescape the Tigray war in
Ethiopia were obtained from internal reports and publicly avail-
able dashboards of the Sudan Ministry of Health and UN Agencies,
respectively. Additional data were extracted from the ﬁeld-mis-
sions’ reports after visiting refugee camps following extreme
weather events. However, no identiﬁable personal data were col-
lected or used.
3. Results
3.1. Impacts of climate change on the local Sudanese communities
During the past ﬁve years, Sudanese communities witnessed sev-
eral severe weather events including drought, storms, heavy rains
and ﬂooding. The frequency of these severe weather events is escalat-
ing rapidly. In 2009, 2012 and 2015, some regions of Sudan have suf-
fered from mild to short droughts. However, by early 2020, around
9.3 million individuals in Sudan needed humanitarian assistance
including 6.2 million who suffered food insecurity, and 3.3 million
who were malnourished [12]. Droughts, ﬂoods, insecurity, and over-
all poverty have displaced over 3 million individuals throughout
Sudan. Also, by the middle of 2020, more than 70,000 vulnerable
families (around 355,000 individuals) needed emergency support to
overcome the consequences of severe ﬂooding that wiped out live-
stock and crops from their farms [14,15]. These families were sup-
ported with critical livelihood aid (agriculture and livestock-based)
to mitigate the devastating impacts of ﬂooding and the following
drought, because this unprecedented ﬂooding worsened the vulner-
abilities of poor communities and intensiﬁed their food insecurity,
malnutrition and impoverishment [15]. In 2015, 44 and 102 cases of
heatstroke and 32 and 12 related deaths were reported from North-
ern and Red Sea States, respectively. Table 1 below highlights the
number of individuals, houses, and facilities that were affected by the
severe weather events, namely heavy rains and ﬂoods throughout
Sudan per year between 2018 and August 2021. These ﬁgures repre-
sent ofﬁcial reports; however, several thousands of affected people in
remote areas where there is no UN agency operating, such as in
Northern and River Nile States, might not have been included in these
reports [16].
3.2. Recent history of health impacts of climate change among Sudanese
communities
During recent years the intensity and magnitude of disease out-
breaks in Sudan have increased remarkably. Growing evidence sug-
gest that such changes in the burden and distribution of diseases can
be attributed to climate change [4,5]. Several diseases emerged and/
or re-emerged in the form of outbreaks among displaced populations
in Sudan in association with climate change including the emergence
of dengue, West Nile virus, and Crimean−Congo haemorrhagic fever
(CCHF) among refugees and IDPs in Darfur [17−19]. The occurrence
of many other outbreaks also was inﬂuenced by climate change
including the malaria epidemic among IDPs and nomads in South
Kordofan [20], Rift valley fever (RVF) among nomads in River Nile
and Gedaref states [6,21], and Chikungunya among refugees, nomads,
IDPs and local communities throughout the country [5]. The heavy
rains and ﬂoods in 2019 directly inﬂuenced a cholera outbreak
among nomads and IDPs in Blue Nile and Sennar states through the
destruction of latrines leading to the contamination of open sources
of drinking water. Fig. 1 shows some of the destroyed shelters and
latrines.
Further details about the intensity and distribution of the major
outbreaks of diseases in Sudan during the recent 12 years, with case
fatality rates (CFR), are presented in Table 2.
3.3. Inﬂux of Ethiopian Refugees to Sudan
Shortly after a ﬂare-up of the Tigray war in Ethiopia in November
2020, an inﬂux of Ethiopian refugees started arriving in Eastern
Sudan through the open borders with the Kassala and Gedaref states.
The Sudanese government, United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR), and their partners implemented a comprehensive
risk analysis for the situation and co-developed an Inter-Agency Ref-
ugee Emergency Response Plan for the Ethiopian inﬂux by late
November
2020
[22].
This
Inter-Agency
Refugee
Emergency
Response Plan considered potential risk factors including security,
socioeconomic, and logistics related to both the refugees and hosting
community. Based on risk analysis recommendations, it was decided
to establish four humanitarian camps to host the arriving refugees.
Two temporary settlements were established in Hamdayet and Vil-
lage 8 and another two long-term humanitarian camps were estab-
lished in Um Rakuba and Tunaydbah [22].
The report of the UNHCR documented that a total of 63,110 Ethio-
pian refugees had arrived in Sudan by April 30, 2021, escaping the
Tigray war that ﬂared up early November 2020 [23]. The Tigray
region, where the armed conﬂict currently is taking place, is in the
Ethiopian side of borders with Eritrea and Sudan. Since the war
started, the population living in and nearby that region has been
forced to ﬂee the area in search for security and food. This massive
human population displacement resulted in most of the region’s pop-
ulation seeking refuge in Sudan for safety, shelter, and food. Sudan
hosts the largest population of refugees in Africa from several coun-
tries, including the neighbouring African countries of Central African
Republic, Chad, Eritrea, and Ethiopia, in addition to the armed-con-
ﬂict’s escapees from the Arabian Peninsula, namely Syria and Yemen
who sought safety in Sudan[24].
While some of the refugees have been integrated in the local com-
munity, others are living in humanitarian camps set closest to their
country of origin, anticipating the improvement of the situation in
their respective country to enable a return home. Due to several fac-
tors, the sub-Saharan African governments tend to host refugees in
spatially segregated sites instead of urban settings. These factors
include preventing the integration of the refugees into the host com-
munity, maintaining social and ethnic structures, reducing the bur-
den of limited resources, and minimizing the national security risk.

More importantly, the limited resources and economic capacity of
sub-Saharan African governments force them to delegate the respon-
sibility of meeting refugees’ needs to the international humanitarian
community, including the relevant UN agencies such as UNHCR and
other humanitarian and emergency relief donors [25].
3.4. The situation of Ethiopian’s Tigray War Refugees in Sudan
At the beginning of the armed conﬂict in the Tigray region in
Ethiopia on November 4, 2020, thousands of Ethiopian refugees ﬂed
the region to escape the war and sought shelter, food, and security in
Sudan. Immediately, the UN agencies established the Inter-Agency
Ethiopian Refugee Emergency Response Plan to respond to this emer-
gency. Humanitarian settlements were established in the Gedaref
state, the hosting community for the massive inﬂux of refugees in the
area. Accordingly, three major humanitarian camps were created,
namely Village 8, Tunaydbah, and Um Rakouba with a temporary
settlement at Hamdayet as an international entry point. As of May
18th, 2021, these settings hosted about 63,000 refugees in total, dis-
tributed with 20,600 refugees in Tunaydbah and a similar number in
Um Rakouba, and 18,700 refugees who are brieﬂy hosted in Ham-
dayet, while only around 2500 are settled in Village 8. Twenty-three
UN agencies and international and national non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) are working in these humanitarian camps pro-
viding all essential services to the refugees, including but not limited
to shelter, food, health and WASH services, and education [24].
3.5. The major public health risks in the area
East Sudan, where the humanitarian camps that host the Ethio-
pian refugees are located, is endemic with several infectious diseases,
including major vector-borne diseases like malaria [20], onchocercia-
sis [26], leishmaniasis [27], and a wide range of arboviral diseases
[28]. Interestingly, there has been a shift in these diseases’ burden

and transmission in the country [5,6]. Recent studies have shown that
this change in the diseases’ epidemiology is associated with actual
and predicted climate change in the area [5]. Also, the epidemiology
of the vector-borne diseases in the area might have transformed due
to alterations in herd immunity that occurred due to the arrival of
thousands of refugees with different previous exposures and disease
susceptibilities. Moreover, many refugees brought their domestic ani-
mals with them which also could serve as alternative hosts to the
locally circulating infections. To mitigate this public health risk in
coordination with the Sudan Ministry of Health, health partners
including different agencies of the United Nations and other interna-
tional and national NGOs have deployed vector control interventions
and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) activities [24]. Further-
more, in addition to providing routine immunization services to all
eligible children among the refugees, health partners also have
implemented mass-vaccination campaigns for preventing vaccine-
preventable diseases, namely cholera, polio, and yellow fever among
the refugees and hosting communities. Details of the total targeted
population and ﬁnal coverage of these campaigns are further shown
in Table 3.
These vaccination campaigns were prompted by lessons learned
from a previous experience with health impacts of climate change,
namely ﬂooding and heavy rains that occurred throughout Sudan in
2019 [9]. The percentage of polio vaccine coverage in Tunaydbah has
exceeded 100% because of the substantial increase in newly arrived
children during the implementation of vaccination campaign in com-
parison with estimated target number during the planning (Table 3).
More importantly, locating the sources of drinking water nearby
the overﬂowing and abandoned latrines presents a serious threat for
the transmission of sanitation, hygiene, and WASH-related infections
such as cholera and hepatitis E (Fig. 2). There is evidence of an out-
break of hepatitis E currently developing among the Ethiopian refu-
gees in these camps, with around one thousand cases conﬁrmed so
far [29].
3.6. Direct and indirect effects of climate change on refugees in the
humanitarian camps
Although the usual rainy season in the Gedaref state is between
August and October [30], heavy rainfalls, windstorms, and ﬂooding
occurred in the area in early May 2021. According to the Ministry of
Health and UNHCR reports, these uncommon extreme weather
events destroyed about 1500 family shelters, 1231 latrines, and
ﬂooded the settlement area (Fig. 3) [24]. Vehicle transportation
through the ﬂooded muddy soil was very challenging and resulted in
limiting the response of the humanitarian teams and their capacity to
deliver essential needs from the storage center. This situation was
particularly challenging for the medical supplies as the need for them
was dramatically increased; e.g. ﬁrst aid kits for snake bites and scor-
pion stings which are common, as well as other medical supplies for
injuries and medical emergencies. Also, an urgent need to re-supply
refugees with food occurred as most of their food was either washed
out or ruined by the ﬂood and rainy storms. Additionally, the com-
plete or partial destruction of over 1200 latrines greatly impacted the
waste management and reduced the overall hygiene in the area,
increasing the risk of vector-borne, food-borne, poverty-related, and
WASH-related diseases in the humanitarian settlements [11]. Several
recovery measures were implemented by health and humanitarian
partners in response to this emergency, including the distribution of
relief items such as prepared food, sleeping mats, blankets, ﬁrst aid
kits, and other essential materials. These response activities were
even further challenged by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic which
required additional prevention and control measures including main-
taining social distance whenever possible, wearing proper personal
protection equipment, and using effective disinfectants, particularly
because the Gedaref state is one of the worst states in Sudan for
COVID-19 case fatality rates [31]. Unfortunately, ﬂooding and storms
destroyed solar panels installed by the humanitarian UN agencies,
which were the primary sources of power for cooking and light. This

affected most of the community and limited their activities, particu-
larly during the night [11]. Furthermore, in June 2021 over 16,000
Ethiopian refugees in Um Rakuba and Tunaydbah were affected
when severe rainstorms destroyed their shelters and service facilities
resulting in a loss of food, medications and other essential belong-
ings, and caused additional mental stress [32]. Approximately 40% of
families lost their tent or family shelter to the heavy rains, strong
winds, and hailstorms, and several service stations which were the
source of drinking water and latrines were destroyed [32]. These
swamped latrines increase the risk of WASH and sanitation related
diseases [33].
Moreover, the camps’ area has witnessed heat waves during
which the temperature reached up 45 °C [11]. Although no health
issues related to the heat wave were reported, the refugees might
have suffered from social impacts of this extreme heat due to their
lack of ability to practice normal social activities and a need to spend
long amounts of time inside crowded tents so as to avoid direct expo-
sure to the sun and prevent heat stroke.
As would be expected, the hosting communities for the Ethiopian
refugees in Gedaref state also were negatively impacted by these
extreme weather events. Fig. 4 shows the destruction of houses and
service facilities, broken and/blocked roads, and ﬂooded villages
(Fig. 4). Local communities also have suffered severely from the inter-
ruption of crucial services including healthcare and education due to
ﬂooded facilities. Additionally, broken bridges and blocked roads lim-
ited the delivery of essential goods such as food and medical sup-
plies.
4. Discussion
Unless a well-designed mitigation and adaptation plan for the
effects of climate change is developed and implemented to reduce
the negative impacts on both the refugees and hosting community, a
dire situation will ensue in the Gedaref and neighboring states [2,3].
In addition to the health impacts, other effects of climate change
such as decreased productivity of agricultural and livestock productss
due to the direct and indirect effects of drought, heavy rains, heat
waves, and ﬂooding will occur. This in turn can result in severe fam-
ine [2,3]. Therefore, further studies and in-depth analysis are war-
ranted
to
generate
information
to
mitigate
various
possible
scenarios. Such studies should consider the integration, coordination,
and timely sharing of information between the different stakeholders
of the One Health strategy to evaluate and reduce the effects of cli-
mate change on the environment, and the populations of humans,
animals and diseases vectors [34,35]. Additionally, experience gained
from recent events can help improve the policy, planning, and imple-
mentation of humanitarian responses among refugees, IDPs, and
other vulnerable communities at a global scale [36]. A major lesson at
the planning level is to establish humanitarian camps in geographical
locations similar to the hosting community whenever possible (e.g.
avoiding locating refugees on low-lands where the water of heavy
rains might collect). Furthermore, it would be appropriate to sur-
round humanitarian camps with wind-shelters to provide protection
from storms [32]. Moreover, although there is often a shortage of vac-
cines in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) where
86% of global refugees are hosted, vaccinating refugees is a good
strategy both to protect the hosting community and the refugees
[37].
In conclusion, due to severe weather events including heavy rains,
storms, and ﬂooding, almost 50% of the Ethiopian refugees in the Um
Rakuba and Tunaydbah humanitarian camps in the Gedaref state lost
their shelters, belongings, and essential service stations exposing

them to serious health threats including WASH-related infections.
Moreover, the sudden lack of shelter, exposure to extreme weather
conditions, loss of food and their limited personal belongings and
increased health risks all challenged the war-terriﬁed Tigray commu-
nity refugees and increased their mental stress. Therefore, in addition
to massive resource mobilization from the international community
to meet the urgent and essential needs of the Ethiopian refugees in
Sudan, mental-health support must be provided to help these indi-
viduals survive the extreme suffering and negative experiences they
endured and allow them to rehabilitate and prepare to resume a nor-
mal life.
Our research, while focused on Sudan, can also be viewed as a har-
binger for future potential situations which can occur in a world
experiencing the impacts of climate change. Our assessment empha-
sizes the need for adaptation and mitigation plans for climate change
to be incorporated in humanitarian response plans. Displaced popu-
lations, particularly in humanitarian settings, need to be afforded the
beneﬁts of well-developed contingency plans to reduce the potential
impacts of climate change, and increased attention must be paid to
this growing concern.
