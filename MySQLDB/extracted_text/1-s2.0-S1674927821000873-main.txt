Abstract
With the increasing awareness of the risks and impacts of climate change, scholars tend to pay more attention to the applications of in-
dicators, which access the effectiveness of climate change adaptation. This study aims to evaluate the overall progress of climate change
adaptation in China during 2010e2018 in a quantitative manner. The Index for Climate Change Adaptation in China (ICCAC) has been thus
developed by adopting the analytic hierarchy process weighting and expert scoring method. Namely, ICCAC is composed of national climate
change impacts, adaptation actions in key sectors, adaptation progress in key sectors, and the national adaptation policy framework. Overall, the
ICCAC and its four sub-indexes increased signiﬁcantly from 2010 to 2018, on a yearly-basis. Each sub-index implied that the socio-economic
impacts caused by climate change in China have been alleviated gradually; speciﬁcally, the mainstream endeavor of key sectors has witnessed
remarkable progress, however, it is worth noting that the gap between individual adaptation actions and policies still exists; the implementation
effect of policies in key sectors is not as afﬂuent as that of actions; the current adaptation endeavor in key areas is still closely related to the
mainstream business of corresponding competent ministries rather than adaptation-aimed actions; the national adaptation policy framework has
been primarily formed, but there are still some deﬁciencies. As a result, the gap in China's adaptation process could be mainly manifested in the
following ﬁve aspects: i) adaptation effectiveness assessment in forestry and urban infrastructure is urgently needed; ii) policies in marine and
water resources sectors need structural reforms; iii) evaluation criteria for national adaptation are not necessarily sufﬁcient; iv) the improvement
of adaptive management efﬁciency has stagnated recently; and v) the adaptation works of relevant Ministries should be coordinated and put
forward the corresponding strategies. Finally, this study presents four proposals: conducting an evaluation of adaptation actions in all key sectors,
integrating climate change impacts into sectoral planning decisions, launching concrete action plans for adaptation, establishing a complete
policy framework on adaptation.
Keywords: Climate change; Adaptation; Index; Evaluation; Risk assessment; Policy recommendation
1. Introduction
Nowadays, climate change, characterized by global warm-
ing, has evolved into one of the most devastating crises for the
global environment and global sustainable development, and
further posed grave threats to social and economic activities of
humanity (IPCC, 2018; Yan et al., 2016). The international
community has paid increasing attention to climate change and
taken active countermeasures, making adaptation now one of
the core concepts in global change science (Bates et al., 2014;
Cutter et al., 2008; Zhao, 2020).
Since 2007, the Chinese government has formulated and
implemented a series of policies on climate change adaptation
(Marco et al., 2011), which propel the burgeoning of practices
and research on climate change adaptation. In terms of policy
evaluation, Peng et al. (2015) and Zhang et al. (2015b)
reviewed China's policies on climate change adaptation and
argued that although China's adaptation policies have been
well promoted and deployed, most of them lack supervision

and evaluation. Zhang and Lin (2018) analyzed China's
climate change response system with reference to climate
change policies from 2007 to 2016, drawing conclusion that
there are still some drawbacks in China's climate change
adaptation policies, such as insufﬁcient supervision on adap-
tation policies and weak evaluation of adaptation effects. The
Third National Assessment Report on Climate Change brieﬂy
evaluated the strategic research and key tasks of adaptation to
climate change (PCTNARCC, 2015). China's Policies and
Actions for Addressing Climate Change over the years pro-
vided more insights into China's policies and actions for
addressing climate change since 2008. However, the above
studies and reports failed to review and evaluate China's
climate change adaptation policies and actions with quantita-
tive assessment tools or methods, thus unable to accurately
identify and evaluate the annual and sub-regional progress in
climate change adaptation.
Emerging attention has been paid to indicator application
for evaluating adaptation success (Arnott et al., 2016). Liter-
ature evaluated the adaptation progress using a single or
comprehensive index and through model simulation from so-
cial, natural, and economic dimensions based on the qualita-
tive description (Feng and Chao, 2020; Liu et al., 2019a; Wu,
2019). For example, Chen et al. (2011) selected four systems
of economy, agriculture, society, as well as resources and
environment to be the evaluation subjects, established an index
system for the regional climate system, and evaluate the
climate change adaptation of Xianyang city. Zhu et al. (2020)
selected 12 evaluation indicators categorized into resource and
environment level, economic support capacity, social devel-
opment level, and response and governance capability, upon
which developed an evaluation system for climate change
adaptation in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei province. Liu (2015)
and Zhang et al. (2015a) framed an evaluation system of
climate change adaptation for the water resources system in
Beijing, with water supply, water demand, and water quality as
three dimensions. Different studies have laid different em-
phases on the selection of adaptation indicators in consider-
ation of varying research objects, contents, and goals. These
studies either structure an evaluation index system for a city or
region or focus on a speciﬁc research ﬁeld. In general, pre-
vious researches attached great importance to impact in-
dicators related to adaptation rather than its physical effect or
policies and actions, qualitative evaluation of policies and
actions is far more than quantitative evaluation as well. Few
studies explore establishing a national adaptation evaluation
index based on China's national conditions (Yang et al., 2020).
Most studies focus on certain sectors or speciﬁc ﬁelds, losing
sight of the overall national progress and the inter-sector
comparison Zhang et al. (2015b).
We believe that quantitative measures would be a more
accurate and straight-forward presentation than qualitative
analysis. Grounded on the existing literature, this study eval-
uates the progress of the Chinese government's adaptation to
climate change in a quantitative way. Apart from adaptation
actions and achievements in key areas, the policy objectives,
management systems, and supporting mechanisms for climate
change adaptation are also important parameters, especially
for the national level. Therefore, this study introduces them to
the evaluation system and gives them considerable weight to
carry out a preliminary evaluation that may guide the policy
practice in the next stage. Some of the policy indicators are
highly correlative with the progress in national adaptation but
are difﬁcult to be fully quantiﬁed. Considering that the ana-
lytic hierarchy process method can provide a quantitative basis
for analysis and decision-making by establishing a hierarchical
structure of problems and pairwise comparison judgment
matrix, it is applicable to resolve difﬁcult decisions with its
hierarchical evaluation indicators and quantitative description
of target value. Therefore, the analytic hierarchy process
method is used to construct the evaluation system and deter-
mine the weight of indicators. This study intends to provide a
quantitative assessment tool for the progress assessment,
drawbacks identiﬁcation and recommendations proposal of
national adaptation.
2. Data and methodology
2.1. Data source
Data and information for index evaluation from 2010 to
2018 are collected and sorted out mainly from China's Sta-
tistical Yearbooks (2011e2019) and China's Policies and
Actions for Addressing Climate Change (2011e2019). Some
data are gathered from other sources, including, but not
limited to Statistic Bulletin on China Water Activities,
Financial Yearbook of China, Water Resources Bulletin, China
Urban-Rural
Construction
Statistical
Yearbook,
Annual
Development Report of China Electric Power Industry, China
Transportation
Statistical
Yearbook
and
Social
Service
Development Statistical Bulletin. More information on climate
change adaptation has been collated extensively from the
above sources for support and interpretation.
2.2. Establishing the index for climate change
adaptation in China (ICCAC)
The index system should abide by the following four
principles:
(1) Scientiﬁcity and operability. Indicators must be in line
with the basic issue proposed by UNFCCC, the Paris
Agreement, and domestic demand on climate change
adaptation while ensuring a clear conception and stan-
dard method.
(2) Representativeness and independence. Priority should be
given to indicators that can accurately represent the
connotation of the indicator framework while keeping
the independence of all indicators as far as possible.
(3) Policy orientation and guidance. Indicators selected
should fully reﬂect the policy requirements of national
climate change adaptation, while giving play to the
724
FU L. et al. / Advances in Climate Change Research 12 (2021) 723e733
guiding role of climate change adaptation territory and
department.
(4) Data credibility and availability. Ofﬁcial documents
such as China Statistical Yearbook, and China's Policies
and Actions for Addressing Climate Change, will be
taken as the main data sources.
The major process of developing ICCAC is as follows.
First, based on existing literature (Chen et al., 2015; Wu, 2019;
Yang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2015a; Arnott et al., 2016) and
the existing best knowledge drawn from experts' judgment,
ICCAC is deﬁned from four aspects: climate change impacts,
adaptation actions in key sectors, adaptation progress in key
sectors, and adaptation policy framework. Second, after
comprehensively considering the connotation, data quality,
availability of indicators, and current policy practices on
climate change adaptation in China, all 43 indicators are
developed accordingly. Third, the analytic hierarchy process
method is introduced to determine the weighting of each in-
dicator and aspect. The analytic hierarchy process method is a
widely
used
decision-making
method
that
decomposes
decision-making related elements into objectives, criteria,
schemes, etc. For both qualitative and quantitative analysis.
Through judgment matrix and pairwise comparison, the ana-
lytic hierarchy process method could be used to determine
comparative sequencing of importance of each indicator for
the purpose of indicator screening and weight conﬁrmation.
The hierarchical structure of ICCAC consists of three layers:
target layer, criterion layer, and indicator layer. Then, a
judgment matrix on a scale from 1 to 9 is created, distributed
to, and then gathered from several experts in different sectors.
For the incomplete experts' judgment matrix, the average value
of other experts' evaluation levels is used to complement the
incomplete items. For the experts’ judgment matrix that fails
the consistency test, automatic adjustment is operated using
YAAHP software. After that, the expert assessment results are
integrated via the expert weights using weighted arithmetic
average in YAAHP software. Last, the weights of each indi-
cator and sub-index are obtained.
The 0e1 standardized method based on 2010 is also
applied for dimensionless processing and scoring. For
positive indexes, the equation should be Ui;n ¼
Ai;nMinAi;n
MaxAi;nMinAi;n,
and
for
negative
indexes,
it
is

as

MaxAi;nMinAi;n, in which Ui,n represents the score of the i-th
standardized evaluation index in the n-th year and Ai,n
represents the initial data of the i-th evaluation index in the
n-th year. Finally, the weighted sum of Ui,n is used to get the
ICCAC evaluation result of the n-th year, that is, ICCACn ¼

climate change adaptation index of the n-th year, Ui,n

represents the index score of the i-th evaluation index in the
n-th year, and NWi represents the weight of the i-th national
evaluation index. Evaluation methods of the 16 qualitative
indicators are as follows. Indicators concerning government
action are scored according to China's Policies and Actions
for Addressing Climate Change over the years, covering A5
to A11. A33 and A37 are scored based on existing policies
and their implementation. A34, A36, A38, A39 and A40 are
scored based on the work carried out by relevant de-
partments, while higher scores will be particularly given to
comprehensive work. A35 and A42 are scored considering
the current framework of the management system and new
initiatives of each year.
The consistency test result of ICCAC is 0.034 (<0.1),
indicating that the consistency test has been passed. Eventu-
ally, the ICCAC of 2010e2018 is obtained.
3. Results and analysis
3.1. Indicator system and weights
Minor adjustments have been made according to literature
review to avoid subjective deviation. Table 1 illustrates the
framework and weighting of ICCAC. Given that the consis-
tency test result is 0.034 (<0.1), the consistency test is reck-
oned as passed.
3.2. Overall progress of climate change adaptation in
China
The overall progress of ICCAC is marked using sequential
data from 2010 to 2018 based on the above evaluation system.
It shows that ICCAC rises year by year with an average annual
growth rate of 14.9% (Table 2), which clearly mirrors China's
progress in climate change adaptation. The great efforts that
China has made in climate change adaptation led to an upward
trend of all sub-indexes to varying degrees, substantially
elevating the national capacity to adapt. National climate
change impacts (S1, with an average annual growth rate of
20.9%, the same below) and adaptation progress in key sectors
(S2, 23.7%) register the highest annual growth rate, yet a 2010
score of nearly zero indicates the signiﬁcant remediation on
previous work. Remarkable annual growth rate was not
observed in adaptation actions in key sectors (S3, 8.4%) and
adaptation policy framework (S4, 10.3%), implying that sec-
toral actions are neither adequate nor up to expectation.
Therefore, it is in urgent need to accelerate the completion of
policy and mechanism system.
3.3. National climate change impacts
Sub-index S1 displays a ﬂuctuating upward trend from
2010 to 2018, suggesting that negative impacts of climate
change on socio-economy have been gradually mitigated in
China. Two distinct ﬂuctuations of sub-index S1 occurred in
2013 and 2016 when the natural calamity took place, for
instance, the earthquake in Yushu and the heavy mountain
torrents and debris ﬂow in Zhouqu in 2010. The results of S1
demonstrate that the number of emergent eco-environmental
occurrences, the area affected by natural disasters, the pro-
portion of direct economic losses induced by natural disasters
to GDP, and the proportion of casualties caused by natural
disasters
have
been
ameliorated,
with
average
annual
improvement rates as 4.8%, 74.9%, 77.8%, and 67.5%,
respectively. The overall downward trend of emergent eco-
environmental occurrences in China from 2010 to 2018 il-
lustrates that eco-environmental threats have been controlled
to a certain extent (Yang et al., 2017). Despite that the climate
change impacts China undergoes are increasing (PCTNARCC,
2015), the degree of damage has decreased. This may be
ascribed to the promulgation of national emergency manage-
ment policies, represented by Measures for the Management
of Emergency Plans1 and National Environmental Emergency
Plan,2 etc. In general, viewing from the perspective of damage
and loss reduction, the capacity to adapt has been evidently
improved in China (Zhao et al., 2014).
3.4. Actions and progress in key sectors
Regarding the strong relationship between S2 and S3, this
study combines the calculation results of the two. Since 2010,
S2 and S3 have been distinctly increasing with annual growth
rates of 8.4% and 23.7% respectively, reﬂecting apparent
improvements. Nevertheless, the overall trend of A16 has been
declining rather than rising since 2013, and the adaptation in
the ﬁelds of water resources, marine sector, and public health
needs to be further advanced.
3.4.1. Agricultural sector
Agriculture is one of the most vulnerable sectors in terms of
adaptation (Tao et al., 2011). The annual growth rates of ac-
tions taken and progress made in the ﬁeld of agriculture are
14.7% and 75.0%, with respective scoring rates as 61.7% and
66.7% in 2018, noting that China has carried out persistent
adaptation for agriculture and achieved certain harvest. China

FU L. et al. / Advances in Climate Change Research 12 (2021) 723e733
has formulated a series of policies and regulations to facilitate
the adaptation of agriculture, with the focus on water con
servancy, water resources utilization of agriculture, etc. Con-
cerning implementation effects, since 2010, all three indicators
of agriculture have been obviously improved, each with
average annual growth rates of 60.5%, 77.8% and 77.8%, as
well as scoring rates all up to 100%. The signiﬁcantly
enhanced agricultural
adaptation
can
be manifested
by
improved soil water usage efﬁciency, soil erosion reduction,
capacity-building of fertilizer conservation, etc.
3.4.2. Forestry and ecosystems
In respect of policy action, China has actively studied and
formulated policies and measures on climate change adapta-
tion to ensure the safety of forestry ecosystems. National
Forestry and Grassland Administration has issued various
action plans, covering forestry, grassland, wetland, and other
key areas, to guide forestry to adapt to climate change and
strengthen ecosystem preservation. The index layout that the
average annual growth rates of adaptation actions and progress
in forestry are 19.6% and 2.3%, with respective scoring rates
as 100% and 49.7% in 2018, signifying that massive forestry
adaptation actions have been taken but achieved limited suc-
cess. As for policy implementation effects, the indexes of
forest pest control, afforestation area completed by grain for
green projects, and newly increased desertiﬁcation control
area, have kept an upward trend since 2010. However, the
former two witnessed an evident decline in 2017/2018. Results
demonstrate that China's forestry adaptation has been gradu-
ally enhanced, as desertiﬁcation land control projects and
grain for green projects have engendered tangible beneﬁts, and
the forest pest control has made huge progress. However, it is
noteworthy that gaps still exist within individual indicators.
3.4.3. Water resources sector
For policy actions, China has issued policy documents to
strengthen the uniﬁed management and protection of water
resources, with the focus on the compliance rate of key
drinking water sources, soil erosion control areas and other
aspects, and to further optimize the water resource allocation
in China. As calculated by the index evaluation, the average
annual growth rates of adaptation actions and progress in the
ﬁeld of water resources are 0% and 33.8%, and the respective
scoring rates in 2018 are 60.0% and 72.4%. Even though the
results reﬂect, remarkable progress made in the ﬁeld of water
resources, the policy actions present a clear preference for
water resource management and water conservation, rather
than adaptation-related ecological restoration over the years.
When it comes to policy implementation effects, four in-
dicators in the ﬁeld of water resources have improved mark-
edly with annual growth rates of 75.7%, 77.8%, 46.3% and
4.7%, respectively. Consistent with the results of index eval-
uation, China's investment in water resources has been grad-
ually increasing, the effects of soil erosion control remain
noticeable, and the water quality and utilization of water re-
sources in water environment functional areas have been
steadily improved.
3.4.4. Marine sector
Marine sector has been experiencing dramatic changes both
at spatial and temporal scales, which in turn affects the human
society that relies on marine services and resources (Jiao et al.,
2015). To implement adaptation, the State Oceanic Adminis-
tration of China has organized and carried out many speciﬁc
projects including China's Marine Medium and Long-term
Plan in Response to Climate Change (2011e2020), and is-
sues the China Sea Level Bulletin and China Marine Disasters
Bulletin on an annual basis. The evaluation for policy actions
in marine sector have stayed unchanged since 2010, with a
scoring rate of 66.0% in 2018. It's clear that China has been
long working on the conservation and restoration of marine
ecology, and the remediation of ecological functions along the
coastline and islands. Nonetheless, the policy actions are
noticeably inclined to periodically monitor and report, instead
of putting forward countermeasures against sea-level rise and
seawater recharge over the years. In terms of adaptation
progress, according to Wang et al. (2020), the complete degree
of the Yantai Blue Bay Plan is 68%. Other plans have not yet
completed the evaluation.
3.4.5. Urban infrastructure
Climate change risks facing urban infrastructure is one of
the major challenges for China's rapid urbanization (Liang
et al., 2020; Edward and Chao, 2018), particularly those
imposed upon, water supply and drainage pipelines (Dong
et al., 2020), power supply system, etc. This study ﬁnds the
annual growth rates of adaptation actions and progress in the
ﬁeld of urban infrastructure to be 22.3% and 23.5%, with
respective scoring rates as 100% and 67.2% in 2018, which
unfolds that the adaptation policies and actions have been
well-implemented for urban infrastructure in China and
proved to be rather effectual. It might be attributed to the
synergy effects brought by the increasing attention paid to
residents' living conditions, urban maintenance and construc-
tion, transportation infrastructure as well as underground
utility tunnels. From 2010 to 2016, the average annual growth
rate of urban maintenance and construction funds is 14.0%,
implying that urban maintenance and construction work in
China has been effectively guaranteed. Although index eval-
uation results illustrate that the effect of policy implementa-
tion is not as signiﬁcant as that of actions, a number of indexes
have been progressing in recent years, e.g., green coverage
rate of urban built-up areas, average outage time of users,
average urban power supply reliability rate, the density of
urban water supply and drainage pipelines, and number of
completed affordable housing projects, etc.
3.4.6. Public health
Climate change highly impacts the occurrence and spread
of infectious diseases. The temperature rise has created
favorable conditions for the survival, and transmission of
entomophagy-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever
(Du et al., 2013). The annual growth rates of adaptation ac-
tions and progress in the ﬁeld of public health are 22.1% and
20.4%, with both scoring rates as 100% in 2018. It is clear that
727
FU L. et al. / Advances in Climate Change Research 12 (2021) 723e733
China has been hammering at public health actions against
climate change since 2010, and has attained a certain degree of
success in water quality improvement, infectious disease
monitoring and prevention, and air quality monitoring. Allo-
cated with a fund of 220 million CNY, local governments
started monitoring drinking water sanitation in 2012, then
impact of haze on public health in 2016, together with a pilot
monitoring on health hazard factors in public places in the
same year. A step further, public health improvement has been
impressive yields, for example, the coverage rate of basic
medical insurance and the number of health technical
personnel per 1000 population in China have increased year by
year during 2010e2018.
3.4.7. Disaster prevention, mitigation, and relief
The annual growth rate and scoring rate of disaster pre-
vention actions respectively reached 10.5% and 100% in
2018, telling of China's steady progress made and the stable
level remained in the ﬁeld of disaster prevention and mitiga-
tion. Through the implementation of the National Compre-
hensive Disaster Prevention and Reduction Plan (2011e2015)
and the National Meteorological Disaster Defense Plan
(2009e2020), etc., China has built up the capacity of
comprehensive disaster prevention and mitigation in both
urban and rural areas for tackling climate change, and has
launched a multi-type and multi-level platform system as
planned. Particularly, drawing on disaster emergency lessons
learned from such as the Yushu Earthquake and Zhouqu debris
ﬂow, China National Emergency Broadcasting (2013) and
National Emergency Early Warning Information Release
System (2015) have been established successively. Monitoring
and early warning systems for various emergencies have been
developed, and the support capacity for handling disaster
emergencies has been prominently enhanced in recent years
(Liu et al., 2019b). The robust growth in disaster prevention
and mitigation emergency system has made a proactive
contribution to China's future disaster emergency manage-
ment, even to the long-term economic and social stability.
In summary, special planning constitutes the basis for both
adaptation work in key sectors and the fulﬁllment of national
climate change adaptation strategy. Directed by special plan-
ning, policies have been formulated to potentially deploy and
implement climate change adaptation in key sectors. Albeit
promising, the adaptation effect of key sectors is not as distinct
as adaptation progress. It may boil down to the limited
consideration to climate change related objectives and priority
tasks in corresponding special planning, given that most of the
adaptation work is carried out by a few ministries in a short
period of time. China's climate change adaptation lacks overall
deployment and long-term planning, and the adaptation work
is mainly carried out by relevant ministries rather than
competent departments, which partly weakens the effect of
adaptation. Nevertheless, adaptation work carried out by
relevant ministries has been reviewed and integrated, laying a
solid foundation for the future work of adaptation to climate
change (see Fig. 1).

3.5. Climate change adaptation policy framework
3.5.1. Policy framework on climate change adaptation
The annual growth rate of the adaptation policy framework
index is 77.8% with a scoring rate of 100% in 2018, as China
has structured a top-level design and special planning frame-
work since 2010 (Fig. 2). By comparing sectoral adaptation
planning and national climate change adaptation strategy, it is
laid bare that many sectors have ﬁrst combined the adaptation-
related requirements with their statutory duties and later
formulated sectoral adaptation plans. Moreover, three levels of
policy goals on climate change adaptation can be identiﬁed
under the existing planning framework. At the highest level,
there are overarching goals, such as to comprehensively
reinforce adaptation by 2020. The mid-level ones are those
key sector goals, for example, the newly increased area for soil
erosion control. Speciﬁc action goals come at the lowest level
to complete the management and policy framework for
addressing climate change. Notwithstanding the planning
framework and three levels of goals, the current adaptation
decision-making process still ignores the assessment of non-
climate factors, e.g., future risks (Peng et al., 2015).
3.5.2. Current institutional system
The pilot system generally plays a pivotal role in China's
climate change adaptation. The annual growth rate of the
institutional system index on adaptation is 9.1% with a scoring
rate of 100% in 2018, implying that China has developed its
underlying capability to adapt to climate change by practicing
pilot demonstrations since 2010. China has consecutively
carried out 100 national water-saving society pilot projects,
seven water rights pilot projects, and 105 pilot projects of
National Water Ecological Civilization Cities in recent years.
To improve urban adaptation, the pilot projects of climate-
adaptive cities were launched in 2017, with positive progress
achieved (Peng et al., 2015). Even with the short-term pilot,
some cities have substantially leveled up their capability to
confront extreme weather events. Changde, a prefecture-level
city in Hunan Province, could serve as an instance, as four
rounds of heavy rainfall during 2016e2019 did not incur
ﬂooding, casualties, or economic losses in its urban area
(Feng, 2020). Overall, though the guiding theory and practices
of building climate-adaptive cities in China are still in the
phase of exploration, which entails further research, trials, and
generalization. Besides, no regular evaluation mechanism in
the institutional design has made it difﬁcult to accurately
measure the actual progress of pilot projects (Fu et al., 2020a).
3.5.3. Management system
The evaluation results suggest that the system construction
index increases by 4.6% annually and the scoring rate is 100%
in 2018. Despite little progress made until now, China's system
construction for addressing climate change has been gradually
upgraded. A management system characterized by the uniﬁed
leadership of the National Leading Group on Addressing
Climate Change of China, centralized management by the
Ministry of Ecology and Environment of the People's Republic
of China, and division of responsibilities between relevant
departments and local governments, has been initiated. After
Fig. 2. Existing framework of China's climate change adaptation top-level design and sectoral adaptation planning.
729
FU L. et al. / Advances in Climate Change Research 12 (2021) 723e733
the institutional reform of the State Council of the People's
Republic of China in 2018, the climate change division was
transferred to the newly established eco-environmental sys-
tem, thus consolidating the collaborative governance over
climate change and pollution control. With the existing
progress in urban climate adaptation pilots (Fu et al., 2020a),
however, there still lacks effective restraints or incentive
means to make the provincial departments of ecology and
environment perform their duties more effectively. In addition,
as departments of ecology and environment and relevant
functional departments of climate change adaptation are
administrative units at the same level, it is rather difﬁcult to
push forward impactful coordination on climate change
adaptation.
3.5.4. Supporting mechanism
The supporting mechanisms for climate change adaptation
mainly include a funding mechanism, public awareness
cultivation, risk assessment mechanism, science and technol-
ogy (S&T) support mechanism, monitoring and early warning
mechanism, emergency management mechanism, etc. The
supporting mechanism index, as an aggregated one, grows at
an annual rate of 12.6% and arrived at a scoring rate of 100%
in 2018. In speciﬁc, the top-level design on climate change
adaptation has been gradually developed, adaptation invest-
ment has accrued, the publicity activities of disaster preven-
tion and mitigation have remained in place, and the working
framework of policies, funds, publicity, and education on
climate change adaptation has initially taken shape.
Adaptation requires long-term ﬁnancial input (Michele
et al., 2020). The index evaluation results note that the adap-
tation input index increases by 16.2% annually and its scoring
rate of 2018 is 100%, which means that the government in-
vestment in adaptation keeps accumulating and the capability
of ﬁnancial support has been constantly elevated. To put it
concretely, over 2.5 billion CNY was invested in climate
change adaptation by the Ministry of Science and Technology
of the People's Republic of China during the 10th Five-Year-
Plan period. During the 12th Five-Year-Plan period, about
3.9 trillion CNY was channeled to climate change adaptation.
In addition, the departmental budget for ‘climate change
management affairs’ was added in 2015, which further
strengthened the ﬁnancial mechanism for adaptation. Never-
theless, funds for adaptation to climate change of China have
not yet been managed by competent departments of adapta-
tion, but allocated in the hands of the Ministry of Science and
Technology, and the Ministry of Finance, etc. The absence of
long-term work deployment has resulted in inefﬁcient allo-
cation of limited ﬁnancial resources to adaptation.
China has paid great attention to the popularization and
education of public disaster prevention and mitigation. Ac-
cording to the evaluation results, the adaptation popularization
index increases by 9.1% annually and its 2018 scoring rate is
100%, proving that China has carried out science populari-
zation and various forms of publicity and education activities
to cultivate the public awareness of disaster prevention and
mitigation. For instance, May 12 has been set as the national
day for disaster prevention and mitigation since 2009, and
October 13 has been taken as the international day for natural
disaster reduction. Even so, studies have suggested that the
overall level of popular science education in meteorological
disaster prevention and mitigation is unsatisfactory (Liu and
Wang, 2017).
As for climate change risk assessment, the National
Assessment Report on Climate Change (PCTNARCC, 2015)
has comprehensively analyzed the impacts of climate change
on China, and has completed the risk assessment of agricul-
ture, water resources, coastal area, etc. Still, the existing
analysis and research sources appear to be rather scattered. To
raise an example, different departments issue their risk
assessment reports at different frequencies and in varied
forms, somehow hindering decision-makers’ judgment, and
the formation of uniﬁed decision-making deployment. Mean-
while, the existing risk assessment is limited to the natural
ecosystems (forestry, marine, water resources, etc.) and the
production sectors with high exposure to climate risks (agri-
culture, animal husbandry, ﬁshery, etc.)
Evaluation results show no change in basic research and
adaptation technology promotion index since 2010 and its
scoring rate to be 100% in 2018. Adaptation-related functional
departments including the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Affairs, the National Forestry and Grassland Administration,
and the Ministry of Civil Affairs, have conducted basic
research, as well as technology popularization and application
for years. Still, China's adaptation technology is relatively
dispersed, and there is no systematic adaptation technology
system for different regions and ﬁelds.
Evaluation results demonstrate that disaster risk monitoring
and early warning index increases by 18.9% annually and the
2018 scoring rate is 100%, which reveals that China's capacity
of integrated processing of meteorological disaster data in-
formation and the number of institutions have seen a dramatic
improvement in recent years. Reﬁned meteorological service
level and basic support capacity have been further advanced,
beneﬁting from the strong support of meteorological moni-
toring and forecasting infrastructure, and scientiﬁc and tech-
nological capabilities. As proof, the National Emergency Early
Warning Information Release System has gathered 76 kinds of
early warning information from 16 departments, therefore the
timeliness of meteorological disaster warnings could be
shortened from 10 min to 5e8 min.
Emergency management is essential for the national
governance system and its capacity-building. With the emer-
gency management index rises by 12.1% annually and the
scoring rate as 100% in 2018, it can be concluded that great
efforts have been made in the ﬁeld of disaster relief policy,
emergency response mechanism, disaster relief funds, material
supervision, and disaster emergency assessment. From 2010 to
2018, China has launched 265 emergency responses in total
but, witnessed a downward trend. China has also issued a
series of disaster emergency management plans since 2010,
and the composition department of emergency management
has been ﬁrst established in 2018 by the latest institutional
reform. Undoubtedly, it will be conducive to the development
730
FU L. et al. / Advances in Climate Change Research 12 (2021) 723e733
of a national governance system and capacity-building,
featured by improved management and tighter regulations.
3.6. Gaps in adaptation progress of China
Four vital shortcomings are identiﬁed in China's climate
change adaptation progress based on the index establishment,
information collection, and evaluation results of ICCAC.
3.6.1. Urgently needed effectiveness assessment in forestry
and urban infrastructure
Evaluation results illustrate that massive forestry adaptation
actions have been taken but obtained limited success, with a
100% scoring rate in actions but only 49.7% in progress for
the year 2018. Likewise, evaluation results in urban infra-
structure also point to insufﬁcient action progress, with a
100% scoring rate in actions but 67.2% in progress for the year
2018. In the light of such results, it might be imperative to
evaluate the effectiveness of current adaptation actions in the
above ﬁelds and to rectify the underlying policy deviation.
3.6.2. Adjustment of policy structure is imperative in
marine sector and water resources
Noticeable policy inclination has been spotted in water
resources and marine sector. Policy actions for marine sector
prone to monitoring and reporting, whereas nearly three-
quarters of policy actions for water resources focus on water
conservation. Moreover, it is noteworthy that huge internal
differences among the four indicators are observed during
evaluation. Indicators A18, A19, and A20 achieve remarkable
progress with an average annual growth rate above 70%, while
A21 merely keeps an average annual growth rate below 20%.
Policy structure adjustments in marine sector and water re-
sources are thus urgently needed to boost the pertinence of
adaptation.
3.6.3. Absence of evaluation criteria for national
adaptation
Few indicators of the three layers of the national adaptation
target system are quantiﬁed, which indubitably affects the
evaluation method determination of ICCAC. Due to the lack of
evaluation standards, the index can only be assessed by annual
progress instead of the target complete rate. Similarly, quali-
tative indicators, such as A34, A35, and A39, etc., also lack
accurate periodical progression. Few speciﬁc system and
institutional indicators are comprised in the target system,
which might lead to confusion or neglect in adaptation system
and institutional arrangement.
3.6.4. The improvement of adaptive management efﬁciency
has stagnated recently
The 2018 institutional reform fails to raise the management
efﬁciency of the competent department on adaptation. The
identical evaluation results of indicator A35 for the years 2017
and 2018 can be taken as testimony. Indicator A35 posed an
annual growth rate of 5.2% from 2010 to 2017 while showed
zero growth during 2018. Therefore, we believe that the
institutional reform that happened in 2018 has not contributed
to the governance efﬁciency improvement of climate change
adaptation (Sun and Ai, 2019).
3.6.5. Adaptation works by relevant ministries shall be in
concordance organized
Evaluation result of sub-index S2 ﬂuctuates drastically
during 2010e2018, indicating that the adaptation goals in key
areas had not been made clear enough. However, sub-index S3
has been rising at a stable pace during the same period, which
infers that there might be no positive correlation between S2
and S3. It further infers that the adaptation actions gathered
are incomplete. This is probably due to the inaccurate under-
standing of adaptation by the ministries that provided infor-
mation to China's Policies and Actions for Addressing Climate
Change (2011e2019). Through the data collection of A36,
A38, and A39, it is noted that actions of adaptation funds,
climate change risk assessment, and adaptation technologies
are still led by various ministries. The observed inconsistency
between ministries' adaptation perceptions or actions with the
national demands could hamper uniﬁed decision-making and
implementation of adaptation in China (Peng et al., 2015;
Zhao and Lei, 2019; Ding and Bo, 2020).
3.7. Suggestions
Some tentative suggestions are proposed here. 1) Adapta-
tion work deployment should be implemented in line with the
target of enhancing the effectiveness of existing policies and
actions. The above-mentioned index-based assessment offers a
preliminary result in key sectors, and conducting a consistent
evaluation of adaptation actions in all key adaptation sectors is
highly recommended. 2) It is suggested to integrates climate
change impacts into all sectoral planning decisions. Climate
risks are cross-ﬁelds, so shall be the adaptation solutions
(GCA ORG, 2019). Thus, the governing political will is in
urgent need for mobilizing cross-department coordination. 3)
According to evaluation results of S1, there is a certain cor-
relation between adaptation effects and policies. Concrete
action plans for adaptation should therefore be developed
following the release of a new national adaptation strategy (Fu
et al., 2020b). 4) A complete policy framework on climate
change adaptation shall be established in the long run. Long-
term ﬁscal investment mechanism and development mode,
risk monitoring and assessment mechanism, more frequent
public awareness cultivation, as well as adaptation techno-
logical systems for different ﬁelds, regions, and levels, are all
integral parts to be developed for the ultimate policy frame-
work of climate change adaptation.
4. Discussion
By and large, this study frames and introduces the Index for
Climate Change Adaptation in China (ICCAC) for identifying
progress and gaps in China's adaptation to climate change. It
aims to lay a basis for future research to devise evaluation
tools for China's climate change adaptation. So far, there
731
FU L. et al. / Advances in Climate Change Research 12 (2021) 723e733
reﬂect two noteworthy deﬁciencies in present studies on
climate change adaptation evaluation. One is that most studies
focus on certain sectors (e.g. agriculture, water resources) or
speciﬁc ﬁelds (e.g., adaptation strategies, adaptation policies),
losing sight of the overall national progress that is essential for
decision-making in climate change adaptation (Zhang et al.
2015b). Taking this into consideration, this study combines
the available national policy with the existing studies, pays
heed to data quality and proposes a rather practical alternative
for decision-making. The other deﬁciency is that previous
studies have not put forth effective quantitative evaluation
tools. Yang et al. (2020) pioneered a national adaptation in-
dicator system, yet applying no scoring methods to quantita-
tively assess the adaptation status. A step further, we develop a
quantitative evaluation index system and complete an index
assessment based on the widely used the analytic hierarchy
process method. This study not only acknowledges the prog-
ress of adaptation that China has achieved, but also pinpoints
shortcomings of each sub-index and puts forward corre-
sponding suggestions. Compared to the previous ones, this
study ﬁnds its originality in both the all-round perspective of
national adaptation actions and the devised quantitative
adaptation evaluation tool. This study, to some extent, can ﬁll
up the deﬁciencies as discussed above. To buttress the
decision-making of climate change adaptation, this study
draws some implications from the evaluation results. Since the
scoring of sub-index S1 plunged sharply in 2013 given the
occurrence of natural disasters, it attests that China's adapta-
tion capacity has not been that well consolidated to satisfy
resilient ends. Meanwhile, considering the scoring of sub-
index S2 and S3, aside from government actions, China's
adaptation progress also beneﬁts from the positive actions
taken by non-government organizations. However, this spec-
ulation can not be veriﬁed in current research.
Although this study has grasped some critical ﬁndings, its
limitations are apparent as well. In the ﬁrst place, for those
important but unavailable indicators, such as disaster impacts
on crucial infrastructures (Yang et al., 2020), this study has to
settle for the second-best. Some indicators shall be devised
with more speciﬁcity. For instance, indicators for the ﬁeld of
public health are currently apt to health insurance, yet
particular attention could be further paid to vulnerable and
sensitive groups, such as the elderly, children, and those with
high-risk occupations. A few indicators, however, need extra
reasoning. Indicator A21, for example, is regarded by some as
irrelevant to adaptation but is selected here in response to the
statement of strengthening the construction of water-saving
society phrased in the national adaptation strategy. Next,
since different scholars have their own approaches in indicator
selection and weight setting (Wu et al., 2016; Sekhri et al.,
2020), and the analytic hierarchy process method would then
average the experts' scoring, to give clear explanations on the
weight determination becomes rather difﬁcult. Third, since
ICCAC is an integrated index, it certainly needs many experts
who have a comprehensive understanding of China's climate
change adaptation to participate in weighting determination
process, rather than experts from various expertise. However,
the number of comprehensive experts in adaptation is very
few, weighting determinations could be affected inevitably by
experts' specialties. Fourth, several indicators are not updated
annually, such as indicator A9, which is only updated from
2010 to 2014. Another few are unavailable in certain years.
Thus, this article deprived the weighting of indicators in
relevant years, which might also have a minor inﬂuence on the
evaluation results of relevant sub-indexes, such as A9 from
2015 to 2018.
By and large, this study can serve as a stepping stone for
future studies both on climate change adaptation in China and
index development. One can improve and optimize the ratio-
nale and operability of ICCAC from four aspects. First, with
emerging adaptation related policy documents and the ever-
growing
statistical
system,
adjusting
scoring
standards,
retooling methods, and updating evaluation indicators would
become incomparably crucial. Second, indicator selection and
weight determination are worth pondering over. It might also
be necessary to conduct in-depth discussions with scholars
from key adaptation ﬁelds and ofﬁcials from competent au-
thorities. Third, it is worthwhile to conduct in-depth analysis
of speciﬁc adaptation policies or sectoral adaptation policies,
upon which one can propose corresponding evaluation in-
dicators of each sub-index to improve the research precision
and accuracy. Fourth, based on the course of each indicator,
one can apply proper measurement models or certain rules to
extend the current evaluation to an adaptation pathway
research. Fifth, for indicators that already have a national
target, such as A12, A13 and A19, one can consider measuring
the sequential execution of target, instead of using the 0e1
standardized method.
