Overview
One might interpret “climate communications” as
sharing information and perspectives related to
information or education about the climate crisis. But at
a deeper level, climate communications refers to
dynamic communication that intersects with diverse
experiences, attitudes, and innovations related to
climate change. 
Today, the practice of climate communications is more
important than ever. Climate communications initiatives
are most effective when they are not passive or
appeasing but are active, forward-thinking, and bold. In
fact, “A large-scale study found that members of the
public in Germany and the USA, as well as other climate
scientists, would prefer scientists to adopt fewer
neutral stances when communicating with the media
and policymakers about climate change (Cologna et al.
2021). A study with climate communication practitioners
in the UK also highlighted that climate scientists,
journalists, and other communicators believe it is
important to nurture a sense of agency and
empowerment through their communications practices
(McLoughlin et al. 2018).” (Source)
When it comes to climate change, people must
find common ground in order to make progress;
the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is an example
of this. The passage of the IRA represents the
most robust climate legislation in history, and it
is a product of political compromise. The bill is
designed to distribute benefits to many
industries and segments of society, and it
affects many different sectors of the economy.
Bridging the divide between different
perspectives is important. Yet climate
communication at its best, requires assertive,
authentic language. 
This toolkit is designed to help communicators
amplify active messages about the climate crisis
that highlight solutions and positive work that is
being done to address the crisis. Whether you
are a climate tech company looking to promote
your climate solution, a nonprofit with an
ambitious goal, or an individual climate activist,
this toolkit will help you tell your story.

3 Universal
Communication Truths
To fully grasp the concept of climate communications, begin with
the 3 Universal Communications Truths: 

3 UNIVERSAL COMMUNICATIONS TRUTHS
3 UNIVERSAL COMMUNICATIONS TRUTHS
1) BEFORE YOU GET STARTED,
FIRST YOU MUST KNOW YOUR
AUDIENCE(S): 
AGE, DEMOGRAPHICS, INDUSTRY, ETC
WHAT DO THEY VALUE? 
WHAT ARE THEIR OPINIONS ON RELEVANT TOPICS? 
WHAT ARE THEIR ATTITUDES? 
WHAT ARE THEIR PAIN POINTS? 
HOW ARE YOU SOLVING THEIR PROBLEMS?

2) WHEN DEVELOPING YOUR
COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY,
YOU MUST KNOW HOW TO
REACH YOUR AUDIENCE:
3) WHEN EXECUTING YOUR
STRATEGY, YOU MUST BE
CLEAR ON YOUR GOAL: 
DO THEY PREFER SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS,
NEWS REPORTS, BROADCASTS, ETC? 
WHAT MEDIA PUBLICATIONS DO THEY READ?
WHAT WILL GET THEIR ATTENTION?
HAVE A CALL TO ACTION; 
OFFER AN EXPERT SOURCE
SHARE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES
WHAT DO YOU WANT YOUR AUDIENCE TO DO? 
Key Messages: Your audiences’ positive
reception of climate communication depends
on how well the messaging is structured.
Messaging, in essence, is the bulk of what
goes into press releases, social media
posts, media campaigns, interviews,
documentaries, or whatever communication
media you are using. 
Key messages contain the most important
information about your organization or
initiative and can be reused and customized
based on the topic and audience at hand. The
key messages are the protein, the building
blocks of any strategic communication effort.
Are you trying to reach more than one
audience? It’s important to note that your
key messages may vary by audience. To
craft key messages that resonate with the
people you are trying to reach, you should
apply the 3 Communications Truths to each
of your audiences.

CLIMATE COMMUNICATIONS ARE MOST EFFECTIVE WHEN
HIGHLIGHTING ALL THREE KEY PILLARS OF SUSTAINABLE
DEVELOPMENT: PEOPLE, PLANET, AND PROFIT. HOW CAN
YOU HIGHLIGHT THE INTERSECTIONALITY OF THESE
PILLARS?   
05
Almost every climate solution delivers
public/community, environmental, and
economic benefits in addition to helping to
mitigate or adapt to climate change. Strong
climate communicators map out those
additional benefits and weave them into their
messaging. Pay special attention to these
intersectionalities.

Media Relations:
Announcement 101 
ONCE YOUR MESSAGING IS THOROUGHLY DEFINED AND POLISHED, YOU
CAN MOVE ON TO MEDIA RELATIONS.
Have big news? Press releases are
concise ways to get your information out
into the world. They are not always
necessary, though. You should only put
out a press release when there is real
news, major events, funding, and other
significant announcements. The essential
pieces of a press release are labeled on
the next page. 
Your press releases can be distributed
through a third-party service or
posted to an owned channel such as a
website or blog. If you post through an
owned channel, you are responsible
for increasing the reach of your press
release, posting it across other
channels, sending it out to reporters,
etc. Continue reading for more on this

Getting News
Coverage
Now that your press release is full of key
messages and you’ve decided where to host
it, it’s time to get your press release in front
of your key audience(s). The next step in
executing your media relations strategy is
researching reporters covering your industry
or topic. Make a list of reporters and their
contact information. Then, go through your
list, reach out to each contact with your
news hook, and try to book interviews with
an expert related to your story, your CEO, or
someone on your leadership team who can
help convey your key messages.
Owned channels can be your Website Blogs
posting articles on your company' LinkedIn.
Sometimes, your story may be better for
publishing on your own media outlet. With
outlets such as company blogs, LinkedIn
articles, and social media pages, you can
create the story from your perspective and
develop yourself as a thought leader on a
subject. First-person accounts of
organizations’ news can be influential and
even more compelling than articles written
from other points of view. 
Social media
What is your/your team members’ area of expertise? Why
are you a credible source? 
How can you create a story around this topic?
What topics align with your goals and key messages?
Social media is a powerful tool to amplify your messages and
analyze your campaign’s reception and online sentiments.
Due to its high accessibility, social media provides a unique
opportunity to widen your reach across to audiences you
otherwise may not have access to.
Connecting with and even tagging the parties involved in
your campaign is a smart way to broaden your reach while
nurturing a sense of community and closeness with your
professional network. Incorporating hashtags is even more
crucial because they help the right users find your content,
increasing followers, views, likes, and overall engagement.
Social media is also great for boosting your notoriety as a
thought leader. Commenting and sharing relevant content
provides credibility to your audience.

Getting Connected
Having a well-developed network can lead to more opportunities.
The climate crisis is a vast problem that demands collaboration.
Whether it is with journalists, your competitors, or your key
audiences, you want to maintain positive relationships with those
involved in your work.
It is important to put yourself in spaces where you can build
relationships and work on creating things together. Engaging with
people who think differently than you is also crucial, and will
challenge your thinking and communications skills. Attend events
to meet others, learn more, and share insights.
