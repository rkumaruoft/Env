Executive Summary 
Canada’s electricity system is expected to be impacted as temperatures increase with 
climate change due to increases in demand for space cooling, decreases in demand 
for space heating, and a change in the frequency and intensity of peak electricity 
demand. This study uses seven general circulation models and two representative 
concentration pathways to project temperature change across Canada under fourteen 
potential climate change scenarios. Navius’ energy-economy model (gTech) and 
electricity model (IESD) are then used to project heating and cooling demand, peak 
load, and electricity expenditure by region across Canada under each scenario, 
compared to a reference case scenario in which no climate change occurs.  
Results indicate three key impacts of climate change on Canada’s electricity system:  
◼ First, overall electricity demand for space heating and cooling is expected to 
increase by 0.4 - 4.2% across Canada by 2100 as a result of climate change due to 
increased demand for space cooling. On average, overall demand for electricity 
remains higher in winter than summer, although some provinces with more extreme 
summer temperatures, such as Ontario, may experience a shift in peak electricity 
demand from the winter (in the absence of climate change) to the summer (with 
climate change) under some climate change scenarios. This is due to significant 
increases in electricity demand for cooling in the summer (Figure A).

change

◼ Second, peak electricity demand is generally expected to increase in the summer as 
temperatures increase due to increased demand for cooling, while it is expected to 
decrease in the winter due to reduced demand for heating, compared to a scenario 
in which no climate change occurs. In some more extreme climate change 
scenarios, however, peak demand for electricity may increase in the winter due to a 
change in peak load from a heating peak in the winter to a cooling peak in some 
warmer winter months occurring in March (Figure  B).

1. Introduction 
Climate change is expected to impact electricity systems in the future. As average global 
temperatures increase, there will be an increase in demand for space cooling, a 
reduction in demand for space heating, and a change in the frequency and intensity of 
peak electricity demand.1,2 Climate change is also expected to impact electricity supply, 
including through changing wind patterns, solar availability, and hydrological patterns.3 
In Canada, these impacts are expected to vary significantly by region.4,5 
This study examines the potential impacts of climate change on Canada’s electricity 
grid, including impacts on heating and cooling demand, peak loads, and cost.

2. Modeling approach 
This chapter provides an overview of the approach used to project the impacts of 
climate change on Canada’s electricity system. It begins with an explanation of how 
temperature change due to climate change is estimated in Section 2.1, followed by an 
overview of the models used to undertake this analysis in Section 2.2, and an 
explanation of how changes in temperature are used to estimate impacts on Canada’s 
electricity system in Section 2.3. Finally, Section 2.4 provides an overview of the key 
assumptions made in this analysis.  
2.1. Estimation of climate change in 
Canada 
The first step to determining the impacts of climate change on Canada’s electricity 
system is to project the potential level of climate change in Canada. This analysis 
focuses on changes in temperature due to climate change, though climate change is 
expected to alter other weather patterns as well such as precipitation and wind. Seven 
general circulation models (GCMs), a type of global climate model used to project 
climate change, were used to project changes in temperature across Canada under 
climate change. These include:  
◼ CCAQ2+GFDL-CM3 
◼ BCCAQ2+MRI-CGCM3 
◼ BCCAQ2+HadGEM2-AO 
◼ BCCAQ2+MIROC-ESM-CHEM 
◼ BCCAQ2+CCSM4 
◼ BCCAQ2+GFDL-ESM2M 
◼ BCCAQ2+HadGEM2-ES 
Two representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) were run in each GCM 
to project a total of fourteen potential climate change scenarios out to 2100. RCPs are 
greenhouse gas concentration trajectories used by the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) and are characterized by the radiative forcing produced by 
emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. RCP4.5 represents an 
intermediate climate change scenario in which radiative forcing stabilizes at 4.5 W/m2 
 
 
 
in 2100 and global temperature rise is expected to reach 2-3 degrees Celsius by 2100; 
RCP8.5 represents a worst-case scenario in which radiative forcing continues to rise 
beyond 8.5 W/m2 after 2100. 
Maximum and minimum monthly temperatures were then extracted from each climate 
change projection in 10 year increments (from 2040 to 2100) and mapped onto several 
weather station locations across Canada. These locations include: 
◼ Victoria, BC 
◼  Abbotsford, BC 
◼  Vancouver, BC 
◼  Kamloops, BC 
◼  Fort St. John, BC 
◼  Edmonton, AB 
◼  Calgary, AB 
◼  Peace River, AB 
◼  Cold Lake, AB 
◼ Estevan, SK 
◼  Regina, SK 
◼  Kindersley, SK 
◼ Saskatoon, SK 
◼ Brandon, MB 
◼ Winnipeg, MB 
◼  Thompson, MB 
◼  Thunder Bay, ON 
◼  Sudbury, ON 
◼ Ottawa, ON 
◼  Windsor, ON 
◼  Toronto, ON 
◼  Québec City, QC 
◼  Montreal, QC 
◼  Mont Joli, QC 
◼  Roberval, QC 
◼ Moncton, NB 
◼ Saint John, NB 
◼  Greenwood, NS 
◼ Halifax, NS 
◼  Sydney, NS 
◼  Yarmouth, NS 
◼  Charlottetown, PEI 
◼  Deer Lake, NFLD 
◼  Gander, NFLD 
◼  St. John, NFLD 
◼  Goose Bay, NFLD 
◼  Bathurst, NB 
The change in temperature across Canada as a result of climate change was then 
calculated by comparing the maximum and minimum monthly temperatures under each 
climate change scenario to reported temperatures in 2010 in these locations. 
Temperature data was adjusted for each location under each climate change scenario 
using the following formula: 
𝑃_𝑇𝐸𝑀𝑃𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦,ℎ,𝑦= (𝐻_𝑇𝐸𝑀𝑃𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦,ℎ−𝐻_𝑀𝐼𝑁𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦,ℎ) × 𝑃_𝑀𝐴𝑋𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦,ℎ,𝑦−𝑃_𝑀𝐼𝑁𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦,ℎ,𝑦
𝐻_𝑀𝐴𝑋𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦,ℎ−𝐻_𝑀𝐼𝑁𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦,ℎ
+ 𝑃_𝑀𝐼𝑁𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦,ℎ,𝑦 
Where P_TEMP = projected temperature under climate change for each city, hour and 
year (from 2040 to 2100); H_TEMP = historically reported temperature in 2010 by city 
and hour; H_MIN = historically reported minimum temperature in 2010 by city; H_MAX = 
historically reported maximum temperature in 2010 by city; P_MAX = projected 
Impacts of climate change on Canada’s electricity system 
 
 
maximum temperature under climate change for each city, hour and year (from 2040- to 
2100), specified by climate change models; P_MIN = projected minimum temperature 
under climate change for each city, hour and year (from 2040-2100), specified by 
climate change models. P_MAX and P_MIN are converted from monthly temperature 
projections from the climate change models (GCM and RCP) to hourly temperature 
projections by assuming the minimum and maximum values occur on the 15th of the 
month and weighting hours according to the following equations: 
𝑃_𝑀𝐴𝑋𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦,ℎ,𝑦= ∑ℎ_𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡ℎ,𝑚
𝑚
× 𝑃_𝑀𝐴𝑋𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦,𝑚,𝑦 
𝑃_𝑀𝐼𝑁𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦,ℎ,𝑦= ∑ℎ_𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡ℎ,𝑚
𝑚
× 𝑃_𝑀𝐼𝑁𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦,𝑚,𝑦 
Note that hourly variations in temperature projections were treated differently when 
analyzing the impacts on electricity consumption or expenditure than when analyzing 
the impacts on peak electricity demand. In the case of the former, variations in hourly 
data from each GCM and RCP were fit to an average monthly regression to capture the 
trend in temperature change from 2040 to 2100. In the case of peak electricity load, 
however, it is important to capture hourly temperatures at the top and bottom of the 
temperature fluctuations, rather than dampening these fluctuations with a monthly 
average, as the highest values are what best inform the capacity that utilities will need 
to add to meet peak demand. For this reason, temperature projection data was fit to a 
different regression when analyzing the impacts on peak electricity load, which uses the 
coldest winter day and hottest summer day in each month and city to capture the high 
end of the temperature range in each GCM and RCP. 
This temperature data was then used with Navius’ energy-economy model (gTech) and 
electricity model (Integrated Electricity Supply and Demand Model, IESD) to determine 
the impact of climate change on electricity demand across Canada in 10-year 
increments out to 2100. These models are described in the next section (Section 2.2) 
and in more detail in Annex 1 and 2, and quantification of the impacts of temperature 
change on Canada’s electricity sector is described in Section 2.3.  
2.2. Introduction to IESD and gTech  
IESD 
The Integrated Electricity Supply and Demand model (IESD) simulates the impact of 
government policies and economic conditions on electricity demand, supply, and prices. 
IESD is effectively two separate models: one that simulates the addition to electricity 
generation capacity and hourly dispatch (generation) decisions in the electricity sector 
 
 
 
and another that simulates decisions by end-users that affect electricity demand (e.g. 
technology and fuel choice). 
IESD can explore multiple policy and economic scenarios in any region or set of regions6, 
and provides detailed insight into their impact on:  
◼ The market for specific generation or supply technologies, in terms of installed 
capacity and electricity generation by unit, fuel type, technology type etc. 
◼ GHG emissions from the electricity sector  
◼ Electricity trade between regions 
◼ Electricity consumption by sector and end-use  
◼ Wholesale and end-use electricity prices 
More detail about IESD and how it is structured is provided in Annex 1. For this analysis, 
IESD was used to simulate changes in peak electricity load, price and expenditure under 
each of the fourteen climate change scenarios compared to a scenario with no climate 
change. This allowed for isolation of the impacts of climate change on Canada’s 
electricity sector out to 2100. 
gTech  
gTech is unique among energy-economy models because it combines features that are 
typically only found in separate models: 
◼ A realistic representation of how households and firms select technologies and 
processes that affect their energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions; 
◼ An exhaustive accounting of the economy at large, including how provinces and 
territories interact with each other and the rest of the world; and 
◼ A detailed representation of energy supply, including liquid fuel (crude oil and 
biofuel), gaseous fuel (natural gas and renewable natural gas) and electricity. 
More detail about gTech is provided in Annex 2. For this analysis, gTech was used to 
simulate annual electricity consumption by region, sector and end-use across Canada 
out to 2100. This consumption was then input into IESD to quantify the impacts of 
climate change on Canada’s electricity system, as described in the following section.  
 
6 The largest coverage to date is disaggregated by each of Canada’s 10 provinces as well as the US, which is also 
disaggregated into 10 regions. 
Impacts of climate change on Canada’s electricity system 
 
 
2.3. Estimation of electricity sector impacts 
An increase in temperature with climate change is expected to impact heating and 
cooling demand in two main ways: 
◼ When temperatures are warmer, there is less of a need for heating in the winter and 
more of a need for cooling in the summer. As a result, people are using their air 
conditioners more in the summer to achieve the same indoor temperature as they 
would in the absence of climate change.  
◼ When temperatures are warmer, the amount of floor space that is heated or cooled 
increases, independent of population or economic growth, as people install air 
conditioners to cool spaces that would not have needed cooling in the absence of 
climate change. For example, with warmer temperatures, homes built in Vancouver 
may include air conditioners that otherwise would not have.  
Changes in temperature due to climate change were used to estimate changes in space 
heating and cooling demand using the PJM method.7 This method projects electricity 
load based on weather-related variables,8 which was then weighted by population at 
each of the weather station locations listed in Section 2.1. Based on this method, the 
temperature humidity index (THI) was used for estimating heating load based on the 
following equation:  
THI = T – 0.55 x (1 – H) x (T – 58), if T >= 58 
THI = T, if T < 58 
Where T = Dry bulb temperature and H = Relative Humidity (where 100% = 1) 
And the wind adjusted temperate (WWP) was used to estimate cooling load based on 
the following equation:  
WWP = T – (0.5 x (W – 10)), if W > 10 
WWP = T, if W <= 10 
Where W = Wind velocity in MPH and T = Dry bulb temperature 
Electricity consumption projections in the absence of climate change, output from 
gTech, were used to adjust hourly electricity load curves (based on 2010 data) out to

temperature variable in this method was adjusted.  
 
 
 
2100, which were disaggregated by sector and end-use to estimate hourly electricity 
consumption for space heating and cooling for every region in Canada. By using gTech 
to simulate reference case consumption out to 2100, other impacts on electricity 
demand were controlled for, including improvements in efficiency for various end uses 
(for example, space cooling demand decreases over time as the efficiency of air 
conditioning improves), all current policies that may lead to fuel switching (such as 
electrification of passenger transport), increases in population and increases in 
economic growth. By controlling for these factors, the impact of temperature change due 
to climate change on Canada’s electricity system could be isolated.  
Electricity consumption for space heating and cooling were then adjusted based on 
temperature change projections using the PJM equations above, and input into IESD to 
simulate Canada’s electricity system under this demand.  
2.4. Important assumptions 
A few important assumptions were made in this analysis. These include: 
◼ First, temperature changes projected by each climate change scenario were mapped 
onto the 37 weather station locations listed in Section 2.1, which were used to 
estimate temperature change across Canada. Temperature change at these locations 
was scaled to the regional level (10 provinces and the territories) and resulting 
changes in heating and cooling demand were weighted based on the population 
closest to each station.  
◼ Second, heating and cooling demand under climate change were calculated based on 
a reference case scenario in which all currently implemented and announced federal 
and provincial climate policies are included. Therefore, any changes in electricity 
demand due to reference case climate policy has been controlled for, as have 
changes in electricity demand due to population and economic growth. 
◼ Third, changes in temperature due to climate change are based on a 2010 base year. 
It is therefore assumed that weather patterns in 2100 are a repeat of weather 
patterns in 2010, but with temperature adjusted up or down based on climate 
change models.  
◼ Fourth, the winter season is defined as the days between December 21 and March 
21 and the summer is defined as the days between June 20 and September 20. This 
is important in defining winter and summer peak electricity loads. 
◼ Finally, electricity storage was simulated as a pathway to help mitigate peaks in 
electricity demand. However, dispatchable load was not included in this analysis.

3. Impacts of climate change on 
Canada’s electricity system  
This chapter summarizes the results of this analysis. Section 3.1 and 3.2 quantify the 
impacts of climate change on electricity demand across Canada, including changes in 
space heating and cooling demand and peak load. Section 3.3. quantifies the economic 
impacts of climate change on Canada’s electricity system, including impacts on total 
and capital electricity expenditure. 
National impacts as well as regional variability is explored. Ontario and British Columbia 
are chosen to represent regional variability across the country and are highlighted in 
more detail as examples of seasonal (hot in the summer, cold in the winter) and 
moderate (warm in the summer, cool in the winter) temperature profiles. 
3.1. Electricity demand for space heating 
and cooling  
In comparison to a scenario without climate change, electricity demand across Canada 
is expected to decrease in the medium term (2050) in most climate change scenarios, 
due to a lower demand for space heating. In the long term, however, electricity demand 
is expected to increase by 0.4 - 4.2% by 2100, as an increase in demand for space 
cooling outweighs a reduction in demand for heating (Figure 1). 
In 2100, electricity demand for space cooling is expected to increase by 32 - 223% in 
the summer and for space heating to decrease by 14 - 61% in the winter. These ranges 
in demand reflect the range in potential temperature change due to climate change 
across Canada, which is based on the fourteen climate change scenarios described in 
Section 2.1. 
 
 
 
Figure 1. Change in electricity demand for heating and cooling in Canada under climate 
change, relative to a scenario with no climate change. 
 
Figure 2 and Figure 3 demonstrate a sample winter and summer day in 2010 in 
Canada, with temperature adjusted based on the level of climate change in 2100 under 
one selected climate change scenario (BCCAQ2+HadGEM2-ES, RCP8.5). Figure 2 
demonstrates that electricity demand for heating in the winter will decease on average 
across Canada due to warmer temperatures, while electricity demand for cooling in the 
summer will increase (Figure 3) compared to the same day with no climate change. 
Under this climate change scenario, total electricity demand remains slightly higher on 
this winter day across Canada than on this summer day.

Ontario  
Ontario, as a province with generally hot summers and cold winters, may experience a 
shift in peak electricity demand from the winter (in the absence of climate change) to 
the summer (with climate change). Figure 4 and Figure 5 demonstrate a sample winter 
and summer day in Ontario in 2010, with temperature adjusted based on the level of 
climate change in 2100 under one selected climate change scenario 
(BCCAQ2+HadGEM2-ES, RCP8.5). Figure 4 demonstrates that electricity demand for 
heating in the winter decreases in Ontario due to warmer temperatures, while electricity 
demand for cooling in the summer increases significantly (Figure 5) compared to the 
same day with no climate change. 
Overall, electricity demand for space heating and cooling in Ontario is expected to 
increase by 0.9 - 6.7% in 2100, depending in the climate change scenario, in 
comparison to a scenario with no climate change. Electricity demand for space cooling is 
expected to increase by 27 - 170% in the summer and for space heating to decrease by 
13 - 59% in the winter.

British Columbia 
British Columbia, as a province with a more moderate seasonal temperature profile, will 
also experience a decrease in demand for space heating in the winter and an increase 
in demand for cooling in the summer, though to a less significant extent than Ontario, 
with demand for electricity remaining higher in the winter than in the summer under 
climate change. Figure 6 and Figure 7 demonstrate a sample winter and summer day in 
British Columbia in 2010, with temperature adjusted based on the level of climate 
change in 2100 under one selected climate change scenario (BCCAQ2+HadGEM2-ES, 
RCP8.5). 
Overall, electricity demand for space heating and cooling in British Columbia is expected 
to increase by 0.2 - 4.6% in 2100, depending in the climate change scenario, in 
comparison to a scenario with no climate change. Electricity demand for space cooling is 
expected to increase by 49 - 470% in the summer and for space heating to decrease by 
17 - 73% in the winter.

3.2. Peak electricity load 
Changes in heating and cooling demand under climate change have an interesting 
impact on peak electricity load. Annex 3 provides a detailed breakdown of peak 
electricity load by province, while this section continues to look at Ontario and British 
Columbia as examples.  
Peak electricity load in both provinces increases in the summer as expected, as demand 
for cooling increases with warmer temperatures. Figure 8 and Figure 9 show an increase 
in summer peak load in 2100 of 17.3 – 32.7% in Ontario and 0.5 – 9.9% in British 
Columbia under climate change. This corresponds to an additional 15,243 - 28,782 MW 
of peak electricity demand in 2100 in Ontario and an additional 84 - 3048 MW of peak 
electricity demand in 2100 in British Columbia. 
In the winter, peak load decreases as expected in 2050 in both provinces in many 
scenarios due to reduced demand for heating. By 2100, however, peak load increases 
in both provinces in the winter under more extreme climate change scenarios (RCP8.5 
scenarios). Figure 8 and Figure 9 show a change in peak load in the range of –1.7 - 
5.7% in Ontario and -1.2 - 3.7% in British Columbia under climate change, compared to 
a scenario with no climate change. This corresponds to a change of -1340 - 4552 MW of 
peak electricity demand in 2100 in Ontario and -314 - 1195 MW of peak electricity

days in March as a result of temperature increases under climate change.

3.3. Capital and total electricity 
expenditure  
As Canada’s electricity demand decreases in the medium term (2050), total electricity 
system expenditure also decreases by 0.3 - 1.9% depending on the climate change 
scenario (Figure 10). This corresponds to a reduction in expenditure in 2050 of $141-
1029 million (2015 CAD). By 2100, as electricity demand increases and electricity price 
increases (due to an increase in peak demand), total expenditure on the electricity 
system also increases by 0 - 4.2% depending on the climate change scenario (Figure 
10). This corresponds to an increase in electricity expenditure of $34 - 5351 million 
(2015 CAD) in 2100 relative to a scenario with no climate change. 
Figure 10. Change in total electricity expenditure in Canada, relative to a scenario with 
no climate change 
 
Total electricity expenditure includes capital expenditure, as well as other operating 
costs, such as fuel and labour costs. Isolating capital expenditure on electricity shows a 
similar trend, decreasing by 0.6 - 2.2% ($207 - 791) in 2050 depending on the climate 
change scenario and increasing by up to 4.1% ($2892 million) in 2100 (Figure 11) (CAD 
2015).

Figure 11. Change in capital expenditure on electricity in Canada, relative to a scenario

Changes in electricity expenditure by province show regional variability, with most 
experiencing an increase in expenditure by 2100 due to increased demand for cooling. 
Figures 12 and 13 show changes in total and capital electricity expenditure in Ontario 
and British Columbia, and a further breakdown of provincial results can be found in 
Annex 4. Overall, results indicate that by 2100 the electricity expenditure required to 
achieve the same desired temperature in buildings across Canada is higher due to 
temperature increases under climate change than in the absence of climate change.

4. Limitations 
This analysis focused on the impacts of temperature changes due to climate change on 
the demand for electricity across Canada. There are other important expected impacts 
of climate change on the electricity system that were not examined in this analysis. 
These include: 
◼ Impacts of climate change on wind speed and direction. This may affect space 
heating demand, which is a function of wind speed, as well as capacity for wind 
electricity generation.  
◼ Impacts of climate change on cloud patterns. This may affect capacity for solar 
electricity generation.  
◼ Impacts of climate change on hydrological patterns. This may affect capacity for 
hydroelectricity generation.    
◼ Impacts of temperature on electricity transmission loss, which may increase as 
temperature increases. 
This analysis also did not examine the impacts of climate policy on electricity demand in 
Canada, but rather isolated changes in demand due to increases in temperature under 
climate change. Total electricity demand in 2100 can be expected to increase further as 
additional climate policy is implemented to encourage fuel switching to electricity (such 
as electric vehicles).  
These limitations present potential areas for future research.  
Impacts of climate change on Canada’s electricity system 
 
 
Annex 1: Introduction to IESD 
How IESD works  
The IESD model simulates: 
◼ How utilities meet electric load by adding new capacity and by dispatching new and 
existing units on an hourly basis, including electricity storage units, and 
◼ How each sector alters its electricity consumption in response to the price for 
electricity. 
Figure 14 depicts the key components of IESD’s simulation process.  
Figure 14: Conceptualization of IESD model simulation 
 
IESD’s simulation process begins with the Electricity Supply Module, which includes a 
detailed representation of the different units available to generate or store electricity in 
each region, including their unique costs and generation constraints. The electricity 
supply simulation determines new generation and storage capacity additions, hourly 
dispatch of each unit to meet electric load over the course of the year, GHG emissions 
from the electricity sector and the wholesale price for electricity.  
The price for electricity is then sent to the Electricity Demand Module, which simulates 
how households and firms change their electricity consumption. The resulting electricity

consumption by end-use is used to adjust the magnitude and shape of the hourly load 
profile. Total load and total demand side management spending are then sent back to 
the Electricity Supply Module. 
Electricity supply module 
The electricity supply module of IESD is a linear programming model that simulates how 
the electricity sector makes capacity and dispatch decisions based on the hourly load 
profile, energy prices and the cost of installing and operating different units. The 
electricity supply module endogenously adds and dispatches electricity units such that 
the total costs of the electricity system are minimized, system revenues are maximized 
and load in each hour is met. The value provided by storage technologies and their 
possible revenue streams are reflected by the extent to which they can minimize system 
costs relative to other generation technologies. The model can be adjusted to represent 
how specific electricity markets may or may not value the grid services provided by 
storage. 
Representative days versus consecutive days  
By default, the national version of IESD represents 43 representative days throughout 
the year that vary by 1) season, 2) load, and 3) wind capacity utilization (i.e. how much 
wind power is available in each hour of the day). These 43 representative days were 
selected to provide an accurate representation of the variation observed in load profiles 
and wind capacity utilization over all 365 days in a year (2010 data were used to 
provide the benchmark for electric load). To calculate total annual load, each 
representative day is assigned a weight such that the load profiles over the 43 days 
matches the load profile and wind capacity utilization over all 365 days in the year. 
To best show the impact of electricity storage technologies, the value of which is a 
function of their continual release and recharging of energy, we are reconfiguring the 
national version of IESD to simulate consecutive hours and days through the year. This 
approach requires greater computing power and we are determining whether a fully 
national version will solve, or whether we may need to create regional models. 
Capacity additions 
The electricity supply module endogenously adds electricity generation units to supply 
energy (i.e. consumption over the year) and capacity (i.e. consumption at a given 
moment) such that the costs of the electricity system are minimized. Each type of 
electricity generation resource is characterized by its cost profile (i.e., capital costs, fixed 
operating costs, variable operating costs), heat rate (i.e. energy efficiency) and 
maximum capacity utilization. The model can simulate specific policy decisions that may 
Impacts of climate change on Canada’s electricity system 
 
 
promote or constrain the use of a given technology (e.g. a performance standard that 
constrains coal power, a portfolio standard that requires renewable energy). This 
framework also applies to electricity storage technologies. 
Dispatch and capacity utilization 
Thermal generation (i.e. fossil fuel or biomass combustion) can be dispatched at any 
time when it will minimize total system costs subject to any existing policy constraints. 
However, we assume cogenerated electricity is not dispatchable and is produced when 
heat is required by the thermal host. 
Like thermal generation, electricity storage can be dispatched. However, this dispatch is 
constrained by the installed storage generation capacity, the amount of energy already 
stored, and any relevant technical constraints represented in the model. 
Electricity from intermittent resources must be used when it is available, either 
consumed, exported or stored. As stated above, the hourly wind energy is based on the 
installed capacity and the hourly capacity utilization in each hour of the representative 
day being simulated. Solar capacity availability varies for each month of the year (e.g. 
lowest in winter, highest in summer) but changes each hour according to the movement 
of the sun through the sky (e.g. zero at night, low the morning, highest at noon). 
Characterizing generation from variable renewable sources 
To characterize wind resources by province, we rely on CanWEA data describing the 
location and hourly capacity factor of 5,000 potential sites across the country9. Sites are 
grouped by generation profile and the cost of transmission access. Each grouping of 
sites is then included in the model as a potential wind resource that can be developed. 
To incorporate variability in solar generation profiles into IESD, we use regression to 
estimate the impact of different weather patterns (as observed in Environment and 
Climate Change Canada weather data) on solar insolation (as observed in the closest 
1x1 mile square across the border in the US10).

Electricity demand module 
Demand for electricity is derived from the Navius' gTech simulation model. The IESD 
model uses gTech’s projections to “shape” the load curve for electricity 
demand/generation. 
Hourly load curves 
We obtained hourly load data for all jurisdictions in North America (over 200 utilities). 
These data provide a starting point for understanding how load varies over the course of 
2010, the model’s base year. An example of Ontario’s hourly load profile in 2010 is 
shown in Figure 15.  
Figure 15. Hourly load profile for Ontario in 2010

from: www.ieso.ca 
Sectors and end-uses in the electricity demand module 
The electricity demand module disaggregates the hourly load curves into seven end-
uses based on data from Natural Resource Canada’s Comprehensive Energy End-Use 
Database. The end-uses for residential and commercial buildings include: 
◼ Space heating 
◼ Air conditioning

◼ Other multi-fuel end-uses (water heating, cooking, clothes dryers) 
◼ Other electric-only end-uses (refrigerators, freezers, dishwashers, clothes washers, 
computers, televisions, etc.) 
The model also represents industrial electric loads. However, they are represented in 
less detail. Industrial load is not broken down by end use (e.g. compression, pumping 
etc.) and we assume it is a base load that is relatively constant over every hour of the 
year 
Electricity load forecast 
gTech determines total electricity consumption and the “shape” of electricity 
consumption in IESD. After a model simulation in gTech is complete, the resulting 
electricity consumption by end-use is compiled and used to “shape” an electricity 
consumption load curve. For example, if a policy increases the adoption of electric heat 
pumps, it will affect electricity consumption at specific times and days of the year. 
What is gTech? 
gTech provides a comprehensive representation of all economic activity, energy 
consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in Canada. It is ideally suited for projecting 
electricity demand because it represents: 
◼ The competitiveness of electric technologies relative to conventional and low carbon 
alternatives. This competitiveness depends not only on the attributes of end-use 
technologies themselves (such as their capital cost and operating performance), but 
also on the availability and price of electricity and other energy carriers (which will 
change based on the amount of electrification, the unique energy resources in each 
province and energy trade among regions). 
◼ Firm and consumer preferences. Electric technologies may be perceived as an 
imperfect substitute for existing technologies. For example, a given household may 
prefer a conventional vehicle over an electric vehicle because of its lower upfront cost 
and greater model variety. In addition, some preferences may change as a technology 
gains market share. For example, if electric vehicles become widespread and fast 
charging stations are broadly deployed, concerns about running out of a battery 
charge would decline. 
◼ The impact of existing federal and provincial climate policies on technology choice 
(including how they interact). Accounting for existing policies is important because 
electrification is highly affected by their interactive and duplicative effects. For 
example, electric vehicle adoption is influenced by ZEV mandates, financial 
 
 
 
incentives, clean/low carbon fuel standards, fuel economy regulations and carbon 
pricing. 
These various features mean that gTech can provide insight into future load in response 
to any combination of (1) existing and/or new policies that directly or indirectly affect 
electricity supply and demand and (2) the cost of electrification technologies relative to 
alternative options. 
Impacts of climate change on Canada’s electricity system 
 
 
Annex 2: Introduction to gTech 
gTech is an energy-economy model that combines realistic representation of technology 
choice, exhaustive accounting of the macroeconomy, and detailed representation of 
energy supply markets (Figure 16).  
Figure 16. The gTech model 
 
gTech builds on three of Navius’ previous models (CIMS, GEEM and OILTRANS/IESD), combining their best elements 
into a comprehensive integrated framework. 
Simulating technological choice  
Unlike most computable general equilibrium (CGE) models, gTech contains substantial 
technological detail, such that it can account for the complexities of the energy economy 
system. Technological detail allows gTech to examine the impact of technology 
deployment on energy consumption, GHG emissions and the broader economy. gTech is 
designed to provide a projection of how households and firms adopt technologies, and 
how technological adoption affects energy and emissions profiles. It simulates how 
energy prices, technology costs and policies affect which technologies are used to 
provide energy end-uses (e.g. lighting, process heating, mobility etc.). These choices in 
turn affect energy consumption, air emissions, capital costs, operating costs and energy 
costs. The model also accounts for the intangible and interactive technological, 
behavioural, and economic factors that accompany energy use and GHG emission 
policies. 
Energy 
Supply
 
 
 
Understanding the macroeconomic impacts of policy 
As a CGE model, gTech represents key economic transactions within the economy 
allowing it to project the economic impacts of climate policies. These economic 
transactions include: 
◼ Interlinkages between sectors of the economy. gTech explicitly represents 115 
sectors of the economy (e.g., construction, cement manufacturing, petroleum 
refining). Each sector of the economy is characterized by the goods it produces (e.g., 
cement), and the inputs required to production (labor, capital, energy, etc.). As an 
equilibrium mode, gTech simulates how every sector of the economy returns to 
equilibrium if a policy is introduced or if economic conditions change. For example, if 
a policy reduces construction activity, demand for construction inputs, such as 
cement, would also be reduced. 
◼ Interlinkages between households and sectors of the economy. Households lend 
their time and savings to industry in exchange for income. Any change in income 
generation within a province affects household income. 
◼ Interlinkages between regions. gTech represents a total of 12 regions in North 
America, including each Canadian province, a single region representing the 
territories, and the United States. gTech accounts for bilateral trade between these 
regions as well as international trade beyond North America. Policies implemented in 
a given region can then affect the level of trade that occurs with the rest of the world. 
Understanding energy supply markets 
gTech accounts for all major energy supply markets, including electricity, refined 
petroleum products, natural gas and hydrogen. Each market is characterized by 
resource availability and production costs by province and territory, as well as costs and 
constraints (e.g. pipeline capacity) of transporting energy between regions. 
Low carbon energy sources can be introduced within each fuel stream in response to 
policy, such as renewable electricity and bioenergy. The model accounts for the 
availability and cost of bioenergy feedstocks, allowing it to provide insight about the 
economic effects of emission reduction policy, biofuels policy and the approval of 
pipelines. 
gTech: The benefits of merging macroeconomics with technological detail 
By merging the three features described above (technological detail, macroeconomic 
dynamics, and energy supply dynamics), gTech can provide extensive insight into the 
effect of climate and energy policy. 
Impacts of climate change on Canada’s electricity system 
 
 
First, gTech can provide insights related to technological change by answering questions 
such as: 
◼ How do policies affect technological adoption (e.g. how many electric vehicles are 
likely to be on the road in 2030 or 2050)? 
◼ How does technological adoption affect energy consumption and greenhouse gas 
emissions? 
Second, gTech can provide insights related to macroeconomics by answering questions 
such as: 
◼ How do policies affect gross domestic product? 
◼ How do policies affect individual sectors of the economy? 
◼ Are households affected by the policy? 
◼ Does the policy affect energy prices or any other price in the model (e.g., food 
prices)? 
Third, gTech answers questions related to its energy supply modules: 
◼ Will a policy generate more supply of renewable fuels or greater demand for 
electricity? 
◼ Does policy affect the cost of transporting refined petroleum products, and therefore 
the price of gasoline in Canada? 
Finally, gTech provides insight into areas where there is overlap between its various 
features: 
◼ What is the effect of investing carbon revenue into low- and zero-carbon 
technologies? This question can only be answered with a model such as gTech. 
◼ What are the macroeconomic impacts of technology-focused policies (e.g. how might 
a zero-emissions vehicle standard impact GDP)? 
◼ Do biofuels focused policies affect (1) technological choice and (2) the 
macroeconomy? 
This modeling toolkit allows for a comprehensive examination of the impacts of energy 
and climate change policy in Canada.
