Climate change is not only affecting our environment, but also negatively impacting mental health globally.
While physical health problems caused by climate change have been increasingly studied in medical litera-
ture, few studies have investigated mental health problems caused byclimate change. In order to bridge this
gap in the literature and assess the psychological impact of climate change, it is crucial to create adequate
psychometric tools such as the Climate Change Anxiety Scale (CCAS) developed by Susan Clayton.
In this study, 150 Italian adults (67.4% females, and 32.6% males aged 19−76) were recruited online and
required to complete CCAS, as well as GAD-7, K-10, NEP, PEBS, PESE/PSSE, and GSE in order to assess the psy-
chometric properties of and validate CCAS in Italy. Patients were retested after three months. Data was col-
lected from January to June 2021. The study used a 13-item version of the CCAS, which was based on the ﬁrst
two factors of Clayton's original scale. Researchers speciﬁcally analyzed internal consistency, test-retest reli-
ability, and discriminant validity.
Factor structure of CCAS was speciﬁcally addressed: a CFA was carried out to analyze the two-factor structure
proposed in the original validation study. An EFA was then conducted and it was hypothesized that a single-
factor structure could better ﬁt data.
Climate Change Anxiety Scale items exhibited reasonably good internal consistency. Test-retest reliability at
a three-month evaluation proved to be good. The experience of climate change anxiety proved to be related
to anxiety, pro-environmental behaviors, and low perception of self-efﬁcacy.

1. Introduction
Climate change, which is largely recognized as the greatest chal-
lenge of the century for science and human society [23,44], will have
an impact on healthcare as well as the environment [11,55].
Due to human activities, the concentration of various pollutants in
the atmosphere has signiﬁcantly increased, thus giving rise to the
greenhouse effect and consequent global warming. Climate change is
a source of concern for the scientiﬁc community as it negatively
affects all life-forms on the planet [18]. Several studies show that
some disastrous consequences of climate change [18], such as rising
temperatures [18], heat waves [37], ﬂoods [42], tornadoes [13], hurri-
canes [30], droughts [61], ﬁres [32], loss of forests [10] and the disap-
pearance of rivers and desertiﬁcation can directly and indirectly
cause physical and mental pathologies [18].
While some of the effects of global warming on mental health
have not yet been assessed in psychiatric studies, and the impact of
climatic events such as acid rain [49], superfog [18], glacier melting
[18], and biomass extinction [18] have been neglected, various
authors have predicted that climate change will negatively impact
mental health leading to extensive, serious and cumulative conse-
quences [26,58].
One of the negative emotional consequences of climate change is
increased anxiety [20]. The construct of climate-change-related emo-
tional disorders has not been described with adequate clarity, and
many terms have been created in order to deﬁne the effects of cli-
mate change on emotions and mental health [20]. Some of these new
terms are eco-anxiety [22], environmental malaise [34], ecological
suffering [24], ecological stress [33], solastalgia[1] , environmental
malaise [34], pre-traumatic stress disorder [64] and climate change
anxiety [50]. In 2017, the American Psychological Association deﬁned
eco-anxiety as "a chronic fear of environmental fate" [21].
While low- and middle-income countries have been the most
adversely affected by climate change [24], eco-anxiety has also
spread to the Western world, where news on environmental disas-
ters, heat waves and climate protests has become more and more fre-
quent since 2019 [67]. While many individuals worldwide experience

unpleasant feelings due to climate change, eco-anxiety is commonly
deﬁned as an individual’s healthy reaction to climate change rather
than a pathology-based response like those common with anxiety
disorders. However, experts believe that concerns about climate
change can trigger latent mental health problems [63]. In this regard,
young people have been shown to feel more discomfort as a result of
climate change than seniors [19].
The type of concern leading to climate change anxiety can vary in
different geographical areas. For example, individuals living in coun-
tries which are directly affected by the disastrous consequences of
climate change may worry about their lives, while individuals living
in richer countries may worry about possible changes in their life-
style [62]. Direct exposure to the consequences of climate change is
not the only driver of climate change anxiety; individuals who have
acquired climate change awareness through books or scientiﬁc
articles have been shown to be prone to eco-anxiety [68]. Studies
also show that subjects who feel emotionally and mentally connected
with nature tend to be more concerned about climate change
[5,27,46,47].
Some authors point out that climate-change-related anxiety may
lead to pro-environmental behaviors [35,36]. Individuals who feel
unpleasant emotions after having acquired awareness or experienced
the consequences of climate change may adopt behaviors aimed at
reducing the impact of climate change on their daily life [18]. Ade-
quate assessment tools, such as a validated scale, are required in
order to measure the levels of eco-anxiety and identify a suitable
treatment. In this regard, Susan Clayton validated the Climate Change
Anxiety Scale, a 13-item scale to assess cognitive and functional
impairment due to climate change. Given the lack of an Italian valida-
tion of the CCAS, the aim of this study was to translate and verify the
psychometric properties of the Italian version of the CCA in a healthy
sample of 150 individuals. Internal consistency, test-retest reliability,
and discriminant validity were speciﬁcally addressed.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Participants and procedure
2.1.1. Italian adaptation of the scale
Two English native speakers independently translated the original
English items into Italian and resolved disagreements via discussion.
The Italian items were then back-translated into English by two other
researchers, who were not aware of the original scale. Afterwards,
the ﬁnal wording of the Italian items was determined.
The translation of the scale was made by avoiding excessively
complex terms and favouring a simple syntactic formulation. No
adaptations have been made for speciﬁc dialects since in Italy, despite
the presence of numerous dialects, the Italian language is well under-
stood by the general population.
Translation and validation were performed on the ﬁrst 13 items
and 2 factors of the original scale, which included 22 items and 4 fac-
tors. This was done based on Clayton's observation in the original val-
idation study that the ﬁrst two factors (13 items) were the most
suitable to represent climate change anxiety [20,73]. An analogous
choice was made by Wullenkord and collaborators for the German
validation of the scale [70].
2.1.2. Sample size
In their scale validation study, Clayton and Karazsia [20] relied on
a sample of 200 participants. We opted to follow Nunnally who rec-
ommends an ideal ratio of 10 respondents per item [45]. As a result,
our a priori targeted sample size was at least 130 participants [9].
2.1.3. Participants
Participants were recruited using convenience and snowball sam-
pling methods, provided they met the following inclusion criteria:
age between 18 and 80 years old, Italian nationality, and residing in
Italy. Exclusion criteria included: illiteracy or inability to provide the
consent or to complete the survey online. On the basis of the method-
ology adopted, a set of 45 participants was initially selected to reduce
selection
bias
associated
with
the
non-probabilistic
sampling
method. The ﬁrst subjects were selected by sharing the research pro-
tocol in the University of Florence’s social spaces. Each participant
was then asked to choose ﬁve individuals and to send them the ques-
tionnaire. This recruitment procedure was carried out until satura-
tion of data.
In total, 150 Italian adults (67.4% female, 32.6% male, aged 19−76
years) were recruited after providing informed consent. The follow-
ing demographic and socio-economic data were collected: age, gen-
der, marital status, instruction, and profession. Of the original
sample, 134 participants correctly completed the survey, 11 partici-
pants did not complete the survey, and 5 missed at least one response
and were excluded from the study. Participants who correctly com-
pleted the survey were retested after three months, in order to verify
the stability of the construct of climate change anxiety over time. A
long-term retest interval was chosen to avoid bias due to short-term
retest interval (e.g. participants remembering the answers, motiva-
tional factors). Four participants did not complete the retest. The ﬁnal
sample was therefore composed of 130 subjects. Data were collected
from January to June 2021. The Google Forms platform was used for
data collection. This study protocol was approved by the Local Insti-
tution Ethics Committee.
2.2. Instruments
The scales used to assess the validity of CCAS in the original vali-
dation study were not validated in Italian. Therefore, a different set of
scales had to be chosen. Clayton showed a positive correlation
between CCAS and measures of anxiety and depression; therefore,
General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) was used to assess anxiety, and
The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K-10) was used for the
assessment of anxiety and depression. Since many authors described
a positive relationship between climate change anxiety and engage-
ment in pro-environmental behaviors [2,19,50]. New Environmental
Paradigm-Revised (NEP-R) and Pro-Environmental Behaviors Scale
(PEBS) were used to assess pro-environmental behaviors adopted by
the participants. Clayton’s construct also reported worse self-efﬁcacy
in subjects with climate change anxiety [20]. Perceived Empathic
Self-Efﬁcacy scale (PESE) / Perceived Social Self-Efﬁcacy sale (PSSE)
and General Self Efﬁcacy (GSE) were therefore used to evaluate self-
efﬁcacy.
2.2.1. Kessler Psychological Distress Scale
The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10; [38]) is a 10-item
self-administered questionnaire used to measure the level of psycho-
logical distress. For each item, the subject evaluates the frequency
with which he experienced the situation described on a 5-level
response scale (1: “none of the time”; 2: “a little of the time”; 3:
“some of the time”; 4: “most of the time”; 5: “all of the time”). The
sum of scores yields a range between 10 and 50 [3]. Suggested score
categories are: 10−19 (likely well), 20−24 (mild mental disorder), 25
−29 (moderate mental disorder), 30−50 (severe mental disorder)
[12,65]. K10 consists of four factors (Nervous, Negative Affect,
Fatigue, Agitation) and two second-order factors Depression and
Anxiety [14]. In this study, the two superordinate sub-scales were
used in order to explore the relationship between climate-change
anxiety and anxiety and depression, which has been described in the
original validation study [20]. K-10 has been validated in Italian,
showing good psychometric properties [17].

2.2.2. The new ecological paradigm scale-revised
The New Ecological Paradigm Scale-Revised (NEP-R) constructed
by Dunlap et al. [29] is an updated version of the New Ecological Par-
adigm Survey [28].
The revised NEP scale is used to document potential increases in
adoption of an ecological paradigm in world viewing, as well as to
analyze the effect of speciﬁc experiences and information in deter-
mining changes in this worldview [29].
The scale consists of ﬁfteen statements to which the subjects must
respond by expressing their degree of agreement or disagreement.
The seven even statements represent the "Dominant Social Para-
digm" (DSP), and the eight odd statements reﬂect the "New Environ-
mental Paradigm" (NEP) [29]. The scale has been validated in Italian
[48].
2.2.3. Pro-Environmental Behaviours Scale
The Pro-Environmental Behaviours Scale (PEBS; [40]) is a self-
administered questionnaire consisting of 19 items assessing ecologi-
cal behaviours (EBs). The Italian version of PEBS is a valid and reliable
questionnaire to investigate EBs [41].
2.2.4. The Perceived Empathic Self-Efﬁcacy Scale (PESE) and the
Perceived Social Self-Efﬁcacy Scale (PSSE)
The Perceived Empathic Self-Efﬁcacy Scale (PESE) and the Per-
ceived Social Self-Efﬁcacy Scale (PSSE) assess the beliefs of self-efﬁ-
cacy of individuals [72,16] with regard to both the empathic
response to the needs or feelings of others [7,15] and the manage-
ment of interpersonal relationships. The scale has been validated in
Italian. Cronbach’s a for the Italian version of PESE and PSSE was 0.78
−0.69 [25].
2.2.5. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7)
The Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7; [56]) consists of a
self-administered questionnaire used as a screening and evaluation
tool for the interference of Generalized Anxiety Disorders symptoms.
The seven elements evaluate feeling anxious or nervous; being
unable to stop or control worries; worrying too much about different
things; difﬁculty relaxing; being restless; becoming easily irritated or
irritable; and being afraid that something terrible might happen. The
questionnaire consists of twenty items, each of them representing a
state of mind or a physical sensation that the subject may have expe-
rienced.
2.2.6. Self-Efﬁcacy Scale (GSE)
The Self-Efﬁcacy Scale [52] consists of a self-administered ques-
tionnaire that evaluates general self-efﬁcacy. This cognitive construct
mirrors the generative capacity which aims to orient cognitive, social,
emotional and behavioral skills efﬁciently to pursue speciﬁc purposes
[6]. The scale was created to measure perceived self-efﬁcacy with the
aim of predicting how subjects would deal with daily problems and
adapt to their environment after experiencing various types of stress-
ful events [53]. Perceived self-efﬁcacy reﬂects a sense of optimistic
self-conﬁdence [54], i.e. the belief that one can perform a new or dif-
ﬁcult task, or be able to cope with adversity, in various domains of
human functioning.The Italian version of the scale showed a good
validity and acceptable reliability (Cronbach’s a between 0.7 and 0.8)
[51].
2.2.7. Climate Change Anxiety Scale (CCAS)
The Climate Change Anxiety Scale [20] is a self-report scale that
investigates self-perceived anxiety in relation to climate change.
Clayton's original version consisted of 22 items with a 4-factor struc-
ture; however, Clayton observed that the ﬁrst thirteen items and 2
factors were most useful for deﬁning climate change anxiety [20,43].
Therefore, a 13-item version comprising only the ﬁrst two factors
was used in the German validation study [43]. The scale consists of
13 statements in which the interviewee evaluates the frequency with
which he experiences the phenomenon described by the item along a
Likert scale from 1 to 5 where 1 = Never; 2 = Rarely; 3 = Sometimes;
4 = Often; 5 = Almost always. The CCAS is divided into two sub-scales:
cognitive and functional impairment. The cognitive impairment sub-
scale is composed of items such as “Thinking about climate change
makes it difﬁcult for me to concentrate” or “I go away by myself and
think about why I feel this way about climate change.” Cognitive
impairment refers to having trouble in remembering, learning new
things, concentrating, or making decisions that affect everyday life.
The second sub-scale investigates functional impairment by propos-
ing items such as “My concerns about climate change make it hard
for me to have fun with my family or friends.” or “My friends say I
think about climate change too much.” Functional impairment refers
to limitations due to the illness, as people with a disease may not
carry out certain functions in their daily lives.
2.3. Data analysis
Reliability was assessed by estimating Cronbach’s alpha coefﬁ-
cients for each subscale.
Convergent validity was assessed by evaluating the relationship,
estimated via sex and age-adjusted ANCOVA, between CCAS sub-
scales and GAD total mean scores, K-10 total mean scores, K10
depression and anxiety subscales mean scores, NEP new social para-
digm subscale.
Concurrent validity was assessed by evaluating the relationship,
estimated via sex and age-adjusted ANCOVA, between CCAS sub-
scales and GSE total score, NEP dominant paradigm subscale and Pro-
Environmental Behaviors measured via PEBS total score.
Test-retest reliability was estimated by evaluating absolute agree-
ment between two measures taken within three months’ time via
estimation of intraclass correlation coefﬁcient, two ways, mixed, for
mean values for each subscale.
A conﬁrmatory factor analysis was performed for the two-factor
model. In line with literature recommendations, it was decided to
use multiple ﬁtness indexes [57]. x2, CFI, RMSEA, and GFI were used.
The model is considered acceptable for RMSEA values lower than
0.08 [57]; moreover, it is possible to calculate a close ﬁt index that
evaluates the probability that the index is less than 0.08. The CFI is
considered acceptable if above 0.90 [20]. The GFI is considered
acceptable if it is above 0.90 [69].
The exploratory factor analysis was used to evaluate the alterna-
tive factor structure to the two-factor model. The scree test was used
to select the number of factors. The scree test consists of a graph that
represents the decreasing curve of the eigenvalues and allows the
selection of the factors that precede the ﬂattening of the curve [71].
This method has shown good reliability in identifying the strongest
eigenvalues, despite the subjectivity of the method [31]. On the other
hand, we did not choose to select the factors with an eigenvalue
greater than 1, since this method has been shown to select an exces-
sive number of factors [66].
Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS 25.0 and
AMOS 24 [4], with p values < 0.05 indicating statistical signiﬁcance.
3. Results
67.4% subjects were female, 32.6% were male. 19.3% subjects were
married, 5.2% had a stable partner, 1.4% were divorced, and 72.6%
were single. 86.2% of subjects were employed, 20% were students,
5.2% were unemployed. Six subjects did not complete high school
(4%), 40 subjects had a high school degree (30%), and 89 subjects had
an academic degree (66%). Mean age was 32.84§11.72 (19−76 years).
The average age of the sample was lower than the Italian average. All
subjects resided in Italy and were Italian native speakers. The sample
therefore excluded linguistic minorities present in Italy and non-

Italian speakers (for example, the German minority of Alto Adige and
the Slovenian minority of Venezia Giulia), as well as the non-native
Italian-speaking foreign population residing in Italy who, according
to ISTAT data in 2021, represents 8.5% of the population [https://
esploradati.censimentopopolazione.istat.it/ (Free Access) consulted
on 02/09/2021]. Of the total sample, 53% came from Central Italy, 24%
from Northern Italy, 23% from Southern Italy.
Mean, standard deviation and item-total correlation for each item
of each subscale is reported in Table 1.
Regarding reliability, Cronbach’s alpha coefﬁcient was 0.784 for
Cognitive Impairment subscale, and 0.728 for Functional Impairment
sub-scale.
Concerning convergent validity, CCAS cognitive impairment sub-
scale showed a positive correlation with GAD total score, K-10 total
score, K-10 depression subscale, K-10 anxiety sub-scale, NEP NSP
sub-scale (Table 2). CCAS functional impairment showed a positive
correlation with GAD total score (Table 3).
Regarding concurrent validity, a positive correlation was detected
between CCAS cognitive impairment and PEBS total score. CCAS cog-
nitive impairment sub-scale showed a negative correlation with NEP
DSP sub-scale, and GSE total score. CCAS functional impairment
showed a positive correlation with PEBS total score. CCAS functional
impairment subscale showed a negative correlation with GSE total
score.
ICC was 0.93 for Cognitive Impairment subscale and 0.88 for Func-
tional impairment sub-scale, showing good test-retest reliability.
The conﬁrmatory factor analysis for the two-factor model showed
x2(64)=199.104, p<0.001, leading to refusal of the null hypothesis.
The other indices calculated were: CFI = 0.754, RMSEA = 0.126 (0.106
−0.145, p close <0.001), GFI 0.830. Therefore, it was considered
appropriate to carry out an exploratory factor analysis to evaluate the
possibility of an alternative factor structure for the Italian version of
the CCAS.
Four factors with an eigenvalue greater than 1 were identiﬁed
(4.773, 1.224, 1.135, 1.023). The scree test showed the presence of a
single factor preceding the ﬂattening point of the graph (elbow point
after a factor) as shown in Fig. 1. This, coupled with the difﬁculty of
making sense of a four-factor model, lead to estimate a one-factor
model. The one-factor model explains 36% of the variance. The com-
monalities and saturations are shown in Table 4. All items correlated
positively with the single factor.
4. Discussion
This is, to the best of our knowledge, the ﬁrst study to report on
the Italian version of the CCAS. Reliability proved to be good for the
cognitive impairment sub-scale, and reasonable for the functional
impairment sub-scale [60], even if slightly lower than reliability
indexes of the original validation study.
Convergent validity proved to be good for the CCAS cognitive
impairment sub-scale, which correlated both with anxiety and
depression indexes, and indexes indicating awareness of environ-
mental issues. CCAS functional impairment proved to correlate with
general anxiety symptoms.
More pro-environmental behaviors are expected in subjects with
climate change anxiety. This was conﬁrmed by the results of the

present study, which showed that both CCAS subscales had a positive
correlation with PEBS total scores. Moreover, subjects with higher cli-
mate change anxiety proved to have lower self-efﬁcacy.
Test-retest reliability at a three-months evaluation proved to be
good.
No conﬁrmatory factor analysis for the two-factor model is avail-
able in the original article, which is focused on the original version of
the scale, involving 22 items and a 4-factor structure [19]. The
indexes calculated for the two-factor model for the Italian version of
the scale led to the hypothesis that a different factor structure could
provide better data ﬁtness. The possibility of a single-factor structure,
representing overall climate change anxiety, was therefore assessed.
All factor loadings for the single-factor model were greater than 0.4.
This cut-off was considered the rule of the thumb for acceptable fac-
tor loading [59]. Therefore, it is likely that it is more useful to consider
the total score of the scale in the Italian version as an indicator of the
levels of climate change anxiety.
The present study provides support for the psychometric proper-
ties of the Italian version of the Climate Change Anxiety Scale. Cli-
mate Change Anxiety Scale items exhibited reasonably good internal
consistency and validity, and the two-factor model showed adequate
data ﬁtness.
5. Limitations
The present study must be considered in light of some limitations.
The sample examined was not fully representative of the Italian pop-
ulation, as it presented an average age below that of the Italian popu-
lation and did not present an adequate representation of ethnic
minorities and non-native speakers. This could lead to a reduction in
the possibility of generalizing the observed results. Furthermore, no
exploratory factor analysis was conducted to evaluate possible alter-
natives to the two-factor structure proposed by Clayton. This deci-
sion, while justiﬁed by the desire to keep the tool as close as possible
to its original version, resulted in the adoption of a factorial structure
that only partially adheres to the observed data. Further studies are
therefore needed to evaluate possible alternative factorial structures
or to evaluate the psychometric properties of the scale in a larger
sample.
6. Relevance to clinical practice
The experience of climate change anxiety proved to be related to
anxiety, pro-environmental behaviors, and low perception of self-
efﬁcacy. This is in line with Clayton’s ﬁndings that climate change
anxiety is correlated with general anxiety [20] and with evidence
showing a direct relationship between climate anxiety and pro-envi-
ronmental behaviors [39]. Climate change is impacting global mental
health, a phenomenon which is expected to signiﬁcantly grow in the
next few years. For these reasons, it is fundamental to have a measure
of climate change anxiety in Italy in order to appropriately address
the psychological impact of climate change. This study should be fol-
lowed by more extensive research in order to evaluate the levels of
eco-anxiety within the Italian population. This would allow research-
ers to study the prevalence of climate change anxiety within a larger
and more representative sample, as well as its correlations with other
disorders and with different types of behaviors.
