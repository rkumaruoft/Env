A good deal of contemporary work in cultural evolutionary theory focuses
on the adaptive significance of culture. In this paper, we make the case that
scientifically accurate and politically feasible responses to the climate crisis
require a complex understanding of human cultural practices of niche con-
struction that moves beyond the adaptive significance of culture. We
develop thisthesis in two related ways. First, we argue that cumulative cultural
practices of niche construction can generate stable equilibria and runaway
selection processes that result in long-term existential risks within and across
cultural groups. We dub this the back of the invisible hand. Second, we argue
that the ability of cultural groups to innovate technological solutions to
environmental problems is highly constrained in ways that are exacerbated
by sustained intergroup conflict, inequality and by inherently unpredictable
cascades in climate change and human migration patterns. After developing
these theoretical points about human cultural practices of niche construction
in detail, we conclude our discussion with some tentative practical suggestions
about the way that cultural evolutionary history can more fruitfully be used in
efforts to remit the climate crisis and contribute to sustainable practices of
human climate change adaptation.
This article is part of the theme issue ‘Climate change adaptation needs a
science of culture’.
1. Introduction
Climate change is one of the most profound sources of existential risk in our
times. It threatens not just irreversible changes to the globe and to human life-
ways, but also potentially an end to our species. In scientific and political
spheres as well as the popular imagination, climate change has replaced nuclear
war as perhaps the most feared threat to our continued persistence [1].
Entangled in discussions of climate change are debates about its causes, conse-
quences and potential remedies. The concept of the Anthropocene, defined by
some as the age of human-induced (and geologically visible) global change, has
entered the popular imagination and scientific discourse [2]. There is widespread
agreement that much or most global climate change is human-induced, the
result of human activities on multiple scales, such as the emission of greenhouse
gases as a byproduct of energy extraction, deforestation and other commercial
activities [3]. The consequences of human-induced climate change are difficult to
predict, but substantial scientific effort has been put towards predicting a point-
of-no-return rate of global warming that the global community must work to
avoid. Because the relationships between human activities and global warming
are complex, substantial effort has also been put towards understanding the
input–output relationships between these activities and the climate. This work,
in turn, has informed discussions of how we might slow the rate of warming
through various national or international policies, as well as other means of
responding to or mitigating the harmful effects of climate change.
There is debate over the causes of climate change, with some arguing that it
is not caused by humans at all [4]. However, the majority view of scientists is

that climate change is at least in part caused by human
activity [3]. Some have appealed to the biological concept
of niche construction [5] as a useful theoretical framework
for
understanding
the
reciprocal
relationships
between
human activity and climate change [6,7]. We agree that this
is a useful perspective, and it is the one we adopt here.
For reasons that we will explain, the centrality of niche con-
struction in our evolutionary history gives neither reason for
optimism nor pessimism about the future of human welfare
in the Anthropocene. It merely posits that humans and ‘the
environment’ are not separate realms or compartments, but
mutually co-constituted. Thus, our activities do (partly) con-
struct the environments in which we live, and vice versa—but
this insight alone does not tell us whether our activities
doom us, or not. For this, we need better understanding of
the causal dynamics of niche construction processes, which
evolutionary theory can provide.
A good deal of contemporary work in cultural evolutionary
theory focuses on the adaptive significance of culture. This, in
turn, leads to what we will call—following Gould & Lewontin
[8]—a Panglossian tendency in some views of human adapta-
bility. Cultural evolution theorists rightly point to the role
that human cultural capacities can play in driving human adap-
tation, making us smarter, more cooperative, and, in some
contexts, particularly prosperous [9–11]. A popular trope in
this literature is to point to the many ways that human cultural
groups have adapted to seemingly extreme environments, such
as deserts or the arctic, accompanied by tales of how outsiders
lacking the relevant cultural knowledge suffer and die—a com-
forting view of culture as, literally, a life saver. Indeed, cultural
evolution theorists have proposed that climate change itself was
one of the primary drivers of the evolution of uniquely human
abilities of cultural learning and adaptation—making climate
change possibly the very raison d’être of human adaptability
[12,13]. Although cultural evolutionists are well aware of the
potential of cultural evolutionary processes leading to mal-
adaptive outcomes—which we discuss in greater detail
below—the Panglossian tendency is distinctly visible in some
discussions of contemporary climate change adaptation,
where it is argued that human cultural adaptability will save
us, just as it has in the past [14].1
Within this Panglossian perspective, culture is seen to act
as a kind of invisible hand that produces evolutionary
optimal outcomes for cultural group members although those
outcomes were not intended or foreseen by those group mem-
bers. Applied to the particular case of climate change, the
Panglossian perspective suggests laissez-faire polices of climate
intervention in which we are better off letting cultural evolution
run its course in finding effective solutions to the climate crisis
independently of any intentional changes in collective action or
political organization.
In what follows, we will offer a critique of the Panglossian
tendency in cultural evolution, and we will highlight the power
of cultural practices to generate existential risks both within
and across cultural groups. Our aim is not to dispute the cen-
trality of natural selection in the evolutionary process, nor to
dispute the role of culture in the course of human evolutionary
history and within contemporary human lifeways. Instead, our
aim is to motivate a nuanced view of cultural evolutionary
dynamics—one according to which cultural evolutionary
dynamics can at once increase our ability to adapt while at
the same time generate a host of undesirable outcomes, from
misery to extinction. In this respect, we will argue that nothing
in the cultural evolutionary process itself guarantees human
wellbeing or a harmonious fit between human communities
and their environments. For that, we need something else
that goes beyond the confines of evolutionary theory.
We will begin by saying more about niche construction and
cultural evolutionary theory. We then explore the upsides and
downsides of evolutionary dynamics in a human niche-con-
structed world, and what we might or might not expect
those dynamics to produce. Building on these considerations,
we close the paper by drawing some conclusions about the
need for policy and intentional interventions in the dynamical
cultural systems that have produced the Anthropocene.
2. Niche construction and cumulative cultural
evolution
Odling-Smee, Laland and Feldman describe niche construction
as the set of processes whereby ‘organisms, through their
metabolism, their activities, and their choices, define, partly
create, and partly destroy their own niches’ ([5], p. 641). Here
we will not concern ourselves too much with what a niche is,
beyond just the environment itself. Our focus is on niche con-
struction as the reciprocal causal interplay between humans,
their activities and the global environment—since the ‘niche’
being constructed or modified by humans encompasses the
entire biosphere.
A central concept for understanding Anthropogenic
global climate change is that of cumulative cultural evolution.
Cultural evolution refers to changes over time in human prac-
tices, ideas, customs and beliefs. This is essentially the same
as human history, but with a focus on evolutionary dynamics
that shape historical trends, including dynamics of adap-
tation to environments through, for example, the cultural
analogue of natural selection acting on human practices
and beliefs through their impacts on survival and reproduc-
tion [15]. Cumulative cultural evolution refers to processes
whereby human practices, knowledge and technologies
increase in complexity over time [16]. In the case of human
niche construction during the Anthropocene, there is a literal
interpretation of the ‘accumulation’ of human culture and its
products, as seen by the increasing piling-up of human-made
stuff across the face of the earth [17].
Cultural evolutionary theorists often point to the bright
side of human cultural capacities as the ‘secret of our success’
[10]. On this view, our species’ unprecedented expansion to
inhabit virtually the entire globe is due to our remarkable
capacities for cultural learning, cultural transmission and
innovation that constantly add to the accumulated store of
cultural knowledge. Our ability to wield culture in this way
is indeed one of the main sources of our remarkable
powers of global transformation. It is at the same time the
very source of the human-induced predicament in which
we find ourselves, making us, perhaps ironically, the victims
of our own success as well. Our ‘success’ as a global species is
the primary cause of human-induced climate change. More-
over, as many critical commentators on the Anthropocene
literature have pointed out, this ‘success’ has been both
asymmetrically produced and asymmetrically experienced
by different groups of people across the globe, as we discuss
further below [1,18,19].
From the perspective of cultural evolutionary theory, cul-
tural learning and transmission are the primary means by

which we adapt to our environments. This occurs through
processes of individual variation and learning coupled with
social transmission of knowledge and behaviour across indi-
viduals and generations. Cumulative culture, which allows
each of us to receive huge masses of cultural knowledge
accumulated by generations before us, is also a source of con-
tinuous change. For example, technologies for agriculture
and food resource extraction become ever-more sophisticated
over
time,
supporting
larger
populations
and
creating
selection for continuous improvement and innovation.
This takes us to cumulative processes of niche construction.
All living things modify and construct their environments
through their metabolic processes and through their inter-
actions with things that reside outside the spatial boundaries
created by those metabolic processes [20]. In this sense, niche
construction is extremely widespread in the biological world.
But some processes of niche construction are cumulative in
the sense that the activities of one generation in a population
have lasting, and sometimes dynamically changing, effects
on the selective environments inherited by subsequent gener-
ations within that population. The mounds built by some
species of termites have this cumulative character: the activity
of mound building in one generation is inherited by the next
generation, which in turn can make changes to the structure
of the mound.
Cumulative niche construction has played a central role in
human evolutionary history. To take a particular example, tech-
nologies for producing more and better-quality foodcan support
population growth. Population growth leads to demands for
more food and to a stronger selective environment for both
innovations in food technology and ever-increasing resource
extraction (deforestation, animal husbandry) in a self-feeding
spiral. In this way, cumulative processes of niche construction
can generate a situation in which cultural agents come to
modify their environments in an ever-accelerating, runaway
fashion [21,22]. The ever-accelerating character of central pro-
cesses of cumulative cultural niche construction is arguably the
source of the ‘great acceleration’ in population, technology and
resource extraction that has been documented by theorists of
the Anthropocene [2]. Many indices of this great acceleration,
such as global use of fossil fuels, continue to accelerate upward
with no sign of a plateau or inflection point in sight.
An extensive body of research has revealed import connec-
tions between cultural adaptation and climatic instability. This
work has documented that human evolution took place in the
context of a changing climate [17,23], that the need to respond
to temporal and spatial variation in climates has been among
the selective pressures responsible for complex cognition and
flexibility in the human behavioural repertoire, and, in particu-
lar, that culture evolved in our lineage at least in part because it
allowed rapid adaptation within unpredictable climates [13].
Against this backdrop, Panglossian views of cultural evol-
ution can seem appealing. In particular, it can be tempting to
suppose that cultural processes will generate effective sol-
utions to problems of climate change without the need for
explicit policy interventions or intentional changes in our
practices of collective action. Market-based versions of this
perspective hold that human ingenuity finds solutions to pro-
blems without the need for any top–down orchestration or
coercion; individuals, or firms, merely acting in their own
self-interest will find solutions because it is in their interest
to do so [24]. Similarly, it can be tempting to suppose that cul-
tural evolutionary processes will produce group-beneficial
solutions to climate change dilemmas. After all, there exist
formal evolutionary models that show that group-beneficial
outcomes can, sometimes, be produced by processes of cul-
tural evolution—typically through an added ingredient of
‘cultural group selection’, driven by competition between
groups [25]. Within such a perspective, culture operates
as a kind of ‘invisible hand’, to borrow Adam Smith’s meta-
phor [26], which produces evolutionarily optimal outcomes
for group members although those outcomes were not
necessarily intended or foreseen by those group members.
However, as cultural evolutionary theorists are aware,
group-beneficial outcomes are not guaranteed by, or even a
likely outcome of, cultural evolutionary processes except in
very special circumstances [9]. Indeed, as we describe below,
culture can be a source of both group-specific maladaptation but
also across-group existential risk. We will first describe these
undesirable features of cultural evolutionary processes. We
then argue that these downsides of cultural evolutionary
dynamics are important for understanding feasible policies
of climate-change remission.
3. Culture as a source of existential risk: the back
of the invisible hand
Natural selection refers to the processes whereby variants in a
population have a particular distribution because of the contri-
bution of those variants to the relative success, or ‘fitness’, of
the members of the population. It has long been known that
these processes need not produce outcomes that are beneficial
for all for even most members of the population, and can even
produce outcomes, including stable equilibria, that are sub-
optimal for everyone. Processes of runaway selection, for
example, can lead to the evolution of costly traits, such as
weaponry or ornamentation, that benefit some individuals
relative to others but that are a net cost to everyone. This
can occur between groups or species as well. Biologists have
documented cases of antagonistic coevolution between males
and females in the same species, and in arms races between
predators and prey or hosts and parasites, where members
within or across species pay substantial costs because of the
inescapable nature of their conflicts [27]. In principle, runaway
selection due to within-species competition can even lead to
extinction [28].
The evolution of harmful or costly traits can also occur in
cultural evolution. Cultural norms and practices can spread
and become stabilized in a population even when they
impose a net cost on the people who adopt them. Anthropol-
ogists have argued that certain forms of ‘costly signal’, such
as costly signals of religious devotion or group membership,
can spread and become stabilized through competitive arms
races in which individuals compete to demonstrate in increas-
ingly harder-to-fake ways what their displays signal [29,30].
Revenge cycles are another form of self-perpetuating and
arguably harmful cultural practice, which can form self-stabi-
lizing cultural equilibria from which individuals cannot opt
out without potentially paying an even higher cost [31,32].2
Runaway selection refers to self-feeding evolutionary spirals
that can occur either within populations—as in the escalation
of costly signals—or between them, as in the case of arms
races from which neither side can unilaterally back down
without risking annihilation.

Crucially, in all of these cases natural selection is occur-
ring, and technically, some form of adaptation is occurring
too. For example, costly signals of religious devotion can be
and are regarded by evolutionary theorists as cultural adap-
tations to particular social circumstances [29,30]. Similarly,
attitudes and values that lead to violence in so-called ‘cul-
tures
of
honour’
could
be
regarded
as
adaptive
if
individuals are better off adhering to them than disregarding
them in the local cultural context [31,32]. There are several
key points about what ‘adaptation’ means in this context
that are important for our understanding of adaptation in
the context of the Anthropocene.3
First, in an evolutionary context, adaptation is a technical
concept that is not equivalent to wellbeing, flourishing or
happiness. For example, both reactive and premeditated (or
proactive) aggression can be adaptive for humans and yet
they often result in outcomes that
significantly reduce
humans’ all-things-considered wellbeing. Questions of what is
evolutionarily adaptive can come apart from questions of
peoples’ subjective preferences and experiences, and from
questions of objective harm to individuals, groups or the
environment. In a cultural context, some people might regard
some cases of self-harm or harm to others as pleasurable or vir-
tuous (e.g. revenge killing), and it could even be adaptive in the
evolutionary sense (an option that increases chances of survival
or avoiding a greater harm). In other cases, cultural dynamics
might lock communities into cycles that they might prefer to
escape if they could—and/or, the community could be ‘better
off’ in some objective sense without the harmful practices.
A second and related point about adaptation in the evol-
utionary sense is that what is ‘adaptive’ is defined locally, in
the sense that an organism acting adaptively would not have
higher fitness (survival and reproduction) in the local context
if it chose to do something else. This means that evolving sys-
tems can get stuck or trapped in sub-optimal equilibria that
selection alone will not get them out of [21]. Communities
stuck in cycles of violence might prefer to escape, but find
themselves unable to do so. At larger scales, societies or
other cultural systems could be stuck in sub-optimal equili-
bria. For example, the healthcare system in the USA might
be regarded as a sub-optimal configuration of options that
most participants would prefer to be otherwise, but individ-
uals and even groups cannot change it without a critical mass
of intentional action.4
This second point is particularly important in the case of
climate change. Cultural practices that perpetuate harmful
environmental effects such as excessive emission of greenhouse
gases could be a self-reinforcing stable equilibrium in which all
actors are doing what is ‘best’ for them, or perceived as best,
given their set of choices. In such cases, the cost for individuals
or cultural groups to unilaterally defect from their current
policy of actions can seem to outweigh the benefits associated
with any alternative courses of action. Relatedly, cultural learn-
ing itself can make cultural groups increasingly unsuited to
adaptively respond to environmental variation. This can be
because cultural change does not always take place rapidly
enough to cope with environmental change—there can be sig-
nificant temporal lags between environmental change and
cultural change [12,36]. But more centrally, strategies of cultural
transmission such as conformist learning can cause a cultural
group to adopt policies of action that are so unsuited for
the changes taking place in their environment that they result
in that cultural group going extinct [37].
Situations in which individual agents acting in their own
interest produce a group-level harm have come to be called
‘tragedies of the commons’ [38–41]. Structurally similar situ-
ations arise in the collective behaviour of cultural groups.
In such cases, group-level behaviour that is acquired through
adaptive strategies of social learning can produce outcomes
that are harmful not just for that group but for other
groups as well. We refer to these situations of individual
and collective behaviour as the ‘back of the invisible hand’,
because they consist of scenarios in which the pursuit of
local individual and cultural group goods produces out-
comes that make those individual and cultural groups
worse off than they would otherwise be.
4. The cultural evolution of the Anthropocene
Anthropogenic climate change is the result of cumulative cul-
tural practices of human niche construction [6,7,21,42]. We
here do not want to take a stand on the ongoing debates
about exactly when human practices of niche construction
began to impact global climate patterns. Instead, our aim in
this section is to briefly highlight the ways in which the char-
acter and the scale of these practices of niche construction
derive from patterns of cultural evolution gone bad, or
what we have called the back of the invisible hand of culture.
As we noted at the outset of our discussion, all living
organisms engage in some form of niche construction. How-
ever, the character of human practices of niche construction is
quite different from those displayed by other living animals.
The emergence of human agricultural practices provides a
useful example [43]. We clear and modify landscapes and
soil in order to plant crops or provide pasture to domesti-
cated animals. This has profound and reciprocally related
effects on both the nature of underlying environments and
the agents that occupy those constructed environments. Agri-
cultural practices result in changes to the global climate as
ecosystems are converted to farmland and through the
byproducts that agriculture produces, which are estimated
to constitute 15% or more of global anthropogenic green-
house gas emissions [44]. Another example of a human-
specific practice of niche construction is the much-discussed
case of fossil fuel use. In each of these cases, it was through
cultural means that these practices of environmental exploita-
tion and modification were discovered and perpetuated. And
in each case, what we see are not just single causal ‘steps’ but
a cumulative spiral of changes in which practices of environ-
mental interaction have been preserved and incrementally
updated over time.
This takes us to the scale of human practices of niche con-
struction. Agricultural practices changed within cultural
communities, often in the direction of increasing the yield
and size of agricultural practices, which in turn increased the
size of the populations they support. The result is an accelera-
tion in the amount and degree of landscape transformed.
Likewise, fossil fuel use has increased at staggering rates
since the industrial revolution and particularly within the
past century. Annual CO2 emissions are currently estimated
to be around 35 billion tons per year—up from 6 billion tons
per year in 1960 [45].
The rapidly accelerating character and scale at work of
these practices of niche construction are a sign of a self-feeding,
autocatalytic
system—one
that

not

to
be

4
self-correcting (though we may face limits as the amounts of
remaining land and fossil fuels available to convert approach
zero) [2]. Importantly, however, the factors generating this
self-feeding niche construction resemble a tragedy of the com-
mons, where no individual, firm or nation has an incentive to
scale back consumption or production. Indeed, the incentive
structures of capitalism and global competition push in the
opposite direction.
Processes of competition occur at different scales, among
different entities and for different reasons. Within nation-
states, for example, there is competition between firms for
economic growth, and to capture percentages of consumer
markets—forces
that
drive
niche-constructing
processes
such as agriculture, resource extraction, manufacturing and
energy consumption. There is competition between individ-
uals that can drive similar processes, as is seen in the
competition for real estate and housing that drives up
prices, feeds endless cycles of renovation, and expands
cities to cover larger and larger areas, with the corresponding
construction of infrastructure to support the expansion
(among the figures originally used to support the idea of a
‘great acceleration’ worldwide were data on the accelerating
number of McDonald’s restaurants around the globe [46]).
Between nation-states, too, there is competition for
political power, growth, and the extraction and control of
resources. While these processes are often co-extensive with
processes of competition between individuals and firms,
between-state competition has the added downside that it
can prevent state policies, even if well-intentioned, from
reaching optimal global solutions. Competition at all of
these levels comes with the challenges of unilateral defection
that are characteristic of collective action problems, and that
produce tragedies of the commons [40]. Even if some states,
for example, adopt policies to cap greenhouse gas emissions
in an effort to curb global warming, other states might choose
not to, and/or to help national industries find workarounds
to international treaties to benefit local economic growth.
Troublingly,
intentional
policies to
incentivize
good
behaviour by firms, nations and individuals can sometimes
create perverse incentives that can make the situation
worse, as some case studies of resource management have
shown [47,48]. Empirically, seemingly well-intentioned pol-
icies designed to shift incentives often do not produce the
desired outcomes. For example, carbon offset programmes
have been shown to produce an excess of credits for projects
that do not actually reduce emissions, for a variety of reasons
having to do with the very incentive structures created by the
policies [49]. A lesson from this is that the dynamics of natu-
ral selection in economic markets can indeed produce
‘adaptation’, but often not of the kind we want—despite
deliberate, scientifically informed efforts at control. The invis-
ible hand is strong here, and it does not push in the direction
we would like.
5. Lessons for policies of climate change
adaptation
What lessons does the foregoing have for effective policies
of climate change adaptation? We will close by offering two
primary lessons. The first concerns the need for clarity
about the outcomes that policies of climate-change adap-
tation are trying to promote. The second concerns the
importance of structural interventions that reflect contingent
details of political history and material inequality in provid-
ing cross-cultural means of environmental safeguards and
fossil-fuel reduction.
First, on the need for clarity about climate-change adap-
tation concerns. As we noted in §3, adaptation is a technical
concept in evolutionary theory. Adaptation in this technical
sense pertains to the process whereby the frequency or distri-
bution of traits in a population—be they biological, cultural,
or some other kind of trait—change over time in ways
that make the members of that population differentially
better able to survive and reproduce. But the term ‘adaptation’
can also be used to denote other types of relations that hold
between individuals in a population and the environments in
which those individuals live. For instance, ‘adaptation’ could
refer to the extent to which individuals adopt practices of
environmental interaction that better satisfy their preferences
or desires than alternative practices of environmental inter-
action. Alternatively, ‘adaptation’ could refer to the extent
to which individuals in a population adopt practices of
environmental interaction that increase their individual and
collective wellbeing in either the current generation or in
subsequent generations.
These senses of the term ‘adaptation’ are not equivalent,
and a population could become adapted in one of these
senses without thereby becoming adapted in the others. Discus-
sion of climate-change adaptation would benefit from a more
careful elucidation of the specific type or types of adaptation
that are being sought after and that policies are intending
to promote.
We strongly suspect that it is not adaptation in the techni-
cal biological sense that is at issue in the search for policies of
climate-change adaptation. For one thing, adaptation in the
biological sense is a purely local or within-population process.
And yet, we take it that policies of climate-change adaptation
are not purely local in this way. For instance, we assume that
most policymakers would endorse a firm constraint accord-
ing to which their policies of climate-change adaptation
should be selected so as to minimize the extent to which
those policies reduce the survival and reproductive prospects
of members of other populations.
Instead, we suspect that many discussions of climate-
change adaptation centre on a notion of adaptation that per-
tains to relations of human (and broader ecological) wellbeing
or flourishing. After all, policies of climate-change adaptation
are generally not designed merely to promote survival and
reproduction but also to promote the ability of the members
of populations to function, develop and thrive. In this sense,
while climate-change adaptation is partly about the perpetu-
ation of human and other organismic life, it is also, or should
be, about the perpetuation of the quality and character of those
lives.
There is a long-standing set of debates concerning the status
of interpersonal comparisons of wellbeing and the extent to
which such notions of wellbeing can or cannot be measured
or otherwise modelled [50]. We will not try to settle such
debates here, although we are sympathetic to approaches that
model wellbeing in terms of the ability of agents to develop a
distinctive set of capabilities in the ecological and cultural
environments in which those agents are embedded [51–53].
Our central point is the need to recognize the potential concep-
tual slippage between biological notions of ‘adaptation’ and a
variety of broader notions of ‘adaptation’ and the need for

increased theoretical reflection and debate about the features
that make lives—human or otherwise—go well. As we have
argued, the factors that increase the wellbeing of a living
thing or its descendants do not straightforwardly reduce to fac-
tors that increase biological or cultural fitness. This is not to
deny that evolutionary theory has much to contribute to an
understanding of how we might best respond to the climate
crisis. But in so doing, evolutionary theorists will need to
move beyond the narrow focus on biological adaptation or cul-
tural group selection and consider the dynamics associated
with a broader array of organism–environment relations.
We close now with our second lesson for policies of
climate-change adaptation. We have argued that human prac-
tices
of niche
construction
do not
invariably
produce
outcomes that are adaptive in either the narrow sense of
increasing the ability of agents to survive and reproduce or
in the broad sense of increasing the character and quality of
those agents’ lives. In this sense, we have emphasized the
contingency of evolutionary processes in producing outcomes
that are all-things-considered beneficial to the lives of
humans and other organisms.
Our argument provides a general theoretical rationale
for the need for planned policies of climate-change adap-
tation.
More
specifically,
our
argument
highlights
the
importance of polices of climate-change adaptation that
seek to introduce structural interventions into current practices
of human environmental interaction.
Technological innovations pertaining to the introduction of
novel sources of energy and energy storage—or, alternatively,
to novel means of CO2 reduction—clearly do have important
roles to play in global policies of climate-change adaptation
[54]. However, our argument in this paper raises an acute chal-
lenge to those who would maintain that such technological
innovations will arise in the context of open market national
economies or as the natural byproduct of human cultural pro-
gress more generally (cf. [24]). For as we have already noted,
economic competition between and within cultural groups
(whether those groups are nations, corporations or groups of
other
kinds)
generates
incentive
structures
that
favour
already-established practices of energy production and con-
sumption. These pressures from cultural group competition
are amplified by the fact that the effects of climate change are
inherently unpredictable. This is especially true in light of
what have been called climate-change cascades [55–57], in
which one type of environmental effect not only triggers
another type of environmental effect but also triggers changes
in human patterns of migration and intergroup relations. These
climate-change cascades can be expected to have profound
effects
on
economic
markets
and
the
ability
of
such
markets—unstructured by top–down regulations and protec-
tions—to generate technological innovations that serve to
remit the climate crisis.
The question of which kinds of structural interventions are
both politically feasible and environmentally effective is the
subject of an enormous amount of current research, including
many of the papers in this issue [58–62]. It is well beyond the
scope of our discussion to assess the relative strengths and
weaknesses of these policy proposals. However, we do want
to note the ways in which a focus on the contingency of the
effects of culturally driven human niche construction under-
scores an often-cited political constraint on policies of
climate-change adaptation—namely, that cultural groups and
historical
entities
(states,
corporations,
etc.)
that
have
contributed more to the problem, should contribute more to
viable solutions to the problem [18,55,63].
As many critical commentators in the literature on
climate change and the Anthropocene have pointed out,
human-induced climate change has neither been uniformly
caused by the human population across the globe, nor have
its negative consequences been uniformly suffered. Anthro-
pogenic climate change has disproportionately been the
result of the activities of some cultural lineages rather than
others. In particular, cultural lineages in the Global North
(and especially in the USA) have contributed significantly
more to the problem than those in the Global South. And
many of the worst consequences of the global evolution of
the Anthropocene have been or will be suffered by nations
and people that have been subject to colonial rule and imper-
ialistic practices [17,18]. Resources have long been and
continue to be extracted from the poor and marginalized to
improve the comfort and welfare of the wealthy and power-
ful—often on purpose. As the Anthropocene proceeds,
resources become depleted, and the livability and economic
potentials of different parts of the earth shift, these differen-
tial impacts of human-induced niche construction will
continue to proliferate. For example, the melting of Arctic
sea ice will be an economic boon to some, and a source of
misery, death and displacement for others [64]. Here, too,
economic and political power seems likely to accelerate
rather than dampen the harmful dynamical processes of
niche construction during the Anthropocene.
We believe that these historical facts about the cultural
evolution of the Anthropocene provide support for those
who have called for climate change reparations that provide
economic support and tractable means of fossil-fuel reduction
and environmental safeguards to communities that have
been subject to colonial rule and imperialistic practices
[18,55,63]. Whatever the fate of this specific policy proposal,
we take our argument to show any discussion of policies of
climate change adaptation is incomplete without a recog-
nition of the roles of colonialism and imperialism in
shaping the current geopolitical landscape [65].
6. Conclusion
Culture may well be the secret to humans’ remarkable success
in geographical range and distribution. But culture also gives
rise to outcomes that generate substantial risks to the character
and quality of the lives of humans and other living organisms.
The Anthropocene provides a vivid case in point. A recognition
of the role of human cumulative cultural evolution—and of
human cultural niche construction—in the rise of the Anthro-
pocene leads to a more nuanced understanding of both the
prospects and the perils of cultural evolution. More signifi-
cantly, we have argued that taking seriously the sometimes
negative
and
harmful
aspects
of
cultural
evolutionary
dynamics is an important addendum to discussions of
climate-change adaptation, and is crucial for a realistic under-
standing of the conditions under which climate-change
adaptation is likely to occur. While cultural evolution and
adaptation are important concepts for understanding the situ-
ation in which we find ourselves with respect to climate
change, it may be more fruitful to regard cultural evolutionary
dynamics as a set of constantly moving structural constraints
within which intentional efforts at change must be enacted.

1For example, consider the following passage from Lomborg [14,
p.159], which strikes us as Panglossian to the point of absurdity:
‘This is why we need to adapt to a warmer planet over the coming dec-
ades. Fortunately, humanity has remarkable adaptive capacity. There
are people living in the icy extremes of Siberia and northern
Canada, in the burning hot Sahel desert and Australian Outback, in
the dry Atacama desert plateau of South America, and in the rain-
soaked Meghalaya state in India. Not only do people withstand signifi-
cant variations in temperature and rainfall, but falling per capita death
rates from natural disasters show that we have more resilience today
than ever before. At its simplest, adaptation means that people react
sensibly to challenges—in our case, to a changing climate. As it gets
warmer, more people will adapt by turning on their air conditioners
(and fewer will use their heaters). If they don’t yet have an air condi-
tioner, more people will buy one (and more people will be able to buy
one as global prosperity increases). Similarly, tourists will adapt to a
warming world by changing their travel destinations. Warm places
like Sri Lanka will host fewer tourists. On the other hand, more visitors
will choose Finland and Canada for their next holiday, while fewer
Finns and Canadians will travel abroad’.
2We note, however, that the question of whether cultural practices are
harmful and to whom can be complex and to answer, and percep-
tions of those inside or outside the community might not be
sufficient to answer it [33].
3Jones et al. [34] discuss the ‘negative valence’ of adaptation associ-
ated with the view that adaptation is a secondary line of defense
once efforts at mitigation have failed. Here we focus on an even
more negative aspect of the concept of adaptation: adaptation, in
the biological sense, can be terrible for individuals, groups and every-
one else. We attempt to explain what we mean by this perverse, but
important, implication of adaptation by natural selection.
4Wilson et al. [35] distinguish between ‘Type 1’ complex adaptive sys-
tems (CAS1), which are ‘adaptive as systems’, (e.g. the immune
system), and ‘Type 2’ complex adaptive systems (CAS2) that are
‘composed of agents following their respective adaptive strategies’
(they cite ecosystems as an example). They point out that ‘there is
little awareness that CAS2 systems can be profoundly maladaptive
as whole systems’, echoing our point here.
