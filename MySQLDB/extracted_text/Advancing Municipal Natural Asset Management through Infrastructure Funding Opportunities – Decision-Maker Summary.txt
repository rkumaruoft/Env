Decision-Makers Summary Series
This summary is part of a series designed to provide local governments with easy-to-access 
information to help with adoption of municipal natural asset management. These summaries 
have been drawn from five reports published by the MNAI between 2017-2019. Copies of these 
reports and complete lists of sources are available at: www.mnai.ca. Municipal decision-makers, 
staff with responsibility for managing municipal assets, and financial and accounting staff will find 
the information helpful in building and scaling up their own municipal natural asset management 
efforts. Further, it may be of interest to asset managers in provincial and federal governments, 
natural resource companies, and universities as early evidence suggests municipal natural asset 
management approaches can be adapted in other decision-making contexts.1   
This summary reviews six of Canada’s major infrastructure funding programs through the lens 
of a manager seeking to fund a municipal natural asset project. It identifies key considerations 
in determining project eligibility and terms of funding, alongside an easy-to-use overview of the 
programs. It also provides further observations pertaining to their relevance for municipal natural 
asset management, including funded projects.

The Municipal Natural Assets 
Initiative (MNAI) is changing the 
way Canadian municipalities deliver 
everyday services, increasing 
the quality and resilience of 
infrastructure at often lower costs 
and reduced risk. The MNAI team 
provides scientific, economic and 
municipal expertise to support local 
governments in identifying, valuing 
and accounting for natural assets 
in their financial planning and asset 
management programs, and in

4 | MNAI – Advancing Municipal Natural Asset Management through Infrastructure Funding Opportunities
Introduction 
Canadian local governments are seeking new strategies to deliver their core services in more financially 
and environmentally sustainable ways, including turning to infrastructure asset management as a key tool 
to manage infrastructure. Municipalities are increasingly recognizing that natural assets
 such as aquifers, forests, streams and foreshores can provide equivalent or better services to many 
engineered assets. Municipal natural asset management offers a sustainable solution to the multifaceted 
problems of supplying municipal services in the face of aging infrastructure, urban growth, and declining 
budgets. As this approach is being implemented in a growing number of Canadian municipalities, it 
is important to support the development of best practices and an understanding of how to facilitate 
widespread adoption of municipal natural asset management. 
Growing evidence of the value proposition of municipal natural asset management provides the rationale 
for funding of natural assets through infrastructure funding programs. Infrastructure funding programs are 
designed to deliver and improve services for communities. Investing in natural assets and the management 
of natural assets is often a cost-effective approach. However, eligibility requirements, such as the 
restricting of funding to tangible capital assets under some infrastructure programs, can make it potentially 
more difficult to fund specific investments in natural assets projects and natural asset management. This 
summary provides an overview of Canada’s major infrastructure funding programs that offer potential 
opportunities to fund municipal natural asset management.     
Advancing Municipal Natural Asset Management 
through Infrastructure Funding Opportunities
A survey of federally-funded infrastructure programs was undertaken to assess current opportunities for 
funding municipal natural asset management in Canada. The results identified six infrastructure funding 
programs including:
•	 Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program - Green Infrastructure Stream
•	 Disaster Mitigation and Adaptation Fund 
•	 Canada Infrastructure Bank
•	 Federal Gas Tax Fund
•	 Green Municipal Fund
•	 Municipalities for Climate Innovation Program 
The review of these opportunities included considering whether the program restricted funding to tangible 
capital assets as currently defined by the Public Sector Accounting Board (Box 1), or includes natural 
infrastructure as a capital asset. The survey also reviewed eligible expenditures, assessments required, 
minimum cost thresholds, project bundling opportunities, delivery of funding and matching funds required. 
These features are summarized for each of the programs in Table 1. These features are summarized in 
Table 1.

Box 1: Tangible Capital Assets and Natural Assets
The definition of tangible capital assets under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles of the Public 
Sector Accounting Board currently excludes from recognition inherited natural resources such as forests, 
water, and mineral resources, in part on the presumption that the costs, benefits, and economic value of 
such items cannot be reasonably and verifiably quantified using existing methods. 
Current accounting standards allow recognition only for purchased natural assets where they meet certain 
criteria.

Relevance for Municipal Natural Asset Management
Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program – Green 
Infrastructure Stream
The Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program (ICIP) is delivered by Infrastructure Canada (INFC) 
and implemented through INFC’s Integrated and Bilateral Agreements with provincial and territorial 
governments. The Green Infrastructure funding stream has three sub-streams: (i) climate change 
mitigation; (ii) adaptation, resilience, and disaster mitigation; and, (iii) environmental quality. For the 
purpose of accessing ICIP funds, INFC now considers natural assets as capital assets under this funding 
program. While natural assets do not generally qualify directly under the Public Sector Accounting Board’s 
“tangible capital assets” above, INFC is broadening its definition of capital assets to include natural 
infrastructure. Under the ICIP, natural infrastructure refers to the use of naturally occurring resources (e.g. 
aquifer, wetland, forest, shoreline etc.) and the engineered use of natural resources (e.g. green roofs, rain 
gardens, trees), to deliver infrastructure services or to complement grey infrastructure services, or to adapt 
public infrastructure to the impacts of climate change and climate-related disaster mitigation.3 Further, 
natural asset projects have the potential to meet more than one of the required Green Infrastructure 
stream outcomes. This makes the ICIP’s Green Infrastructure Stream a strongly viable source of funding 
for municipal natural asset projects. However, land acquisition is not eligible, meaning that natural assets 
must already be publicly owned or must be purchased through separate funding.
Examples of relevant funded projects include4:
•	 Reclamation and Naturalization of Existing Urban Watercourses Rehabilitation Plan Preparation – 
London, Ontario (ON).
•	 Reduce Lake Erie phosphorus loading rehabilitating 8 wetlands as part of the regional stormwater 
conveyance and management system – Blandford-Blenheim, Erin, London and Wellesley, ON.
•	 Climate Change Mitigation Business Plan – Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.
Proposals under this program may require a climate change resilience assessment or a greenhouse gas 
mitigation assessment, depending on the program sub-stream and/or the project cost.
Disaster Mitigation and Adaptation Fund
INFC is also responsible for the delivery of the Disaster Mitigation and Adaptation Fund (DMAF) program, 
a national program to support large-scale infrastructure projects, including natural infrastructure projects, 
to help communities better manage the risks associated with current and future natural hazards. Eligible 
investments for infrastructure projects under the DMAF explicitly include natural infrastructure.  The Fund is 
designed to support the objectives of the federal government’s Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth 
and Climate Change to build climate resilience through infrastructure and reduce climate-related hazards 
and disaster risks. The DMAF defines natural infrastructure as referring to the use of naturally occurring 
resources or the engineered use of natural resources, to provide adaptation or mitigation services to the 
gradual and/or sudden impacts of climate change or natural hazards. 
Decision-Maker Summary  |  11 
The DMAF’s $20 million project threshold may present somewhat of a barrier since natural infrastructure 
projects tend to be low cost in comparison to engineered projects. Nonetheless, the program allows for the 
bundling of several sub-projects within a single watershed. For example, a potential project could include 
a number of communities’ projects to manage, monitor, restore, and rehabilitate natural assets in a single 
and/or neighbouring watersheds to reduce flood risk.
Canada Infrastructure Bank
Established as part of the ICIP, the Canada Infrastructure Bank (CIB) is a Crown Corporation that uses 
federal support to attract private sector and institutional investment for new or “greenfield” infrastructure, 
and large, transformative infrastructure projects with economic, social and environmental returns. Projects 
must be revenue-generating and in the public interest. The CIB is still establishing its overall governance 
and project, as well as specific economic and investment, criteria. With investment criteria still under 
development, relevant project examples are not yet available.
Similar to the DMAF, it may be challenging for natural asset management projects to meet CIB eligibility 
requirements based on the eligibility requirements for large, transformative infrastructure projects. 
Federal Gas Tax Fund
Delivery of the federal Gas Tax Fund varies by province or territory. In the provinces of British Columbia 
and Ontario, the agencies are the respective municipal associations (Union of BC Municipalities, and 
Association of Municipalities of Ontario), whereas elsewhere the funding is delivered directly to the 
provincial or territorial governments. The Fund is limited to tangible capital assets. The list of eligible 
funding categories does not explicitly state natural assets, but there are a number of Eligible Project 
Categories under which purchased natural assets could fit. 
In order to qualify, municipalities may need to explicitly identify the ecosystem services provided by the 
natural asset. For example, a municipality could seek funding for a wetland under the category of disaster 
mitigation if flood-water storage is identified as a service. Or, a forest could be categorized under culture, 
tourism, or recreational infrastructure if the asset’s recreational services are highlighted.
Green Municipal Fund
The Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) has administered the Green Municipal Fund (GMF) for 
close to 20 years. In particular, the GMF’s stormwater management funding stream could fund natural 
asset projects. Previously funded projects provide a strong indication of the variety of natural asset 
management projects that can access funding through the GMF. For example, the GMF has funded 
projects that restore and rehabilitate wetlands and forests, watershed management planning, erosion 
control projects, and urban natural asset planning. Examples of such projects include:
•	 Flood Erosion Control Project on Stoney Creek Mountain - Hamilton, ON.5
•	 Action Plan for All Lakes in the Town of Sainte-Anne-des-Lacs, Quebec (QC).6  
•	 Burndenet Creek Erosion Control Optimisation Study – Markham, ON.7
•	 Natural Environment Protection and Development Plan for the City of St. Agathe-des-Montes, QC.8
12 | MNAI – Advancing Municipal Natural Asset Management through Infrastructure Funding Opportunities
Municipalities for Climate Innovation Program – Climate and 
Asset Management Network
FCM also administers the Municipalities for Climate Innovation (MCIP) program, including the Climate and 
Asset Management Network stream which will open for applications again in 2019. Natural assets clearly 
fall within the MCIP’s scope. Under the now-closed Climate Adaptation Partner Grants, the MCIP funded the 
Municipal Natural Assets Initiative’s second cohort of pilot projects,9 focussed on assessing and comparing 
the costs of natural assets and gray infrastructure to manage risks from climate impacts. 
The MCIP focuses on building the capacity of municipalities including local elected officials and municipal 
staff, to better understand the risks and opportunities, plan, and take action on climate change. It is 
unique in its focus on integrating climate change considerations and asset management.
Like under the GMF, previously funded projects provide a strong indication of the variety of natural asset 
management projects that can access funding through the MCIP. For example, the program has funded 
climate change planning and asset management planning. Such funded projects include:10
•	 Reducing climate risk through asset management and peer learning – City of Selkirk, Manitoba
•	 Improving regional climate resilience through vulnerability analysis and planning – Fraser Basin 
Council, British Columbia
Looking Forward
INFC’s broadening definitions of natural assets as capital assets points to high potential for municipal 
natural asset management projects to be eligible for ICIP’s Green Infrastructure Stream funding. FCM’s 
GMF and MCIP funding provide strong opportunities for municipal natural asset management projects. 
Whereas, the INFC’s DMAF and the CIB funding requires large-scale projects that may be challenging 
for small-scale natural asset projects. A manager seeking funding will need to consider each program’s 
parameters for eligible projects, eligible expenditures, minimum eligible cost thresholds, and the ability 
to bundle projects or applications. Other factors to take into account include whether the funds are 
being delivered directly to municipalities or through provinces and territories, and what level of matching 
funds are required and available. For a more complete overview of eligibility requirements and required 
outcomes, please refer to the full report on the MNAI website (www.mnai.ca).
