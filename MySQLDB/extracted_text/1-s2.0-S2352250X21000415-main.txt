Motivation and climate change: A review
Cameron Brick1, Anna Bosshard1 and Lorraine Whitmarsh2
Abstract
This paper reviews motivations people experience about
climate change and integrates recent findings into the BUCkET
model of core social goals. We argue that environmentalism is
not the main cause of thoughts or behaviors about climate
change. Rather, the evolved social needs for Belongingness,
Understanding, Control, self-Enhancement, and Trust are
more practical intervention targets than the attempt to create
environmentalist beliefs or identities. We used database
searches to identify the key research areas on motivation and
climate change and synthesized articles into the BUCkET
model. This reveals some limiting assumptions of previous
approaches and suggests the effectiveness of targeting exist-
ing motives rather than fostering new values or worldviews.

A central paradox in human behavior is that people value
their health, relationships, and environments yet choose
actions that harm them. One explanation for this value-
action gap is that evolution shaped human minds to
respond to problems faced by our distant ancestors [9].
Consider the disproportionate fear people experience
towards spiders compared to cars, even though road in-
juries are a major cause of death worldwide. Climate
change is an abstract, slow, and distant problem unlike
any our ancestors adapted to solve, and therefore
humans are poorly equipped for environmentalism [33].
Rather, animals developed biological drives such as
reproduction that are partially served in humans through
psychological motivations like maintaining positive
interpersonal relationships. For example, people over-
consume to boost their social status [31]. This leads
to two discomﬁting claims: behaviors that impact the
environment are rarely explained by a conscious moti-
vation towards nature, and conservation efforts will fail if
the damaging behavior is easier, cheaper, or better serves
social motives. Even deliberate conservation actions
could be explained through core social motives (review;
[88]), and meta-analyses suggest that the most effective
interventions harness motives such as belongingness
[24].
Beyond environmentalism
Contrary to what might be assumed, proenvironmental
thoughts and behaviors are only weakly linked (for re-
views, see: [50,78]). This suggests that environmen-
talism is not the main cause of relevant behaviors. Long-
term concern about the natural environment is new in
evolutionary terms, and its abstraction, distance, and
uncertainty can make it hard to understand. Despite
this, many interventions are still based on the knowl-
edge deﬁcit model, which holds that damaging behav-
iors are caused by the ignorance of facts. This claim is
hard to substantiate. The strongest predictors of indi-
vidual environmental damage are demographic like
income and country rather than psychological like
environmentalist identity or behavioral intentions [63].
Even environmentalists want to behave in ecological
ways, but they still tend to focus on actions with small
beneﬁts. There is a wide gulf between the environ-
mental behaviors most people think about and adjust
(such as recycling or turning off lights) and their be-
haviors with large impact (such as indirect water use or
home size), and these different classes will have
different predictors [59]. Even climate scientists ﬂy a
great deal [91]. Consistent with this separation, people
are surprisingly inaccurate about the environmental
impact of common behaviors, for example, of household
appliances using water [4] or energy [5].
In sum, environmentalism is not a unitary and internal
psychological construct but only a semantic label that
groups distinct phenomena by face validity, combining
other terms like climate change beliefs and recycling
behavior. A recent paper explains that assuming scien-
tiﬁc terms are real, discovered, and have an underlying

essence
is
pervasive
across
psychological
science,
including areas like neuroscience and biopsychology
[13]. Proenvironmental behavior is not a single thing
either (review: [54,75]). Almost nothing is similar be-
tween the habitual behavior of recycling and the
expensive, one-off purchase of a new furnace. They
might each be weakly linked to cognitive variables such
as attitudes about conservation, but that does not mean
the behaviors form a coherent, separate category. Too
quickly
assuming
labels
like
environmentalism
or
proenvironmental behavior have valid and unitary es-
sences assuming the descriptive stage of mapping out-
comes across contingencies, contexts, and populations
[30,71]. Fortunately, environmental beliefs, prefer-
ences, and behaviors can also be explained through well-
established social motives.
The current review
This article focuses on core social motivationsdneeds
that arise in social settings. Below, we integrate recent
climate change research into the BUCkET motives:
Belonging, Understanding, Controlling, self-Enhancing,
and Trusting others (Table 1). Key psychological
research was identiﬁed through author experience and
nonsystematic reviews of years 2010e2020 for publica-
tions in Web of Science and Google Scholar in
September 2020. The ﬁrst query was (“proenviron-
ment* OR environmentally responsible* OR climate
change
OR
climate change
mitigation OR
global
warming OR sustain* OR green”) AND (“motive* OR
behavior* OR attitude* OR norm* OR intent* OR
personality”). These articles were examined for rele-
vance, their references and citing articles were also
reviewed, and the most relevant and informative were
included in the review.
Belonging
Thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are shaped by the
desire to build and sustain positive social relationships.
Social norms quickly emerged as one of the central
predictors of proenvironmental and climate mitigation
behaviors (review: [34]). Descriptive norms are beliefs
about what others are doing, and injunctive norms are
beliefs about what others should be doing. Notably,
people dramatically underestimate how much others
inﬂuence their behavior [94]. Because afﬁliation mo-
tives are powerful, fundamental, and underappreciated,
they are a major potential lever for interventions ranging
from message framing to social context and can also
explain antienvironmental preferences [39] and behav-
iors [81].
In a rare transition of social psychology to large-scale
application, norm interventions on household energy
use [72] inspired a major commercial venture in
Opower, a company that introduced normative messages
into utility bills. The messages showed how much
energy people
used compared
to their neighbors
(descriptive) and included neutral or smiley face emojis
(injunctive). These messages reduced household energy
use by 2%, which is massive considering that Opower
operated in nine countries and 50 million households
when it was sold in 2016. Descriptive norms are also a
key predictor of public-sphere climate action such as
volunteering, at least among those alarmed about
climate outcomes [23].
Understanding
People are motivated to feel that they understand what
is real and why things happen. Crucially, this feeling
does not require that knowledge is accurate nor inter-
nally consistent. The chasm between facts and wide-
spread conspiracies can be partially explained through
the desire to understand (and other motives like
belongingness). This is particularly concerning because
conspiratorial thinking predicts climate change denial
[57].
Recognizing
the
motive
for
understanding
allows
climate change communicators to move beyond a simple
deﬁcit model of ignorance (for example, presenting facts
about atmospheric chemistry) towards providing in-
dividuals with satisfying opportunities such as aligning
their beliefs with what others think. For example, the
Gateway Belief Model is the replicated ﬁnding that
informing people about the high scientiﬁc consensus
about human-caused climate change leads to increases
in relevant, accurate beliefs and willingness to act

towards mitigation and adaptation [84,85]. This inter-
vention might also support belongingness, but the un-
derstanding component has a unique contribution
because boosting consensus can also reduce group-based
ideological biases [35].
Controlling
The motives to effectively control one’s environment,
achieve mastery, and feel competent are core behavioral
drivers [68e70,73]. Self-efﬁcacydthe perceived ability
to mobilize resources and take actiondis essential for
behavior change and persistence [8], including proenvir-
onmental behaviors [53,80]. Self-efﬁcacy also mediates
spillover: adopting an initial, easy proenvironmental
behavior develops individuals’ conﬁdence and skills,
which motivates further, more difﬁcult proenvironmental
actions [55]. Similarly, perceived behavioral control drives
a wide range of behaviors [1], and particularly more
difﬁcult and impactful proenvironmental actions such as
avoiding driving [7,32]. This literature helps explain the
importance of convenience factors [58] and reveals that
increasing proenvironmental actions requires making
green actions easier than more polluting actions (for
example, by reallocating road space from cars to cyclists
and pedestrians) [46].
Climate change is global, long-term, and uncertain,
which can lead to low perceived control and motivation
to engage in mitigation or adaptation: feeling like a drop
in the ocean [59]. Further, climate change is psycho-
logically distant in time and space, unavailable to sen-
sory experience, and therefore deprioritized in favor of
more proximal problems [16,42,61,77] (review: [62]).
Extreme weather events like ﬂoods [2,90] can make
climate change salient and threatening. Actions like
ﬂood-prooﬁng
one’s
home
are
more
likely
when
perceived as effective and controllable [22,37]. Boosting
individual and collective efﬁcacy (review [49]: can thus
increase motivation for mitigation and protective action
against climate change impacts [28] (systematic review:
[51]).
Self-Enhancing
People are motivated to see themselves as consistent and
worthy. How people describe themselves (self-identity)
is inﬂuenced by personal motivations for self-esteem,
self-enhancement, and self-understanding, as well as
social interactions and roles [25]. People are motivated to
act consistently and express their self-identity through
actions and purchases [10]. Proenvironmental identity
predicts green consumption behaviors [19,36,45,76,86],
recycling [60], carbon offsetting [93], avoiding ﬂying
[32], and green policy preferences [14]. Identity can
support consistency across actions and contexts, thus
mediating spillover between proenvironmental behaviors
[52,87]. In contrast, external interventions without self-
enhancement motives such as price signals are less likely
to spill over because individuals do not attribute the
action to their identity [67] (review: [83]). Conspicuous
conservation describes when individuals seek status by
demonstrating their green credentials, for example, by
purchasing hybrid or electric vehicles [64,74]. Environ-
mentalist identity may best predict proenvironmental
behaviors that are visible to other people [15].
Self-enhancement includes the motivation for moral
integrity: being a good person. Similarly, personal norms
are perceived moral obligations and also predict certain
proenvironmental behaviors [12,17,26,48] when not in
conﬂict with other motives (reviews: [78,79]). Climate
change is a moral issue for many people [41]; addressing
it requires considering social inequalities, intergenera-
tional justice, and environmental degradation. Conse-
quently,
environmentalist,
self-transcendent,
and
progressive values are the strongest predictors of climate
change attitudes [93](meta-analysis: [40]).
For those with strong environmental values, taking
green actions can afford a warm glow and intrinsic
satisfaction [82], whereas taking more polluting actions
can create guilt [65,11]. Conversely, environmental in-
formation that threatens a valued social identity, such as
one’s political afﬁliation, is likely to be ignored or
denigrated [38,43]. In climate change communication,
motivated reasoning can lead to attitude polarization
[21]. Likewise, a behavior such as reusing a grocery bag
might be shunned to avoid looking like an environ-
mentalist [15]. Reframing environmental action in line
with audience values may overcome identity threats and
motivate attitude and behavior change [27,92].
Trusting
In addition to the desire to belong, people are motivated
to trust others and believe that others are benevolent
[29]. Trust will be a crucial aspect of climate change
action because the required physical changes are com-
plex, distributed, and require cooperation spanning from
small groups to international treaties. This systematic
need aligns with trust in scientists and institutions
emerging as a key lever for climate communication and
behavior change in the USA. [3] and Germany [44], as
well as in a recent meta-analysis [18].
The desire to trust others can also reveal novel pathways
to policy support for mitigation. In 24 countries, in-
dividuals were motivated towards action when they were
informed of cobeneﬁts such as development (economic
and scientiﬁc) and benevolence (a moral and caring
community) [6]. These effects were of similar magnitude
to the belief that climate change is important, which
reinforces the potential for harnessing existing motives.
Last, perhaps because environmentalists are perceived as
84
42 Psychology of Climate Change

trustworthy, environmentalists are seen as more cooper-
ative in social dilemma tasks [89] and even preferred as
romantic partners [66].
Conclusion
Because of how human minds evolved, actions on
climate change are explainable through social motives;
even phenomena such as cognitive dissonance or ambi-
guity avoidance that are commonly attributed to intra-
psychic processes may be explained by interpersonal
processes, according to a recent review [56]. Social
motives may be a uniquely effective target for in-
terventions since they are ubiquitous and afford many
roads to action, for example by activating different
identities. Other frameworks of fundamental motives
could also serve as a basis for interventions. For instance,
Self-Determination Theory covers similar core motives:
autonomy,
competence,
and
relatedness
[20,70].
Another related model of fundamental needs is well-
grounded in evolutionary psychology, and it overlaps
most with the BUCkET motives for status and esteem
[47]. However, these frameworks do not fully explain
behaviors. Major topics within environmental psychol-
ogy such as social norms or identities can plausibly ﬁt
several motives, and behaviors are also driven by habits
and homeostatic drives.
Our practical advice is for researchers to identify a
behavior with environmental consequences, determine
how it serves core social motives, and test an interven-
tion targeted at fulﬁlling those motives. This process
may also reveal instances when difﬁcult conservation
behaviors conﬂict with existing motives. In these cases,
the most effective interventions might limit individuals’
capacity to do harm, for example, through taxes or reg-
ulations. Overall, harnessing core motives could help
avoid the worst outcomes of climate change. Many drops
can ﬁll a bucket.
