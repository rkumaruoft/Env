The Story of Sackville  
 
Sackville is a small town located in southeastern New Brunswick at the head of the Bay of Fundy. The 
area is part of the traditional, unceded territory of the Mi’kmaq called Siknikt in the district of 
Mi'kma'ki. Sackville is situated near the Nova Scotia border on the narrow Chignecto Isthmus, a 
nationally important transportation corridor. Sackville is a low-lying coastal town with part of the 
community located below sea level behind a network of dykes. The picturesque town is surrounded by 
forested uplands and low-lying dykelands, once reclaimed from the sea by Acadian settlers. The area is 
known for migrating songbirds, shorebirds and waterfowl. The community is home to Mount Allison 
University, Canadian Wildlife Service, the regional Sackville Memorial Hospital, a small industrial park, 
three schools, Silver Lake, the Sackville Waterfowl Park, farms, and many shops, restaurants, small 
businesses and services. It is also home to a number of environmental organizations and many 
community groups. About 5300 residents and 2250 university students call Sackville home. The town 
serves surrounding rural unincorporated Local Service Districts. Sackville is and will continue to be 
impacted by human-caused climate change; however, the community is vibrant and known for its focus 
on the arts, nature and sustainability. 
 
 
 How this Guide Came to Be 
 
EOS Eco-Energy, based in Sackville, NB, was awarded funding from the New Brunswick Environmental 
Trust Fund in 2020-2021 to create a plan to help residents, businesses and organizations come together 
to adapt to human-caused climate change and be more resilient. This guide complements the Town of 
Sackville’s adaptation plan focused on municipal operations adopted by the town council in 2016.

The timing of this project coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has shown the 
community how vulnerable basic needs are, such as food supplies, but the community has also realized 
how resilient it can be, how people can come together to help community members and neighbours 
adapt when faced with hardship. COVID-19 presented an opportunity to develop this guide with 
pandemics in mind as well.  
 
To gather input for the guide, EOS staff performed a literature review, and looked at other rural and 
small-town climate change resilience and adaptation plans. A steering committee of ten local residents 
was formed to help guide the project and included representatives from local businesses, organizations, 
Mount Allison University, students, municipal staff, and provincial government. EOS interviewed key 
informants and experts from across Canada, and performed 4 community focus groups with local 
experts, community residents, and vulnerable populations (seniors and adults with disabilities) for a 
total of 31 participants. EOS also conducted resident, business and student surveys to gather 
information about perceptions of risk, climate change c0ncerns, existing adaption actions, perceptions 
of community strength, barriers and challenges, and ideas for enhancing community resilience to 
climate change. A total of 262 people (ages 11 to 75+) responded to the surveys. Summaries of the 
surveys can be found at https://eosecoenergy.com/en/sackville-community-climate-change-resilience/.  
 
The overall aim of this guide is to help residents, businesses, organizations and institutions in Sackville, 
NB to plan, prepare, adapt, respond to climate change. There are ideas for household and community 
projects, and for influencing political action for more widespread adaptations.  
 
Much like the symbol of the dandelion, this tool is meant to sprout resilience, communication, 
clarity, perseverance, ingenuity, healing and hope. 
 
 
 
How to Use this Guide 
 
This guide has 50 Great Ideas for inspiring community resilience. It has been created by and for 
individuals, businesses, organizations and the community in Sackville, New Brunswick. Whether you 
are new to town or have lived in Sackville all your life, you will find helpful, practical information, ideas 
and resources. The guide is also a unique resource for community members in other small towns. 
 
What is climate change resilience?  
 
Climate change resilience is the ability to predict, prepare for, adapt, respond and recover from 
disturbances related to a changing climate. Improving climate resilience involves assessing 
threats and opportunities and taking steps to cope with the changes.  
 
What is climate change adaptation?  
 
We can adapt to climate changes by adjusting how we live and the choices we make. Making 
these adjustments will help decrease the negative effects of the changing climate and allow us 
to take advantage of any new and favourable opportunities.

The 50 Great Ideas are a collection of interdependent actions that can be done at home, in your 
workplace, organization, school, and/or as part of larger community initiatives run by local 
organizations or volunteers. Start small or go big. It is at the community level where resilience grows. In 
times of hardship – floods, storms, power outages, emergencies, pandemics – it is community 
residents, businesses and organizations that help each other get through tough times. A great example 
is the Tantramar Covid Taskforce, formed to help the most vulnerable meet basic needs during the 
pandemic.  
 
Most of all, the guide is meant to empower community-based actions and working together to create a 
resilient community, while also providing ideas for individual actions. Many of the actions are things 
that can be done together. There are suggestions for larger community-wide programs and influencing 
even larger municipal, provincial and federal government changes.  
 
The 50 Great Ideas are in no particular order, and all are important interconnected actions. They have 
been grouped together in themes including Health and Wellness, Education and Skill Building, Food, 
Green Spaces, Water, Flood Risk, Emergency Planning, Energy, Transportation, Local Economy, 
Communication, and Citizen Engagement. Along the way you will find inspiring stories from Sackville 
area residents, businesses and organizations that are already taking steps to be more resilient. The 
guide wraps up with an implementation plan, links to further resources and the online guide/toolkit. 
Contact information for organizations mentioned throughout this guide are listed in the Directory. This 
guide is only the beginning of the great ideas the Sackville community can make happen. 
 
Climate Change Concerns 
 
Sackville is already experiencing the impacts of a changing climate. Due to its low-lying coastal 
location, Sackville has experienced hurricanes and storm surges. Sea levels around Sackville are 
expected to rise by a 1m or more by 2021, which will increase the impact of coastal storms. The dykes, 
meant originally to protect farm lands, are now expected to protect infrastructure, including a 
community. The Sackville area is expected to see more annual precipitation (rain and snow) but falling 
less often and in more intense events. Sackville has already experienced various fresh water floods and 
drought periods as well as increasing annual temperatures. Residents can expect to see more heat 
waves and ice storms. Invasive species such as ticks have also moved into the region. These climate 
change impacts are also affecting some residents’ mental and physical health.  
 
Community members who responded to the surveys listed a variety of climate change impacts that 
concern them. They are most concerned about coastal flooding and dyke breaches, droughts, more and 
longer heat waves, human health impacts, and sea level rise. The most commonly reported concerns 
among students are human health impacts (due to mental health, polluted water, heat alerts, tick, 
etc.), drought, invasive species and more powerful hurricanes happening more often. Businesses and 
organizations are concerned about how climate change may affect their operations including reducing 
the number of clients or members, communications challenges, loss of suppliers, shipping 
interruptions, difficulty getting essential supplies, having to close their physical location, and loss of 
power or internet.

How Resilient do Community Members Feel? 
 
A large percentage of residents feel that people in Sackville are committed to the well-being of the 
community, know how to work together to help each other prepare, respond and recover from crises. 
Likewise, students feel that Sackville has the ability to unite and come together during times of crisis 
such as helping university students impacted by a recent apartment fire. The connected, community-
minded nature of Sackville is a significant resource. People feel that Sackville has an engaged and 
concerned population which is willing to act. Having a diversity of experience, ages, skills, and resources 
in the community was also noted as an important community strength. Several respondents feel that 
the mayor and council are supportive of climate change actions and that they have confidence in local 
decision-makers, making climate action more likely. However, not everyone felt that way and there are 
concerns that the Sackville community does not have the resources it needs to address future climate 
risks effectively. Focus group participants said the community should build off the successes of the 
Sackville Refugee Coalition and the Tantramar Covid Taskforce.  
 
Residents are confident in their own abilities to adapt to climate change. Those older than 55 reported 
more “confidence in their ability to respond and adapt to climate change” than younger respondents. 
Only 40% of student respondents (ages 11 to university) say they feel prepared for climate change. A 
large percentage of residents feel they can be of help to neighbours and that their neighbours can help 
them in the event of a disaster. However, the phrases respondents most commonly disagreed with 
included: talking to their neighbours about preparing for an emergency or disaster and helping the 
community prepare for or respond to an emergency or disaster. Some focus group participants said 
people in apartments don’t know their neighbours so there is no one to turn to for help. 
 
While respondents to the community survey feel strongly that Sackville is resilient and well resourced, 
connecting people with those resources and with each other is more challenging and could be an 
important action to address climate change.  
 
Key informant and focus groups said the community needs more focus on long-term adaptation. Some 
feel it is hard for community members to see long-term. Others said the community is further ahead 
than when climate discussions started in the early 2000s, but there are still a lot of people who do not 
see climate change as a threat to their personal situation and so more education is needed. Some 
participants said Sackville could easily have a food shortage, supply chains could be disrupted, and that 
transportation is at risk. The pandemic has been useful to show people how precarious things like food 
systems are. Sackville is very vulnerable as one large storm could have a huge impact; however, it is a 
strong community, with deep roots or strong ties. 
 
What is a Resilient Community? 
 
EOS Eco-Energy asked focus groups and key informants what a resilient community looks like and 
received a long list of qualities. A resilient community is: 
 
• 
Positive social connections and relationships among residents 
• 
A strong sense of community where people contribute and benefit  
• 
Embracing diversity  
• 
Effective communication and inclusive

50 Great Ideas for Community-Based Resilience in Sackville 
 
The 50 Great Ideas are in no particular order, and all are important. They have been grouped together in 
themes including: Health and Wellness, Education and Skill Building, Food, Green Spaces, Water, 
Flood Risk, Emergency Planning, Energy, Transportation, Local Economy, Communication, and 
Citizen Engagement. The ideas are community-based actions that residents, businesses and 
organizations could do alone and collectively. The ideas represent the power of a community to come 
together to improve resilience and self-reliance.  
 
 
Health and Wellness 
 
It can be stressful and scary to think about climate change impacts now, in the future, and particularly 
for our young people. There is a lot that needs to be done and it can feel overwhelming. Social

determinants of health1 will impact people’s ability to prepare, respond and recover from climate 
change events. Supporting mental health and addressing eco anxiety, fostering great relationships, and 
supporting the vulnerable are key actions. 
 
1. Support mental health and address climate change stress 
 
Sackville groups such as EOS Eco-Energy and IRIS Community Counselling have offered workshops on 
how to deal with climate change stress and eco anxiety. More climate change stress workshops should 
be offered. They could be coordinated for co-workers, parents, volunteers, students, and the 
community as a whole. Climate stress is a normal part of addressing climate change challenges and 
needs to be acknowledged and supported at the community level. It means that we care about the 
issues and that is a good thing. Coming together in workshops offers a community-based approach 
where participants can lean on each other and learn a variety of coping strategies. Ultimately, 
participants learn how to harness stress into fueling positive climate action at home and in their 
communities. Action is the perfect remedy for despair.  
 
 
2. Foster great relationships  
 
It is important not to feel alone in our efforts to adapt to climate change and build community 
resilience. It can be a group or community effort. Resilience includes fostering a safe and supportive 
community. Community members should be kind and support each other during hard times. A 
community needs to support those who are socially disadvantaged so that they too can contribute to a 
 
1 The 14 social determinants of health include: Aboriginal status, gender, disability , housing, early life , income and 
income distribution, education, race, employment and working conditions, social exclusion , food insecurity, social 
safety net, health services, unemployment and job security. 
 
Self -Care Tips for Managing Climate Change Stress 
 
Here are some ideas that can be done at home, with friends, family, co-workers or as part of a 
community program:  
 
• 
Spend time in nature 
 
 
 
 
• 
Find ways to relax and recharge: garden, read, yoga, dance, meditation, sports, paint, etc. 
• 
Talk to friends, family, counsellors about your concerns, or attend a workshop 
• 
Eat well, stay active and be healthy so you have lots of energy 
• 
Tackle one action at a time, focus your actions on what you are good at 
• 
Don’t feel guilty about what you cannot control, focus on what you can control 
• 
Focus on positive changes and celebrate small victories 
• 
Make changes at home to be more sustainable 
• 
Get prepared, have an emergency kit, learn traditional skills, etc.  
• 
Get involved to influence big changes, join local organizations, volunteer with political parties, 
run for local government elections, etc.

resilient community. Everyone needs someone they can depend on. How do we ensure a caring, 
inclusive and supportive community? Sackville is fortunate to have great organizations like Daybreak, a 
community centre for adults with mental health challenges, and Open Sky Co-op, a farm setting which 
serves adults with mental health challenges. Mount Allison University also has programs to help new 
students meet others and connect with local residents.  
 
3. Support the vulnerable 
 
Like every community, Sackville has residents who are vulnerable. To be fully resilient, all members of a 
community must have the resources and supports they need. Who in Sackville is vulnerable, and what 
do they need to be resilient? Everyone needs affordable housing, food, security, income, etc. Without 
the basics, it is hard to focus on anything else. Community discussions are needed about equity, 
diversity, social justice and how they influence community-based climate resilience. Often the most 
vulnerable are also the most impacted by climate change. Creating a community connection program, 
or Buddy System, is a great way to connect people.  Mount Allison University students started a 
program to connect seniors during the pandemic called Community Connect. Offering a Sackville 
Nursing Home without Walls program, similar to the one in the Port Elgin area, could also be greatly 
beneficial to Sackville area seniors and help connect seniors to support services. Students reported that 
more affordable housing units are also needed in Sackville.  
 
 
Education and Skill Building  
 
Addressing climate change is a life-long learning process. Sackville residents are interested in raising 
public awareness, attending workshops, climate change education in local schools, acquiring traditional 
self-sufficiency skills, and using art. 
 
4. Coordinate public awareness and education on climate change resilience  
 
Sackville residents, businesses and students would like to attend a variety of workshops to learn more 
about climate change and appropriate actions and skills to build self-sufficiency. The most asked for 
workshops and training opportunities are: 
 
• 
gardening skills 
• 
permaculture gardening 
• 
regenerative agriculture 
• 
pruning trees and shrubs and how to tend newly planted trees  
• 
wild foraging skills 
• 
survival skills 
• 
traditional skills 
• 
food preservation and Community canning workshops 
• 
small scale livestock farming 
• 
water conservation 
• 
how to grow things in drier conditions  
• 
how to manage livestock during drier conditions  
• 
emergency preparedness

• 
flood risk reduction 
• 
how to be resilient 
• 
climate stress 
• 
mental health first aid  
• 
home retrofits and ways to save energy 
• 
accessible renewable energy alternatives 
• 
and many more! 
 
The above needs reflect the climate impacts and risks of most concern to community members such as 
dyke breaches, flooding, agricultural/food system impacts, and droughts. EOS Eco-Energy has offered 
some of these workshops (e.g. wild edibles, canning, managing climate stress, solar energy, emergency 
preparedness, etc.) in the past and hopes to offer more workshops. Open Sky has also offered 
workshops on mental health first aid, gardening skills, canning, etc.  
 
5. Acquire traditional self-sufficiency skills 
 
A senior in the seniors focus group said, “You can live on less when you are self-sufficient.” There are so 
many reasons to be more self-sufficient at home and self-reliant as a community. Often being self-
sufficient means learning and using traditional skills. Apart from saving money, using traditional skills 
can save energy, reduce waste and make people less vulnerable and more resilient when they have the 
things and skills they need to get by. Some of the self-sufficient traditional skills community members 
would like to learn include gardening, canning and preserving food (a recipe is offered on the next 
page), raising livestock, survival skills, and how to fix things.  
 
A great idea is to start a Sackville DIYers group. It was suggested to have an email list, meet monthly, 
put on workshops, bring in speakers, offer skill sharing events, have a Facebook page with tips, etc. 
Learning forgotten traditional skills from seniors could be a valuable multi-generational activity. 
Groups that could help offer traditional skills training could include EOS Eco-Energy and Open Sky, who 
already partnered and offered a series of popular food preservation workshops. The Tantramar Seniors 
College and local schools could also organize learning events. It is important to think about those who 
live in apartments and others who may not have the ability to be as self-sufficient as others and how 
they could be supported.

“DILLY” Green Beans 
 
Yield: 7 (1 pint / 500 ml) jars 
 
Ingredients: 
• 
4 lbs whole green beans (choose produce in good condition with no soft spots or blemishes) 
• 
1-1/2 teaspoons dried red chili flakes 
• 
3-1/2 teaspoons dried dill seed, or 7 fresh dill heads 
• 
7 cloves fresh garlic, peeled 
• 
5 cups vinegar 
• 
5 cups water 
• 
7 tablespoons pickling or coarse salt 
 
Method: 
Fill your water bath and bring to a boil while you prepare the beans and jars. 
1. Wash beans thoroughly. Remove stems and tips. Cut beans into uniform lengths as much as 
possible. They should stand upright in jars and reach the shoulder of the jars.  
2. Have jars clean and hot. Always check your jars to make sure there are no chips out of the edges of 
the jars. Do not use jars that are damaged. Cover the canning lids with hot water and aside. Choose 
canning rings that are in good condition with no signs of rust. Clean and set aside.  
3. In each jar, place:  ¼ teaspoon chili flakes, ½ teaspoon dill seed or 1 dill head, and 1 garlic clove 
4. Pack beans upright in jars, leaving one inch of headroom (headroom is the distance between the top 
of the produce and the edge of the jar).  
5. Heat together water, vinegar and salt. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and carefully fill each jar 
with the hot liquid leaving a ½ inch of space between the top of liquid and the edge of the jar. Run a 
plastic knife around the edge of the jars to remove any air bubbles.  
6. Place lids on jars and secure rings over jars. Tighten the rings until you have resistance – do not over-
tighten. Place filled jars in water bath. The water should cover the jars by at least one inch. Bring the 
water back to a boil, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes.  
7. Turn off heat and remove lid from water bath. If you are able to move the water bath off the burner 
safely, you can move it to a cool burner. Let the jars sit for 5 minutes before removing from the water. 
This depressurizes the jars and prevents leaking and breakage.  
8. The rings will have become loosened during canning. This is normal. You should start to hear sharp 
‘pings’ as the vacuum seal is created in the jars. You can tell if your jars are properly sealed by pressing 
gently on the centre of the lid. If there is no movement of the lid, your jars are sealed. If you can feel a 
little bump that you can press up and down, the jars are not yet sealed. Give the pickles a few minutes 
to cool and try again. Any jars that have not sealed properly should be put in the fridge.  
9. Let the beans sit for two weeks to develop their flavour. Label your jars with the name of the product 
and the date is was made. Properly sealed beans can be stored for a year.

6. Use art and visual representations to get people’s attention 
 
Artistic and visual representations can catch people’s attention and help raise awareness about climate 
change issues. Music, art, and theatre with various age groups and sectors could be organized and 
shared. One survey respondent suggested that publicly displaying maps created with Geographic 
Information Systems (GIS) or other visual formats could be used to show residents local climate 
changes and related flood risks in Sackville. The Sackville Art Association, Struts Gallery and Faucet 
Media Arts, Mount Allison University’s Fine Arts Department as well as their Geography and 
Environment Department, Owens Art Gallery, EOS Eco-Energy, and the New Brunswick Southeast 
Regional Service Commission (planning commission) could also be sources of visual representations to 
get people’s attention. The Owens Art Gallery has an online map of local landscape art and 
photography where residents can upload their art and photos at: 
https://www.youareheresackvillenb.ca/about.  
 
7. Provide climate change education in schools  
 
Several respondents noted the need for quality and accurate climate change education in schools and 
providing multigenerational learning opportunities. There are a variety of local organizations who can 
enhance and support climate change education in schools from elementary to university levels. More 
and ongoing efforts are needed and groups such as EOS Eco-Energy, RCE Tantramar, Sackville Schools 
2020, the Tantramar Wetland Centre, Nature NB, Ducks Unlimited Canada (DUC), the Chignecto 
Climate Change Collaborative (CCCC) and many others could help provide more climate education in 
schools. The CCCC offered a climate change fair at Tantramar Regional School in early 2020, EOS goes 
into schools during Tantramar Climate Change Week, DUC and Nature NB have ongoing programs for 
youth as well.  
 
 
Food  
 
Food quality and food security are a big part of feeling resilient. As a result, there are many food actions 
for households and collective actions including planting trees, food forests, gardens, greenhouses, cold 
storage, a community kitchen and creating a community composting program. 
 
 
8. Plant edible trees and food forests  
 
Planting edible trees (fruit, nuts) and shrubs (berries) that are suited to our local climate can help 
increase food security and provide a source of healthy foods. Edible trees can be planted in your own 
backyard, in a community orchard or a food forest. A food forest can contain diverse edible trees, 
shrubs and perennials. Food forests sequester carbon and also regenerate the soil, can better tolerate

drought, help absorb runoff, increase biodiversity, support pollinators, and buffer against climate 
change. Food forests can use permaculture design techniques and require less energy to maintain 
because they mimic a natural forest environment. Food forests need less water and fertilizers than 
traditional gardens which saves energy and reduces emissions. Growing more food sustainably and 
locally will help reduce emissions from transportation. According to a recent NB Food Security Action 
Network Report, New Brunswick only produces 7% of the vegetables we consume. The pandemic has 
shown vulnerabilities which will be made worse with climate change impacts leading to supply chain 
disruptions. Planting more edible trees can be done at home, school, work and across the community. 
A demonstration food forest was planted in the Sackville Community Garden by Community Forests 
International staff many years ago and continues to grow well.  Local resources include Community 
Forest International, EOS Eco-Energy, Understory Farms, the Sackville Community Garden and the 
Black Duck Café who planted their own food forest garden to supply their cafe.

9. Plant a garden 
 
Gardening has so many benefits including healthy local food grown with little impact and it can be a 
great stress reliever. Whether it is in a back yard, a balcony or even a windowsill, many people can grow 
at least some of their own food. School gardens are a great learning tool for students and a way to help 
supply the school cafeteria with healthy locally grown ingredients. For those who need more space, 
there are community garden plots.  Another way to enhance community resilience is to have enough 
community garden space for everyone who wants to grow their own food. If you would like a garden 
plot, contact the Sackville Community Garden to see about availability. Another idea could be to 
establish more community gardens throughout town.  
 
10. Build a greenhouse 
 
Greenhouses would allow residents and restaurants to extend the growing season beyond what they 
can currently do at the Community Garden or in their backyards and balconies. Greenhouses could be 
built in backyards (such as a small hoop frame) or at schools to supply cafeterias with sustainable, 
healthy, local foods. A community greenhouse is another great idea and would need a group of citizens 
to coordinate it, find a location, and a community grant. A community greenhouse could assist those 
living in apartments and others unable to have their own. Open Sky currently operates a greenhouse on 
their property for their programming. A community greenhouse could be a meeting place, a place to 
share knowledge and cooperate. It could extend the benefits of the Community Garden to more of the 
year.

What to plant in a food forest in New Brunswick? 
 
Horseradish, Jerusalem artichokes, oyster mushrooms, creeping thyme, strawberries, perennial 
greens like sorrel, medicinal flowers like comfrey and calendula, shrubs like elderberry and highbush 
blueberries, Saskatoons (service berries), hazelnuts, apple trees, and butternut trees.

11. Build a cold storage 
 
Cold storage spaces in basements would allow residents to store their root vegetables, etc. over the 
winter months. A community cold storage space could also allow those without the space or 
appropriate set up in small homes or apartments to be more self-sufficient. Innovative design 
possibilities include burying shipping containers underground or under a pile of fill planted with grass, 
lining with insulation, installing off-grid solar air circulation system, shelving and other features. Groups 
such as EOS Eco-Energy could be approached to help with this idea.  
 
12. Create a local food hub and collective kitchen 
 
The establishment of a collective kitchen space could lead to the creation of a community food hub. 
Such a space could be used for community cooking events, food preservation workshops, communal 
canning events, cooking and baking workshops, sharing of traditional skills, and more. Storage and 
processing of local foods could also take place in such a facility. Funding a group to spearhead the 
kitchen would be needed. It could be housed in a community centre which also has space for other non-
profits, and/or a permanent space for the Sackville Farmers Market.  
 
13. Compost 
 
Composting is an important part of creating a sustainable, self-sufficient community. Decreasing the 
amount of food waste transported to Eco360 waste sorting facility in Moncton would save the Town of 
Sackville money and reduce transportation and landfill emissions. Community composting closes the 
loop on food production and creates a valuable local product used to grow more food locally. A variety 
of composting program options exist. More backyard composting bin bulk purchases could be 
organized. EOS Eco-Energy has coordinated two bulk deals and offered composting workshops in the 
past. Programs that allow apartment dwellers, businesses and others to drop off (or have picked up) 
food scraps to be used by gardeners, farmers, local schools, etc. could be an option. A community 
composting program could be organised where residents and businesses drop off compost at a central 
community site to be used by anyone who needs it. A location would be needed to house the compost 
and an organization or group of residents would be needed to manage the compost to ensure proper 
maintenance. To get started with composting at home visit: https://eosecoenergy.com/en/wp-
content/uploads/2018/03/Composting-at-Home-Brochure.pdf  
 
 
Open Sky Cooperative is using solar panels for power and geothermal energy for heating the 
farmhouse, as part of the necessary shift away from fossil fuel consumption’s pollution.  Open Sky also 
practices sustainable organic agriculture for growing food locally in Sackville, New Brunswick, which 
results in less energy and fuel consumption to get food onto your plate—also known as “Farm-To-
Table”. – Open Sky

Green Spaces 
 
Maintaining and deliberately creating green spaces can help mitigate flooding, provide cooling, 
increase biodiversity, regenerate soils, support pollinators, have a positive effect on mental health, and 
enhance the resilience of a community. It’s important to know what natural assets a community has 
and to conserve, protect or restore them. Actions include planting trees and rain gardens, depaving, 
and green roofs.  
 
14. Plant trees 
 
Planting trees at home, work, school or as part of a community-wide project has so many benefits 
for climate action. Planting trees, especially those that are native and climate resilient, sequesters 
carbon, helps absorb runoff, increases biodiversity, provides shade, helps reduce heat islands and more. 
Having more trees and green spaces also helps people feel better. All ages can help plant trees, and 
planting trees is a great educational experience too. In Sackville, there are lots of great resources that 
could help with community tree planting programs and initiatives including EOS Eco-Energy, 
Community Forests International and Replant.ca Environmental.  
 
 
 
 3 
 
15. Plant rain gardens 
 
A rain garden is a shallow depression planted with native water-loving flowers, grasses and ferns 
located in a spot to collect rainwater or runoff from roofs, parking lots, roads, and other hard surfaces. 
They mimic natural environments and absorb rainwater to help reduce flooding, filter runoff, and 
recharge ground water supplies. The plants have deep roots which help break up the soil, improve its 
permeability, and allow the plants to find water during dry spells. You can dig and plant a small rain 
garden at home, work or school, or organize a community rain garden program. Native plants such 
as Joe Pye Weed, Black-eyed Susan, Ostrich Fern, Blue Flag Iris, Blue Vervain, Swamp Milkweed, 
Bloodroot, sedges and Sweet Grass, can be purchased locally from Anderson’s Greenhouse. EOS Eco-
Energy is a local leader in rain gardens and has planted dozens in Sackville. It is most beneficial to have 
lots of small rain gardens all over town so there is a lot of opportunity.

50 Great Ideas for Inspiring Community Resilience to Climate Change in Sackville 
 
19 
16. Reduce pavement  
 
Reducing the amount of pavement, concrete and other hard ground coverings will help slow, and 
absorb rainwater runoff and reduce flood risk. Depaving is becoming a popular community-based 
activity that all ages can participate in. Remove a section of pavement such as part of a paved 
parking lot, ally way, etc. and choose from a variety of permeable options such as permeable 
asphalt, stones, grass tiles, etc. Better yet plant a rain garden, with water-loving native plants. 
Driveways, walkways, unused parking areas or patios at home, work or school could be depaved. Or 
work together to depave larger areas community wide. EOS Eco-Energy has experience depaving a 
parking lot in Sackville and coordinating repaving with permeable asphalt.  
 
17. Install green roofs 
 
Green roofs are another example of community-based natural infrastructure and can be planted with 
low-maintenance grasses, sedums, edible plants or larger installations including trees and shrubs. An 
engineering assessment to verify load capacity of the roof is required before a green roof can be 
designed. Planting green spaces on suitable roofs has many benefits including absorbing rainwater 
and reducing runoff, saving energy and reducing cooling costs, increasing biodiversity, supporting 
pollinators, and improving the wellbeing of people in and around the building. Green roofs also provide 
exciting learning opportunities for all ages and make use of available space in an innovative way. The 
Sackville town hall has had a small green roof for many years. EOS Eco-Energy, the Town of Sackville 
and other local properties have plans for more green roof installations.  
 
 
Water 
 
Climate change is impacting precipitation patterns. There will be more intense storms happening more 
often, but also longer drought periods. Concerns about water quality, droughts and conserving water 
are important worries for the Sackville community. The summer of 2020 saw very little rain, making it 
challenging to grow abundant crops, feed and water livestock, and keep wells from going dry.  
 
18. Monitor water quality 
 
Currently EOS Eco-Energy and its Chignecto Watersheds Committee oversees the monitoring of 
surface water quality in the watersheds in and around Sackville. Water quality is important for the long-
term health of residents, and supports healthy and safe tourism, recreation and business activities. 
Local residents can take part in citizen science initiatives to monitor sites and contribute to expanding 
our knowledge of our local watersheds. A Silver Lake Association could be formed to help monitor 
and ensure the health of Silver Lake. Monitoring trends over time is important as climate change will 
impact water quality and quantity. Find out more about the Chignecto Watershed Committee and how 
you can participate at: https://eosecoenergy.com/en/projects/chignecto-watersheds-committee/ . 
 
19. Develop an integrated watershed management plan 
 
An Integrated Watershed Management Plan (IWMP) is a guiding document for use by landowners, 
governments, planners, and all other stakeholders in a watershed. It sets out common goals and 
50 Great Ideas for Inspiring Community Resilience to Climate Change in Sackville 
 
20 
objectives for the long-term management of land and water resources in the basin. EOS Eco-Energy, 
the Chignecto Watersheds Committee, Ducks Unlimited Canada, Nature NB, and other stakeholders 
and experts could collaborate on this plan.  
 
20. Perform home water use audits 
 
A great idea is to create a community-based program similar to Reep Green Solutions’ home water use 
audits. The program could offer a free service to evaluate your household's water efficiency and check 
for possible fixture leaks and related water issues. It could provide high efficiency shower heads, 
shower timers, faucet aerators, possibly low-flow toilets, etc. to qualifying local homes and 
businesses. If EOS Eco-Energy could find funding, it could coordinate this program.  
 
21. Rain barrels 
 
Climate change is changing precipitation patterns and we see longer drought periods followed by 
intense rain events. Collecting water when it is raining is one way to deal with water shortages during 
drought periods. Community-based rain barrel giveaways and bulk purchase deals are great ways to 
promote water conservation. Having multiple rain barrels can help us water our gardens during the dry 
spells. EOS Eco-Energy has coordinated rain barrel bulk purchases, giveaways and DIY workshops and 
should look to offer more in the future. To find out more about rain barrels visit: 
https://eosecoenergy.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/water-conservation-flyer-final-2014.pdf  
 
 
22. Adapt to drought conditions 
 
How can we grow things during droughts, what options are there for drought-tolerant landscaping and 
vegetable gardening? What seeds are best selected for drought tolerance? Hot dry weather can also see 
ponds, rivers and lakes develop algae blooms toxic to humans, animals and livestock. Public education 
is needed. Having irrigation ponds dry up may require digging new wells in order to water farm fields. 
Workshops on soil health, regenerative agriculture and permaculture can provide some ways to 
adapt. 
 
 
Flood Risk  
 
Sackville is at risk of coastal flooding from the Bay of Fundy and potential dyke breaches, and flooding 
from intense rainstorms and snow melts. The community has already seen numerous floods from 
EOS Eco-Energy empowers residents, communities and municipal governments to be more 
sustainable and adapt to climate change. We use community-based tools and approaches that 
result in tangible action and improvements at the local level while supporting the local economy. 
Things like bulk purchases allow residents to save money by ordering together. Bulk orders provide 
an easy incentive for environmental action and show the power of community despite few if any 
government rebates or incentives. – EOS Eco-Energy 
50 Great Ideas for Inspiring Community Resilience to Climate Change in Sackville 
 
21 
rainstorms which have made roads impassable for days and flooded basements. The dykes near 
Sackville have overtopped by 1 to 2 cm during intense coastal storms.  
 
23. Reduce flood risk at home, work and in the community 
 
Floods can happen at any time of year but if we are prepared, it is less stressful. Homeowners and 
businesses can follow the tips below and households are encouraged to fill in the family flood plan on 
the following pages. 
 
 
 
Beyond household level actions, a community program to organize flood risk reduction home 
assessments could be organized by a local environmental organization and/or local area plumbers. 
Assessment advisors could help homeowners identify potential flood risks (for example, cracks in 
foundations, improper landscape grading, missing downspout extensions, etc.) and suggest solutions. 
Another community level effort could be to design and build additional naturalized stormwater 
retention ponds to complement the Lorne St. pond built by the Town of Sackville. Opportunities exist 
at the former site of the Pickard Quarry. Additional sites could be identified especially though a natural 
asset inventory.  Landowners with larger properties could also build naturalized stormwater retention 
ponds and look to potentially partner with Ducks Unlimited Canada to restore sites to wetlands.  
 
 
 
Tips for Reducing Flood Risk at Home and Work 
 
  Store important and hazardous items up high where they won’t get damaged. 
  Elevate furnaces, hot water heaters and electrical panels. 
  Anchor fuel tanks to the ground so they can’t float, tip over and leak out.  
  Make sure vents and fill lines for oil tanks are above flood levels. 
  Install a sump pump if appropriate for your home. 
  Install a sewer backflow valve if you are on municipal sewer system. 
  Install a water alarm to let you know if there is water in your basement.  
  Ensure proper grading around your home. 
  Keep eaves, storm drains and culverts free of debris. 
  Patch cracks in foundation. 
  Seal leaks around windows. 
  Extend downspouts at least 6 feet away from home foundation. 
  In winter, clear snow away from foundation. 
  Separate sewer and storm drains. 
  Use a rain barrel to collect runoff. 
  Reduce runoff by planting rain gardens.  
  Plant more trees and perennials and have less lawn. 
  Reduce hard surfaces such as concrete pathways and paved driveways.

24. Retreat, relocate, build back better 
 
Sea level rise may mean that some communities will need to retreat from low-lying areas. Storm surges 
and coastal erosion will impact more properties and buildings in the next years. Some areas may need 
to be abandoned. The topic of relocation is a tricky one, fraught with emotion and high costs. As a 
community, we need to think long-term about what the future could bring and how to avoid 
devastating emergencies. With long-term planning, residents and businesses can choose not to 
develop in flood zones. Current land use regulations make some developments in such areas difficult 
already. Sackville is fortunate to have upland areas within its town limits. When there is the 
opportunity, we could choose to build better – not building a basement, building on posts, building 
on higher ground, and relocating away from the coast.  
 
 
Emergency Planning 
 
25. Prepare for emergencies 
 
Being better prepared for emergencies and extreme weather events like storms, hurricanes, blizzards, 
or wildfires provides piece of mind. Households could fill in the emergency plan template on the 
following pages. Also think about how your workplace can better prepare in case you get stuck at work 
(do you have a first aid kit, food, blankets, etc. on hand)? You could ask your neighbours if they are 
prepared, share the household template with them; or hand out the template at community events. 
EOS has organized emergency preparedness workshops in partnership with local emergency 
measures organizations and hopes to offer more workshops in the future.

26. Get a 72-hour emergency kit  
 
Preparing an emergency kit with essentials will help households through a disaster while emergency 
officials are attending to others with greater needs. Kits will help households be more self-sufficient 
during emergencies. 72-hour kits can be purchased from the Canadian Red Cross at: 
https://products.redcross.ca/category/3/emergency-preparedness. Community bulk purchases can 
help reduce the costs. Kits can also be assembled. Fill a kit with the following items:  
 
 
 
 
27. Store food for the winter  
 
The COVID-19 pandemic showed how vulnerable food supply chains can be and how quickly shelves 
can go empty in an emergency. To be more self-sufficient, we could store more foods for the winter 
months, buy food in season, purchase local produce from the Sackville Farmers Market and other

local retailers. Grow what you are able to, and can, dehydrate, freeze, ferment it, or make things 
into preserves. Families will eat better in the off-season, save money and won’t need to spend as much 
time shopping. If we are prepared for winter in New Brunswick, we are prepared for anything! 
Preserving food for the winter does take time, so spread out the work, get together with friends or 
organize a fun community workshop to can and preserve large batches and share the end products.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How Much Food to Store for Winter? 
 
The following estimation is based on 300 days or 10 months and about 2,500 calories per person per 
day. (This estimation does not include the summer months when you may be eating more fresh 
produce from your garden or farmers markets.)  
 
Grains: Allow 1 lb. (2 cups dry) of grain per person per day. Grain includes flour, wheat, rice, pasta, 
quinoa, corn meal, oatmeal, etc. (800 calories) 
 
Beans: 1/2 lb. of beans is 700 calories (approx. 1 cup dry). 1 cup of dried beans will cook up into 3 
cups.  Allow 1/2 lb. of dried beans or peas per person per day if you are vegetarian.  If you have meat, 
eggs, and cheese allowing 1 lb. of beans per person per week allows for 2 vegetarian meals each 
week. (700 calories) 
 
Oils and butters: Allow 4 tbsp or 1/8th lb. per person per day of olive oil, coconut oil, or nut butters. 
This includes oil for cooking, spreads, and salad dressings. Butter is an option too and can be frozen 
up to 4 months. (400 calories)  
 
Nuts, Seeds: Allow for 2 oz. per day per person on a vegetarian diet.  Or 4 oz. per week for 
nutritional supplementation for omnivore diets.  (550 calories) 
 
Vegetables and fruits: This is where home canning and preserving come in. Allow for 4 to 6 half cup 
servings per person per day. (200 to 300 calories).  
  
Milk and dairy products: These are difficult store. One option is to have your own dairy goat or cow, 
but that is not an option for most people.  
 
Meat:  If you have your own animals such as chickens, pigs, cows, or wild game and waterfowl, you 
can dry, freeze or bottle some using a pressure canner.   
 
Seasonings, sweeteners and extras:  Store what you need and perhaps make your own or 
purchase local honey, maple syrup, spices, herbs, tea, etc.

Energy  
 
Saving energy reduces emissions that contribute to climate change. Finding ways to save energy, 
improve efficiency, and focus on renewable energy are all possible at the individual and the community 
level.   
 
28. Encourage landlords to improve the energy efficiency of their buildings 
 
Involving landlords in energy efficiency efforts will reduce their environmental impact and the quality of 
local housing. Respondents noted that many individual household actions can be difficult for renters 
with little control over energy use, heat sources and appliances in their homes. Create a community-
based incentive program for landlords.  
 
29. Promote and coordinate energy savings and efficiency programs 
 
Promote provincial programs such as NB Power’s Total Home Energy Savings program. For $99, 
homeowners can have an energy audit performed on their house and obtain information about 
available provincial rebates. Visit the NB Power website for more information and to sign up: 
https://www.saveenergynb.ca/en/save-energy/residential/total-home-energy-savings-program/  
 
NB Power’s Community Outreach Program is available to community groups and non-profit 
organizations. NB Power donates retrofit items such as LED light bulbs, high efficiency shower heads 
and hot water pipe wrap to be installed in local homes. EOS Eco-Energy has coordinated this program 
locally in the past and could again in the future if funding is obtained. Visit NB Power’s website for more 
information: https://www.saveenergynb.ca/en/save-energy/  
 
 
 
30. Draft-proofing 
 
Draft-proofing can be done by individual homeowners or organized as work parties that involve 
homeowners, friends and volunteers learning how to seal air leaks and working together to save the 
homeowner energy and money. The program has been offered by EOS Eco-Energy (when it can obtain 
funding) and includes an energy advisor with a blower door unit that measures air flow before and after 
the work party. Using simple tools and materials (like weather stripping, caulking, spray foam, foam 
gaskets, etc.) draft proofing can save an average of 1-2 tonnes of emissions per year per house. There 
are many older homes and buildings in the Sackville area that would benefit from draft-proofing 
Energy conservation and the environment have been priorities for us for some time. It began with 
choosing to build a house in 1988. The house (and roof) faces south, with windows mainly on the east 
and south. This design, combined with R28 walls, laid the groundwork for our upgrades in 2014. 
Photovoltaic solar panels, triple glazed windows, more cellulose in the attic, solar thermal hot water, 
new wood stove, and an air-to-air heat pump have reduced our consumption of electricity and brought 
us close to net zero. These things didn’t happen all at once but have evolved because we made it our 
priority. We have time now to grow and preserve more of our own food, taking advantage of the cold 
room which was part of the design years ago. Next ambition an electric car! Our panels were installed in 
the spring of 2013. Since then, we have generated about 50,500kWh. - Heather & Blane 
50 Great Ideas for Inspiring Community Resilience to Climate Change in Sackville

work and the program should be offered again if funding can be secured. The program could be 
expanded to non-profit buildings, churches, and other community buildings. 
 
31. Establish more solar powered buildings 
 
The Sackville community is a leader in solar power with a number of homes, businesses and schools 
powered by the sun already! This is partly due to EOS Eco-Energy’ solar bulk purchases over recent 
years. There are few government rebates or incentives for solar systems in New Brunswick, but 
community-based bulk purchases help reduce some of the costs. EOS also often puts on solar energy 
workshops, organizes home tours and provides information, and a resource directory and case studies 
are available on the Renewables NB website: https://renewablesnb.ca. Furthermore, there are a 
number of passive solar homes built by EnerGreen Builders, a local cooperative, in the Sackville area.  
 
 
32. Coordinate community-based financing for energy projects 
 
Beausejour Renewable Energy Co-operative Ltd. is a community-based for-profit investment 
cooperative run by a volunteer board. Local investment dollars are pooled to provide financing for solar 
or wind projects to commercial or residential property owners, and a return on investment to investors. 
Investments are kept local to help support local community development. More renewable energy 
projects in need of financing are desired in order to have investment opportunities.  Find out more 
about becoming a member, financing or investing at: https://beausejourcoop.wordpress.com. 
 
33. Develop community-owned renewable energy projects 
 
Community-owned solar farms and wind power sites create local jobs and revenue with less 
environmental impacts than other energy sources. The power grid in New Brunswick includes oil, gas, 
coal and nuclear power sources. If community members, organizations and businesses owned the 
renewable energy facility, they would be able to keep profits, control the facility’s operation and 
contribute to a much healthier environment. Unfortunately, current provincial regulations do not allow 
for community-owned power generation. 
 
34. Create a lending library 
 
Creating a lending library is a practical and feasible way to collaborate, share resources, reduce impact, 
save money and help each other. A community-based lending library could offer things such as 
garden tools, wheelbarrows, power tools, canning equipment, pressure cookers, dehydrators, heat 
lamps and incubators for chicks, wet/dry vacuums, fans, bicycles, camping gear, etc.  Things that aren’t 
I had never imagined I would design and build my own home. But after living (and renting) in Sackville 
for some years, I got to know local builders and learned about the elegant genius of passive solar design. 
I then bought an empty lot in Wood Point with a lovely view of the Bay of Fundy and realized that 
passive solar house construction was the obvious way to go. So, with a little help from friends and local 
tradesmen, I designed my own home and contracted EnerGreen Co-op to build it. It is one of the most 
energy efficient houses in Sackville-Tantramar and gorgeous to boot! This Christmas will be my tenth 
anniversary living in this home. - Brad

needed all the time but could be expensive or take up space to own would be great to have in lending 
library. An organization or group would be needed to coordinate and house the items, some of which 
could be donated, and a small rental fee could be charged. Organizations such as the Sackville 
Commons or EOS Eco-Energy could potentially be involved or support the initiative.  
 
 
Transportation 
 
Like food and shelter, transportation is a basic need, especially in the rural area where Sackville is 
located. Community-based options can be viable solutions.  
 
35. Coordinate sustainable community transportation options 
 
We need to get to work, school, shopping, activities and medical appointments safely. Sackville would 
benefit from bike lanes and trails and the discussion of a cycling and pedestrian bridge over the 
TransCanada Highway has been ongoing for many years. Active transportation contributes to a 
healthy and resilient community. A community shuttle would be ideal for out-of-town trips to 
Amherst, NS and Moncton. There are many seniors, low-income residents, single parents, students and 
others who would benefit greatly from a community shuttle to help them access medical 
appointments, and other essential services.  While a shuttle poses challenges for our low-density 
population, Tantramar Rural Rides, a charitable organization, offers door-to-door services for a low 
cost with volunteer drivers. Find Rural Rides at: http://ruralridesnb.com/tantramar/. 
 
36. Install electric vehicle charging stations 
 
Electrifying our transportation is central to addressing climate change and is the way of the future with 
more and more countries promising to ban the sale of new gas-powered vehicles in the coming years 
and decades. Electric vehicles reduce emissions and eliminate the need for oil and gas. EOS Eco-
Energy, Mount Allison University students and the Town of Sackville installed a level 2 electric vehicle 
charging station at the Sackville Visitor Information Centre in 2014. Since then, many local residents 
have purchased electric vehicles and many tourists drive them as well. There is a desire to install more 
electric vehicle charging stations, including a fast-charging station, in downtown Sackville to 
support electrification of transportation and support downtown development. As a community, we can 
work towards identifying funding for more charging stations at local businesses, municipal sites and 
other locations.  
 
 
 
 
 
I thought an electric car was five years in the future for my family. But when we crunched the numbers, 
we realized it was within our reach…. Plus, we know we're reducing our carbon footprint right away by 
switching to an EV. Maybe not every family is ready to switch to electric yet, but I think many would be 
surprised to find out how soon they might be. - Laura

Local Economy 
 
Local businesses have an important role and opportunity in providing services to support community 
resilience. Resilience also means supporting a vibrant local economy.  
 
37. Create an eco-business association  
 
Sackville businesses currently lack a business association, and the local Chamber of Commerce closed 
many years ago. Currently Sackville businesses have the option to join the Moncton Chamber of 
Commerce. Sackville Main Street Redevelopment represents the downtown business improvement 
area (BIA) and provides information for economic development for existing businesses in downtown 
Sackville and aids in promoting their appearance. An eco-business association could promote and 
support environmentally friendly businesses and assist others to become more eco-friendly. Improved 
communication and resource sharing, enabling businesses to feel part of the community could be 
another benefit.  
 
38. Create a climate change economic plan 
 
Businesses who responded to the survey would like to see a climate change economic plan developed 
that incorporates a vision of local climate resilience. Businesses would like a plan to guide actions 
with more intention. Such a plan could encourage more collaboration between businesses. 
Respondents would like a plan to help inspire and guide conversations with their boards and other 
businesses. Another repeated suggestion by business respondents was collaboration and input from 
local businesses, non-profits, and farms to provide employment, to create best-practices, and to create 
more resilient local systems. An eco-business association could coordinate a climate change economic 
plan. 
 
39. Create an energy efficient facility for businesses incubation 
 
For many years there has been a desire among Sackville community members to create a community 
centre for community groups and small businesses to share. It is a long-term project for the 
development of the town. Such a centre could house non-profit organizations, small offices, affordable 
meeting rooms, and enable tenants to share resources such as printers, receptionists, phones, etc. 
Ensuring the facility is energy-efficient and green contributes to the community’s overall focus on 
sustainability. Currently the Sackville Commons meet some of these needs and provides a space to co-
work and support entrepreneurs.

40. Encourage local businesses to save energy  
 
Supporting and encouraging local businesses and organizations to save energy is important to help 
businesses thrive, save money and reduce emissions. NB Power has a Commercial Building Retrofit  
Program. Visit: https://www.saveenergynb.ca/en/save-energy/commercial/commercial-buildings-
retrofit-program/.  
 
41. Promote and reward environmental stewardship 
 
EOS Eco-Energy hopes to offer a Green Shops Program, similar to a program available in Fredericton 
(https://greenshops.wordpress.com/green-shops/). The goal of the program is to reduce environmental 
impact through supporting, promoting and rewarding environmental stewardship within the business 
community. Participating businesses could be encouraged to implement actionable items which 
simultaneously reduce their environmental impact, reduce their operating costs, and help achieve a 
more sustainable community. Community not-for-profit organizations, including churches, should also 
be encouraged to save energy. Write articles and present local awards to promote businesses that 
prioritize environmental goals and climate change adaptation.  
 
 
42. Create a facility for local farmers to sell their products locally 
 
There has been a desire among residents, farmers and crafters to have a permanent location and 
enclosure for the Sackville Farmers Market for many years. Some local people look at the example in 
Wolfville, Nova Scotia where their market building is also solar powered: 
https://www.wolfvillefarmersmarket.ca. Supporting local farmers and crafters, shopping local, and 
reducing transportation needs and shortening supply chains helps a community be more self-reliant. 
Currently, local produce and crafts (including household supplies like soaps and cleaning products) are 
The Black Duck garden is an oasis of green amidst the surrounding concrete. Over several years, we 
transformed the area from a lawn and parking lot to an active ecological space. We planted a food 
forest with fruit trees and shrubs and built soil for vegetable beds including a greenhouse. Growing a 
variety of edible flowers and herbs provides habitat for insects and birds, and the garden has become a 
productive and beautiful space in downtown Sackville.  – Sarah and Al 
How can co-operatives contribute to resilience? 
 
Sackville is home to many co-operative businesses and charitable organizations such as Sackville 
Commons, Open Sky, Aster Group Environmental Services, EnerGreen Builders and Beausejour 
Renewable Energy, etc. Co-0peratives follow 7 principals including voluntary membership, 
democratic member control, member’s economic participation, autonomy and independence, 
education and training, cooperation among co-operatives, and concern for community. Co-
operatives are known as resilient businesses, able to find creative ways to survive when other 
businesses would fold. They can be more stable in communities which will be needed as we face 
increasing unpredictability due to a changing climate.

sold at the Sackville Farmers Market on Saturday mornings, Cattail Ridge Market, and some Sackville 
area produce is available at Ultramar and Hirtle’s Variety. 
 
43. Shop local  
 
Shopping locally keeps money local, reduces transportation costs, and puts money directly in the 
pockets of hard-working famers, crafters, and shop keepers. Locally made products reflect unique 
flavours, cultures and experiences. Shopping locally creates a vibrant community with a diverse and 
strong economy.  According to the Better Business Bureau, when $100 is spent at a local business, 
approximately $68 remains in the local economy. Locally owned businesses are also much more likely 
to support local causes and contribute to the local community than large corporations. Local businesses 
create local jobs and are also more likely to support other local businesses, purchasing supplies or 
services from them and keeping more money in the local economy. More local businesses also mean 
more local taxes which contribute revenue for important community infrastructure.  Shopping local 
translates into a stronger, more sustainable, resilient and vibrant community. Before ordering 
something online check with local businesses and if they don’t have what you are seeking, try asking 
them and perhaps they can bring it in.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Communication and Collaboration 
 
When EOS surveyed the Sackville community, all age groups responded with more confidence in their 
individual ability to deal with climate change, but less experience working collectively within their 
community to respond to emergencies or disasters. While generally few respondents had spoken to

50 Great Ideas for Inspiring Community Resilience to Climate Change in Sackville 
 
34 
their neighbours about responding to climate change disasters and emergencies, older respondents 
were slightly more likely to have discussed these scenarios with neighbours. Preparing and responding 
to climate change takes teamwork, cooperation and good relationships. Residents, organizations, 
businesses, and local institutions will need to depend on each other. Improving communication, 
welcoming newcomers, partnering with Indigenous leaders, and establishing a joint climate change 
coordinator are all great ways to support communication and benefit from collaboration. 
 
44. Improve communication throughout the community 
 
It is at the community level where we come together during times of crisis. While respondents to the 
community survey feel strongly that Sackville is resilient and well resourced, connecting people with 
those resources and with each other is an important action. Sackville is a busy place with a lot going on. 
Communication infrastructure is central to community climate adaptation and resilience. EOS heard 
there is a need for better communication between businesses and organizations, better communication 
with Mount Allison University students, and generally better communication in town. It was noted that 
quality communication is necessary to both educate residents about climate change and also to 
communicate climate threats, actions and opportunities. Some residents find it hard to know where to 
offer their skills or what organizations need help. The recent loss of the Sackville Tribune-Post has 
made communication and the sharing of news even more challenging. Not everyone has access to 
social media, and it can often be laden with inappropriate comments and false information. There are 
fewer places that will post posters as no one is allowed to linger in entryways during the pandemic. It is 
harder now than before the pandemic to get information out. The campus based CHMA radio station 
(106.9FM) does cover some local news and has a news website: https://www.chmafm.com/welcome/. 
Recently the Town of Sackville agreed to add a community news and events section to its monthly e-
newsletter which has a readership of 480+ local residents. Find the newsletters here: 
https://sackville.com/monthly-newsletter/.   A community subsidized Tantramar region weekly 
newspaper could be another great idea.  
 
45. Establish a newcomer program 
 
How a community welcomes newcomers says a lot. Establishing a newcomer welcome program could 
involve community volunteers gathering samples, coupons and/or gift certificates from local 
businesses, as well as brochures, information and business cards from local organizations and groups. 
Information and resources addressing climate change impacts could also be included. Volunteers could 
act as ambassadors for the community, explaining a variety of things and creating connections. Such a 
program could also be offered to existing residents who feel they have not had the opportunity to fully 
engage in the community or feel they don’t know enough about the resources available locally.  
 
46. Partner with Indigenous leaders  
 
Indigenous leaders have much to teach communities about resilience and creating collaborative 
communities. Indigenous voices, such as those from nearby Fort Folly First Nation and others should be 
elevated in climate action and decision-making. Meaningful partnerships and engagement on climate 
change projects are needed. Climate resilience work should involve efforts toward reconciliation.

35 
47. Establish a joint climate change/sustainability coordinator  
 
Establishing a joint climate change or sustainability coordinator shared between the Town of 
Sackville’s municipal government and Mount Allison University is not a new idea. For many years 
there have been residents who have seen the value in such a position to aid in communication, 
cooperation and beneficial community-wide actions.   
 
 
Citizen Engagement 
 
It is critical to recognize and change the systems that have caused the climate crisis and have left 
certain people more vulnerable to its impacts. We can’t do everything alone and do not have to. We can 
engage in civic duties, volunteer with or support community groups, and influence political action for 
larger changes and broader climate change adaptation.  
 
48. Get involved with local groups 
 
A great idea is to be part of collective action for a bigger impact. Community-based action and 
sustained action is an indicator of a resilient community and Sackville has a number of excellent 
community-based groups and organizations that have kept momentum on climate change action 
and/or community development. Volunteering with or donating to a local organization can be a great 
way to turn climate stress into action. Below are some local organizations that may have opportunities 
for volunteers or could use additional support.

49. Influence political action   
 
Voting, volunteering or running for election for the provincial and federal parties that align with your 
values will help move government toward the changes you want to see. Additional ways to influence 
political action is to write letters to your MLA and MP.  Running for municipal election, voting for the 
municipal councilors that you feel will work on the issues that matter to you and attending and 
participating in community meetings are more great ways to get involved.  
 
Despite all the household and community-based actions and ideas in the rest of this guide, there are 
many things we need our municipal, provincial or federal governments to do, such as create 
regulations and programs.  
 
Some actions from the municipal government that would enable further community resilience include:  
• 
Municipal water tax break and incentive for implementing water saving actions 
• 
Tree bylaw to help protect trees in the downtown 
• 
Net zero runoff bylaw 
• 
Formally joining the Transition Town movement 
• 
Working on long-term plans to retreat or relocate municipal assets to higher ground 
•

50 Great Ideas for Inspiring Community Resilience to Climate Change in Sackville 
 
37 
The provincial government can also support community resilience by: 
• 
Improving the dyke system 
• 
Allowing a property assessed clean energy (PACE) program where residents could finance 
clean energy projects affordably through their property taxes 
• 
Allow community-owned renewable energy projects  
• 
Provide funding for long-term and costly adaptation projects such as relocating low-lying 
sewage lagoons, doing land swaps, protecting critical transportation routes, etc.  
• 
And more

Challenges and Barriers 
 
In order for the great ideas in this guide to become reality, we must work to address and reduce barriers 
to action. Survey respondents, key informants and focus groups shared a variety of challenges and 
barriers they feel limits their own and the community’s ability to adapt to climate change and be more 
resilient.  
 
Residents’ primary barriers are provincial government, actions being too expensive, federal 
government, needing better skills, and being too busy. Other barriers include living in an apartment, old 
age and lack of ability, and some feel that their climate anxiety limits their ability to take part in climate 
actions. Many respondents said that NB Power’s reluctant attitude and limiting rules with regard to 
community renewable energy projects and lack of adequate financial incentives to upgrade homes 
present barriers to resilience. Among student respondents 64% feel they need better skills, 55% need 
more time or are too busy to adapt to climate change, and 49% need more knowledge to prepare for 
climate change. Local businesses are challenged with needing more time or being too busy, the 
provincial government, that adaptation is too expensive, and needing more information. 
 
Key informants and focus group participants reported that it will be difficult for people to cope and be 
resilient as more and more is thrown at them. Sackville is home to vulnerable populations, and it is hard 
to know their experience. They may not be connected or able to be engaged. Sackville has lost train 
service and is not serviced by as many bus routes as in the past which impacts the ability to access 
services and basic needs. Communication is challenging and the lack of community newspaper 
contributes. For some of the ideas provided in this guide, larger system changes or government action 
is needed. Provincial regulations prohibit local procurement of goods and services and force 
municipalities, schools and universities to purchase the lowest price rather than support local. 
Provincial government does not allow for community-owned renewable energy or PACE programs. 
Provincial rebates for energy efficiency and solar are minimal. Finally, there are no federal rebates to 
encourage household action such as home energy or electric vehicle rebates.

Opportunities: From Ideas to Action 
 
Despite challenges and barriers, the Sackville community possesses many strengths and has the ability 
to adapt to climate change. Turning ideas to action is vital to success. Ideas presented in this guide can 
be done at home, with friends, or as part of a community project. We can make positive changes; we 
just have to get started. Focus on your own strengths and select the actions you are interested in 
working on.  
 
 
Implementation Plan 
 
This is a guide for the Sackville community and so it is up to residents, businesses, organizations and 
community groups to implement ideas. You are invited to work on the ideas presented in this guide, to 
start projects, to get involved, to help. EOS Eco-Energy will use many of the ideas contained here to 
help direct its planning, community projects and funding proposals in the coming years. In particular
