INTRODUCTION
Home energy upgrade programs offer 
tailored financing options and other services 
to help homeowners improve the energy 
performance, comfort and value of their 
homes through energy efficiency meas­
ures, renewable energy installations and 
other improvements.
Local home energy upgrade programs are 
a win–win for municipalities and residents 
because they:
	•
reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
to help meet national, provincial/
territorial and local emissions targets
	
•
provide energy cost savings for residents 
through lower utility bills
	
•
make buildings more resilient and 
durable for facing increasing extreme 
weather conditions
	
•
provide healthier, more comfortable 
homes for residents
	
•
help to develop the local economy 
and create local jobs
FCM’s Community Efficiency Financing 
(CEF) initiative supports municipalities and 
their partners with funding and resources 
to implement local financing programs for 
home energy upgrades. This user guide 
is part of a suite of resources that can 
help your municipality develop one of 
these programs.
Who this guide is for
We created this guide to help municipalities 
and their partners across Canada to assess the 
potential for a local home energy upgrade 
program in their communities. Completing 
the steps in this guide will help you deter­
mine whether a local home energy upgrade 
program makes sense for your municipality 
and assist you in building a case for one to 
present to your local council.
Introduction
4
This guide focuses on assessing the 
potential for the types of home energy 
upgrade programs that would be eligible 
under FCM’s CEF initiative, but the steps 
in it are still relevant to other residential 
upgrade programs.
These are the key questions this guide 
will help you answer:
	
•
What are the overall size and 
characteristics of the housing stock 
in your community, and who would 
your home energy upgrade program 
serve? (In other words, who is the 
target market?)
	
•
What level of program uptake could you 
expect? That is, what is a realistic number 
of homes in your community that would 
participate in a local home energy 
upgrade program if one was offered?
	
•
What potential impact could the 
program have? How many greenhouse 
gas emissions would it reduce? How 
many jobs would it create?
FCM’s Community Efficiency 
Financing (CEF) initiative
CEF supports municipalities and their 
partners in designing local financing 
programs for low-rise residential prop­
erties. These programs offer financing 
to cover the full upfront costs of home 
energy upgrades, which are paid back 
over time. See the CEF application 
guide for more information.
How to use this guide
We’ll take you through the recommended 
types of research, methods and data 
sources you’ll need to help you determine 
how feasible a local home energy upgrade 
program would be in your community. The 
information you collect in these steps will 
be the foundation for further feasibility 
work that can help you build the case for 
your program.
The guide is organized around four main steps:
1.	 Assessing the market landscape: 
What other programs, if any, are already 
available in the marketplace? What 
have they achieved?
2.	 Examining local housing stock: Is 
the housing stock in your community 
suitable for home energy upgrades?
3.	 Understanding the perspective 
of residents: Who are the residents 
in your community and how likely are 
they to participate in a home energy 
upgrade program?
4.	 Putting it all together: Using the 
information you gathered in steps 1–3, 
you’ll now be able to identify your pro­
gram’s target market, estimate program 
uptake, and calculate program impact.
Each of these steps will be explained 
in-depth in its own section and broken 
down into smaller steps. Steps 1, 2 and 3 
don’t necessarily need to be done in the 
order listed here. There will be a checklist 
at the end of the sections for Steps 1–3 to 
help you keep track of the most important 
information to gather. Some of this information 
will be vital for completing Step 4.
Introduction
5
How you complete this assessment will 
also depend on your municipality’s local 
priorities, so keep these in mind as you 
work through the steps.
Scope and limitations 
of this guide
This guide is intended to be a starting point. 
Our focus is on assessing whether a home 
energy upgrade program would make sense 
for your community, so we don’t get into 
some of the more complex work that you 
would need to do for detailed program 
design here.
For example, this guide does not cover 
reviewing relevant legislation around local 
home energy upgrade programs, but this 
is an important component of a feasibility 
study for a local financing program under 
FCM’s CEF initiative.
This guide focuses on the environmental 
impact of home energy upgrade programs, 
although we do touch briefly on job creation 
impact (Step 4) and home energy afford­
ability (Step 3). The guide doesn’t cover 
how to plan a program with an equity lens. 
However, it’s important to center equity and 
inclusion in the planning and design of any 
new program from the outset. We include 
several resources that can help you get 
started in Step 3.
Your council may have other priorities as 
well, such as energy cost savings, so you 
may need to do additional research and 
analysis to determine other impacts. It’s 
important to be aware of your local council’s 
priorities so you can tailor a business case 
to your local context.
Introduction

STEP 1: 
Assess the market landscape
You may want to start with a high-level scan 
of the home energy upgrade program land­
scape. What programs are already available 
in your community? In nearby communities? 
In your province or territory? Nationally?
In this step you’ll review those programs 
and assess how well they fit with market 
conditions and consumer needs and prefer­
ences. What has and hasn’t worked to date, 
and why?
Having this kind of snapshot will help you 
determine what your program could offer. 
Researching how other municipalities have 
designed or implemented home energy 
upgrade programs will show how your 
program might complement existing 
programs offered by utility companies, 
provincial/territorial agencies or 
the federal government.
STEP 1: Assess the market landscape

Table 1 summarizes this step. We’ll be looking at these actions and their outcomes in more 
detail in the rest of this section.

Steps
Benefits
Program review:
	
•
Look at existing home energy 
upgrade programs available 
in your province/territory
	
•
Review local home energy upgrade 
programs established in other 
communities/nationally
	•
Examine the effectiveness of past and current 
programs (what results did they achieve?)
	
•
Identifies potential gaps and/or 
limitations in current programs (areas 
for improvement that your program 
could address)
	
•
Data on program uptake will help you 
estimate program uptake and impact 
for your program later
Stakeholder consultation (optional):
Consult with a few stakeholders, such as 
utilities, trades/conwtractors and home energy 
auditors about their experiences with home 
energy upgrade programs
	
•
May give you more insight into barriers 
and opportunities
	
•
Establishes relationships with stakeholders 
who may be key to successful program 
development and implementation later
Program review
The easiest way to find out about home 
energy upgrade programs that are already 
available is to start by searching your prov­
incial or territorial government’s website. 
Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) and 
Efficiency Canada have also compiled 
directories that are a great starting point 
for your research (see the Key resources 
box on this page).
Key resources:
•	
FCM’s CEF Resource Library
•	
Clean Air Partnership’s toolkit 
for municipalities looking to 
implement local programs
•	
NRCan’s directory of energy 
efficiency programs for homes
•	
NRCan’s list of energy efficiency 
financial incentives by province
•	
Efficiency Canada’s database 
of energy efficiency programs
STEP 1: Assess the market landscape
8
For each program you review, take note 
of the following:
	
•
What is the program’s focus 
or objective?
	
•
What are its eligibility requirements?
	
•
What are its funding limits?
	
•
What kind of resources or tools does 
it provide to help homeowners make 
decisions on upgrades?
	
•
What kinds of incentivization does 
it use?
	
•
What is the overall process that 
homeowners must navigate to get 
rebates or other financial assistance?
You should also examine how effective 
each program has been in meeting its 
goals or targets:
	
•
What are the program’s actual uptake 
and outcomes?
	
•
Which program measures had the 
greatest impact (energy cost savings, 
GHG emissions reductions, etc.)?
	
•
What are the program’s gaps 
or limitations?
Rebate/incentive programs 
versus financing programs
Historically, home energy upgrade 
programs have offered rebates and 
incentives to encourage homeowners 
to make energy upgrades. Now there 
are a growing number of financing 
programs that cover the upfront costs 
of upgrades, including local pro­
grams funded by FCM’s Community 
Efficiency Financing initiative and 
the Canada Greener Homes Loan 
program. Financing programs 
complement existing rebate pro­
grams and can help homeowners 
undertake deeper and more costly 
energy upgrades. When assessing 
the potential for a new home energy 
upgrade program in your community, 
it’s important to consider how a new 
program would fill gaps and com­
plement existing programs that are 
already out there.
STEP 1: Assess the market landscape
9
Stakeholder consultation 
(optional)
To take your assessment of the market 
landscape to the next level, consider 
consulting with some of the stakeholders 
(such as utility staff, tradespeople who work 
on the upgrades, etc.) involved in delivering 
the programs you researched to gain some 
valuable lessons learned. Cultivating rela­
tionships with these types of stakeholders 
earlier in the process is a good idea anyway, 
because they may inform and/or support your 
program’s development and might even be 
involved in delivering your program, provid­
ing training and helping with promotion 
and marketing.
For example, holding an engagement 
session with tradespeople who conduct 
home energy evaluations and complete 
home energy upgrades can provide 
valuable insights on issues such as:
	
•
challenges faced with certain types 
of homes or upgrade projects
	
•
parts of the program that have 
and have not worked well
	
•
capacity/competency levels of 
tradespeople working on energy 
efficiency/renewable energy upgrades 
(e.g., is more training needed?)
	
•
potential supply chain constraints
	
•
any early questions or concerns to flag 
about home energy upgrade programs 
(administrative process, etc.)
STEP 1 CHECKLIST: ASSESS THE MARKET LANDSCAPE
If you have successfully completed Step 1 you should have 
the following important information:
	

Gaps and/or limitations in current programs that can help identify what 
your program should offer and who it should target
	

Past program results/uptake rates to use for estimating participation 
in your program and calculating its impact
STEP 1: Assess the market landscape
10
STEP 2: 
Examine local housing stock
1	
Although this guide does not cover reviewing relevant legislation, it's possible that there may be limitations 
on the types of properties eligible for a home energy upgrade program in your province/territory. For example, 
mobile homes are specifically excluded from participating in Alberta’s Clean Energy Improvement Program. 
You will want to consider this when defining which types of residences your program will serve.
Another important step is finding out how 
a local home energy upgrade program 
would fit into your community. The aim of 
this step is to gather data on all categories 
of residential dwellings within your commun­
ity. You want to find out the total number of 
residences and the age of that housing stock 
to get an idea of how many residences could 
be served by your home energy upgrade 
program (i.e., your program’s potential 
market size).
You’ll start by identifying how many buildings 
within a community are residential dwellings 
versus buildings used for commercial, indus­
trial or institutional purposes. Then you’ll 
look within that residential category—there 
are several types of dwellings, such as apart­
ment buildings and single-detached houses, 
that could be the focus of a home energy 
upgrade program. For example, the CEF 
initiative focuses on upgrades to single-family 
homes, which include single-detached and 
semi‑attached houses, row housing and 
permanently affixed mobile homes.1
Step 2: Examine local housing stock
11
The age of housing is important because 
of the historical improvements made to 
building codes2 over the past several dec­
ades. Generally, the older a home is, the less 
energy efficient it is because older homes 
were often built to much lower standards 
than modern homes. This means that the 
potential for energy cost savings and GHG 
emissions reductions from energy upgrades 
will often be greatest in older homes, espe­
cially anything built before the 1990s (when 
building codes were first introduced in 
some provinces).
2	 Although the first National Building Code in Canada was released in 1941, the first National Energy 
Code for Buildings (NECB) wasn’t developed until 1997. The NECB was updated in 2011 and included 
an average performance improvement of 25 percent over the original version. Building codes also vary 
by province/territory, as do their inclusion of energy efficiency standards.
You will also be looking at energy data for 
the local housing stock in this step. You’ll 
need to know the total residential energy 
consumption and GHG emissions for your 
community so you can calculate averages 
per household to show baseline levels that 
your upgrade program is aiming to improve 
(we’ll be doing this later, in Step 4).
Table 2 summarizes this step. We’ll be 
looking at these actions and their outcomes 
in more detail in the rest of this section.

Steps
Benefits
Identify housing quantity, type and age:
Identify total residential dwellings and 
number of single-family homes (SFH) versus 
multi‑residential buildings within a community 
sorted by age (period of construction)
Determine home energy use:
	
•
Determine total energy consumption in 
residential sector (ideally separated by 
SFH and multi-residential buildings)
	
•
Identify primary heating energy source 
for different categories of dwellings
	•
Summarize past energy upgrades completed 
in community if data is available
	
•
Provides an initial estimate of the 
size of the target market(s) for your

to make map illustrations (optional)
Develop housing archetypes (optional):
Use data modelling to identify major group­
ings of housing types in the community based 
on the potential for improvements in energy 
efficiency, GHG emissions and costs
	
•
Visual presentation of data compiled, 
such as priority neighbourhoods with 
high density of older homes
	
•
Can help identify a target market and break 
it down into useful market segments (i.e., 
by home age, GHG emissions, energy rating 
and consumption, and utility costs) later
	•
Can help create a more accurate estimate 
of potential program impact later
Step 2: Examine local housing stock
12
Identify housing 
quantity, type and age
Depending on your province or territory, 
you may use federal, provincial/territorial 
or regional/local housing data sets for this 
task (see Table 3). They usually include 
quantities of different dwelling types as 
well as age.
3	 Although many municipalities may have access to their local residential property tax databases, it can take a 
lot of staff time to compile the necessary information for this step. That’s why this guide focuses on the two 
national databases that already have the built-in ability to compile the information needed for this step. If 
program planners do have access to local municipal property databases and the staff capacity to compile the 
information, the required data outlined in this section is still the same.
There are two databases that make it 
relatively easy to compile information for 
this step. Statistics Canada’s Canadian 
Housing Statistics Program (CHSP) and the 
Canadian Mortgage Housing Corporation’s 
(CMHC) Housing Market Information Portal 
both draw on national Census data, and 
you can customize searches to your geo­
graphic region. Once you find the data 
you’re looking for, it can be downloaded 
into a spreadsheet.

Provincial housing agencies
Some provinces also have agencies that compile detailed housing 
data, such as the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation 
(Ontario) and the Property Valuation Services Corporation (Nova 
Scotia). Some municipalities may have someone in their planning, 
building or economic development departments who regularly 
accesses these databases and can share information from them.3
Municipal tax records
If your municipality has a local climate action plan or a community 
energy plan, check if some of this data has already been compiled 
using municipal tax records of residential properties.
Step 2: Examine local housing stock
13
Once you have the data you need, you can 
produce a visual representation of it. This 
could be:
	
•
a table listing the quantity/types of 
homes by decade of construction, or
	
•
a graph illustrating how many homes are 
over 30 years old, over 50 years old, and 
over 70 years old (these age groupings 
are examples)
Figure 1 shows an example of two graphs 
showing proportions of GHG emissions 
by source and the distribution of housing 
stock by decade built in Burlington, Ontario. 
The figure shows that a high proportion 
of homes in Burlington were built before 
1990, which means they likely account for 
a significant portion of the emissions from 
the residential sector in that community. 
Communities with a long history of residen­
tial development, like Burlington, tend to 
have a high proportion of older (and there­
fore energy inefficient) homes. This makes 
them good choices for local home energy 
upgrade programs because it maximizes 
program impact.

and age of housing stock in Burlington, Ontario

Step 2: Examine local housing stock
14
Determine home 
energy use
To properly assess the potential for your 
program, you’ll need to, at a minimum, find 
out the total residential energy consumption 
within your community by energy source 
(i.e., heating fuels and electricity). The main 
sources of household energy use data are 
national databases, utility companies and, 
sometimes, municipalities.
Canadian homes use on average about 
80% of total household energy on space 
and water heating4. That’s why it’s also 
important to determine what proportion of 
households use different fossil fuels, electri­
city, or other energy sources for space and 
water heating. Understanding the carbon 
intensity (how many GHG emissions are cre­
ated per unit of fuel consumed) and costs 
of those energy sources consumed in your 
community can help you more accurately 
estimate the potential for home energy 
upgrades to reduce emissions and/or save 
money on energy bills.
The age and location of a home may dictate 
its primary heating source. Some areas or 
residences don’t have access to natural gas 
service lines. In these cases, oil or propane 
are often the fuels used alongside wood and 
electricity. This is relevant to planning home 
energy upgrade programs because fuel oil 
and propane are usually the most expensive 
and carbon-intensive heating fuels used in 
homes in many parts of Canada.5
4	 See NRCan’s “Energy Use in the Residential Sector” for more on this.
5	 If your community uses heating oil or propane for home heating, note that the provincial/territorial level data 
on these heating sources may be incomplete. You can supplement this information through any existing utility 
or municipal surveys on household energy use, or by including a question in a survey to residents.
6	 Note that due to Alberta’s deregulated energy market, Alberta municipalities may have difficulty requesting 
this data if there are many energy retailers for electricity and natural gas servicing your community. In that case, 
it may be helpful to work with a third party to compile this data.
The more detailed the data you compile 
for this step, the better your understanding 
will be of the types of homes your program 
could target for the greatest household 
GHG emissions reductions and/or energy cost 
savings. If your data is detailed enough, you 
might also be able to pinpoint where these 
homes are concentrated in your community.
Getting data from municipal 
sources and utility companies
If your municipality has already compiled 
a community GHG emissions inventory, 
start with this. You may already have a total 
energy consumption figure for all residential 
buildings available.
Utilities like natural gas and electricity 
companies have data sets on residential 
energy use that may be helpful. If your 
municipality has not completed a GHG 
emissions inventory, you can try requesting 
data on your community’s residential energy 
consumption from your local or provincial 
utility company.6
Ask the utility company for:
	
•
Total residential energy consumption, 
ideally separated by single family homes 
and multi-residential buildings, as well 
as by postal code (if possible)
	
•
Results of any recent customer 
surveys related to energy efficiency 
and conservation
Step 2: Examine local housing stock
15
Depending on the utility company’s policies 
and your relationship with the company, 
it may be too time-consuming to try and 
obtain more detailed energy consumption 
data from it. If the utility company can’t 
provide what you’re looking for, you can 
take the total residential energy consump­
tion from one of the national databases in 
the next section and divide it by the number 
of residential dwellings within your muni­
cipality to develop an average household 
consumption value (in a common unit such 
as gigajoules). Note that some homes will 
use more energy (e.g., older and/or larger 
homes) or less energy (e.g., newer and/or 
smaller homes) than this average.
Using national databases
You can use national databases to apply 
provincial/territorial percentages for differ­
ent variables (e.g., primary heating source) 
to the number of residential dwellings within 
your community (as collected in the previous 
step) to derive a high-level proportional 
breakdown for your community. Table 4 lists 
a few examples.
A limitation of this approach is that using 
provincial/territorial averages may not reflect 
the characteristics of your local housing 
stock—this is particularly the case in more 
rural or less populated regions. But the prov­
incial data can be a good starting point, and 
you could refine it further if more localized 
data is available for your community.

16
The national EnerGuide Rating System 
(ERS), developed and maintained by Natural 
Resources Canada, is also a very rich data 
source.7 ERS measures and collects data 
from home energy evaluations that is used 
in developing many energy efficiency 
programs across Canada. It tells you the 
amount of energy consumed by a home, 
the efficiency of equipment and systems 
within the home, and the types of energy 
sources utilized. All are important for 
assessing the potential impact of a home 
energy upgrade program. Tens of thousands 
of EnerGuide evaluations have been 
completed over the past 25 years.
7	 For some smaller or remote communities, there may be very limited or no home energy evaluation data 
available from ERS. In these cases, look at EnerGuide data at the provincial or territorial scale.
8	 To do this, you’ll need to contact the office by email and put in your request.
Data on the number of completed evaluations, 
amount of GHG emissions reductions from 
completed upgrades, and the age of homes 
evaluated can be very helpful for program 
planning. You can request this data in sum­
mary form from NRCan’s Office of Energy 
Efficiency.8 If your community is part of the 
Green Communities Canada network, you 
can also request summary data on existing 
EnerGuide home energy evaluations from 
one of its member organizations.

EnerGuide results. These could also be 
compiled by the first three digits of the 
postal code and then shown on a map.

Map geocoded housing 
data (optional)
Municipalities with in-house GIS (geographic 
information system) staff could map 
geocoded housing data to show the location 
of homes within a community by age of con­
struction, as the example in Figure 2 shows. 
Mapping can be useful for targeting specific 
neighbourhoods for further consideration in 
the program design stage but is not critical. If 
your municipality has the in-house capacity or 
resources available to hire a consultant to do 
this, consider completing this step. Another 
option is to seek assistance for mapping 
from a university or other post-secondary 
school (as a student project, perhaps) or from 
non‑profit organizations with GIS abilities.

18
Develop home 
archetypes (optional)
Home archetypes are developed using data 
modelling (often using detailed data from 
EnerGuide evaluations) to create categories 
of your community’s housing stock that are 
based on characteristics such as:
	
•
age of construction
	
•
size
	
•
primary heating fuel type (electricity, 
natural gas, fuel oil, propane, etc.)
	
•
total energy consumption and 
energy costs
	
•
building envelope and mechanical 
efficiency performance or 
efficiency ratings
Although it usually requires some specialized 
consultant expertise, home archetyping 
can tell you which upgrades will yield the

greatest improvements in efficiency, emissions 
and costs. Archetypes can also be mapped 
to pinpoint the market segments that a 
home energy upgrade program could target 
to have the greatest impact. Many Canadian 
municipalities have used home archetypes 
in their program planning processes to 
better understand the opportunity for home 
energy upgrades. See Appendix B for sample 
home archetypes in Capital Region District, 
British Columbia.
Incorporating home archetypes into your 
program planning process can also help 
with identifying which groups of housing 
can benefit the most from energy upgrades, 
in terms of cost savings. This makes it a 
powerful technique for addressing energy 
poverty because it can help target house­
holds that experience the highest energy 
cost burden. We’ll discuss energy cost 
burden more in Step 3.
STEP 2 CHECKLIST: EXAMINE LOCAL HOUSING STOCK
If you have successfully completed Step 2 you should have 
the following information:
	

The number of homes within your community, ideally by major housing 
type, (e.g., single-family home or low-rise residential building three stories 
or under9)
	

Total residential energy consumption, ideally broken down by major housing 
type and/or by primary heating energy source (e.g., natural gas, electricity, 
fuel oil, propane)
	

Total residential GHG emissions within your community from a municipal 
GHG inventory or average energy consumption per home and breakdown 
of energy consumption by energy source for your province/territory using 
NRCan’s Comprehensive Energy Use Database
Step 2: Examine local housing stock
19
STEP 3: 
Understand residents’ 
perspectives
10	 If planning a program within FCM’s CEF scope, this refers to single-family homeowners and includes owners 
of low-rise residential buildings that are rented out to residents. If planning an upgrade program outside of this 
scope, for example to reach people renting units in multi-residential buildings, the target audience would be 
the owners and/or managers of those mid-rise and high-rise rental buildings.
To develop a successful home energy 
upgrade program, it’s essential to under­
stand who your potential program users 
(the owners of the residential buildings in 
your program area) are and to learn about 
their needs.10 This step will help you do that, 
and it will also help you to identify potential 
opportunities for and barriers to participa­
tion in a home energy upgrade program in 
your community.
Your local municipal council will find 
information gathered directly from pos­
sible program users valuable. Councils 
want to ensure their constituents have 
had input into any proposed local energy 
upgrade program.
Step 3: Understand residents’ perspectives
20
You can also use data you collect here to 
verify the data you collected in Step 2, such 
as the primary energy sources residents use 
to heat their homes. You’ll need this data to 
estimate the potential impact of your 
program in Step 4, so it’s important that 
it be as rich as possible.
Table 6 summarizes this step. We’ll be 
looking at these actions and outcomes 
in more detail in the rest of this section.

Steps
Benefits
Gather residents’ perspectives on home 
energy improvements:
Survey residents on their viewpoints on home 
energy upgrades. What are the barriers and 
incentives to their participation in a home 
energy upgrade program?
	
•
May help further define a target market for 
your program
	
•
Insight into barriers and opportunities that 
could be addressed to improve program 
participation
	
•
Can be another way of collecting/
confirming localized data on primary 
heating energy source from Step 2
Complete a review of home energy 
affordability (optional):
Identify the percentage of households within 
the community with high, very high and 
extreme energy cost burdens
Information on households with high energy cost 
burdens in your community could be important 
for designing an appropriate program
Step 3: Understand residents’ perspectives
21
Gather residents’ 
perspectives on home 
energy improvements
If resources and/or capacity are available, 
conduct an anonymous online survey of 
the residents your local energy upgrade 
program would target to gather the 
following useful data:
	
•
primary energy sources and equipment 
used for space and water heating in 
their homes, and the age/efficiency 
of that equipment11
	
•
their past knowledge and experience 
with other energy upgrade programs 
offered by different levels of government 
or by utility providers
	
•
barriers they face when it comes to 
making home energy improvements
	
•
things that would motivate them to 
make home energy improvements
	
•
home energy upgrades/renovations 
they’ve made in the past or are planning 
to make in the future, and how they 
paid/would pay for them
	
•
under what circumstances they would 
consider accessing financing from 
a new local program
11	 This could help to locally verify data collected during Step 2 if national or provincial/territorial data sets 
were utilized.
There may already be recent consumer 
surveys or research for your community 
and/or relevant ones from the provin­
cial/territorial/national level. Here are 
a few examples:
•	
Example of a national survey 
by the Consumers Council 
of Canada
•	
Example of a provincial survey by 
Transition Énergétique Québec
•	
Example of utility-led consumer 
survey by Fortis B.C.
•	
Example of municipal-led survey 
by City of Kingston
•	
Example of a resident and 
stakeholder engagement report 
by the City of Saskatoon
These types of surveys can usually be 
developed in-house with municipal communi­
cations staff or by collaborating with a local 
partner such as a non-profit organization 
or a post-secondary school student and/
or instructor. You can promote the survey 
in municipal spaces (e.g., curbside signs, 
ads on transit vehicles/shelters/benches, 
websites and social media blasts) often 
for free.
If your municipality does not have the capacity 
to conduct a survey, you can use existing 
research from other sources to understand 
some typical behaviours around program 
participation. See the survey examples in 
the call-out box on this page.
Step 3: Understand residents’ perspectives
22
Complete a review 
of home energy 
affordability (optional)
Household energy cost burden is the 
proportion of household income spent 
on heating and electricity. Residents who 
are spending disproportionately more of 
their household income on energy costs 
than the national median are experiencing 
energy poverty.12
If one of your program goals is to improve 
housing affordability through implementing 
home energy conservation and efficiency 
improvements, you won’t want to skip this 
step. And you may still want to complete it 
even if reducing household energy costs is 
not an explicit focus of your program. Your 
local council is likely to want to know more 
about an issue that a program could contribute 
to improving at the community level.
The Energy Poverty and Equity Explorer 
is an online mapping tool developed by 
Canadian Urban Sustainability Practitioners 
(CUSP). This tool compiles relevant 
Statistics Canada Census data such as:
	
•
median home energy expenditure
	
•
housing needing major repairs
	
•
percentage of housing built before 1991
	
•
percentage of single-detached dwellings 
versus mid- and high-rise buildings
	
•
percentage of resident-owned versus 
rented households
12	 As defined by the CUSP initiative, energy cost burden is calculated as the percentage of total after-tax 
household income that is spent on home heating and electricity compared to the national median percentage 
(3%). An energy cost burden of 6% is considered “high”; 10% is “very high”; anything 15% or more is “extreme.”
Data from the Energy Poverty and Equity 
Explorer tool is readily available for down­
load from CUSP’s website. You can use the 
tool to identify varying levels of household 
energy burden in your community. Figure 3, 
made with the CUSP tool, captures a view of 
a Census tract near Winnipeg experiencing 
a high home energy cost burden. The figure 
illustrates the proportion of households and 
the varying degrees of household energy 
cost burden they are experiencing along 
with median home energy expenditure.
Understanding energy poverty in your 
community is just one aspect of planning 
a program with an equity lens. Although 
this guide does not go into detail about 
how to address equity in your program 
design, we encourage you to consider 
doing some additional research to under­
stand socioeconomic and systemic barriers 
to program participation, and to ensure 
that the viewpoints and needs of margin­
alized or underrepresented groups are 
heard. The Energy Poverty and Equity 
Explorer tool includes additional demo­
graphic and housing data that can help 
with your analysis, such as:
	
•
Proportion of renter or owner 
households
	
•
Housing condition in terms of need 
for major repairs
	
•
Homeowner affordability (i.e., % of 
income spent on shelter costs)
	
•
Recent immigrant households as 
well as those speaking neither English 
nor French
	
•
Proportion of visible minority and 
Indigenous households

STEP 3 CHECKLIST: UNDERSTAND RESIDENTS’ PERSPECTIVES
If you have successfully completed Step 3 you should 
have the following information:
	

Demographic data and results from local surveys (and possibly a home 
energy affordability review) that can help you identify/refine who the target 
market of your program is
	

Potential barriers and opportunities for consideration in estimating program 
uptake levels
13	 Another resource you may find useful is the guidebook, Integrating equity, diversity and inclusion into municipal 
climate action, developed by ICLEI Canada and FCM’s Partners for Climate Protection program.
Step 3: Understand residents’ perspectives
24
STEP 4: 
Put it all together
You’ve assessed the home energy upgrade 
program marketplace, examined local 
housing characteristics and sought the per­
spectives of the residents in your community 
who could be your program’s users. In this 
final step, you’ll take the information you 
gathered in Steps 1–3 and use it to clarify your 
program’s target market and estimate the 
potential uptake and impact of your program.
As you get started on this, keep in mind that 
it can be easy to become overly ambitious 
when estimating your program’s uptake 
and impact. Try to be aware of any limit­
ing factors—like how many homes can be 
physically retrofitted, contractor availability, 
administrative capacity, etc., so that you can 
set realistic expectations.
Identify your home 
energy upgrade program’s 
target market
The information you gathered in Steps 1–3 
can be used now to pinpoint your program’s 
target market. This target market are 
residents of homes with specific housing/
energy characteristics that would be served 
by your program.
You may find it helpful to further refine this 
target market into segments like the exam­
ples shown in Table 7. Programs can have 
multiple target market segments, and there 
will likely be some overlap between them.
Step 4: Put it all together
25
TABLE 7. Possible target market segmentsMTT_ATT
Market segment
Information source/step
Homeowners planning renovations
Research on other programs, consumer studies, 
resident surveys (Steps 1,3)
Homes that are likely to have a low building 
envelope standard (i.e., most homes built 
before 1991)
Review of type/age of housing stock (Step 2)
Homes using fuel oil or propane as their primary 
heating sources (i.e., homes with high energy 
costs and high GHG emissions)
Data on residential energy use (Step 2,3)
Homes with above-average energy use and/
or GHG emissions per square metre (can be 
sub-categorized into homes that would realize 
the highest cost-savings potential)
EnerGuide data, other detailed energy 
consumption data, and/or modelled 
home archetypes (Step 2)
Residents who want to lower the carbon 
footprint of their homes
Resident surveys or other engagement 
activities (Step 3)
Homes/areas with high energy cost burdens
Home energy affordability review (Step 3)
You will likely establish a much more precise 
target market later, in the program design 
stage. But you still need some understanding 
of who your target market segments are now 
to estimate program uptake in the next step.
An important point to note is that the 
more you narrow down your program’s 
target market, the smaller the number of 
homes/homeowners who are eligible to 
participate will be. This isn’t necessarily 
a bad thing. For example, a program that 
focuses on fuel-switching to reduce GHG 
emissions may only reach a small portion 
of all the homes in a community that were 
built before 1991, but it is likely that a large 
portion of participating homes will be those 
heated by more expensive, higher-emitting 
fuels like oil and propane. This is good news 
for program impact (more on this concept 
in the final step).
Step 4: Put it all together
26
Estimate program uptake
This step simply involves calculating the 
estimated number of homes you think would 
potentially implement home energy upgrades 
through participating in a local program. 
The information you compiled in steps 1–3 
will help you calculate program uptake.
Let’s walk through the equation with 
an example:
Say we want to develop a 20-year program 
that focuses on low-rise residential homes 
built before 1991 in a community with 
40,000 low-rise residential buildings.
FIGURE 4: Equation for estimating program uptake
You can further examine these considerations and refine program uptake estimates as more 
detailed information is collected and analyzed during the program design stage and as local 
decisions are made on the program’s focus and features. But the numbers you have now will 
be good enough for the next step, where you calculate your program’s potential impact.
Step 4: Put it all together
27
Calculate program impact
In this step you’ll make a preliminary estimate of your program’s environmental impact: 
the overall or average percentage of improved energy efficiency that will be achieved by 
participating homes, and the impact of this on greenhouse gas emissions. There is also a 
simple equation later in this section for calculating your program’s job creation impact.
FORMULA FOR CALCULATING POTENTIAL PROGRAM IMPACT:
baseline × % rate of improvement = impact
We’ll be going over everything you need to 
do this equation in this section. You’ll use 
some of the values you just calculated in the 
previous step and some from the data you 
gathered in Steps 1–2 of this guide. If your 
municipality has completed a community 
GHG emissions inventory, you can use the 
residential sector energy and emissions 
data from that to calculate your program’s 
impact. However, the guidance in this 
section applies whether your municipality 
already has a community GHG inventory 
or not. We’ll walk you through how to do 
the program impact calculation with and 
without it.

gas reductions at the project level
Step-by-step guidance from ICLEI 
Canada and FCM’s Partners for Climate 
Protection on estimating GHG reductions 
from local mitigation projects, including 
the basics of formulating calculations for 
home upgrade programs. Page 4 of the 
guidebook explains how to convert activ­
ity data (e.g., kilowatt-hours of electricity 
usage) to GHG emissions.
Step 4: Put it all together
28
CHECKLIST: DATA YOU WILL NEED TO USE THIS FORMULA
	

Estimated number of homes participating in your program (from your 
estimation of program uptake in the previous step)
	

Average energy consumption per household in your region, expressed in 
gigajoules/GJ (from data on residential energy use you compiled in Step 2)
	

Conversion tables to convert each fuel/energy source from GJ to original 
energy units and appropriate emission factors for each energy source to 
estimate GHGs (see Appendix A)
	

Average percentage of household energy consumption by each source 
(Step 2) converted from GJ to original energy units (electricity in kilowatt 
hours; natural gas in cubic metres; fuel oil and propane in litres)14
	

Estimated rate of improvement: the average reduction in household GHG 
emissions that would result from your program’s upgrades, expressed as a 
percentage (based on your research on other programs in Step 1). Later in the 
sample equation you’ll see we’ve used a 30% rate of improvement.15
14	 Wood is not included in GHG calculations in this guide because it’s largely recognized as a carbon-neutral fuel. 
But it’s important to note that homes primarily using wood for heating can implement energy upgrades to save 
on costs and to improve indoor and outdoor air quality.
15	 We chose 30% for our example because several home energy upgrade programs in Ontario and Quebec have 
achieved an average 30% reduction in GHG emissions and energy consumption. However, your research in 
Step 1 will be relevant to your jurisdiction and may lead you to a different rate of improvement to use in your 
calculation. For one thing, household consumption of fuels and electricity and the carbon intensity of electricity 
generation vary significantly across Canada. For another, your rate of improvement will also be tied to the type 
of upgrades targeted by your program and how comprehensive the upgrades are.

If your municipality already 
has a community‑scale GHG 
emissions inventory
You can use this simpler approach using 
existing GHG figures from your municipal 
inventory as follows:
	
•
Take the amount of residential-sector 
GHGs (expressed in tCO2e) from your 
community GHG inventory and divide it 
by the total number of dwellings in the 
community (ideally by major housing 
type, such as single-family homes—see 
Step 1) to derive an average GHG value 
per dwelling
Example: 
260,000 tCO2e 
÷ 40,000 single-family homes 
= 6.5 tCO2e per dwelling
	
•
Take that average GHG value per 
dwelling and multiply it by the estimated 
number of homes participating in your 
program (from your program uptake 
estimate) to get your baseline total 
GHG emissions
Example: 
6.5 tCO2e × 6,000 homes 
= 39,000 tCO2e
	
•
Now multiply that baseline by the 
average rate of improvement to arrive 
at your program’s estimated impact 
(estimated number of GHGs reduced)
Example: 
39,000 tCO2e × 0.3 (30% 
average rate of improvement) 
= 11,700 tCO2e
Step 4: Put it all together
32
Calculating job creation impact
Local home energy upgrade programs have 
economic impacts. The increased demand 
for the products and services involved in 
completing home energy upgrades (e.g., 
contractors, home energy evaluators) 
results in local job creation. Your local 
council is likely to be very interested in 
estimates of local economic activity/job 
creation that could be generated by a local 
home energy upgrade program, so you 
may want to generate a rough estimate 
at this stage.
Job creation can be calculated per dollar 
value of upgrade investment. A recent 
study found that 16 to 30 new jobs were 
created for every million invested in energy 
efficiency.18 Once you have an idea of the 
average investment per household, you can 
use this 16–30/$1M job multiplier to estimate 
job creation impact in your local economy.
18	 See “Bridge to the Future: Final Report from the Task Force for a Resilient Recovery” (September 2020)
For example, if the average home energy 
upgrade will cost a total of $25,000 per 
home (including all materials, equipment and 
labour) and you aim to reach 1,000 homes 
with your program over the next five years, 
the total investment will be $25 million 
($25,000 × 1,000 homes). Using the job 
multiplier formula above, we can now cal­
culate that means 400 to 750 jobs could be 
created in your community by a new home 
energy upgrade program ($25M/$1M = 25; 
25 × 16 = 400 jobs; 25 × 30 = 750 jobs).

NEXT STEPS
We hope that you have found this guide 
helpful for assessing the potential and 
developing ideas for a home energy upgrade 
program in your community. The work you 
did in Steps 1–4 should put you in a good 
position to create a business case that 
can be shared with your municipal council 
and local partners to build support for 
a local program.

APPENDIX A: 
Energy conversion tables 
and emission factors
To determine GHG emissions from home 
energy use, you’ll need to multiply activ­
ity data by the emissions factor for the 
fuel source in question. Emissions factors 
reflect the mix of fuel types used in local 
energy production and are different for 
natural gas and other fossil fuels versus 
electrical utilities.

19	 Efforts should be made to use the most recent emissions factors available. Environment Canada releases its 
national GHG emissions inventory annually but there is a two-year time lag (i.e., the 2021 inventory’s emissions 
factors are from 2019). Look for the most recent release to find the most up-to-date emissions factors.
