Executive Summary 
Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of extreme weather events across Canada. In 2019, the 
federal government released the report Canada’s Changing Climate. It found that the annual average temperature 
in Canada has increased by 1.7°C since 1948, with higher temperature increases in Canada’s North, the Prairies 
and northern British Columbia. While every region in Canada experiences the impacts of the warming climate 
differently, evidence indicates an increase in the severity of heat waves and drought, more frequent and intense 
rainfall events, changes in snow and ice cover, and more frequent and intense storm surges in coastal regions. For 
Canada and its economy, the consequences are severe. While a number of studies have attempted to measure the 
cost of climate change in terms of the damage it will cause or the impact it will have on the economy, there is more 
to be done to estimate the cost of adapting to climate change.
Climate change adaptation, or disaster mitigation, means taking strategic actions to reduce a community’s 
vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. In the past decade, climate adaptation in Canada has progressed 
from research, to public engagement, to actions to reduce the impacts of climate change. All levels of government 
have developed climate change adaptation strategies and are investing in specific adaptation measures. The 
Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) and Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC) commissioned Green 
Analytics to establish a credible estimate of the investment in municipal infrastructure and local adaptation 
measures needed to reduce the impacts of climate change in Canada. 
Municipalities, as the owners and operators of 60% of the public infrastructure in Canada, are on the frontlines 
of both the impacts of climate change and the solutions to protect Canadians. However, addressing climate risks 
by retrofitting existing infrastructure and implementing new adaptation measures poses an additional burden 
on the limited financial capacity of municipalities. Municipalities cannot shoulder the cost of adapting to climate 
change alone. Climate change adaptation is a shared responsibility among all orders of government, and will 
require a long-term commitment to action. This study is the first attempt to estimate the long-term need for 
investment in climate change adaptation measures at the local level.
METHODOLOGY:
To estimate how much investment is required to help communities adapt to climate change and reduce disaster 
risk, Green Analytics collected adaptation cost estimates for a variety of communities across Canada and housed 
those estimates in an adaptation cost database. The estimates were based on vulnerability and risk assessments 
done at the local level, usually by a municipality. The adaptation cost estimates were adjusted to allow them to be 
compared between communities and added up at the national level. Other information in the database for each 
adaptation cost estimate includes location, such as province or territory; infrastructure type, such as buildings, 
green infrastructure, roads and water treatment; and climate risk, such as drought, erosion, flood, heat wave and 
wildfire. The final database contained 414 adaptation cost estimates for 34 communities across the country. For each 
community, the gross domestic product (GDP) values were obtained or established and added to the database. The 
cost of adapting to climate change was then determined relative to the size of the local economy, expressed as a 
percentage of local GDP. 
5
Finally, the adaptation cost as a percentage of local GDP collected for each community within a region of the country 
(West, Prairies, North, Central, East) was analyzed to determine the average percentage for that region. The five regional 
percentages were then weighted by the region’s respective share of the national GDP. Combined, these regional 
results were added together to obtain a national estimate of the cost of adaptation as a percentage of national GDP. 
RESULTS:
The analysis determined that an average annual investment in municipal infrastructure and local adaptation 
measures of $5.3 billion is needed to adapt to climate change. In national terms, this represents an annual expenditure 
of 0.26% of GDP. This estimate represents the total annual cost of the actions that need to be taken at the local level for 
public infrastructure. These investments would typically be cost-shared between each order of government. Given 
the scale of the long-term cost of adapting to climate change, public funding may need to be leveraged by new 
forms of private capital. Flood, erosion and permafrost melt are associated with the highest cost as a percentage 
of GDP at 1.25%, 0.12% and 0.37%, respectively. These climate risks require the greatest investment in adaptation. 
From an infrastructure perspective, buildings, dikes and roads require the greatest investment in adaptation; 
they are associated with the highest costs as a percentage of GDP at 2.01%, 1.18% and 0.47%, respectively. Grey 
infrastructure has the highest average cost at 0.75%, green infrastructure has an average cost of 0.05% and soft 
infrastructure (or administrative action) has an average cost of 0.03%. From a regional perspective, Canada’s East, 
at 3.20%, and North, at 0.37%, have higher average costs. The four highest costs as a percentage of GDP in the 
database are coastal communities in Eastern Canada. 
The results of this research, finding an annual average investment equivalent to 0.26% of national GDP, generally 
align with historical investments made by leading cities outside of Canada, and with international research on 
future needs. In 2014-15, the cities of London, New York and Paris spent approximately 0.22% of their respective 
GDP on public and private expenditures on climate change adaptation. Looking forward, an international 
assessment concluded that countries should be spending between 0.60% and 1.25% of GDP on adaptation 
measures to minimize the worst impacts of climate change across sectors of the economy, including but not limited 
to municipally owned infrastructure.
This research is the first attempt to quantify what Canadian governments need to be spending on local disaster 
mitigation and adaptation projects to reduce the impacts of climate change. In releasing this report, IBC and FCM 
hope to contribute to the growing body of knowledge on climate change adaptation in the Canadian context. The 
cost of climate change adaptation will continue to be better understood as more data on adaptation investments 
becomes available and additional research along these lines is undertaken. While better data and additional 
research will further clarify long-term costs, what this research clearly shows is that an ambitious long-term climate 
adaptation investment plan—including infrastructure funding commitments and efforts to improve local capacity 
to better assess climate risk as called for by both IBC and FCM—is urgently needed now.

Introduction
The cost of climate change is rising in Canada. The Government of Canada’s 2019 report, Canada’s Changing Climate, 
documenting the latest evidence of a changing climate, found that the annual average temperature in Canada 
increased by 1.7°C since 1948, when nation-wide records became available. Higher temperature increases have 
occurred in Canada’s North, the Prairies and northern British Columbia. While regions in Canada experience impacts 
of a warming climate differently, evidence indicates an increase in the severity of heatwaves and drought, more 
intense rainfall events, changes in snow and ice cover and greater storm surges in coastal regions. The 2019 report 
concluded that trends of more frequent and intense weather extremes will continue, increasing flood and wildfire 
risks, among other impacts.1 The potential consequences to the well-being of Canadians and our economy are 
severe. 
Public infrastructure is particularly vulnerable to impacts from climate change as municipalities in Canada struggle 
with the cost of maintaining these crucial assets. As of 2016, one-third of Canadian municipal infrastructure was 
considered to be in fair, poor or very poor condition.2 However, research is showing that investments in adaptation 
and risk mitigation measures can help ensure Canadian communities are resilient to threats caused by a changing 
climate, including risks to our public infrastructure. Some studies have shown a return on investment around 6:1, 
meaning that for every dollar invested in mitigation measures, $6 is saved in future damages.  
Given the benefits of investing in disaster mitigation and adaptation, what is the level of investment that federal, 
provincial/territorial, and municipal governments should be making? International research of investment rates in 
climate adaptation measures in the United States, United Kingdom and the European Union suggests that national 
governments need to be investing 0.66-1.25% of GDP in adaptation measures to minimize the worst impacts of 
extreme weather events.3 As a percentage of Canada’s GDP in 2018, this would be $13.5-$25.6 billion per year. 
However, a national level study of investment on adaptation measures in Canada is currently lacking, both in terms 
of how much Canada is already spending on adaptation and how much Canada should be spending. The goal of 
this research project was therefore to start to answer the latter question and gain a better understanding of the 
level of investment needed for disaster mitigation and climate change adaptation measures in Canada.

What is Climate Change Adaptation?
Why is Climate Change 
Adaptation Needed?
Adaptation is any alteration in the structure or function of something or any of its parts that makes it better 
suited for its environment. In the context of climate change, this means adjusting to projected or actual changing 
climates to become more resilient to those changes. While there are numerous working definitions of climate 
adaptation,4,5,6 the common theme is that adaptation is a response to climate impacts. Many definitions also 
recognize the intent of adaptation, which is to reduce the negative effects of climate change. The European 
Commission and European Environment Agency differentiate between three types of adaptation: grey, green and 
soft. Grey adaptation focuses on human-made physical infrastructure such as dikes, sea walls, expanded water 
treatment capacity and fire-resistant building materials. Green adaptation includes protecting, strengthening 
and modifying natural systems such as wetlands, mangroves, forests and soil nutrition. Soft adaptation, on the 
other hand, focuses on legal, socio-cultural, political and financial management policies and systems that enable 
adaptation.7 Climate adaptation is unique from climate change mitigation, which focuses on activities that 
reduce or eliminate the release of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.⁸  
To date, the majority of efforts to combat climate change have focused on the mitigation side, reducing or eliminating 
the release of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change itself. However, as the 2019 Canada’s Changing 
Climate report demonstrates, communities in Canada are already facing the impacts of climate change and so while 
adaptation can have many benefits, including employment, reduced energy costs, improved air and water quality, 
and improved livability,9 one of the main benefits is avoiding the high cost of the predicted climate change impacts. 
3.1 COSTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
In 2011, the National Round Table on Environment and Economy (NRTEE) estimated the economic impacts of 
climate change for Canada to be $5 billion per year by 2020 and between $21 billion and $43 billion per year 
by 2050, assuming a global warming scenario of slightly under 2°C. That report, however, only focused on three 
key areas–flooding damages to coastal dwellings resulting from climate change–induced sea level rise and storm 
surges, timber supply impacts through changes in pests and fires, and health care system costs due to poorer air 
quality in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and Calgary.10 A more comprehensive assessment of the current costs of 
climate change given more recent knowledge and data is likely to be much higher.

Now that the original forecast date of 2020 has been reached, support for this significant estimate by the NRTEE 
can be seen in the data on insurance payouts and disaster financial assistance. Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC) 
reports insurable losses dating back to 1983. The time series data in Figure 1 clearly indicates a rising trend in 
insurance payouts as a result of natural disasters. For nine of the last ten years (2010-2019), insurance payouts 
for catastrophic losses from natural disasters have exceeded $1 billion per year. For the 26 years prior to 2009, 
insurable payouts averaged $400 million per year. 
However, insured losses only account for a portion of the full costs attributed to catastrophic weather-related events. 
An accepted standard for capital losses is for every dollar of losses borne by insurers in Canada, $3-4 are borne by 
governments, households and businesses.11 The spread will vary depending on the type of catastrophic event. For 
example, insurance policies are less likely to cover flood protection versus fire protection.12 The spread of losses 
borne by governments, households and businesses would be even greater if indirect costs were included. Figure 2 
provides an example of the additional costs associated with uninsurable losses from catastrophic events in Canada.

Evidence of the growing cost of climate change in Canada is also demonstrated by the trend in government 
sponsored disaster relief payments. The rising severity of extreme weather events has led to a significant increase 
in provinces and territories seeking assistance under the federal Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements (DFAA) 
program. The program was set up in 1970 to help provinces and territories recover from natural disasters. The Office 
of the Auditor General Canada reports that from 2009 to 2015, DFAA’s compensation to the provinces and territories 
was greater than the previous 39 fiscal years combined.13 The fund’s payouts for the past five years (2013-2014 to 
2017-2018) totalled $3.3 billion.14 The increase in DFAA costs over the past 10 years is attributed to more extreme 
weather events with greater intensity.15 Recognizing its escalating liability associated with the DFAA program, in 
2015 the Government of Canada changed the expense thresholds at which federal funding is triggered (Table 1). 
These threshold changes reduce the share of disaster-related recovery costs borne by the federal government and 
shift those costs to municipal and provincial governments, homeowners and businesses in impacted regions.16

A 2016 report by the Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) projected the costs for disaster financial assistance 
arrangements due to weather events for 2016 to 2020 at $4.9 billion of which DFAA would cover $902 million, or 
18%. The analysis considered hurricanes, floods, convective storms (hail, rain and wind) and winter storms. Wildfires, 
which can be a result of dry weather associated with climate change and can trigger DFAA support, were not included. 
Floods accounted for the largest percentage of the projected annual DFAA costs at $673 million (Table 2).
As part of the report, the PBO also completed a historical assessment of cumulative losses and DFAA and insurance 
payments from extreme weather events for the period 2005 to 2014. Total cumulative losses were estimated to be 
$31 billion, of which 16% were covered by DFAA and 47% were covered by insurance payments. It can therefore be 
inferred that the outstanding $11 billion in losses (37%) were borne by households, businesses, and municipal and 
provincial governments in affected regions (Table 3).17

While cost assessments of extreme weather events typically report insurable losses and/or direct capital losses 
only, damages to infrastructure cascade into other losses. As an example, productivity losses resulting from 
damaged infrastructure are substantial. A 2016 economic analysis of the cost of flooding in Canada estimated 
productivity losses ranging from 27% to 42% of capital costs depending on the severity of the flooding event 
and length of recovery period.18
Statistics Canada completed a detailed analysis on the impact of flooding in Southern Alberta in June 2013 on 
hours worked in the province. The analysis found that during the last two weeks in June, 300,000 Albertans (or 
13.5% of the employed population in Alberta) working in the private sector lost 7.5 million hours of work due to 
workplace closures because of the flood event.19 Damages to infrastructure caused by extreme weather events can 
hinder broader economic activity that is not captured by replacement cost estimates. When such costs are taken 
into account, adaptation measures become even more justifiable.  
Not surprisingly, given the trends presented above, the rising occurrence of extreme weather events attributed to 
climate change is leading to higher costs for municipal insurance policies. Henstra and Thistlewaite (2017) note that 
increased premiums, higher deductibles and changes to municipal insurance policies limiting liability followed the 
large insured and uninsured losses in 2013. As examples, the authors reference the Toronto and Calgary municipal 
policies. The Toronto policy (2015) cost $5.1 million with a deductible of $5 million providing $100 million in liability 
coverage and $1.8 billion for property damage. Calgary’s policy, after the 2013 flood event, included a loss limit of 
$700 million for damage to property, with a deductible of $2 million.20 In Ontario between 2007 and 2016, municipal 
liability premiums increased by 22.2% to account for increased liability coverage. 
Home policies are going up as well. Climate change was cited as the reason for insurance companies across Canada 
increasing home insurance rates for 2019 by 5-10% on top of inflation. In addition, premiums and deductibles for 
sewer backup and overland flood insurance have also increased.21 Elsewhere, insurers have warned that climate 
change may make insurance coverage for most people unaffordable. This proclamation came after $24 billion in 
losses resulted from wildfires in California.22

3.2 BENEFITS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION
With the evidence piling up on the actual and predicted costs of climate change, the benefit of climate adaptation in 
reducing those costs becomes very important. The 2016 Office of the Auditor General’s report on federal government 
support for mitigating the effects of severe weather notes the potential cost effectiveness of disaster mitigation 
measures for government and society, citing Public Safety Canada’s estimate that every dollar invested in mitigation 
in Canada saves $3 to $5 in recovery costs. As an example, the report notes the $63 million invested to build the 
Manitoba Red River Floodway in 1960, which is estimated to have saved $8 billion by 2008 in avoided flood recovery 
costs.23 In 2017/2018 the US National Institute of Buildings Sciences looked at the results of 23 years of federally funded 
mitigation grants provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), U.S. Economic Development 
Administration (EDA) and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and found mitigation funding 
can save the nation $6 in future disaster costs, for every $1 spent on hazard mitigation.24 
The NRTEE (2011) found that adaptation strategies are cost, effective ways to reduce the economic impacts of climate 
change ranging in a benefit-to-cost ratio of 38:1 under a high climate change, high growth scenario, to 9:1 under a 
low climate change, slow growth scenario. In coastal areas, for example, prohibiting new construction in areas at risk 
of flooding as well as undertaking strategic retreat by gradually abandoning dwellings once flooded, reduces the 
costs of climate change to only 3-4% of what the costs would have been without adaptation. The NRTEE also found 
that the cost to build a new house, bridge or transmission line that is adapted to climate change for its lifecycle only 
adds 0-5% to the construction costs.  This is significantly cheaper than retrofitting buildings, or restoring or rebuilding 
infrastructure post-damage. The 0-5% addition to the construction cost range is generally recognized as a rule of 
thumb for the cost of incorporating adaptation initiatives into the design of a new structure.  
Demonstrating the value of administrative adaptation measures (or soft infrastructure), Green Analytics 
estimated the value of Ontario flood plain regulations (Section 28 of the Conservation Authorities Act).25 The 
study drew on evidence from a study of the potential impact of flooding on the City of Waterloo prepared by 
the Intact Centre for Climate Adaptation. The Intact analysis examined the expected property damage to the 
333 structures located within the Regulatory Laurel Creek floodplain resulting from a flood proportionate to 
Hurricane Hazel. The projected direct damages to these buildings was estimated at $85 million.26 A subsequent 
analysis of productivity losses associated with a Hurricane Hazel flood of Laurel Creek assuming a six-month 
recovery period estimated such losses at $17 million.27
Green or natural infrastructure also holds significant promise as an adaptation measure to reduce the cost of climate 
impacts. Green infrastructure is often considered an umbrella term that includes natural infrastructure (wetlands, forests, 
shorelines), enhanced natural infrastructure (bioswales, rain gardens, urban parks) and engineered infrastructure (green 
roofs, rain barrels, permeable pavement).28 Research confirms that investments in natural infrastructure in particular is an 
effective adaptation strategy. For example, a study by the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation demonstrated that natural

wetlands can reduce the costs of flood damage by 29% in rural areas and 38% in urban areas.29 The community of 
Gibsons, BC, recognizing the importance of their natural infrastructure, was the first municipality in North America 
to declare natural infrastructure assets as municipal assets.30 The town then committed to operate and maintain its 
natural assets in the same manner as storm sewers, roads and other traditional engineered assets.50 An assessment 
of the naturally occurring ponds in the town’s White Tower Park found that the ponds provided the same stormwater 
management services as engineered assets that would have cost about $3.5 million to $4 million to construct. These 
assessments led Gibsons to protect its ponds from proposed new housing developments in order to save the capital 
costs of constructing engineered stormwater infrastructure. Other Canadian communities are now following suit, 
adapting the framework initiated by Gibsons and developed through the Municipal Natural Assets Initiative (MNAI) 
and employing green infrastructure as an adaptation strategy.
3.3 CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION IN CANADA 
Climate adaptation is increasing in the country as it has been recognized as a necessary response to climate change; 
one that enhances the resilience of Canadians to climate change impacts.31 Experience in Canada clearly demonstrates 
that there is a solid awareness in the country of the impacts of climate change and the need to adapt.  There is also 
increasing evidence that resources are being mobilized and capacity is building to adapt through various federal, 
provincial, territorial and local government adaptation plans as well as consortiums and collaborative efforts related 
to adaptation (e.g., Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium). 
As an example, in response to the urgent need for adaptation measures to protect municipal infrastructure, 23 
Canadian municipalities are part of ICLEI Canada’s Building Adaptive and Resilient Communities (BARC) program. The 
program provides a framework and comprehensive planning methodology to support municipalities in developing 
and implementing climate change adaptation plans.32 Climate change impacts that ranked highest among BARC 
member municipalities that have completed climate adaptation plans include:  
•   More frequent freezing and thawing causing damage to roads, sidewalks, bridges and stormwater ponds.
•   Overburdened stormwater systems caused by intense precipitation events.
•   Damage to transportation infrastructure and public property due to flooding. 
•   Damage to electrical distribution systems and parks and greenspaces as a result of more severe storms. 
Among the BARC program municipalities that have completed climate adaptation plans, all recognize the exposure of 
public infrastructure to climate change impacts as a rationale for adaptation measures and strong action.

Progress is less evident in the implementation of adaptation measures.33 According to the most recent national 
assessment of Climate Change Adaptation, the majority of adaptation measures assessed in Canada involved 
research, monitoring, assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities, developing strategies and mainstreaming 
adaptation within existing policies and planning. The balance of the measures were implemented to prevent or 
offset harm from climate-related risks.34 Table 4 summarizes some of the main federal adaptation efforts, while 
Table 5 provides examples of provincial and municipal structural adaptation implementation.

The federal government’s climate change plan, developed with the provinces, territories and Indigenous Peoples. 
The plan describes emission reduction and resilient building initiatives including climate adaptation actions.35
This framework guides domestic action by the Government of Canada to address adaptation to the impacts of climate 
variability and change. It sets out a vision for adaptation in Canada, objectives, roles of the federal government and 
provides criteria for setting priorities for action.36
Looking ahead to the year 2030, the framework will guide the federal government’s involvement in the North, 
including supporting adaptation action.
The strategy is a collaborative, whole-of-society roadmap to strengthen Canada’s ability to assess risks, prevent/
mitigate, prepare for, respond to and recover from disasters.
Established in 2012, Canada’s Climate Change Adaptation Platform is a national forum that brings together key 
groups in Canada to collaborate on climate change adaptation priorities. Members include representatives from 
federal, provincial, and territorial governments, industry, communities, academics, and Indigenous, professional, 
and not-for-profit organizations.37
Funding for built and natural, large-scale infrastructure projects that help build the resilience of infrastructure to 
natural disasters, extreme weather events and climate change.
Budget 2014 earmarked $200 million over five years, from 2015 to 2020, to establish the NDMP. The NDMP addresses 
rising flood risks and costs, and builds the foundation for informed mitigation investments that could reduce, or even 
negate, the effects of flood events.38
This initiative will develop capacity in Canada’s construction industries to adapt to the demands on built infrastructure 
attributed to climate change. The program is intended to drive innovation and provide partners with the knowledge 
and tools they need to make sound decisions about how to design, operate, and maintain their infrastructure assets.39

Quebec
The Municipal Planning Strategy and Land Use By-Law for the downtown Halifax waterfront area prescribes 
minimum elevation for any ground-floor development – to protect against sea level rise and flooding.40
To help their coastal communities become more resilient, the city is developing a Coastal Flood Adaptation Strategy 
(CFAS) for Surrey’s coastal floodplain area. The flood adaptation measures will increase flood resilience and protect 
over 125,000 commuters, residents, homes and businesses who are at high risk of coastal flooding.
Norman Wells Airport and Ottawa International Airport have grooved their runways to improve traction and drainage 
during heavy precipitation. 41
British Columbia provincial guidelines for development in flood-risk areas identify the need for Flood Construction 
Levels in line with the increased risk presented by sea-level rise. 42
The Northwest Territories Housing Corporation is adapting housing construction to protect against melting 
permafrost through the use of new foundation systems (e.g., using larger diameter and deeper pile installations) 
designed to better respond to and absorb the additional stress caused by shifts in the ground beneath buildings. 
The use of thermosyphons (that keep permafrost cold through passive heat exchange) and other technologies to 
preserve permafrost are also being used.43
The New Brunswick Department of Transportation rebuilt and raised a bridge on the main road into Pointe-du-Chêne 
to accommodate future sea level rise.44
The Quebec Ministry of Transportation has oversized the diameter of culverts by 10% to help manage heavy 
precipitation events.45 
The Quebec Ministry of Transportation has introduced a thermal monitoring program for 13 airport runways in 
Nunavik that are built on land sensitive to permafrost thaw.46

This chapter presents the results of an examination of the cost of adaptation in Canada. The objective was to generate 
a credible estimate of the level of investment that government should be making in municipal infrastructure and 
other adaptation measures at the local level to reduce the cost of climate change impacts in Canada.
 
As outlined above, numerous studies confirm that investments in adaptation and risk mitigation projects provide 
a payback in abated future disaster and climate change related costs.47 However, despite the importance of 
adaptation as a strategy to address climate impacts, and the evidence of significant cost avoidance, a limited 
number of studies have quantified the cost of pursuing adaptation measures. Those that have been completed 
are mostly at a global scale, such as the 2010 World Bank study which estimated the global annual cost of 
adaptation at between $70 billion and $100 billion up to 2050 (in 2005 dollars). Following a similar methodology, 
annual adaptation costs have been estimated to be approximately $40 billion in Asia and the Pacific over the 
period 2010-2050.48 The United Nations estimates that industrialized countries would have to spend $22-105 
billion annually by 2030 on adaptation to climate-proof infrastructure.  Similarly, a study for Europe estimated 
the cost of climate-proofing new infrastructure at $4.6-58 billion per year.50
Estimates at a national or local scale are also scarce. Table 6 demonstrates actual public and private expenditures 
on climate adaptation for three major cities. To put the estimates from the table below into perspective, 
a study on international resilience investment suggests governments need to be investing 0.66-1.25% of GDP 
in adaptation measures to minimize the worst impacts of extreme weather events.51 Figure 3 presents climate 
adaptation as a percentage of GDP for a select number of countries, demonstrating the range of investment from 
a high of approximately 0.325% in Beijing to a low of 0.14% in Addis Ababa.

4.1 RESEARCH APPROACH
Given the limited number of existing national level assessments of the investment needed for climate change 
adaptation measures, and the limited amount of Canadian data to work with, it was necessary to develop 
a methodology that would be comparable to existing estimates but still reflect the unique experience in Canada 
and work with the various data available. Climate change adaptation costs for a small town on the east coast 
will be very different compared to the costs for the City of Saskatoon, for example. Figure 4 depicts the overall 
approach that was used to complete the assessment of climate adaptation costs in Canada and the level of 
investment needed at a national scale.

4.1.1 COLLECT ADAPTATION COST STUDIES 
The analysis of adaptation costs for Canada began with collecting studies that have quantified the cost of 
adaptation at the community level from across the country. These studies are distinct from those that describe 
actual spending (as this is not necessarily a reflection of what should be spent but rather what has been spent) 
and from studies that quantify the cost of climate impacts (which are known to exceed the cost of adaptation). 
The objective was to obtain studies that describe the cost of adaptation from a range of locations (East, West, 
Central and Northern Canada), population sizes and climate risks. The studies were collected and reviewed and 
adaptation cost estimates extracted. 
4.1.2 EXTRACT ADAPTATION COST ESTIMATES
Adaptation cost estimates and details pertaining to their derivation were extracted from the climate adaptation 
studies and entered into a database. The database contains the following details extracted from each study:
•   Location
•   Province/Territory
•   Adaptation Measures
•   Infrastructure Type
•   Climate Risk Applicable to Adaptation Measures
Information added to the database for each of the studies includes:
•   Population	
	
 •   Lifespan of Infrastructure	
	
•   Gross Domestic Product
The cost estimates for each study needed to be adjusted to allow for tallying across actions and communities. To 
do this, several steps were taken. First, it was necessary to establish a planning horizon. This is the time period 
over which total adaptation costs would be estimated. For this project a planning horizon of 50 years was applied. 
The timeframe, combined with the lifespan of the infrastructure, determines the total cost of the adaptation 
measure for a community. Costs associated with infrastructure with shorter lifespans will recur numerous times 
over the planning horizon, while costs associated with infrastructure with longer lifespans will occur less times 
over the planning horizon. All cost estimates were then translated into annual cost values. This was done by 
taking the cost estimate and dividing it by the number of years the associated action is implemented over (a 
time horizon specified in the studies or assumed to be 1). Present values were then established (at a 2% discount 
rate) and estimated over the 50-year planning horizon taking the frequency of the cost into account. Final cost 
estimates were converted to a common year (2019) to facilitate comparisons across studies. Cost estimates that 
could not be converted to total cost values, for example studies with costs per kilometre of road or per bridge, 
were removed from the database. Studies that covered geographic regions for which a GDP estimate could not 
be established, for example studies that did not specify specific communities, were removed from the database. 
It should be noted that the climate change scenario (i.e., 1.5 or 2 degree warming) was not standardized across 
studies given the limited data available.

4.1.3 OBTAIN/DERIVE GDP FOR THE STUDY LOCATIONS 
For the study locations corresponding to the adaptation cost estimates, an estimate of GDP was then obtained 
or derived. If the study area was a CMA (census metropolitan area), the GDP estimate corresponding to the study 
location was obtained from Statistics Canada. If the study area was something other than a CMA, a GDP estimate 
was derived. Appendix C describes the approach employed to derive GDP estimates for study locations. 
4.1.4 CALCULATE ADAPTATION COST AS A PERCENT OF GDP
The adaptation cost estimates (4.1.2 above) for each community were then calculated as a percent of GDP (4.1.3 
above) for the same community. 
4.1.5 ESTABLISH A RANGE OF GDP PERCENTAGES
The percentage of GDP was then tallied across all of the communities to estimate an average adaptation cost as a 
percentage of GDP. Percentages were also examined by region (West, East, North, Central Canada), infrastructure 
type, climate risk and population. 
4.2 RESULTS
This section of the report presents the results of the assessment. Details pertaining to the climate adaptation 
cost database are provided along with the range of adaptation costs as a percentage of GDP that were derived. 
4.2.1 ADAPTATION COST DATABASE
The final database employed for the study contains 414 adaptation cost estimates for 34 different locations 
across the country. Table 7 shows the number of communities represented in the database by province. There are 
more communities in Alberta than other locations because numerous communities in Alberta have completed 
the “Climate Resilience Express” program. The Climate Resilience Express program is a streamlined process for 
developing climate resilience action plans for smaller communities. Through this program, communities identify 
climate risks and quantify relevant adaptation costs.54 No such program was identified for other jurisdictions, 
with the exception of the nationally available BARC program through ICLEI Canada (See section 3.4).

Figure 5 demonstrates the distribution of the communities by region. The database contains cost estimates for 
17 communities in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba (Prairie region) with the majority of those studies for 
Alberta communities (13 of the 17 communities). Thirteen communities are from eastern provinces (Nova Scotia, 
New Brunswick, Newfoundland & Labrador, and Prince Edward Island), 9 are from central provinces (Ontario and 
Quebec), and the remainder are from western provinces (British Columbia) and northern territories (Northwest 
Territory, Yukon). No studies were identified from Nunavut.

Fifteen categories of infrastructure are represented in the database. Table 8 demonstrates the number of cost 
estimates in the database by infrastructure type. Roads and green infrastructure are well represented in the 
database at 33 and 28 cost estimates, respectively. A large number of cost estimates were identified for dikes 
(25), water treatment (21) and technology and equipment (21).
The table above does not include the administrative cost estimates that were identified and included in the 
database. Two hundred and twenty-nine administrative cost estimates are included in the database. The majority 
of the administrative costs are for communities that have participated in Alberta’s Climate Resilience Express

4.2.2 ADAPTATION COST AS A PERCENTAGE OF GDP 
As is noted in Section 4.1, after the adaptation cost database was cleaned and adjusted as needed, the cost 
estimates were summed by community and the adaptation cost as a percentage of GDP for each community was 
established. The percentages are presented in this section of the report, assuming a 50-year planning horizon 
and a 2% discount rate. The following sections provide a summary of how the adaptation costs as a percentage 
of GDP differs according to location, infrastructure type, climate risk, and population. The final section provides 
the methodology and results of scaling up the regional results to estimate a national level of investment in 
adaptation as a percentage of GDP.
4.2.2.1 ADAPTATION COST AS A PERCENTAGE OF GDP FOR ALL STUDIES
Figure 6 shows the distribution of the adaptation cost as a percentage of GDP for all studies. The majority of 
the results are less than 0.5% of GDP but range from a low of 0.00005% to a high of 14%. The average of all 
results rounds to 1.0% from 0.99698%. The median value is 0.06%. The three highest percentages are from small 
coastal towns on the east coast of Canada (the fourth highest percentage is from a coastal area in NB and NS). 
These communities have relatively small GDPs and high adaptation costs given their vulnerability to coastal 
climate risks.

Given the number of estimates in the database that relate to administrative costs (i.e., 229 cost estimates for 
administrative actions relative to 185 cost estimates for all other infrastructure types), a percentage of GDP was 
derived excluding the administrative cost estimates from the analysis. Doing so resulted in the elimination of two 
communities (i.e., there were two communities for which the only infrastructure type captured in the adaptation cost 
estimates was administration; other communities had administration costs but also costs for other infrastructure 
types). The average adaptation cost as a percentage of GDP for the remaining communities (excluding administrative 
costs) is 1.05%, somewhat higher than the average when administrative costs are included.
4.2.2.2 ADAPTATION COST BY LOCATION
Figure 7 presents adaptation cost as a percentage of GDP by region. The Central region contains estimates from 
Ontario and Quebec, the West region contains estimates from British Columbia, the Prairie region is comprised 
of estimates from Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, the East region reflects estimates from Nova Scotia, New 
Brunswick, Newfoundland & Labrador and Prince Edward Island, while the North region is comprised of studies 
from Yukon and Northwest Territory. No studies were identified from Nunavut. 
The average percentage of GDP for the East region is 3.20%. The North region has the next highest average at 
0.37%. This is followed by the Central region, where the average percentage is 0.12%, the Prairie region which has 
an average percentage of 0.06%, and the West region, which has an average percentage of 0.015%. While the higher 
percentage observed for the East region in Figure 7 may appear as an outlier relative to the other regions, this may 
not be the case. On the contrary, given the relatively small dataset employed in this analysis, the higher percentages 
observed for eastern communities might be representative of a larger population of communities in that region 
(i.e., if more data points were available, the gap between the upper and lower averages may be filled). The four 
highest percentages in the database are from coastal communities in eastern provinces (two from Newfoundland & 
Labrador, one from New Brunswick and Nova Scotia combined and one from Nova Scotia). These communities have 
relatively low GDP and relatively high risk given that they are located on the coast. Thus, the percentages observed 
for these communities could very well be representative of numerous small coastal communities in eastern Canada. 
Upon investigation, it was revealed that 20 communities in the eastern region match the profile of the communities 
in the database with these high percentages. These communities are located on the coast and have populations of 
6,000 or less (see Appendix E for a list of comparable communities and a description of how they were identified). 
27
As was noted earlier, more cost estimates were obtained for the province of Alberta than other provinces and 
territories due to the number of communities that have participated in the Climate Resilience Express program. 
Given this, it was deemed appropriate to derive an Alberta-only climate adaptation cost as a percentage of 
GDP. To that end, cost estimates from 13 Alberta communities were used to derive an average percentage for 
the province of Alberta. Assuming a 50-year planning horizon and a 2% discount rate (as was assumed for all 
other results presented in this report), the percentage for just Alberta is 0.06%. The percentages for Alberta 
communities range from a low of 0.00047% to a high of 0.16%. The majority of the percentages fall between 
0.03% and 0.08%.

4.2.2.3 ADAPTATION COST BY INFRASTRUCTURE
Figure 8 shows adaptation as a percent of GDP by infrastructure type. The relatively higher estimates for 
buildings, dikes and roads are visible in the figure below. The average percentage for buildings is 2.01%, for dikes 
is 1.18% and for roads is 0.47%. The average percentage for green infrastructure and water treatment is 0.05%; 
for administration it is 0.03%.
Grouping the infrastructure types as grey, green and soft reveals the following information. Grey infrastructure 
has the highest average percentage of GDP at 0.75%. For green infrastructure it is 0.05% and for soft infrastructure 
(or administrative actions) it is 0.03%. Adaptation costs as a percentage of GDP by climate risk are presented in 
Figure 9. The figure demonstrates the relatively higher cost for floods.

4.2.2.4 ADAPTATION COST BY CLIMATE RISK
Adaptation costs as a percentage of GDP by climate risk are presented in Figure 9. The figure demonstrates the 
relatively higher cost for floods. The average percentage of GDP for flooding is 1.25%, for permafrost is 0.37% 
and for erosion is 0.12%. 
4.2.2.5 ADAPTATION COST BY POPULATION
Figure 10 shows the number of cost estimates within the database by population size. As is clear in the figure, the 
majority of the cost estimates are for relatively smaller communities (less than 190,000). Figure 11 demonstrates 
how the cost estimates translate into average percentages of GDP across a range of community population 
thresholds. The higher percentages are associated with lower population communities (less than 5,600). Such 
communities have relatively lower GDP values but potentially significant adaptation costs, depending on their 
location and climate risks. For example, communities with low GDP located on the east coast and prone to flood 
and erosion impacts, have the highest adaptation costs as a percentage of GDP. The average percentage of GDP 
for communities with populations under 5,600 is 2.8%. For communities with populations of more than 5,600 but 
less than 71,900 the average percentage is 0.2% and for communities with populations greater than 71,900 it is 
0.07%.

4.2.2.6 NATIONAL LEVEL OF INVESTMENT IN ADAPTATION
To derive dollar estimates for the amount of required expenditure on a regional basis, GDP values were calculated 
for the respective regions and the % GDP by region applied to them. (Table 11). These regional results were 
then combined to give an estimate of the annual national level of investment in adaptation at the local level. 
The analysis determined that an average annual investment in municipal infrastructure adaptation measures 
of $5.3 billion is needed to adapt to climate change. In national terms, this represents an annual expenditure of 
0.26% of GDP. This estimate represents the total cost of the actions that need to be taken at the municipal level 
and would typically be cost-shared between each order of government.

Trends in climate adaptation in Canada in the past five-to-ten years have progressed from research, to expanded 
engagement, to more and more examples of implementation. Communities and governments have moved past 
awareness and are increasingly pursuing specific measures to reduce the impact of climate change.55 Today, 
in Canada, there are examples of adaptation measures at all levels of government, within industry groups and 
individual companies.56  Despite the growing trend in adaptation measures in Canada, few studies have quantified 
the cost of adaptation and such studies are particularly lacking at local and municipal levels.57
The objective of this study was to establish a credible estimate of government spending on climate change 
adaptation measures to reduce the cost of climate change in Canada. Studies that have quantified the cost of 
adaptation from across the country were used to estimate an average investment in adaptation as a percentage 
of GDP and to examine whether such data varies by location, population, infrastructure type and climate risk. 
The analysis revealed an average percentage, weighted by regional variations, across all studies, populations, 
communities, locations, climate risks and infrastructure types of 0.26% of national GDP or $5.3 billion annually. 
This figure represents adaptation investment in local public infrastructure only that would be cost-shared 
between the three levels of government.
Flood, erosion and permafrost are associated with the highest adaptation costs at 1.25%, 0.12% and 0.37% of 
GDP, respectively. These are the climate risks requiring the greatest investment in adaptation. Grouping the 
infrastructure types as grey, green and soft reveals that grey infrastructure has the highest average adaptation cost 
as a percentage of GDP at 0.75%. The percentage for green infrastructure is 0.05% and that for soft infrastructure 
(or administrative actions) is 0.03%, indicating relatively lower costs for these adaptation measures. From a regional 
perspective, the East, at 3.20%, and the North, at 0.37%, are characterized by relatively higher costs as a percentage 
of GDP, indicating that these regions are most in need of adaptation spending to protect against climate risks.
When considering the results presented above, it is important to keep in mind the number of cost estimates 
employed in the analysis. As noted in section 4, the database contains 414 cost estimates from 34 locations in 
Canada. This is a relatively small sample size given the number of communities of varying sizes and exposure 
to climate risks across the country. Particular gaps in the database exist for mid-sized cities and communities in 
British Columbia. There are more cost estimates for Alberta than any other province with a total of 13 communities 
represented in the database. While this may be, relatively speaking, an overrepresentation of Alberta communities, 
the key consideration is the degree to which the Alberta communities are representative, in terms of size, 
GDP and climate risks, of a larger population of similar communities across the country. Given the reliance on 
Alberta-specific data, community profiling was undertaken to examine the degree to which the Alberta 
communities are representative of a larger sample of communities across the country. Upon investigation, 134 
such communities were identified. These communities, from Saskatchewan, Ontario, Manitoba and Quebec, face 
a similar climate risk profile, are not coastal communities, and have similar populations and land areas. Other data 
points that may appear as outliers, such as the percentages for the small coastal communities in eastern Canada, 
warrant the same consideration (see Appendix E for the approach employed for community profiling as well as 
communities identified as similar in nature to the Alberta and east coast communities contained in the database).

The results presented here rely on previous studies that have quantified the cost of adaptation for communities 
in Canada. There is an underlying assumption that the studies have targeted the major climate risks that each 
community is exposed to. To the extent that the cost estimates represent a portion of the total climate risk for any 
given community, the percentages will underestimate adaptation spending. Related to this point, it is obvious 
that there is a lack of studies that have quantified adaptation costs for communities in Canada. Results from 
FCM’s Municipalities for Climate Innovation Program (funded by Infrastructure Canada), point to an ongoing 
need to continue to build municipal capacity to assess climate risk and identify the optimal responses. As more 
communities conduct climate risk and vulnerability assessments and identify the cost of action, future research 
can shed more light of the cost of climate impacts to help build the case for continued and expanded investment 
in climate adaptation in this country. As well, given the size of the estimated investment needed at the local level, 
the role of the private sector and how private finance can support enhanced community resilience should also 
be considered in future research and analysis.
This research is the first attempt to quantify what Canadian governments need to be spending on local disaster 
mitigation and adaptation projects to reduce the impacts of climate change. In releasing this report, IBC and FCM 
hope to contribute to the growing body of knowledge on climate change adaptation in the Canadian context. 
The cost of climate change adaptation will continue to be better understood as more data on adaptation 
investments becomes available and additional research along these lines is undertaken.

65 Insurance Bureau of Canada. 2015. The Economic Impacts of the Weather Effects of Climate Change on Communities.
As the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events increase due to climate change, so too do the impacts 
and associated costs. The Fraser Basin Council (2016) modelled economic loss projections using the HAZUS model 
for four major Lower Mainland flood scenarios to inform the Lower Mainland Flood Management Strategy.63 
Scenarios modelled included two coastal flood scenarios (2016 and 2100) and two Fraser River flood scenarios 
(2016 and 2100). Analysis of total economic loss projections under flood scenarios focused on building-related 
losses and damage costs for infrastructure and agriculture and lost productivity attributed to interrupted cargo 
shipments only. The two 2016 flood scenarios were estimated to result in losses of $19.3 billion (coastal flood) 
and $22.9 billion (Fraser River flood). The flood damages for the 2100 scenarios were estimated to result in 
losses of $24.7 billion to $32.7 billion. Estimated damage to infrastructure under the four scenarios ranged from 
$1.4 billion to $5 billion (Table B1). Any one of the four major Lower Mainland flood scenarios analyzed would 
be expected to trigger the costliest natural disaster in Canadian history to date, creating severe strain on the 
regional, provincial and national economies.64
An analysis completed by Green Analytics and the Ontario Centre for Climate Impacts and Adaptation Resources for 
the Insurance Bureau of Canada (2015) modelled the potential costs of climate related extreme weather events on 
two communities, namely Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) and Mississauga. The study calculated the expected 
cost of direct and secondary impacts from asset damage and business interruptions (lost economic output) due 
to climate-related extreme events assuming no climate adaptation actions are taken. The case study analysis for 
the HRM focused on the costs of storm surge flooding and extreme wind. The expected annual damage of direct 
and secondary impacts attributed to climate change by 2040 for storm surge flooding is over $35 million of gross 
domestic product ($2013) and over $140 million of gross domestic product ($2013) for extreme wind.65

The case study analysis for Mississauga focused on the costs of stormwater flooding and freezing rain. The 
expected annual damage of direct and secondary impacts attributed to freezing rain and stormwater flooding 
by 2040 are $30 million of GDP ($2013) and $70 million of GDP ($2013) respectively.
Given the potential costs facing municipalities, the analysis affirms the business case for investing in community-
level adaptation measures.66
As part of developing a climate adaptation plan, the city of Edmonton completed an economic analysis of the 
future cost of potential climate impacts on the city. The analysis estimated an increase in costs of $8.0 billion by 
2050 and $18.2 billion by 2080 compared to time of the study (year 2018). Costs considered included financial 
losses, health costs and environmental losses. The study predicts that Edmonton’s GDP will be $3.2 billion and 
$7.4 billion lower by 2050 and 2080, respectively, compared to 2018, as a result of climate change impacts. 
The analysis found that costs for Edmonton increase with each degree of additional warming.67
To derive GDP estimates for the study locations, a GDP value from the respective province was scaled to the 
location using labour force statistics. More specifically, to tailor provincial data for regional use, GDP values were 
scaled to reflect the relative concentration of industry sectors in the region as compared to the province more 
broadly. The regionalization of GDP was performed by calculating location quotients (LQ) using Statistics Canada’s 
Labour Force Survey data. An LQ is a ratio that compares labour force concentrations of industry sectors within 
a region (i.e., the study area) to a larger reference region (i.e., the province). LQs are calculated by comparing the 
industry’s share of regional employment with its share of provincial employment as per the following equation:
 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
where
ei = local labour force population in industry i
e = total local labour force population
Ei = provincial labour force population in industry i
E = total provincial labour force population	
	
	
By regionalizing the provincial GDP values using LQs, the analysts were able to derive GDP estimates that are 
reflective of the study areas under consideration (i.e., the study areas that correspond to the adaptation cost 
estimates in the database).

Community Profiling
APPENDIX E
Green Analytics examined the extent to which some of the data in the adaptation cost database might be 
reflective of a larger sample of communities in Canada. The approach employed for the examination involved 
taking several key characteristics of the communities in the database and identifying other communities with 
the same characteristics. This was done using data from Statistics Canada. A +/- 20% range from the population 
and land area of the target communities (i.e., the communities in the adaptation cost database) was applied to 
a larger geographic area to identify communities with similar populations and land areas. These communities 
were then filtered such that only communities facing similar climate risks were included (i.e., only coastal 
communities on the east coast meeting the population and land area criteria were included). The result was a list 
of communities facing a similar climate risk profile, with similar populations and similar land areas. 
Profiling was done for the small east coast communities that are associated with the highest cost estimates in the 
database. Profiling was also done for the set of Alberta communities that have completed the Climate Resilience 
Express program and that have populations of less than 100,000. 
The target east coast communities are Marystown, NL (population 5,316), Little Anse, NS (population 3,150) and 
Bay Bulls-Witless Bay, NL (population 3,119). These communities have adaptation cost to GDP ratios of 8.9, 6.2 
and 14.0, respectively. Using the approach identified above, 20 communities with similar populations, land areas 
and climate risk profiles were identified. The adaptation cost to GDP ratios contained in the cost database (noted 
above) may be representative of the range of ratios that may be observed in these additional 20 communities. 
The communities and their populations are listed in Table E1.

Municipal Costs of Extreme Weather
APPENDIX F
THE COSTS OF RECENT EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS
Weather changes in Canada are happening abruptly with more communities experiencing extreme weather events.68 
The Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society reports that heat waves, extreme flooding and wildfires are 
becoming more frequent and severe. Environment and Climate Change Canada, for example, has concluded that the 
risk of western fires since 2015 has increased two to six times due to human-induced warming.69  The resulting impacts 
of extreme weather events are placing a financial strain on communities, businesses and all levels of government. In 
this section, we demonstrate the benefits of adaptation by highlighting examples of the economic costs associated 
with recent extreme weather events (see Appendix B for an overview of studies that have estimated the future cost 
of climate change impacts). A map of insured losses due to extreme weather events in Warren and Lemman (2014), 
provides historical context, documenting the costliest impacts between 2004 and 2013 (Figure F1). The map includes 
events up to July 2013 so does not include the flooding in Southern Alberta or the ice storm in Eastern Ontario.

The year 2013 was a landmark year, as insurance companies incurred over $3.2 billion in losses due to extreme 
weather events, a record high, which at the time dramatically exceeded previous highs. Below, three events that 
occurred in 2013 are highlighted to demonstrate the magnitude of economic impacts from climate change and 
the importance of adaptation measures. The 2013 events are the flooding in Southern Alberta, the July rainfall 
event in Toronto, and the December ice storm in Ontario. The two extreme weather events hitting Toronto in 
2013 demonstrate the financial burden that multiple extreme weather events can have on municipalities. The 
combined costs incurred by the city were over $171 million. A new record in insurance losses was set in 2016, 
attributed largely to the Fort McMurray fires, which is now the costliest natural disaster ever in Canada.70 In 
addition, two examples of other recent extreme weather events, floods in Essex County, Ontario, and the 2018 
Saint John river flood, demonstrate the financial toll these events are having and the need to ramp up adaptation 
measures in communities across Canada. 
The benefits of these adaptation measures have been acknowledged by local decision makers. According to 
Tecumseh Mayor Gary McNamara, “[b]y making flood mitigation improvements, not only do we prevent flooding 
for our townsfolk, we also save money by sending less water to Windsor to be treated.”71 The leaders in the 
communities ravaged by the extreme rains of 2016 and 2017 recognize the importance of keeping water in the 
ground, holding and controlling its flow and redirecting it away from the sewer system.72 In this regard, the use of 
green infrastructure is an important part of the solution. Lakewood Park, for example, is a parcel of land bought 
by the town of Tecumseh at a cost of $15 million. It rests above a water reservoir and large sanitary sewers and 
is integrated with a storm channel and pumping station. The park is an important part of the flood adaptation 
strategy for the community.

FORT MCMURRAY FIRE, MAY 2016 
The Fort McMurray fire in May of 2016 displaced Fort McMurray’s 88,000 residents, damaged or destroyed 1,935 
residential structures, 23 commercial and industrial buildings, and scorched 18,600 vehicles.73 The Conference 
Board of Canada estimated the total direct cost of the disaster, including private expenditures, at $5.4 billion. This 
includes $3.8 billion in insured losses, $1.2 billion in payments from federal, provincial and municipal governments 
to help with the cleanup and rebuilding, and $500 million in costs incurred by the private sector and households. 
In addition, the Alberta Government spent $369 million in extra wildfire-fighting costs.74 The estimated 
$3.8 billion in insured losses makes it the costliest natural disaster for Canadian insurers ever. Catastrophe Indices 
and Quantification Inc. estimated the breakdown of insurance losses as follows: 27,000 personal property claims; 
5,000 commercial claims; and 12,000 car claims.75
The fire caused substantial economic disruption to the Wood Buffalo region and resulted in temporary shutdowns 
to oil sands operations. Real (inflation‑adjusted) GDP in the Wood Buffalo region was estimated to have declined 
by 14.6 per cent in 2016 due to the fire. Shutdowns of oil sands production created losses of 47 million barrels of 
oil and cost producers $1.4 billion in revenues.76,77 Other economic costs include $300 million in lost taxes and 
royalties to the province, $167 million in lost federal taxes, $458 million in lost labour income and $55 million in 
lost revenue to Fort McMurray businesses.78 
While the emphasis is on the direct cost of the fires, the toll on the community in terms of health impacts was 
substantial as well. For example, Agyapong and colleagues (2018) in a study on depression prevalence of Fort 
McMurray residents following the 2016 wildfires found a fourfold increase in the point prevalence of major likely 
depressive disorders when compared to the general population in the province. The prevalence rate of major 
likely depressive disorders 6 months after the disaster was 14.8% compared to the 3.3% prevalence rate in the 
general public in Alberta. The study also identified a significant twofold or greater likelihood of suffering from 
problematic drug use, harmful or hazardous drinking or alcohol dependence, or moderate to high nicotine 
dependence among those suffering from likely depression.79

TORONTO, ONTARIO ICE STORM, DECEMBER 21-22, 2013
While the 2013 ice storm impacted Eastern Ontario, parts of Quebec and New Brunswick, the Toronto area was 
among the hardest hit regions by the storm. Over 300,000 customers in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) lost 
electrical power, and many households and businesses lost power for several days. Transportation systems came 
to a halt. Forty percent of power transmission lines were affected, while more than 20% of the City of Toronto’s 
tree canopy was destroyed.80 The winter storm event cost City of Toronto divisions, agencies and corporations 
over $106 million.81 Table F1 provides a breakdown of costs by service provider. In addition to costs incurred 
directly by the city, the federal government contributed $120 million under the DFAA program to offset recovery 
and repair costs.82 Insurance losses were estimated to cost over $200 million.83

TORONTO, ONTARIO RAINFALL EVENT, JULY 2013
Record rainfall on July 8, 2013 caused severe flooding in Toronto. More than ninety millimetres of rain fell in a 
two-hour period. Subways were closed due to flooding, GO trains were evacuated by police boats, and drivers 
faced washed-out roads.84
The rainfall event resulted in more than $850 million in insured property losses across the GTA. A City of Toronto 
assessment of the storm-related costs estimated the city (municipal government) incurred $59.2 million in capital 
costs and $10.9 million in operating costs associated with response and recovery (Table F2).85
The storm had a wide economic impact causing major transit delays, road closures, power outages, flight 
cancellations and business closures lasting in many cases several days to deal with flood recovery and clean-up. 
The combination of the Toronto December ice storm (discussed above) and July rainfall event resulted in losses 
and costs to the city of over $171 million. The events placed substantial financial strain on the city to address 
budget shortfalls.86

SOUTHERN ALBERTA FLOODING, JUNE 2013 
The 2013 flood in Southern Alberta damaged an estimated 4,000 businesses and 13,500 homes. One hundred 
thousand people were evacuated and five people died. The flood caused extensive damage to infrastructure, 
with 1,000 km of roads destroyed and hundreds of bridges and culverts washed out.87 In total, an estimated 
278 cities, towns and villages were affected.88
The flood was estimated to cost over $6 billion in capital losses of which about $2 billion represented insured 
losses.89 The federal government contributed $1.35 billion under the  DFAA program to support flood recovery. 
In addition, the City of Calgary, one of the hardest hit regions, received $55 million in direct federal support to 
help repair damaged infrastructure and to pay for the costs of emergency response and staff.90
SAINT JOHN RIVER FLOOD, 2018
While seasonal flooding is a common occurrence along the Saint John River in New Brunswick, the 2018 flood 
was well beyond the realms of normality for the river. The flooding occurred in early April and was the result of 
the winter accumulation of snow colliding with extremely warm temperatures and significant rainfall within a 
48 hour period. Temperatures in the province reached 29°C immediately before a heavy rainstorms moved into 
the province. Rain fell for 31 of 32 days and totalled 152 mm. The result was water in the Saint John River rising 
2 metres above flood levels.91 Water levels in the capital city were more than 8 metres above sea level.92 
The trifecta of conditions culminated in the largest, most impactful flood in modern New Brunswick history. 
The impact to public infrastructure was significant as the Trans-Canada Highway between Fredericton and 
Moncton was closed along with over 150 roads, bridges, and culverts across the province.93  
When the Saint John River flooded in 2008, more than $23 million in damages were incurred as over 600 
properties were impacted and 1,000 people were displaced from their homes. At the time, it was the worst spring 
flood since 1973.94 The impact from the 2018 spring flood far exceeded that of 2008. In 2018, 12,000 properties 
were impacted. The cost to the federal and provincial government was $80 million.95 The 2018 flood became the 
most damaging flood in New Brunswick in more than 50 years.96 
FLOODS IN ESSEX COUNTY, ONTARIO, 2016 AND 2017
In September 2016, Essex County, Ontario experienced extreme rainfall. The volume of rainfall varied by 
neighbourhood, but exceeded 200 mm in some communities (e.g., Riverside and Tecumseh). In Windsor, the city’s 
stormwater infrastructure could not manage the deluge of water; the volume was well beyond the maximum 
capacity of the system. The result was inundated roads, fields and yards as well as dirty sewer water in flooded 
basements. Over 6,000 insurance claims were made as a result of the 2016 rainfall event.97 The total cost of such 
claims was over $153 million. Of course, the insurance costs are a fraction of the total costs. Recall that for every 
dollar spent on insurance, $3 to $4 are incurred by governments, households and businesses.

Less than a year later, on August 28, 2017, another extreme rain event hit the region flooding the same area. 
Within 48 hours, 222 mm of rain had fallen in southwest Windsor and 140 mm to 200 mm in Riverside-Tecumseh. 
The neighbouring community of LaSalle was hit even harder when 125 mm of rain fell on August 28 and another 
160 mm of rain fell the next day. In total, 285 mm of rain fell on LaSalle in 32 hours.98 
Once again, stormwater infrastructure in these neighbourhoods and communities was overpowered as rainwater 
smothered roads, fields and yards and filled thousands of basements. Insurance payouts for the 2017 rain event 
totaled $165 million – the most expensive single-storm loss across Canada that year. In addition to insurance 
claims, the province of Ontario paid out another $1.4 million through the provincial Disaster Recovery Fund.99 
Between the two events, 11,000 households experienced flooding.
Factors that contributed to the record breaking claims and high cost of these extreme rainfall events include 
climate change, the disappearance of wetlands and aging infrastructure.100 In response, municipalities are 
investing millions of dollars ($120 million as of September 2018) in adaptation measures including improvements 
to sewer systems, modified roads to support overland water flows, and upgrades to pumping stations in 
the hardest hit neighbourhoods.101,102 Infrastructure upgrades to manage extreme volumes of water that are 
underway in the municipalities include:103  
•	
A nearly $90-million plan for the Riverside area that includes sewer replacements, upgrades to pumping 
stations and sewers and rebuilding roads. 
•	
Improvements to the Lennon Drain in South Windsor and the Riverside Vista project, both of which will aid 
storm water management.
•	
A $30.3-million plan for Tecumseh to cover the Manning Road ditches and improve sewers and pump 
capacity along Riverside Drive.
•	
A $3-million project in LaSalle to turn a park and sports recreational area into a dry pond in the Heritage 
Estates and Oliver Farm areas. 
•	
Lakeshore’s priorities are making improvements in its sewers and pump capacity in the western end of the 
town that got hit hard in 2016 and 2017 and to expand its wastewater treatment plan.
