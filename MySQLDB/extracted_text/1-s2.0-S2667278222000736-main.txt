Across the United States, climate change impacts are intensifying
and accelerating with hardly an area of the country unaffected. While
wildﬁre frequency is growing exponentially on the West Coast [1],
people on the East Coast suffer from hurricanes, heavy rainfall, and
ﬂoods. Each of these events takes a toll on the health of impacted
communities. Wildﬁres, for example, are linked to increased hospital
visits for respiratory illness [2], higher rates of mental health impacts
such as depression [3], and PTSD [4], and 2022 research shows that
wildﬁres may increase the risk of lung and brain cancer [5]. Other
health impacts of climate change include heat-related illness and
water, food, and vector-borne diseases [6]. Climate change-fueled
events take a toll on human health, in addition to growing ﬁnancial
burdens. It is reported that the health costs of climate change and air
pollution are greater than $800 billion per year [7].
Despite these impacts, there are mitigation efforts that can reduce
the worst impacts of climate change. Reducing emissions by decar-
bonizing the economy and restoring natural ecosystems are two
paths forward. As transitioning to renewable energy has gained trac-
tion, a number of countries have begun producing much of their elec-
tricity generation from renewables. These include Paraguay, Norway,
and Costa Rica, which source 93−99% of their electricity from hydro-
power [8]. Transportation is beginning to shift, too. Electric car sales
were up 109% globally from 2020 to 2021, demonstrating the move
away from fossil-fuel vehicles [9]. Restoring nature through imple-
menting techniques often referred to as “Natural Climate Solutions”
or “NCS” has the potential to sequester 21% of the United States’
greenhouse gas emissions [10]. There is also growing recognition
within the health sector of its own emission contributions. Within
the healthcare sector, MacNeill et al., suggest a framework that
includes reducing the incidence and severity of disease, thereby
reducing the demand for health services, providing the appropriate
level of care and avoiding unnecessary care, and minimizing the car-
bon footprint within the health-care supply chain [11].
One of the most important actions individuals can take in address-
ing climate change is talking about it [12,13]. 45% of Americans report
feeling “very concerned” about climate change, but only 14% think
that others around them are “very concerned” [14]. This gap in real
versus perceived concern can be referred to as “pluralistic ignorance”,
the phenomenon in which an individual’s beliefs about their social
group’s consensus differs from what the group actually believes, and
may be contributing to silence on the issue [15,16]. Goldberg et al.
found that talking about climate change with friends and family can
result in a positive feedback loop of discussion that in turn, may
encourage engagement on the issue [13]. Dr. Katharine Hayhoe is a
leader in climate communication research. In her 2018 TED Talk,
Hayhoe says “The bottom line is this: climate change is affecting you
and me right here, right now, in the places where we live. But by
working together, we can ﬁx it. Sure, it’s a daunting problem. Nobody
knows that more than us climate scientists. But we can’t give in to
despair. We have to go out and actively look for the hope that we
need, that will inspire us to act. And that hope begins with a conver-
sation today.” [12]
Communication, particularly from those in the health profession,
proves to be meaningful. Compared to other professions, nurses, doc-
tors, and pharmacists are highly trusted in terms of honesty and ethi-
cal standards [17]. A 2021 ecoAmerica survey revealed that 64% of
Americans say they trust health professionals as sources of climate
change information [18]. It should be a priority to equip health pro-
fessionals with the education and tools they need to advocate, act on,
and talk about climate change solutions in a number of ways.
The Climate for Health Ambassador Training is a four-hour course
based on applied social science and comprised of six chapters. The
training was reviewed by a committee of ten medical doctors, public
health professionals, and researchers [see Appendix] who were
selected for their recognized work at the intersection of climate
change and health. Reviewers were invited to share feedback on the
presentation and joined convenings to discuss their comments and
recommendations on the training. The program was initially piloted

in 2019 and based on successful feedback, was scaled in 2020. The
training is a comprehensive intervention that brings forth psychol-
ogy, psychographics, social psychology, epistemology, linguistics, and
behavioral economics to inspire and empower health professionals
to move up a ladder of engagement from concern to visible leader-
ship and advocacy. It is offered in two formats: in-person at conferen-
ces
and
convenings
and
online
through
a
Litmos
Learning
Management System. The training is instructed by trained ecoAmer-
ica staff. When conducted at conferences, instructors are joined by
staff of the partner organizations to provide context for their mem-
bers.
The primary aim of the training is to equip health professionals to
speak about, act on, and advocate for climate solutions. Four central
goals include:
(1) Ensuring a baseline knowledge of what we need to know and do
about climate change as a health issue.
(2) Building conﬁdence by preparing for public speaking with impor-
tant communication strategies.
(3) Giving prospective Ambassadors the tools and materials necessary
to plan and conduct advocacy actions in their communities.
(4) To provide opportunities to connect with, learn, and share with
others in the broader Ambassador community and within their
own health profession.
The six chapters include: (1) Introduction, (2) Climate Changes
Health, (3) Solutions and Beneﬁts, (4) Talking Health and Climate, (5)
Advocacy and Engagement, and (6) Getting Started. The introduction
provides a climate science overview to ensure participants have a
baseline knowledge of the drivers of our changing climate. Chapter 2,
Climate Changes Health, covers the myriad of impacts climate change
has on physical and mental health with a focused module that
describes climate and health equity. While climate change will harm
everyone to some level, certain groups are vulnerable and at higher
risk of health impacts than others. This topic is central to ensuring cli-
mate action and solutions that beneﬁt all people, especially those
who have contributed the least to the problem but are burdened the
most by its impacts. The solutions and beneﬁts section in Chapter 3
covers electrifying energy, restoring nature, and solutions speciﬁc to
the health sector: decarbonizing healthcare, greening healthcare
facilities, and health organizations committing to 100% clean energy.
The most active and participatory section is communications. Chapter
4 shares examples of messaging that apply learnings from values
research and has gone through several rounds of intensive testing
spanning across focus groups, online dial surveys, and a phone sur-
vey. Through lectures, active engagement and exercise, participants
practice their messaging techniques to ensure they can reach their
audiences appropriately to inspire action. Participants become famil-
iar with knowing their audience, and connecting with their personal
concerns — helping advance the priority of climate change [19].
Advocating for climate action in Chapter 5 reviews advocacy in a
wide array of settings: with friends, family, neighbors, policymakers,
in the workplace, policy, and online. Finally, the training concludes
with guidance on how to get started in the Ambassador Program and
community.
By October 2022, the Climate for Health Ambassador program
successfully trained over 1200 health professionals across the United
States and incorporated over 575 into the program. Ofﬁcially joining
the program is designated by signing an agreement to do the follow-
ing: each Ambassador is asked to give three peer-to-peer talks (such
as publicly speaking with their association’s members or presenting
at conferences) and complete a minimum of two advocacy actions
per year. Advocacy actions might be taken in the form of writing let-
ters to the editor, meeting with policymakers, and posting advocacy
messages on social media. Ambassadors are also publicly listed and
may be asked to host a talk or presentation about health and climate
change within their region. The Ambassador’s actions are currently
self-reported, which has proven to be a challenge for the program —
ways to improve reporting are being explored. Public participation
on climate change is critical from the health sector. Research suggests
that to build engagement on climate change, Americans need to see
leaders they trust, such as health professionals, addressing the crisis
[19]. The Climate for Health Ambassador Program has collaborated
with a number of partners including, but not limited to, the American
Academy of Pediatrics, the National Environmental Health Associa-
tion, the American Public Health Association, and NorthCal Kaiser
Permanente. The most attended training was conducted virtually in
September 2021 with Harvard’s Center for Climate, Health, and the
Global Environment (Harvard Chan C-Change) which resulted in 173
attendees and 113 signed ambassadors.
There is strong urgency for health professionals to feel conﬁdent,
prepared, and inspired to act and advocate for climate solutions. The
Climate for Health Ambassador Training offers an opportunity for
health professionals to connect with a network of climate activists in
their ﬁeld to share experiences and learn from. The growing Ambas-
sador community suggests that a diverse range of health professions
and organizations want to take action to curb the climate crisis and
that momentum is growing. The result of the training and now an
ongoing program is that trusted health professionals are widely shar-
ing values and behaviors for climate action. Future work may (1)
examine the most impactful actions taken by Climate for Health
Ambassadors to encourage engagement in those areas, and (2) ana-
lyze how the empowerment of health professionals on climate may
help shift the narrative nationally to be increasingly personal as com-
munications focus on health.
