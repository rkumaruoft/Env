Chapter 3. How Does Addressing Climate Change Make
Us Healthier?
This inquiry explores sensitive material. It explores the connection between climate change and
many facets of human health. We have included resources, activities, and information to inform
educators of the serious and widespread effects that climate impacts have on physical and
mental health across Canada. This inquiry also invites students to reflect and consider their
own health in the face of these serious climate changes. We explore how many of the actions
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions also have the co-benefit of improving our health.
Through open-ended discussion probes, thoughtful provocations, and several hands-on
activities, this inquiry provides multiple directions for educators to take as human health and
climate change are explored side by side.

Before you Begin: Background Information for Educators
In order to help you have conversations with your students about how they are feeling about the
existential threats of climate change, we recommend several additional resources to consult.
Before feeling ready to create a safe space where students can explore issues of climate
change, you should feel supported and informed with the help of expert voices on the subject.

The climate is changing at a rapid rate, and this change continues to have implications for
human health in a profound way. It is important to consider human health as more than simply
the absence of disease; human health is a multidimensional framework that encompasses
mental, physical and emotional well-being as equal contributors. Climate change has both direct
and indirect implications for mental health and psychosocial well-being. Overall, recent studies
have found that Canadians are increasingly experiencing mental health conditions and
symptoms related to the effects of climate change. As well, in terms of the impacts on physical
health, “Climate change is already impacting health in a myriad of ways, including by leading to
death and illness from increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as heatwaves,
storms and floods, the disruption of food systems, increases in zoonoses and food-, water- and
vector-borne diseases, and mental health issues” (WHO, 2021). In order to properly address the
urgency of climate change in Canadian classrooms within a health and well-being framework, it
is important to understand the impact of climate change on all facets of human health.
Educating students about the health-related effects of climate change is critical due to the close
link between comprehending and acting on climate change. Psychological Research and
Climate Change showed that people are better able and more motivated to act on climate
change solutions when they can relate information and solutions to their own health and
well-being or local environment.
There are many additional factors that can affect an individual’s or region’s susceptibility to the
negative physical effects of climate change including: geographic location, the presence of
pre-existing illness or disability, and inequalities (socioeconomic, demographic, education level,
economic status and age).
Physical Health
The Public Health Agency of Canada has classified physical health risks as a result of climate
change into five categories: temperature-related morbidity and mortality, weather-related natural
hazards, air quality, water- and food-borne contamination, and health effects of exposure to
ultraviolet rays. Some health effects can be directly linked to concrete climate events like natural
disasters (droughts, floods, storms), but other changes are more gradual. (Health Canada)
Temperature-related morbidity and mortality: periods of higher than normal heat and the
numbers of days per year above 35 degrees Celsius are multiplying and, on this trajectory, will
continue to do so throughout the next century, causing:
●
respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses
●
increased occupational health risks
Weather-related natural hazards: climate change is increasing both the severity and
frequency of natural hazards throughout Canada which can cause:
●
damaged public health infrastructure
●
injuries and illnesses
●
social and mental stress
●
increased occupational health hazards
●
population displacement
Air quality issues: cars, planes and industrial facilities are causing air pollution and it is being
intensified by warmer temperatures, causing:
●
increased exposure to outdoor and indoor air pollutants and allergens
●
respiratory diseases
●
cancer, heart attacks, strokes
●
other cardiovascular diseases.
Water-borne contamination and food safety: climate change causes increased precipitation,
storm surges, and water temperatures which can contribute to flooding and runoff that can
spread sewage, chemicals, diseases, bacteria, and toxic algae. Climate change can also put
food safety at risk due to changing environmental and social conditions that increase the
likelihood of contamination.
Health effects due to exposure of ultraviolet rays: Increased UV exposure poses a high risk
and has the potential to cause:
●
skin damage and increased risk of skin cancer
●
cataracts
●
disturbed immune function
Mental Health
Mental health is influenced in many ways by climate change, both directly and indirectly, and it
can have both acute and chronic impacts on human health. Chronic mental health impacts can
be less obvious than in physical illness, but no less important. Individuals may experience fear
and feelings of helplessness that can manifest into serious mental health conditions such as
post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, grief, substance abuse disorders, and
others.
Acute mental health consequences often occur as a reaction to a natural disaster which has
caused damage to infrastructure, food systems, medical services, transportation, home and
belongings, or loved ones. Natural disasters can cause or exacerbate stress, and the
psychological effects can be profound and long-lasting.
Chronic mental health consequences can occur as a result of gradual climate changes. Feelings
of powerlessness, despair, and constant worry about the future of the planet, one’s own health,
and that of future generations have been termed “eco-anxiety.”
According to Mental Health and Our Changing Climate, both acute and chronic mental health
effects can include:
●
Anxiety
●
Depression
●
Post-traumatic stress disorder
●
Compounded stress
●
Loss of personal and occupational identity
●
Feelings of fatalism and helplessness
●
Trauma and shock

It is crucial to be informed about and cognizant of students’ mental health when addressing
climate change in the classroom. There are clear risks associated with catastrophizing the
problem and leaving students feeling helpless or solutionless. However, when the emphasis is
placed on taking action against climate change, the impacts on mental health can be positive
rather than negative. Encouraging students to make lifestyle choices that benefit the
environment or taking collective action can curtail some of the negative effects of climate
change. According to the American Psychological Association, “climate solutions not only
improve the quality of air and food but also enhance our cognitive abilities and strengthen our
mental health.”

This chapter offers 3 different structured and scaffolded inquiries to support ideas associated
with “How Does Addressing Climate Change Make Us Healthier?” Each of the 3 inquiries begin
with a provocation followed by numerous strategies and examples.
These steps can be completed in their entirety as stated. However, as inquiry is an organic and
fluid process based on student input, educators may wish to adapt, modify or replace the
suggested steps to create their own inquiry with their class. We therefore suggest that teachers
review the whole chapter first in order to create a plan that will work best with their particular
group of learners.
The following 3 inquiries are connected to curricular concepts as shown in this chart. These
curricular concepts are applicable across Canada.

Inquiry 1: Impacts on Health - Campaign for Vitamin N (“N” for nature)
“Vitamin N (for “nature”) is a concept coined by Richard Louv, author of the book of the same
name. This book and concept is a complete prescription for connecting with the power and joy
of the natural world right now, with: activities, informational websites, an abundance of
down-to-earth advice, and dozens of thought-provoking essays.” (“Vitamin N (for “nature”),

“Vitamin N (for “nature”) is a concept coined by Richard Louv, author of the book of the same
name. This book and concept is a complete prescription for connecting with the power and
joy of the natural world right now, with activities, informational websites, an abundance of
down-to-earth advice, and dozens of thought-provoking essays” (Vitamin N, Richard Louv,
2016).
A. Provocations
To hook student interest, choose one or more of the provocation ideas to
initiate student thinking.
Image Impressions
Pollution exists in many forms. There is air pollution, water pollution, terrestrial (land - litter,
plastic) pollution, noise pollution, and light pollution to name a few. Search for images that
depict the harmful treatment of nature. Below are some [creative commons] examples (Click
the photo to access the source url).
1
(© id-iom, 2011 retrieved from:
https://www.flickr.com/photos/id-iom/584228
0154/)
Print off the images (or find your own to print), stick each one on a piece of chart paper, and
mount them around the classroom so that students have space to walk around, think about
what they see, and respond. This activity is best done in silence with students looking at the
pictures as they would in a Gallery Walk, viewing the images, and writing their reaction to
the image or interpretation of what they think the image is saying directly onto the chart
paper surrounding the image. They can use words or drawing to demonstrate their feelings
towards the images. Allow enough time for students to look and respond thoughtfully.
2
B. Question Generation
At this point in the inquiry, we want to harness students’ curiosity and build off of
the provocations that have captured their interest by generating meaningful
questions to continue to drive the learning process. This section will outline
pathways for question generation depending on the provocation(s) that your class engaged
with.
Once the gallery walk is complete allow students time to read or discuss the reactions
written on the papers.
During the See, Think, Wonder routines students share their thinking.
Example Activities
Option 1:
Working in pairs, each group of students receives a See, Think, Wonder worksheet. Ask
each pair to choose a particular image to respond to. Once students have a chance to
discuss with a partner what they ‘think’ and what they ‘see’ when looking at the image,
students work together to come up with a list of questions that they ‘wonder’ about when
looking at the image. These wonderings can then be collated and the class can choose
questions to drive the inquiry on understanding Vitamin N.
Option 2:
Have each student make a “picture frame” by cutting out a frame shape from a heavy stock
boxboard (old cereal box) or use popsicle sticks glued into a picture frame shape. Take
students on a simple walk in the schoolyard to capture nature’s beauty. When students find
something in nature that they think is beautiful, have students lay their frames over the
object or scene. They can share their captures using another Gallery Walk or they can use
a device to photograph their capture to bring back into the classroom.
Generate questions on the captures that students find. Here is a resource to help:
Activities for Teaching Children to Ask and Answer Questions
C. Knowledge Building
At this stage, students may be ready to engage in a group knowledge-building
activity. It will encourage students to open their minds to many alternative ways
of thinking about the provocations and ideas that have been generated thus far in the inquiry
process. Engaging in a class Knowledge Building Circle (ideally outside if possible) is a
good opportunity to delve deeper into the topic of human health and encourage participation
from many students in the classroom. Find your way into a circle where everyone can see
one another and if this is your first knowledge-building circle, make sure that everyone
understands their role in the circle. You could pose some guiding questions to the group and
mediate the conversation as required. It is a good idea to take notes throughout the
discussion or otherwise record the experience to refer to when gauging students’ growth in
understanding.
3
Example Activity:
What is vitamin N? According to Richard Louv, author of many books including Last Child in
the Woods and Vitamin N there are 10 reasons why children and adults need Vitamin N.
1.
The more high-tech our lives become, the more nature we need.
2.
Humans are hard-wired to love and need exposure to the natural world.
3.
We suffer when we withdraw from nature.
4.
Nature brings our senses alive.
5.
Individuals and businesses can become nature smart.
6.
Nature heals.
7.
Nature can reduce depression and can improve psychological well-being.
8.
Nature builds community bonds.
9.
Nature bonds family and friends.
10. The future is at stake.
Looking at this list of 10 reasons why adults and children need a healthy dose of Vitamin N,
choose up to 5 reasons (bolded ones are our suggestions to focus on with students in
grades 3-6) to be at the centre of your knowledge building.
Using a Knowledge Building Circle, explore these statements to allow students to express
their understanding and build their knowledge around the importance of nature for health
and well-being. Students may find that they want to share stories about their experiences in
nature and how those experiences impacted them.
Possible knowledge-building circle questions:
●
How do you feel when you are outside?
●
What is your favourite place to be? Why?
●
When is your favourite time to be outside?
●
Do you feel different when you are inside?
D. Determining Understanding
Use responses to inform and guide the learning process. They can provide
insight into which concepts need clarity, what many students are already well
informed about, and a general direction that many students want to pursue.
Students choose one of the statements from Richard Louv’s list of 10 reasons why adults
and children need Vitamin N and create a poster to support that reason. The poster should
be focused on a good slogan and clearly show, through text and drawings, the message you
want to convey. Examples of slogans:
●
Put Down the Screen and Go Outside
●
Screen Time vs Green Time
●
Go Wild - Spend Time in Nature
●
Love Your Mother (Nature)
●
Nature Each Day Keeps the Doctor Away
4
●
Just Do It! Get Outside!
●
Give a Hoot, Don’t Pollute
●
Do Your Share for Cleaner Air
Here are two examples of posters to promote an “anti-idling” campaign. Ask students to
consider how the message is being conveyed. There is little text, but drawings and symbols
also send the message. Have students make rough drawings of their posters and
incorporate these techniques to make their message understood.
This site shares the Advantages of Posters in Education and suggests 6 attributes that a
quality poster should contain. This could help in developing the success criteria with the
students.
Possible Discussion Questions:
●
What does idling mean? Why is this a problem?
●
What do you think each symbol on the posters means?
●
Why is there a dollar sign on the poster?
●
How does the use of capital letters and/or colour help make the point?
E. Pursuing Learning: Impacts on Health
At this stage, students may begin research to pursue some of their questions,
or some of the following activities could be integrated into the process to ensure
that students have an understanding of foundational climate science. The activities listed
below will enrich the understanding of climate change.
Students will continue their exploration of health and climate change. If there is interest, the
activities listed below offer deliberate, focused opportunities for students to pursue learning
about physical and mental health-related impacts and responses to climate change.
Example Activity: Create a Survey so that students can investigate what knowledge the
public (their community) has about the impacts on health due to climate change. Students
can survey through:
●
Observations (e.g., during school drop off and pick up times, have students tally the
number of cars and buses that idle while waiting for students, observe how peers
5
deal with their garbage, recyclable and compostable items during lunch and snack
times)
●
Interviews (e.g., students create questionnaires and interview members of the school
community, their parents and friends).
○
They can ask questions about simple environmental actions that promote
good health, how people use nature or feel about being in nature
○
Or they can ask people about their knowledge of environmental problems
(such as air pollution, light pollution, use of plastics, etc.) that contribute to
climate change.
The results of these surveys can then be used to help direct students’ campaigns promoting
the importance of Vitamin N and good behaviours that promote positive environmental
actions.
Mental Health Break:
To get their own healthy dose of Vitamin N (particularly if students are feeling overwhelmed),
spend time outside in a natural space. Learn how to do Sit Spots outside as a coping,
relaxation strategy as well as a learning activity. Start with one minute and increase the time
every day or week. At school, travel outside as a class with their Sit Upon, a mat or bag to sit
on that will keep them dry. Try to find a place that your class can revisit on a regular basis,
perhaps every week or every month. Encourage students to sit a minimum of two metres
apart and invite them to quietly observe what is around them, do some breathing exercises
or just to relax and enjoy their surroundings.
F. Consolidation
This step is designed to encourage students to integrate and synthesize key ideas. When
students make connections and see relationships within and across lessons, this helps them
to solidify knowledge and deepen understanding.
Using all of the information from the inquiry up to this point, students create a campaign to
promote the importance of Vitamin N. A campaign is an “organized course of action to
achieve a goal” (Oxford Language Dictionary, 2022). The goal is to spend more time in
nature to increase our exposure to Vitamin N.
A campaign has more than just a poster to promote your ideas, it also needs a plan.
Students will choose an action that gets people outside more often.
Click here to see some examples of a successful campaign from the company Stihl’s “Get
Real” Campaign.
6
Assessment Idea
Teachers will assess learning at different points throughout the inquiry using
multiple methods. The following assessment provides an alternative evaluation
method to standard quizzes and tests, that can be used after consolidation or at
any point in the lesson to check for understanding.
The Choice Board Strategy incorporates the principles of Universal Design Learning (UDL)
by encouraging multiple means of expression. Students choose a mode from the choice
board (see sample below) to present their understanding of their learning.
Choice Board Strategy Example guiding questions:
●
How does addressing climate change also help improve our health?
●
What climate solutions are also healthy lifestyle choices?
●
Why is being in nature important for the health of living things?
●
What can we do to help our environment?
●
What is a healthy lifestyle?
●
Does everyone have the accessibility and opportunity to have a healthy lifestyle?
●
What factors may influence a healthy lifestyle?
Sample Choice Board
Create a Bumper
Sticker
Tell an Oral Story
Make an
Announcement
Draw a Picture
FREE CHOICE
Think like a plant
Make Music
(any materials)
Sing a Song
Use Recycled
Materials to Make a
Model
Take Action:
Allowing time for students to take action is an essential part of the learning
process on climate change, as it empowers students and eases their
eco-anxiety.
7
Ask the students what they want to do to positively impact climate change. List their ideas
and come up with a plan to put their action in place. Use the choice board activities the
students chose to share information with other classes or the community.
While the future is uncertain, there are many examples of positive actions happening all
around the world, and too often these stories do not get media coverage (check out The
Happy Broadcast to get some good news for a change!).
Finding actions that students can get involved in is paramount and in the subsequent
thematic inquiries, there are many examples of school projects and activities. As we
collectively oscillate between optimism and outrage, stories of the past can also be important
for active hope pathways.
Ideas for Taking Action:
●
A ready-made vehicle idling campaign (NRCAN, 2015)
●
Create their own anti-idling or idle-free posters for their community.
Catalogue of Potential Idling Reduction Campaigns (NRCAN, 2015)
●
Educate the school through different announcements sharing “waste and water
facts”. Post the garbage collection graph on the wall outside the classroom. Do a
second schoolyard garbage audit a month later. Put the second graph on the wall.
Celebrate successes.

students?
●
Feeding Our Community -  Ruth Betts Community School - Flin Flon, MB (2019)
○
Students at RBCS built a community garden to increase the availability of
affordable fresh produce. Students acquired the knowledge to build, grow,
and harvest their own fresh fruit and vegetables and how to utilize them in
daily meals and snacks. The garden contains a plant medicine wheel,
ceremonial plants, and a three sisters garden, incorporating traditional
knowledge. See their project here.
●
VegFest - E.L. Crossley Secondary School, Pelham, ON (2016)
9
○
E.A.R.T.H. club members at E.L. Crossley hoped to inform their fellow
students about the positive impacts a plant-based diet can have on the future
of our planet. Students organized a week of veggie-friendly events with the
support of various local community partners. The week’s events included a
vegan cooking class with a local natural chef, a screening of the documentary
Cowspiracy, a smoothie day, vegan salad bar extravaganza, cafeteria games,
and a vendor day. VegFest received an overwhelmingly positive response and
high levels of student participation each day. See their project here.
●
Connect with Nearby Nature - Ecoschools Canada
○
“Nature” is often understood as a place far away from human involvement.
However, humans exist within natural systems all the time, even in urban
environments! The Connect with Nearby Nature action incorporates
outdoor, environmental learning to foster relationship-building between people
and place, including all the more-than-human others who also call that place
home. Students will get to know their ecological neighbours by practicing
inquiry, observation, identification, research, and communication skills to build
their own nature-connections and knowledge, and share learnings with their
communities. Specifically, this action involves the creation of field guides,
maps, or outdoor signage. See resources and details here.

Review the definitions provided within the link with students. There are several “think and
answer” questions on page 4 that you might choose to share with your class and can be
modified based on the province or territory where the students live.  Decide whether you
would like students to work individually or in a group and hand them a “Food Security Budget
Activity” worksheet from page 7.  The directions are provided on page 5 so that the class can
play one or more games.
B. Question Generation
At this point in the inquiry, we want to harness students’ curiosity and build off of
the provocations that have captured their interest by generating meaningful
questions to continue to drive the learning process. This section will outline pathways for
question generation depending on the provocation(s) that your class engaged with.
The See Think Wonder routine encourages students to make careful observations and
make thoughtful interpretations. It helps to stimulate curiosity and set the stage for inquiry.
Example Activity 1:
After watching the video Every Plate Tells a Story have students dive into their lunchboxes
to analyze their food choices. Use the See, Think, Wonder strategy to explore where (in the
world) their food has come from and how it got to their lunchbox! How many questions can
they generate about each item?
and/or
Example Activity 2:
After watching the video Every Plate Tells a Story, have students participate in a group
‘lunchbox’ analysis. Using a simple cardboard box, create a “lunchbox” using pictures from
grocery store flyers for each group of 4-5 students. Instruct students to cut out up to 10
pictures of their favourite foods, filling their “lunchbox” with images. Once filled, students
work together to sort the food into groups (criteria to be determined by the teacher and grade
level of the students). Suggestions for sorting criteria: using Canada’s Food Guide (available
in 31 languages including 10 of Canada’s Indigenous languages), where the food originates,
seasonal availability, or processed or not processed to name a few. From these images,
have students generate questions they could ask their local grocery stores about sourcing
2
local foods. For example: when purchasing fruit that is in season in Canada, such as apples
in the fall, why do grocery stores still carry apples from Mexico?
C. Knowledge Building
At this stage, students may be ready to engage in a group knowledge building activity. It will
encourage students to open their minds to many alternative ways of thinking about the
provocations and ideas that have been generated thus far in the inquiry process.
Book: The World Came to My Place Today by Jo Redman, illustrated by Ley Honor
Roberts
The world really does come to visit George when his grandpa arrives, with a globe, to look
after him and his sister for the day. Grandpa explains how everything from the cereal they
eat for breakfast and the chocolate bars they love, to the rubber in their bicycle tyres and
wood in their toys, come from plants all over the world.
The slideshare version can be downloaded from a Scribd company.
Example Activity:
This storybook explores where our food comes from and how it gets to our plates. After
sharing the story, using the Change for Children’s resource called The Wonderful World
of Food, dig into global food facts and then use the “Getting Critical” exercise to investigate
food security, scarcity and fair trade issues.
D. Determining Understanding
Use responses to inform and guide the learning process. They can provide insight into which
concepts need clarity, what many students are already well informed about, and a general
direction that many students want to pursue.
Ask students to cut out pictures of food that would make up one of their typical meals and
3
put them together on a plate. Using the poster that they will already be familiar with from the
Question Generation section, Every Plate Tells a Story (appendix B in World’s Largest
Lesson’s resource), have students “STOP AND THINK” and make connections to the other
global goals by asking themselves the questions:
●
Who grew or helped produce my foods?
●
How far did my food travel to get to me?
●
What was my food packaged in?
●
Am I making healthy choices?
●
How much food am I wasting?
●
What can I do differently and who can I tell?
●
What is the ecological footprint of the food I eat?
From these images and with the knowledge they’ve gained through this inquiry so far, have
students try to create a balanced meal that has the smallest ecological footprint using the
GreenEatz Food Carbon Footprint Chart.
E. Pursuing Learning
At this stage, students may begin research to pursue some of their questions,
or some of the following activities could be integrated into the process to
ensure that students have an understanding of foundational climate science. The activities
listed below will enrich the understanding of climate change.
This is an opportunity to make some local connections to grocery stores that could lead to
action. Investigate the “Ugly Food” or “Misfits” movement. This is a movement towards
embracing food that doesn’t look perfect but is perfectly good to eat.
“In Canada we waste nearly as much food as we eat. Approximately 30 percent of that food
is fresh fruits and vegetables—25 million pounds—rejected before it reaches the distributors,
stores and our plates. The desire for “perfect”, unblemished produce means perfectly edible
food gets tossed simply because it’s not pretty enough. Consumers rarely even see curvy
carrots, bulbous potatoes, or twisted zucchini because of supermarket restrictions based on
strict inspection regulations governed by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CIFA)”
(Holly Brooke, “Fight Food Waste, Eat Ugly Vegetables,” Eat Magazine, 2015).
Connect with your local grocery stores to see how they deal with “ugly food” and food waste.
Here are some other resources to the movement:
●
Canada is Warming up to Ugly Vegetables (Vice, 2016)
●
Ugly Food Works - and you can get it for 30% less (Global Citizen, 2016)
●

F. Consolidation
This step is designed to encourage students to integrate and synthesize key
ideas. When students make connections and see relationships within and
across lessons, it helps them to solidify knowledge and deepen their understanding.
Guided Reading of the graphic story The Rise of the Plate PioneerZ written by Joe Reiter
with support of the World's Largest Lesson and UNICEF. As a class or in small groups, read
the story and complete the activity sections at the back of the comic. Have students, working
in small groups, take part in a drama activity where they act out the dialogue in the graphic
story. Students can improvise additional dialogue to enhance the story.
After reading and/or the drama activity, facilitate a classroom discussion on a definition of a
Plate Pioneer to check understanding. This activity comes from the Plate PioneerZ
resource.
Assessment Idea
Teachers will assess learning at different points throughout the inquiry using multiple
methods. The following assessment provides an alternative evaluation method to standard
quizzes and tests, that can be used after consolidation or at any point in the lesson to check
for understanding.
The I Used to Think… Now I Think… routine helps students to reflect on their thinking.
Example Activity:
Using some of the following sentence starters, have students complete the I Used to
Think… Now I Think
●
Unemployed people are food insecure
●
Food securities affect only senior citizens
●
People who are food insecure are bad at cooking
●
People who are food insecure budget poorly and make unhealthy food choices
●
Healthy food is cheaper than junk food
●
There is nothing I can do to help food security issues in my community
Take Action:
Allowing time for students to take action is an essential part of the learning process on
climate change, as it empowers students and eases their eco-anxiety.
5
Ask the students what they want to do to positively impact climate change. List their ideas
and come up with a plan to put their action in place. Use the choice board activities the
students chose to share information with other classes or the community.
While the future is uncertain, there are many examples of positive actions happening all
around the world, and too often these stories do not get media coverage (check out The
Happy Broadcast to get some good news for a change!).
Finding actions that students can get involved in is paramount and in the subsequent
thematic inquiries there are many examples of school projects and activities. As we
collectively oscillate between optimism and outrage, stories of the past can also be important
for active hope pathways.
Ideas for Taking Action:

support of various local community partners. The week’s events included a
vegan cooking class with a local natural chef, a screening of the documentary
Cowspiracy, a smoothie day, vegan salad bar extravaganza, cafeteria games,
and a vendor day. VegFest received an overwhelmingly positive response and
high levels of student participation each day. See their project here.

Connect with Nearby Nature - Ecoschools Canada
○
“Nature” is often understood as a place far away from human involvement.
However, humans exist within natural systems all the time, even in urban
environments! The Connect with Nearby Nature action incorporates
outdoor, environmental learning to foster relationship-building between people
and place, including all the more-than-human others who also call that place
home. Students will get to know their ecological neighbours by practicing
inquiry, observation, identification, research, and communication skills to build
their own nature-connections and knowledge, and share learnings with their
communities. Specifically, this action involves the creation of field guides,
maps, or outdoor signage. See resources and details here.

Take Action
“The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provides a global blueprint for dignity,
peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and in the future. A few years into the
Agenda, we see how civil society, private sector, and governments are translating this
shared vision into national development plans and strategies.” (UN: Why the SDG’s Matter)
A. Provocation
Videos
As a whole class, watch either the first video here Clean Water & Sanitation (Primary),
United Nations SDG6 Explained! geared more for grades 3 and 4, or the next one suitable
more for grades 5 and 6, Clean Water & Sanitation (Secondary) in order to get students
thinking about water and how it’s used everywhere to sustain life and remain healthy. This is
also a great introduction to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal #6 of the same name.  If
you’d like to show more than one video to promote thinking on water another video is United
Nations SDG6 Explained!, and SDG Goal 6 Explained: Clean Water & Sanitation
Next, working in groups of 3, have students discuss their thoughts about the importance of
water and then record the uses of water on a sheet of chart paper.  The chart paper should
be divided in half with one side showing personal water use and the other side displaying
uses of water outside of their homes, within their community and beyond.  Students can look
through any print resources available on the topic as well as explore the internet to add to
their work.
Have students assign each member of the group a number 1, 2 and 3. Gauge student
progress to determine how long to provide for the class to record their thoughts and what
they have quickly found through briefly researching.   When they have had sufficient time to
record, conduct the 2 Stray 1 Stay strategy.
B.  Question Generation
At this point in the inquiry, we want to harness students’ curiosity and build off of the
provocations that have captured their interest by generating meaningful questions to
continue to drive the learning process. This section will outline pathways for question
generation depending on the provocation(s) that your class engaged with.
1
Example Activity:
To keep students engaged in knowing and thinking more about water, share the 10 slides
from Nasa Kids 10 Interesting Things About Water as well as the video Water: Looking After
Our Planet.
Students should independently record questions they have that they will ask their peers in
preparation for the next step.  Assign students into 2 large groups and have them share and
respond to student-generated questions using the “Harkness Discussion Method”.
The teacher begins with an example to demonstrate the strategy.  Below are some
suggested questions.  They may be useful to have handy throughout the inquiry to guide
students in  their understanding of water importance and its risks, based on the information
gained through the provocation and conversation to date.
●
How does water keep you healthy?
●
At home, where do you get your water from? How is it cleaned before you drink it?
●
At school, where does the water come from? Is it cleaned differently than at home?
●
What would you do if there was a drought in your community or something that
happened to the source that supplies water to your house?
●
How do we take water for granted?
●
How do you show respect for water?
●
Do you think we will always have water available for human use? Why or why not?
●
Can you think of places where we might be able to recycle water?
●
Have you experienced any issues with clean water in your community?  Have you
heard of water problems elsewhere in Canada? In the world?
C. Knowledge Building
At this stage, students may be ready to engage in a group knowledge building activity. It will
encourage students to open their minds to many alternative ways of thinking about the
provocations and ideas that have been generated thus far in the inquiry process.
Divide the class into groups of 5 and use the Jigsaw method to explore the various water
resources.
Example Activity:
The following offers 5 links to water information.  Each jigsaw group (or expert group) should
be assigned one of the links in order to review the information, discuss what they have found
out and summarize in their mind or on paper the focus.  After a determined amount of time,
the members of the expert group will disperse and report the key details of what they learned
together to their home group.

D. Determining Understanding
Use responses to inform and guide the learning process. They can provide insight into which
concepts need clarity, what many students are already well informed about, and a general
direction that many students want to pursue.
Read the story The Water Walker by Joanne Robertson to the class or have them watch
and listen to the read aloud on the link below:
Choose from the following stories or read them all to explore how access to clean water
addresses other of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. Have students explore which
goals, beyond #6 Clean Water and Sanitation, link to water issues, in particular goal #5
Gender Equality and goal #10 Reduced Inequalities. This may also be a time and place to
discuss Boil Water Advisories in many Indigenous communities in Canada and the important
people fighting for justice like Autumn Peltier. Here are two videos of Autumn’s story, one
when she began her advocacy work
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg60sr38oic&t=83s) and the other where her work has
taken her as a water activist (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A33XRMLBbOc&t=5s)

E. Pursuing Learning
At this stage, students may begin research to pursue some of their questions, or some of the
following activities could be integrated into the process to ensure that students have an
understanding of foundational climate science. The activities listed below will enrich the
understanding of climate change.
Have students read the information found on pages 3 & 4 in the following link and complete
a home water audit by completing the Water Wise Student Worksheet on page 6.
Water in the World: Water Sources & Conservation Once students complete their audits
have a discussion about their findings.  There are guiding questions provided in the link as
well. An option is to play Water Conservation Pictionary as well, found on page 8 as a fun
activity to reinforce the concept.
3
F. Consolidation
This step is designed to encourage students to integrate and synthesize key ideas. When
students make connections and see relationships within and across lessons, it helps them to
solidify knowledge and deepen their understanding.
Explore the graphic story called Chakra the Invisible Girl: Global Goals and Sanitation
created by Stan Lee, Sharad Davarajan and Gotham Chopra, written by Ashwin Pande. This
resource helps to connect the Global Goals to their targets and to each other and then
focuses on water. After reading the comic, have students help Chakra and Mighty Girl match
the goals to their target (pages 7-10) and complete any of the other 4 activities that follow at
the end (pages 15-18).  Since students won’t be able to electronically answer the questions
you might want to print the pages for their use.
Cautionary Note: If you use Chakra’s Trash Challenge the answers may differ from the ones
indicated in the booklet as recycling programs and how to sort materials varies from
community to community.  Chakra’s Save Water Challenge suggests taking a bath instead of
a lengthy shower, however this would be a great discussion point because what you’d want
to encourage are quick showers where you can turn the tap on and off while cleansing.
Assessment Idea
Teachers will assess learning at different points throughout the inquiry using
multiple methods. The following assessment provides an alternative evaluation
method to standard quizzes and tests, that can be used after consolidation or at any point in
the lesson to check for understanding.
Create a poster to promote the importance of one of the SDGs in your own community, with
goal #6 linked to water and sanitation. The World’s Largest Lesson has a set of comic
posters to accompany each of the 17 goals. Download sample posters here for inspiration!
Take Action:
Allowing time for students to take action is an essential part of the learning
process on climate change, as it empowers students and eases their
