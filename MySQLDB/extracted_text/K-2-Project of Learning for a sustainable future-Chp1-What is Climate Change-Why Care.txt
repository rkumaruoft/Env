Chapter 1. What is Climate Change and Why Care?
In this initial inquiry, students will explore and learn about the differences between weather and
climate and understand the basic scientific principles of climate change through books, videos
and interpretations of an infographic. You may find there are more activities than a class can
complete. We have included several suggestions so that every kind of learner will find ideas,
questions and activities to explore based on their unique and diverse community characteristics
and circumstances, inspiring learning that ultimately leads to action.
Climate change is a wicked problem that is increasingly affecting human health, species
distribution, and the ability of the earth’s ecosystems to sustain our physical, economic, social,
and environmental needs. The reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) and other leading scientific organizations have become increasingly urgent. Alongside
this urgency, media reporting consistently uses a doomsday framing, which can leave viewers
with a sense of anxiety or paralysis.
In this inquiry, we suggest that educators begin by talking with children about the weather and
climate. This will help them understand the more difficult concept of climate change. We also
suggest framing learning pathways broadly by connecting to actions that students identify as
personally relevant and important to them.

Before you begin: Background Information for Educators
Canada’s climate is changing at an accelerated rate: since 1948 Canada’s annual average land
temperature has increased by 1.5°C—roughly double the global average level of warming
(Natural Resources Canada). “‘It has been clear for decades that the Earth’s climate is
changing, and the role of human influence on the climate system is undisputed,’ said [IPCC
Working Group I Co-Chair Valérie] Masson-Delmotte. Yet the new [IPCC] report also reflects
major advances in the science of attribution – understanding the role of climate change in
intensifying specific weather and climate events such as extreme heat waves and heavy rainfall
events” (Climate change widespread, rapid, and intensifying – IPCC, 2021). It is true that there
are many natural forces that play a role in determining the Earth’s climate (the Earth’s orbit
around the sun, changing ocean currents, very large volcanic eruptions and the Earth’s tilt) and
there is a great deal of evidence that the world has warmed and cooled in decades before
humans existed. However climate changes have never occurred at a pace as rapid or as drastic
as we have seen since pre-industrial time, and these changes cannot be explained by any
natural phenomena (Prairie Climate Centre). These changes are a cause for concern but, more
importantly, they are also a call to action to mitigate current and future effects.
According to the Council of Canadian Academies’ expert panel on climate change risks and
adaptation potential, Canada faces substantial risk with a likelihood of significant losses,
damages, or disruptions over a 20 year timeframe in the following areas: agriculture and food;
coastal communities; ecosystems; fisheries; forestry; geopolitical dynamics; governance and
capacity; human health and wellness; Indigenous ways of life; northern communities; physical
infrastructure; and water. If the global community is able to limit the increase in temperature to
1.5 degrees, the impacts on terrestrial, freshwater and coastal ecosystems are expected to be
lower.
Overall, Canadians are quite certain that climate change is happening. According to the national
survey Canadians’ Perspectives on Climate Change & Education (2022) conducted by Learning
for a Sustainable Future, 81% of all Canadians believe that climate change is happening.
However, the population is less certain that humans are the primary cause of the warming
climate; only 54% of respondents think that climate change is caused mostly by human activity.
When this understanding is contrasted with the widespread scientific consensus that climate
change is primarily caused by the human activity of burning fossil fuels, the urgent need for
more comprehensive education on the subject is made clear.
Another finding from the report, Canada, Climate Change and Education: Opportunities for
Public and Formal Education, found that 46% of students ages 12-18 are categorized as
“aware,” meaning they understand that human-caused climate change is happening, but they do
not believe that human efforts to stop it will be effective. This is an opportunity for schools to
help students understand that there are strategies and solutions to address climate change if all
sectors take action today.
Greenhouse Effect
According to Let’s Talk Energy, “A greenhouse is used to create a warmer growing environment
for plants that would otherwise not survive in the colder conditions outdoors. In a greenhouse,
energy from the sun passes through the glass as rays of light. This energy is absorbed by the
plants, soil and other objects in the greenhouse. Much of this absorbed energy is converted to
heat, which warms the greenhouse. The glass helps keep the greenhouse warm, by preventing
the warmed air from escaping.” (Greenhouse Effect, Let’s Talk Energy)
3
Let’s Talk Science explains that “A blanket of gases called the atmosphere surrounds the Earth.
Some of these gases are greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide being the most common
greenhouse gas). They trap heat, like the walls of a greenhouse. The greenhouse gases in our
atmosphere keep our planet warm enough for us to survive. Not enough greenhouse gases
would make the Earth too cold for humans. In fact, without greenhouse gases in our
atmosphere, Earth’s average temperature would be -18 degrees Celsius. But, too much
greenhouse gas in the atmosphere would make the Earth too warm.”
“Many greenhouse gases exist naturally. Greenhouse gases cycle through the Earth’s systems.
There are greenhouse gas sources and greenhouse gas sinks. Sources are parts of the cycle
that add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Sinks are parts of the cycle that remove
greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Recently, the concentration of greenhouse gases in
our atmosphere has gotten higher. This is because humans have dramatically increased the
amount of sources, which now outweigh the sinks.” (Climate Change 101, Let’s Talk Science)
Climate vs. Weather
The difference between weather and climate is that weather describes an event occurring at a
particular time and place (a storm moving in over a city for example), whereas climate describes
the typical weather that a location experiences based on the study of weather conditions over
long periods of time. An often heard expression is that “climate is what you expect, and weather
is what you get.” (Let's Talk Energy - Climate vs. Weather: A collaborative project with the Royal
Canadian Geographical Society and Ingenium)
To better understand the difference between climate and weather, watch this video by National
Geographic that features Neil Degrasse Tyson.
General Introduction to the inquiries in this chapter:
This chapter offers three different structured inquiries to support What is Climate Change and
Why Care? Each of the three inquiries begin with a provocation followed by the other steps of
the inquiry model and many strategies and examples are included.
These steps can be completed in their entirety as stated. However, as inquiry is an organic and
fluid process based on student input, educators may wish to adapt, modify or replace the
suggested steps to create their own inquiry with their class. We therefore suggest that teachers
review the whole chapter first in order to create a plan that will work best with their particular
group of learners.
The inquiries in this chapter are connected to curricular concepts as shown in this chart. These
curricular concepts are applicable across Canada.

Prior to Provocations: Journaling
Encourage students to record their thinking and learning throughout the learning process. The
main reason for developing a journal is for students to then be able to look back and track their
growth and progression with their connection to climate change. Students scaffold their thinking
throughout their learning journey. The entries can be a combination of personal reflections and
assigned reflections. This can be done as illustrations, concept maps or written reflections.
Inquiry 1: Understanding Weather
Students will explore and learn about weather through storybooks, sensory walks and
charades. They will acquire an understanding of how weather is the condition of the atmosphere
in one area at a particular time.
Resources:
●
Read Aloud: What Makes It Rain?
●
Visual Processing Cards (Chiji or Climer cards)
Inquiry 2: Understanding Climate
Students will explore and learn about climate by exploring the outdoors and through sorting
activity.They will acquire an understanding of how climate is the weather of a specific region
over a long period of time.
Resources:
●
Sorting Activity
●
Visual Processing Cards (Chiji or Climer Cards)
Inquiry 3: Understanding Climate Change
Students will explore and learn about the difference between weather and climate and
understand how climate change impacts our world. They will have opportunities to further learn
by watching videos to obtain solid background information on the concept of climate change.

A. Provocation
To hook student interest, introduce the provocation to initiate student thinking.
BOOK
What Makes It Rain? By Katie Daynes, illustrated by Christine Pym
This book, What Makes It Rain? is handy to have in the classroom and has six big topics with a
lot of information on each. Note suggestions for when to use each chapter in brackets below:
●
Rain (spring or when it is raining)
●
Rainbows (spring or if you see one)
●
Sun (any season/temperatures)
●
Lightning and thunder (after a storm)
●
Wind (any season)
●
Snow (winter or if it snows when it shouldn’t)
As you read through the book, discuss how people, animals and plants are feeling and affected
by weather.
*If you don't have access to this book there are other suitable titles in your school or public library that
could be used instead such as Questions and Answers About Weather by the same author
Possible Discussion Questions:
●
What would happen if it never stopped raining? Or if it didn’t rain at all?
●
What would happen if it only rains in one part of the world and not the rest?
1
●
What would happen if the sun overheats a farmer’s field?
●
What would happen if all the glaciers melted?
●
What is your favourite weather? Why?
B. Question Generation
At this point in the inquiry, we want to harness students’ curiosity and build off the
provocation that has captured their interest by generating meaningful questions to continue to
drive the learning process.
Book: What Makes It Rain?
Have the students look at the pictures in the book. Ask them to think about what questions they
would have. Start with one of the suggestions from Five Ws and an H and Developing Higher
Order Questions (Who, What, Where, When, Why and How) to see what students come up
with. Write these questions down so that students can see their questions come to life.
Extra Resource for helping students asking questions:
●
Activities for Teaching Children to Ask and Answer Questions
C. Knowledge Building
At this stage, students may be ready to engage in a group knowledge building activity. It will
encourage students to open their minds to many alternative ways of thinking about the
provocations and ideas that have been generated thus far in the inquiry process.
Engage in a class Knowledge Building Circle (outside is recommended if possible) using one
of the questions that you generated after the What Makes it Rain Book provocation or the
example below.
Possible Critical Thinking Question:
●
“What do I know about weather?” (easier)
●
“Do we need different kinds of weather? Why?” (more difficult)
D. Determining Understanding
At this stage of the inquiry, use responses to inform and guide the learning
process. They can provide insight into which concepts need clarity, what students
are already well informed about, and a general direction that students want to
pursue.
2
Based on their understanding of weather, work together with your class to fill out the “Know” and
“Want” columns of a KWL (Know-Want-Learned) Chart.
Sample KWL Chart:
TOPIC:
K – What I Already Know
W – What I Want to Know
L – What I Learned
E. Pursuing Learning
At this stage, students may begin research to pursue their questions, or the following
activity could be integrated into the process to ensure that students have an
understanding of foundational climate science. The activity listed below will enrich the
understanding of climate change.
The purpose of this activity is to make students aware of their environment using their senses.
Start with a Sensory Walk (this can be done during every season and all weather!).
Begin by having students take note of the weather on a particular day.
Example prompts:
●
If it is windy, ask them, “Can you feel the wind on various parts of your body?” or “What
direction is the wind coming from?”. Have them notice where the sun is and if they feel
the heat. Have them notice the shape of the clouds. Are they moving? Ask, “Do the
shapes of the clouds remind you of anything?”.
●
In the winter, if it is snowing, go outside to have students closely look at snowflakes.
Suggest that they look at their snowflakes and compare them with a friend. Ask if they
are the same.
**For other ideas on focused sensory walks, explore A Walking Curriculum by Gillian Judson.
Follow up: Weather Element Charades
After the walk, divide the students in groups of 4 or students can choose to perform alone.
Explain the instructions to the Charade Game.
In their groups, students pick a weather element that they observed outside during the sensory
walk, talked about in the book or that they would like to share. Instruct them to work together to
determine how to illustrate the element using their bodies and movement. Once they have
rehearsed they will present their charade to the rest of the class. The spectators are invited to
guess what they are acting out.
3
F. Consolidation
This step is designed to encourage students to integrate and synthesize key ideas.
When students make connections and see relationships within and across lessons,
this helps them to solidify knowledge and deepen understanding.
Illustrate
Have the students show their learning about climate with playdough, illustrations or movement
in groups.
AND/OR
Visual processing cards (will need to be purchased)
Using a deck of Visual Processing Cards (Chiji or Climer Cards), spread these out on the
floor or on a table. Ask students to pick a card that reflects something that they have learned
today. This is ideally facilitated in a circle.
Assessment Idea
Teachers will assess learning at different points throughout the inquiry using multiple methods.
The following assessment provides an alternative evaluation method to standard quizzes and
tests that can be used after consolidation or at any point in the lesson to check for
understanding.
Tell the students they are school artists and have been invited to explain to the school
community about weather. They have been given a space on a wall called a graffiti wall.
Divide the wall into 3 and ask students to visually represent their ideas and opinions about
weather in the first third. The other two thirds will be filled over the course of the next two
inquiries (climate and climate change).
Spend some time learning about the history of graffiti: Graffiti Facts for Kids.
Take Action:
Once the students have a good understanding of weather, climate, and climate
change, allow time for students to take action. This is an essential part of the
learning process on climate change, as it empowers students and eases their eco-anxiety.
Remind students that even when things get hard and seem so big they can always do
something by taking action. Their actions will create an impact
4
These ideas for action can be utilized at any point in the learning process, whether it's now or
after completing more guided inquiries. Please note the suggestions are consistent in each
chapter.
Ask the students what they want to do to positively impact climate change. List their ideas and
come up with a plan to put their action in place.
Ideas for Taking Action:
●
Organize an assembly to present information learned in an engaging manner
●
Plant trees
●
Collect data as a citizen scientist (e.g., bird counts)
●
Encourage families to use eco-friendly options in place of single-use items (e.g., plastic
water bottles, paper coffee cups, etc.)
●
Take a class pledge to make changes:
○
Use both sides of paper
○
Turn off the lights when leaving the room
○
Unplug things that aren’t being used
○

A. Provocation
To hook student interest, introduce the provocation idea to initiate student
thinking.
Neighbourhood Walk
Neighbourhood walks and learning can be done all year in all seasons.
Take your class outside on a Neighbourhood Walk to look for things in their neighbourhood
that depend on the weather/climate. Focus on the natural, human and built systems that are in
place to help all species that depend on the weather/climate (e.g., rain gardens, umbrellas,
energy sources, trees, etc.). Look for features that might have been altered because of the
weather/climate (e.g., erosion on the schoolyard).
While you are out in your community, think of potential community partners that are focusing on
weather systems and climate change (e.g., local conservation authorities, local businesses,
transportation companies).
Ask students to document their observations through photos or sketches.
Some other examples of features to note on the walk:
●
Bike paths
●
Parks (natural areas)
●
Cars/trucks/buses
●
Rivers/Ponds (Storm Drains)
●
Solar Panels/Wind Turbines
1
B. Question Generation
At this point in the inquiry, we want to harness students’ curiosity and build off the
provocation that has captured their interest by generating meaningful questions to
continue to drive the learning process.
Neighbourhood Walk Follow-up
1.
After the walk, display the photos or sketches that students documented throughout the
walk.
2.
Give students a chance to observe one another's drawings/notes. After observing, ask
the students to sort the pictures into groups based on themes/similarities.
3.
Ask students to explain their sorting and use the groupings to narrow down one “Big
Idea” as a class.
4.
Based on the big idea, generate a key question about climate.
C. Knowledge Building
At this stage, students may be ready to engage in a group knowledge building
activity. It will encourage students to open their minds to many alternative ways of thinking about
the provocations and ideas that have been generated thus far in the inquiry process.
Engage in a class Knowledge Building Circle (outside is recommended if possible) using one
of the questions that you generated after the Neighbourhood Walk provocation or the example
below.
Possible Umbrella Question: “What is the difference between weather and climate?”
D. Determining Understanding
Use responses to inform and guide the learning process. They can provide insight
into which concepts need clarity, what many students are already well informed
about, and a general direction that many students want to pursue.
Based on students' questions or the Umbrella Question, “What is the difference between
weather and climate?”, work together with your class to fill out the “Know” and “Want” columns
of a KWL (Know-Want-Learned) Chart.
2
Sample KWL Chart:
TOPIC:
K – What I Already Know
W – What I Want to Know
L – What I Learned
E. Pursuing Learning
At this stage, students may begin research to pursue the umbrella question, or the
following activities could be integrated into the process to ensure that students have
an understanding of foundational climate science. The activities listed below will enrich the
understanding of climate change.
Sorting Activity (Weather vs Climate)
Adapted from 15 Meaningful and Hands-On Climate Change Activities For Kids
Explain to students that you will read cards with clues and they will try to identify which is
referring to weather and which is referring to climate. Discuss as a class which card belongs in
each category.
OR
Story Writing
Create a story with the class explaining the weather on a particular day.
For example:
Today is a sunny day and there are no clouds in the sky. Everyone is wearing shorts because it
is hot. We have to wear sunscreen and hats so that we don’t get sunstroke. We are sweating so
we also need to remember to drink a lot of water to stay hydrated.
Then create a story with class explaining the climate of the region that the students live in.
For example:
In the winter it often snows and the temperature drops. It is more difficult for animals to find food
and water. Some animals hibernate and some birds begin to migrate south. At home we close
the windows and turn the heat on.

Take Action
A. Provocation
To hook student interest, introduce the provocation idea to initiate student thinking
using the following pictures.
Posters
Posters can be a great tool for education and motivating children.
*This is a very difficult concept for young children who are very literal. They have challenges
seeing the closet as climate. This video might also help the teacher and students see the
patterns Trend and variation (challenging vocabulary).
1.
Display the weather picture first. Have a discussion as to what they observe in the
picture.
2.
Display the climate section of the poster. Have a discussion as to what they observe.
3.
Read the subtitles under each title. Have a discussion about the meaning of each
subtitle and the relationship between the two.
1
4.
Look at the second poster. Talk about the pictures and the lines. Think about animals
that survive in tropical climates. Would they be able to survive here? Watch the
beginning of this video about Monarch butterflies. Unraveling the Great Butterfly
Migration Mystery Why do you think they need to take this long journey south? Are there
other animals that also need to go to a different climate?
5.
Come up with a class statement that explains the difference between weather and
climate.
Potential Questions:
●
When would you wear a toque? Or a raincoat? Or flip flops?
●
Does the weather change from day to day?
●
Can we plan ahead for the weather?
●
Do we have an idea of what kinds of weather we have in each season?
●
What would it be like if the seasons didn’t change?
●
What if we had snow in the summer or no snow in the winter?
B. Question Generation
At this point in the inquiry, we want to harness students’ curiosity and build off the
provocation that has captured their interest by generating meaningful questions to
continue to drive the learning process.
Poster Follow up
After observing and discussing the differences between weather and climate, invite students to
develop Umbrella Questions focused on the “big ideas” of climate change. Post the questions
around the poster. These questions will help ground the inquiry.
C. Knowledge Building
At this stage, students may be ready to engage in a group knowledge building
activity. It will encourage students to open their minds to many alternative ways of thinking about
the provocations and ideas that have been generated thus far in the inquiry process.
Engage in a class Knowledge Building Circle (outside is recommended if possible) using one
of the questions that you generated after the poster provocation or the example below.
Possible Umbrella Question: “How does Climate Change impact our world?”
2
D. Determining Understanding
Use responses to inform and guide the learning process. They can provide
insight into which concepts need clarity, what many students are already well
informed about, and a general direction that many students want to pursue.
Based on students' questions or the Umbrella Question: How does climate change impact
our world?, work together with your class to fill out the “Know” and “Want” columns of a KWL
(Know-Want-Learned) Chart.
Sample KWL Chart:
TOPIC:
K – What I Already Know
W – What I Want to Know
L – What I Learned
E. Pursuing Learning: Foundational Climate Science Concepts
At this stage, students may begin research to pursue their umbrella questions, or the
following activity could be integrated into the process to ensure that students have an
understanding of foundational climate science and enrich their understanding of climate change.
Video and experiments
The following climate change video helps to consolidate climate change vocabulary such as the
greenhouse effect and global warming. We encourage teachers to watch the video beforehand
and identify the teachable moments or sections applicable for your age group.
1.
Watch the video: Climate Change for Kids | A fun engaging introduction to climate
change for kids
2.
After you have watched the video, choose one, two or all three of these Climate Change
Science Experiments For Kids to help the students understand climate change.
Extension: Video
3
What is Climate Change?
The video explains how climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather
patterns, mainly caused by human activities.
F. Consolidation
This step is designed to encourage students to integrate and synthesize key ideas.
When students make connections and see relationships within and across lessons,
this helps them to solidify knowledge and deepen understanding.
Illustrate
Have the students show their learning about climate change with playdough, illustrations or
movement in groups.
AND/OR
Visual processing cards: (these would need to be purchased)
Using a deck of visual processing cards (chiji or climer cards), spread these out on the floor
or on a table. Ask students to pick a card that reflects something that they have learned today.
This is ideally facilitated in a circle.
Assessment Idea
Teachers will assess learning at different points throughout the inquiry using multiple methods.
The following assessment provides an alternative evaluation method to standard quizzes and
tests that can be used after consolidation or at any point in the lesson to check for
understanding.
Tell the students they are school artists and have been invited to explain to the school
community about climate change. They have been given a space on a wall called a graffiti
wall.
Divide the wall into 3 and ask students to visually represent their ideas and opinions about
weather in the first third. The other two thirds will be filled over the course of the next two
inquiries (climate and climate change).

Take Action:
Once the students have a good understanding of weather, climate and climate
change, allow time for students to take action. This is an essential part of the
learning process on climate change, as it empowers students and eases their
eco-anxiety. Remind students that even when things get hard and seem so big they can always
do something by taking action. Their actions will create an impact.
These ideas for action can be utilized at any point in the learning process, whether it's now or
after completing more guided inquiries. Please note the suggestions are consistent in each
chapter.
Ask the students what they want to do to positively impact climate change. List their ideas and
come up with a plan to put their action in place.
Ideas for Taking Action:
●
Organize an assembly to present information learned in an engaging manner
●
Plant trees
●
Collect data as a citizen scientist (e.g., bird counts)
●
Encourage families to use eco-friendly options in place of single-use items (e.g., plastic
water bottles, paper coffee cups, etc.)
●
Take a class pledge to make changes:
○
Use both sides of paper
○
Turn off the lights when leaving the room
○
Unplug things that aren’t being used

How could you use these great examples to come up with Action Projects with your students?
“POLLINATOR GARDEN” –Algonquin Public School- Woodstock, ON (2017) K-2
●
The main focus of the project is to inform and support young children in developing their
understanding of insect life cycles and the interconnectedness of the beautiful creatures
to our lives and to begin to foster an appreciation for nature and how they can have a
direct impact on their local and national environment. They learned about the decline in
the Monarch Butterfly populations during a professional development workshop and
decided to plant a pollinator garden. See their project here.
