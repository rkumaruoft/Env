Introduction: Extreme weather events caused by climate change pose a risk to mental health. Illustrating this
reality, this study estimates the impact of the 2021 Western North American heat dome (June 25th, 2021 −
July 1st, 2021) on climate change anxiety among British Columbians.
Methods: We conducted an online survey of British Columbians, aged ≥16. Participants were recruited using
paid advertisements on social media. Data were collected pre- and post- heat dome between May 12th, 2021
−June 21st, 2021 (n = 439), and July 15th, 2021 −July 18th, 2021 (n = 420), respectively. A multivariable
inverse Gaussian regression model tested differences in Climate Change Anxiety Scale (CCAS) scores pre- and
post- heat dome. Potential confounders measured included age, gender, ethnicity, education, income, and
political orientation. CCAS reliability was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha.
Results: Most participants indicated that they were much (40.1%) or somewhat (18.4%) more worried about
climate change due to the heat dome. Mean CCAS scores increased from 1.66 (standard deviation [SD]= 0.80)
to 1.87 (SD = 0.87) pre- and post- heat dome, respectively. In multivariable modeling, this effect was signiﬁ-
cant after controlling for potential confounders (Estimate = 0.057, standard error = 0.148, p < 0.001). The
CCAS reliability was high (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.94).
Discussion: Our results found that British Columbians had signiﬁcantly higher climate change anxiety follow-
ing the 2021 Western North American heat dome. Ongoing monitoring of climate change anxiety is needed
to understand the impact of individual and compounding climate change-related weather events over time.

1. Introduction
Climate change poses an urgent public health threat, in part due to
its role in increasing the frequency, duration, and intensity of extreme
weather events such as heat waves, ﬂoods, and droughts [1]. Scientists
around the world have highlighted that high temperature extremes
have worsened globally, and that average global temperatures are pro-
jected to rise at least 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels by 2040, posing
substantial risks to human health [2]. Extreme weather events caused
by temperature changes, in addition to direct impacts on morbidity
and mortality, can signiﬁcantly disrupt interactions between socio-
environmental factors and human health, leading to indirect health
impacts due to consequent economic, food, housing, and job insecurity,
or forced displacement [1]. Heat waves, described as temperatures
above long-term averages where warm air masses are stagnant and
high minimum temperatures occur successively over nights [3], can
have multifaceted implications for public health, including elevated
mortality [4], or exacerbation of pre-existing comorbidities such as car-
dio-respiratory conditions [5]. Therefore, exposure to high tempera-
tures

community-based healthcare demands, thus creating a signiﬁcant bur-
den on health systems [6].
While the impact of intense heat on physical health is well docu-
mented, the mental health repercussions from these events have
received less attention, despite evidence showing that environmental
hazards and the related mortality and morbidity from such hazards
elevate the risk of certain mental health disorders [7,8]. Moreover,
there is growing evidence that mental illness is one of the greatest
health burdens worldwide [9]. Extreme weather events have been
associated with an increase in various mental health problems such as
anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder [10,11]. Anxiety,
described as negative emotional state that causes physical symptoms
and apprehension about the future [12], is seen as a particularly rele-
vant psychological response to climate change, where it is referred to
as climate change anxiety [13]. Heat waves speciﬁcally can cause stress
that has been associated with mood and anxiety disorders [14] and ele-
vated mortality in individuals with pre-existing mental illness [15].
The increase of climate-related mental health concerns has drawn
attention to the lack of validated instruments that can be used to accu-
rately assess and quantify this population health concern. However,
recent efforts within this ﬁeld have led to the development of a Climate
Change Anxiety Scale (CCAS) by Clayton and Karazsia (2020) [16]. CCAS
was developed in response to increasing concerns related to negative
emotional responses to climate change. Considering their multifaceted
impacts, it is reasonable to expect that extreme climate events may
lead to certain levels of emotional distress (e.g., ‘normal reactions to
abnormal situations’) [3]. Nonetheless, there is a risk of pathologizing
such otherwise reasonable responses when conducting research
assessing mental health in climate change contexts [13]. In contrast, as
climate change risks increase, worries about the effects of climate
change may lead to elevated levels of anxiety causing cognitive, emo-
tional and functional impairment [13,16]. As such, it is important to dif-
ferentiate between ‘adequate’ emotional responses and ‘extreme’
psychosocial reactions in this context [16]. By integrating such consid-
erations, the CCAS is an innovative tool aiming to identify signiﬁcant
levels of climate change anxiety. Additionally, CCAS is a validated tool
that can be used to track population-level changes to climate change
anxiety and enhance efforts advocating for mental health support and
services during and following climate disasters.
The CCAS is a 22-item scale that measures emotional responses to
climate change among adults and includes correlated sub-scales
assessing cognitive and emotional impairment, functional impairment,
and behavioural engagement related to climate change events.
The unprecedented heat wave that took place in Western North
America further demonstrates the implications of these concerns.
Between June 25th and July 1st, 2021, most regions in the Paciﬁc
Northwest experienced record-breaking temperatures reaching up to
49.6 °C [17]. The intense and long-lasting heat contributed to the for-
mation of a heat dome, described as large areas of scorching heat
being trapped in the atmosphere [18]. In British Columbia (BC) alone,
almost 750 excess deaths were considered directly attributable to the
heat dome [19]. The event marked the hottest June on record in
Western North America, highlighting crucial gaps in the current
health system and climate adaptation strategies, especially in the
realm of mental health concerns. Most signiﬁcantly, at present, there
are no known indicators describing potential climate change impacts
on mental health in Canada. Our study aims to address this gap and
assess the effect of the 2021 heat dome on climate change anxiety
levels among British Columbians using the CCAS scale.
2. Methods
2.1. Study design and data collection
We conducted a quasi-experimental study analyzing the impact of
the 2021 heat dome in relation to changes in CCAS scores among
adults in BC. Data were collected as part of a serial cross-sectional
online survey with independent samples using the Survey Monkey
platform [20]. Participants were recruited using paid advertisements
on Facebook and Instagram and incentivised to respond using a prize
draw for a $200 CAD VISA Gift Card. We used a targeted sampling
strategy, with advertisements being targeted to individuals aged
≥16 years living in BC. A total of $6147.87 CAD was spent on adver-
tisements, resulting in 880,047 impressions among 408,982 people.
These impressions resulted in 11,735 clicks from 9916 people. The
average cost per click was $0.52 CAD.
We determined the sample size for this study by performing
power analyses informed by Clayton and Karazsia (2020) [16], who
originally tested the distribution of CCAS scores using a sample of
297 respondents recruited in the US using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk
platform. In their analyses of these responses, cognitive impairment
subscale scores had a mean score of 1.75 with a standard deviation
(SD) of 0.97 and functional impairment subscale scores had a mean
score of 2.09 and an SD of 1.08.
This study was powered to detect a mean difference of 0.20 on
functional impairment subscale scores, as it had the larger SD of the
two CCAS subscales. Setting alpha at 0.05 and power at 0.80, our
power analyses indicated a required sample size of 458 responses
per wave. We assumed a missing data rate of 37%, 10% greater than
Clayton and Karazsia’s, since we assumed our online sampling
method would recruit less experienced survey takers than Amazon’s
Mechanical Turk platform. As such, our target recruitment rate was
726 participants for each wave of the survey.
The ﬁrst wave of data collection for our ﬁrst sample (n = 439) was
conducted prior to the heat dome (May 12th, 2021- June 21st, 2021)
as part of a research initiative aiming to descriptively explore the cur-
rent levels and patterns of climate change anxiety among the general
adult population in BC. The second wave of data collection (n = 420)
for a distinct second sample was conducted between July 15th, 2021,
and July 18th, 2021. The decision to pursue a second wave of data col-
lection was inﬂuenced by the occurrence of the heat dome and the
opportunity provided by this event to conduct more nuanced analy-
ses and was not initially anticipated. Recruitment took longer for the
ﬁrst wave due to advertising spending limits imposed by Facebook
on new accounts. As the spending limits were gradually increased,
wave 2 of the survey was completed faster.
2.2. Variables of interest
The variables of interest for our bivariable analysis were survey
items related to changes in climate related concerns pre- and post-
heat dome. Such items included participants’ evaluation of whether
they were impacted by the heat dome (not impacted at all, impacted
only a little, somewhat impacted, impacted to a great extent), partici-
pants’ level of worry about climate change after the heat dome
(much less worried, somewhat less worried, worry not changed,
somewhat more worried, much more worried), whether participants
were concerned about climate change impacting the industry they
are working in (no, yes), or participants’ perception of potential risks
that the area where they live will be devastated by climate change
(don’t know/unsure, somewhat likely, somewhat unlikely, very
unlikely).
The outcome variable for our multivariable analysis was the mea-
sure of climate change anxiety among British Columbians as deter-
mined by the calculated CCAS scores, including the functional
subscale, cognitive subscale, behavioural subscale, and overall CCAS
scores, pre- and post- the 2021 heat dome. Of the total 22 items
included in the scale, indicators 1−13 measure the overall climate
change anxiety scale, as follows: (1) Items 1−8 assess cognitive-emo-
tional impairment (i.e., CCAS Cognitive Subscale) with questions such
as “I ﬁnd myself crying because of climate change”; and (2) Items 9
−13 measure functional impairment (i.e., CCAS Functional Subscale)

with indicators like “My concerns about climate change undermine
my ability to work on my potential”. In addition, items 17−22 sepa-
rately measure behavioural engagement in climate-related events
(i.e., CCAS Behavioural Engagement Subscale) with questions such as
“I feel guilty if I waste energy”) [16].
The exposure variable was whether observations were made prior
to or after the heat dome (i.e., wave 1 and wave 2 of data collection,
respectively).
We selected potential confounders based on empirical knowledge
of factors that are likely associated with climate change anxiety and
climate-related extreme weather events such as heat waves. Poten-
tial confounders included in the multivariable inverse Gaussian
regression analysis included age (<24, 25−44, 45−64, 65+ years),
gender (man, woman, non-binary), ethnicity (white, Indigenous, Chi-
nese, South Asian, other), education (bachelor’s degree, graduate
training, advanced training below bachelors, high school diploma, or
less), income (ten level variable starting from $10,000 to $19,999 to
$100,000 and over), and political orientation (extremely liberal, mod-
erately liberal, slightly liberal, neither liberal nor conservative,
slightly conservative, moderately conservative, and extremely con-
servative).
2.3. Data analysis
All statistical analyses were completed in R (version 4.0.3) [21].
Observations with missing data on our selected outcome or explana-
tory factor were excluded and a complete case analysis was per-
formed. Descriptive statistics were calculated and stratiﬁed by wave
of data collection. Chi-square tests assessed bivariable differences
between wave 1 and wave 2 CCAS scores. A multivariable inverse
Gaussian regression model tested differences in CCAS scores, with
the wave of data collection as the primary explanatory variable,
adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, education, income, and political
orientation. We used inverse Gaussian modeling due to the observa-
tion that the outcome variable (i.e., CCAS scores) was right skewed
and the linear regression models were heteroskedastic. In sensitivity
analyses, we built multivariable models with Poisson and Linear
regression −ﬁnding that the overall conclusions of our paper were
not sensitive to model building approach beyond the magnitude of
the effect size (Range: b = 0.05 using inverse Gaussian [p < 0.001],
0.10 using Poisson regression [p < 0.001], and 0.18 using Linear
regression [p < 0.048]). Model ﬁt was tested using standard visual
diagnostic plots.
2.4. Ethics
Ethics approval for this study, including the use of the survey for
research and an amendment to use the survey for a second wave of
data collection, was received from the Research Ethics Board (REB) at
Simon Fraser University (SFU) (REB#: 30000309). The amendment
included minor modiﬁcations to the survey and received ethical
approval by SFU REB prior to the start of the second wave of data col-
lection.
3. Results
The survey was initiated by 1551 participants (N1 = 741, N2 = 810).
We excluded 16 participants who did not agree to the consent form
terms and 7 participants who did not live in BC. Among wave 2 par-
ticipants, 9 had taken the survey during wave 1 and 36 were unsure
if they had taken a survey. These individuals were excluded to ensure
independence of observations. This resulted in a ﬁnal sample size of
1438. For these analyses, we conducted a complete case analysis by
omitting participants with missing data across any of the variables
included in our ﬁnal multivariable model. This resulted in a ﬁnal ana-
lytic sample size of 859 (N1 = 439, N2 = 420).
Table 1 shows the socio-demographic characteristics of our popu-
lation sample. The sample included approximately equal numbers of
men and women in the pre- and post- heat dome samples (men: N
[%]: 215 [49%] vs 217 [51.7%], women: N [%]: 201 [45.8%] vs 192
[45.7%], pre- and post- heat dome, respectively), and a small number
of non-binary individuals (N [%]: 23 (5.2%) vs 11 [2.6%]). Most partici-
pants were white (82% vs 89% pre- and post- heat dome, respec-
tively), and in the 25−64-year-old age category (69.3% vs 68.8%).
Table 2 highlights the changes in climate related concerns pre-
and post- heat dome. Overall, there was a signiﬁcant increase in the
participants’ overall CCAS score pre-and post- heat dome (mean [SD],
1.66 [0.80] vs 1.87 [0.87], p < 0.001), as well as in their CCAS Cogni-
tive Subscale scores (mean [SD]: 1.65 [0.80] vs 1.84 [0.86], p = 0.001),
and CCAS Functional Subscale Scores (mean [SD]: 1.68 [0.87] vs 1.92
[0.98], p < 0.001). There was no signiﬁcant increase in the scores for
the CCAS Behaviour Engagement Subscale (mean [SD]: 3.59 [0.83] vs
3.60 [0.85], p = 0.931). CCAS reliability was high for the overall CCAS
scale, as well as the CCAS Cognitive and CCAS Functional Subscales
(Cronbach’s alphas = 0.94, 0.92 and 0.89, respectively).
Additionally, there was a signiﬁcant increase in participants’ con-
cern that the industry they are working in will be affected by climate
change (p < 0.05), and that the area where they live will be devas-
tated by climate change events such as ﬂoods or forest ﬁres

(p < 0.001). Most participants reported that they were somewhat
(40.8%) as well as greatly (17.4%) impacted by the heat dome. Simi-
larly, most participants reported that they were much (40.1%) or
somewhat more (18.4%) worried about climate change after the heat
event.
Table 3 outlines the inverse Gaussian multivariable model results,
which suggest that the mental health impact of the heat dome, mea-
sured by changes in CCAS scores pre- and post- heat dome, was sta-
tistically signiﬁcant after controlling for potential confounders
(Estimate = 0.057, standard error = 0.148, p < 0.001).
4. Discussion
The current study found that the 2021 Western North American
heat dome was associated with a signiﬁcant increase in climate
change anxiety and climate-related concerns among British Colum-
bians.
To our knowledge, this study is the ﬁrst to use a natural experi-
ment design to describe the impact of climate-induced extreme heat
on mental health and anxiety levels among the general public in BC.
Our study is also the ﬁrst to use a validated climate change anxiety
measurement tool to explore impacts of extreme heat on mental
health, therefore providing uniquely novel insights that can forward
emerging research in this ﬁeld. Other studies exploring the effect of
heat on population health in Canada primarily focus on mortality or
physical health outcomes. For example, one study showed that older
individuals aged 45 to 64 years experienced increased odds of mor-
tality during the 2009 heat wave in Vancouver [22]. Globally, our
study results are largely consistent with other research exploring cli-
mate-related mental health impacts. A recent systematic literature
review identiﬁed 35 studies that suggest signiﬁcant associations
between heat and various mental health outcomes [23]. Notably,
there is growing literature describing concepts of ecological anxiety,
which are used to highlight the increasing prevalence of distress and
worries about climate change and its effects [24]. Nonetheless, this
research ﬁeld remains largely underexplored in Canada. Our ﬁndings
highlight the immediate reality of heat-dome-related anxiety as a
signiﬁcant public health concern in BC and emphasize the need for
additional studies that can inform climate change adaptation strate-
gies that incorporate mental health considerations. Our results can
be used to complement other national or global studies and inform
larger, more comprehensive research efforts, such as developing
mental health monitoring systems to inform relevant decision mak-
ing and policy development. Including mental health indicators in
health policy efforts is crucial to avoid potential socioeconomic losses
caused by climate change-related mental health challenges.
4.1. Strengths and limitations
The most signiﬁcant strength of our study was the timeline of the
data collection as part of our study design (i.e., pre- and post- heat

start of the heat dome, and the wave 2 data collection commenced
only two weeks after the heat dome ended. This provided an oppor-
tunity to collect real-life and real-time data at two relevant time
points that are highly relevant to the environmental phenomenon of
interest (i.e., heat dome), therefore adding to the limited evidence
examining heat-related health outcomes in a quasi-experimental set-
ting [25]. While the serial cross-sectional methodology allowed us to
evaluate climate change anxiety levels immediately before and after
the heat dome, our results can inform studies exploring long-term
effects of climate-related extreme weather events on mental health.
Other signiﬁcant strengths include the signiﬁcant statistical power of
our study, and the novel use of a validated climate anxiety scale to
generate climate-related insights relevant to BC. While the CCAS
scale was validated in a US setting, our study provides validity evi-
dence for the use of the CCAS in a Canadian setting.
The opportune timing of our data collection increases the ecologi-
cal validity of the study, while reducing recall bias. Nonetheless, as
with most self-reported data, there is a possibility that some partici-
pants’ answers might not accurately reﬂect their behavior or situa-
tion, therefore increasing response bias. This is particularly relevant
in the context of our survey due to its focus on mental health and cli-
mate change, which raises the potential for subjective measurements
of wellbeing [26], as well as the risk of social desirability bias, previ-
ously highlighted as a potential concern in environmental psychology
research [27]. Additionally, the survey was randomly advertised and
distributed on social media channels—and was not a paid by survey
platform where the population completing the surveys differs from
the general population. The use of social media for data collection
was a cost-effective opportunity to reach an adequate sample size,
which is consistent with literature highlighting the advantages of
recruiting study participants via social media [28]. Notably, given
that we only addressed the occurrence of the 2021 heat wave in BC,
our results have reduced external validity and should be interpreted
with caution in wider settings. Moreover, while the random selection
of participants reduced the risk for sampling bias in our study, our
survey was only completed by individuals with access to social
media. Additionally, even though our advertisements included pho-
tographs of ethnically diverse individuals, the survey largely failed to
attract participants from diverse backgrounds, and our two samples
included predominantly white individuals. This limits generalizabil-
ity of the ﬁndings. Having a predominantly white sample also did not
allow for an intersectional examination of the data. While our out-
come measures a comprehensive range of elements related to climate
change anxiety, future research should explore how climate-related
events may differentially impact populations at risk of being dispro-
portionally affected by climate change anxiety, such as Indigenous
communities [29,30]. As such, integrating considerations relevant to
social determinants of health is needed to inform inclusive and equi-
table public health responses. In addition, our study can be used to
inform more diversity-focused surveys and frames of reference for
climate change impacts based on social and structural determinants
of health, and emphasizes the need for further disaggregated data
and analysis to forward this ﬁeld.
4.2. Conclusion
The impacts of climate-related extreme weather events such as
heat waves are likely to continue to intensify in the following decade.
Our study results highlight that British Columbians were negatively
impacted by the 2021 Western North American heat dome (June
25th, 2021 −July 1st, 2021), which was associated with increased cli-
mate change anxiety in this region. This draws attention to climate
change anxiety as an emerging and pressing public health concern
across the province. As such, our ﬁndings indicate a compelling
urgency to incorporate mental health indicators into future decision-
making policies. Our results also indicate a strong need for capacity
building aiming to increase psychosocial resilience as a crucial com-
ponent of climate adaptation and mitigation strategies. While our
study provides valuable insights into the potential threats posed by
climate change-related extreme weather events, further research is
urgently needed to explore potential monitoring, surveillance, and
interventional solutions focused on addressing climate change anxi-
ety across Canada.
