Abstract
Individual behavior change offers a large potential to curb greenhouse gas emissions. However, messaging promoting individual be-
havior change has been criticized as a strategy for addressing climate change due to its potential to diminish climate policy support.
In a pre-registered study with a representative sample of American adults (n ¼ 1069), we found that messages recommending the
adoption of high-impact individual climate behaviors, such as ﬂying less, eating less meat and reducing food waste, and highlighting
their large impact do not affect support for a carbon tax. In an exploratory analysis, we found that this messaging results in a higher
intention to adopt several climate behaviors. We recommend that interventions that advocate for individual climate action be best
understood as complements, rather than undermining substitutes, to broad carbon regulatory policy.

INTRODUCTION
The Earth is facing adverse and unprecedented risks from
human-caused climate change, which are predicted to dispropor-
tionately harm the world’s most disadvantaged communities
[1, 2]. Thankfully, many solutions to mitigate climate change al-
ready exist [3, 4]. Yet, after technological improvements, increas-
ing affordability of these solutions, and strong consensus on the
threat of rising emissions, we are still far from a carbon-neutral
future. The Global Warming of 1.5C (SR15) report suggests that
programs that encourage people to adopt behaviors that reduce
their carbon footprint present a clear complement to proposed
policy solutions [5]. For example, it is estimated that the UK’s
path to Net Zero will be unlikely without societal and behavioral
changes [6]. The rising popularity of behavioral solutions presents
policymakers and behavior change program designers with new
strategies that they can use to complement traditional climate
regulation [7]. These solutions could inform the design of inter-
ventions that change what we eat, how we travel, what energy
we use and what we do with waste, all of which have been shown
to have a high impact on carbon emissions when scaled up to the
population level [8].
Individual behavior change, however, has received skepticism
from academics, climate scientists and the public due to its po-
tential to diminish climate policy support [9–11]. The critics argue
that prominently discussing behavior change can make it appear
as a substitute for regulatory policy change, therefore undermin-
ing support for larger systemic policy efforts.
In the context of climate emergency, it is crucial for policy-
makers and program designers to know which strategies in their
toolkit should be deployed to combat climate change. This
includes understanding whether programs that rely on messag-
ing to promote high-impact individual behavior change risk
undermining policy support. The existing literature assessing
such effects is mixed and largely indirect. Recent work has ar-
gued that messages recommending individual behaviors reduce
willingness to support political candidates with a pro-climate
agenda [9]. Similarly, messages that primed people of their past
pro-environmental behaviors (PEBs) and included recommended
individual actions to reduce energy consumption were found to
reduce support for climate change policy [12]. Research in the re-
lated domain of policymaker decision-making found that policy
support for a carbon tax is undermined when policymakers con-
sider less intrusive ‘nudge’-based policies to encourage individual
behavior change [13]. However, studies investigating the effect of
inducting individuals to adopt PEBs have shown no effect on cli-
mate policy support [14–16]. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis
reveals no aggregate effect of the adoption of pro-environmental
individual behavior on climate policy support [17].
To inform whether policymakers and program designers
should include behavioral solutions which highlight the impact
of individual action, we posed the following research question:

‘Do messages that recommend the adoption of individual behav-
iors to address climate change affect individuals’ support for a
carbon tax?’ As a secondary investigation, we also aimed to as-
sess whether the messages affect the intention to adopt these
behaviors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
In March 2020, we collected responses from 1085 US participants
via the Prolific.co platform. The sample was stratified by age, sex
and ethnicity, based on quotas designed to be representative of
the US Census adults. Past research with respondents from simi-
lar platforms has found that resulting demographic and empiri-
cal findings track well with US national probability sample
benchmarks
[18]. Per our
pre-registration,
we excluded 16
respondents from analyses due to incomplete survey responses
leaving a final sample of 1069 respondents. The demographic
composition of respondents is available in Supplementary Tables
S2 and S3. Before beginning, all participants provided consent to
participate.

Procedure
We randomly assigned participants to either the individual be-
havior messaging condition or a neutral control. To ensure that
the impact of individual behavior on climate was not confounded
with the saliency of the consequences of climate change, all par-
ticipants
were
first
shown
a
paragraph
describing
the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change finding that global
temperatures are likely to rise in the future [1]. In the experimen-
tal condition, we presented participants with a message describ-
ing seven high-impact individual climate-mitigating behaviors
that previous research has highlighted as highly impactful to
adopt—reduce the amount of meat in your diet, switch to a green
energy provider, install solar panels, reduce food waste at home,
make an electric vehicle (EV) your next car purchase, reduce the
amount you fly by at least one flight a year and purchase carbon
offsets—that Americans could adopt to reduce their carbon emis-
sions [8]. To highlight the impact of these behaviors, we informed
participants that if each behavior was adopted by 10% of
Americans, the USA would be back on track to meet its global
commitments to reduce carbon emissions [8]. Participants in the
control condition were not shown the message about the seven
behaviors.
Next, all participants stated their support for a carbon tax
(‘Impose a carbon tax on companies and products based on how
much emissions they create’, adapted from Ref. [13]). Their re-
sponse (1 ¼ Yes or 0 ¼ No) formed our first dependent variable. To
reduce possible demand effects, the carbon tax policy question
was embedded in a matrix with a set of eight other questions fo-
cused on other government policies unrelated to climate (e.g.
‘Introduce government-mandated paid maternity leave’) [19].
For six of the seven behaviors, we asked participants ‘If you
had to guess, what is the percent chance you will take each of the
actions in the next 12 months?’. Due to the infrequency of pur-
chasing a vehicle in the USA, intention to purchase an EV was
measured through the following item: ‘If you had to guess, what
is the percent chance you will make an EV your next car pur-
chase?’. Participants responded to all behavioral intention meas-
ures
on
a
100-pt
slider
scale
(0 ¼ No
chance
at
all
to
100 ¼ Certain). To create a single behavioral intention index
variable representing a respondent’s overall propensity to take
individual action, we standardized each behavioral intention var-
iable (subtracted the mean, divided by the standard deviation),
and then took the average of all seven values for every respon-
dent. This individual-level index formed our second dependent
variable.
For exploratory reasons, we collected several demographic
measures, such as gender, age, ethnicity, education, political
viewpoint and household income.
Analytic strategy
To evaluate whether our messaging affected policy support and
whether the difference between conditions was equivalent, we
conducted a combination of pre-registered traditional null hy-
pothesis significance tests (NHSTs) and equivalence tests. To test
for this equivalence, we relied on two one-sided tests (TOST) pro-
cedure that allows us to specify a lower (DL) and upper bound
(DU) based on the smallest effect size of interest. The results fall-
ing within the bounds are deemed equivalent to the absence of a
meaningful effect [20].
In the TOST procedure, the null hypothesis is the presence of
a true effect of DL or DU. The alternative hypothesis is that the ef-
fect is smaller than the smallest effect size of interest and it falls
within the equivalence bounds. The observed effect is compared
against DL and DU in TOSTs, one testing if the effect is larger than
the lower bound of the equivalence range and one testing
whether the effect is smaller than the upper bound of the equiva-
lence range. When both these one-sided tests can be statistically
rejected, we can conclude that the observed effect falls within
the equivalence bounds and is close enough to zero to be practi-
cally equivalent. Previous research found that messaging on the
effect of a nudge policy reduced policy support for a carbon tax
by 18% [13]. Based on this finding, we established the smallest ef-
fect size of interest of 10% change in carbon tax support both for
traditional
NHST
of
difference
as
well
as
the
TOST
of
equivalence.
Figure 1: Exposure to the message emphasizing the large climate-
mitigating impact of individual behaviors does not affect support for the
carbon tax. Proportion difference, P ¼ 0.002 (black square), plotted with
90% TOST conﬁdence intervals (CIs) (thick horizontal lines) and 95%
NHST CIs (thin horizontal lines) with equivalence bounds DL ¼ 0.1 and
DU ¼ 0.1 for a test result that is statistically equivalent and not
statistically different from zero. A 90% TOST CI (1  2a) is used instead of
a 95% CI (1  a) because TOSTs (each with an a of 5%) are performed.

To test our secondary hypothesis of whether exposure to mes-
saging affects individuals’ intention to adopt high-impact climate
behaviors, we followed the same pre-registered analytical proce-
dure of testing for both difference and equivalence, evaluating
whether the differences in the mean reported intention to adopt
behaviors were statistically equivalent. Based on literature stand-
ards for a small effect, we set d ¼ 0.2 as our smallest effect size of
interest [21]. Therefore, the equivalence range goes from d ¼ 0.2
to d ¼ 0.2.
RESULTS
Following the analytic procedure of testing for both difference
and equivalence, we find no evidence that messaging on the im-
portance of individual action reduces support for a carbon tax.
Specifically, those in the individual behavior condition supported
a carbon tax 0.2% less than those in the control condition, which
is statistically equivalent (z ¼ 4.169, P < 0.001) and not statistically
different (z ¼ 0.0938, P ¼ 0.925) from zero.
To test our secondary hypothesis of whether messaging
affects
individuals’
intention
to
adopt
high-impact
climate
behaviors, we followed the same analytic procedure of testing for
both difference and equivalence. We find the differences in the
mean intention to adopt behaviors (d ¼ 0.127), while small, are
statistically
distinguishable
from
zero
(t(1060.29)
¼
2.081,
P ¼ 0.0377) and not statistically equivalent (t(1060.29) ¼ 1.186,
P ¼ 0.118). That is, the messaging statistically significantly in-
creased the average intention to adopt high-impact climate
behaviors. Supplementary Fig. S1 is the graph of the observed
mean difference in mean intention to adopt the behaviors. To
evaluate the degree to which the messaging affected intention to
adopt each behavior highlighted in the messaging, we conducted
an exploratory analysis of the effect of the messaging on each be-
havior (Fig. 2).
We found that those exposed to the messaging on the impact
of adopting individual behaviors reported statistically signifi-
cantly higher intention to eat less meat, fly less and reduce food
waste. We found no statistically significant effect of messaging
on the intention to adopt the remaining four behaviors. We hy-
pothesize that this may be due to the three behaviors which
show a significant change all lacking a monetary cost and there-
fore being perceived as easier to adopt, whereas those that
showed non-significant effects all have monetary costs.
For exploratory reasons, we constructed a linear regression
model regressing support for a carbon tax on demographic varia-
bles, political viewpoint and the experimental condition. Political
viewpoint was the greatest unique predictor of the support for a
carbon tax (Supplementary Table S1). Other predictors, including
condition assignment, showed largely insignificant or small
effects.
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS
Previous discourse has expressed concern that supporting indi-
vidual actions for the environment can diminish support for cli-
mate policy. As a result, programs that recommend individual
behavior change have been discouraged in favor of regulatory
policy [9–11]. However, despite growing public concern about cli-
mate change in the USA, policies that aim at lowering green-
house gas emissions and helping to mitigate climate change,
such as a carbon tax, face political gridlock [22]. In part due to
these political challenges, these much-needed regulatory policies
can be difficult to implement in the near term. Complementary
to regulatory initiatives, behavioral policy solutions to climate
change offer high mitigation potential as well as the opportunity
to create demand for greater technological and regulatory shifts
while being more politically palatable in the near term. In addi-
tion, behavioral solutions can offer positive impacts on a range of
challenges at lower costs than those associated with traditional

economic policies [23]. For example, the Department of Energy
supported Solarize campaigns apply social influences to drive the
adoption of household solar with a direct program cost of $21 per
ton of CO2 reduced, a cost below the social cost of emissions [24,
25]. However, due to the critical need for comprehensive policy
reform, programs encouraging individual action may not be
worth pursuing if they undermine broader support for regulatory
approaches like a carbon tax. Based on our results, policymakers
and program designers working to address climate change should
view behavioral solutions and messages as potential comple-
ments driving shifts in large-scale climate policy.
The study design results in several limitations for its interpre-
tation. The study evaluates stated carbon tax support and inten-
tion to adopt the behaviors. Actual adoption and voting behavior
can
diverge
from
expressed
intentions
and
preferences.
Furthermore, it is possible that the carbon tax was framed too
broadly (‘carbon tax on companies and products. . .’) and per-
ceived as insular to the individual behaviors in the messaging.
Future work may extend our findings by measuring the effect of
messaging on support for behavior-specific policies, such as fede-
ral tax credits for EVs or taxes that are costly to the individual.
