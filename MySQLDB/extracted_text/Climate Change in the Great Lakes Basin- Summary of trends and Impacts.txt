Executive Summary 
Under the 2012 Canada-United States Great Lakes Water Quality 
Agreement (GLWQA), the Climate Change Impacts Annex Subcommittee 
coordinates efforts to identify, quantify, understand, and predict climate 
change impacts on the waters of the Great Lakes, and shares information 
that Great Lakes resource managers need to proactively address these 
impacts. The purpose of this report is to characterize historical and future 
climate trends within the Great Lakes basin, and to summarize the impacts 
that are already being felt by communities across the basin. This report 
was created for the Climate Change Impacts Annex Subcommittee and is 
intended to further the understanding of climate change impacts in the 
Great Lakes basin. 
This report translates technical climate and hydrological data into 
practical information for decision-makers based on climate and water 
level projections, developed by Environment and Climate Change Canada 
(ECCC) and ice cover projections developed by the Nelson Institute Center 
for Climatic Research (CCR), respectively. Observed historical data was 
retrieved from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s 
(NOAA) Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL). This 
report also seeks to enhance understanding of climate change impacts 
based on a review of peer-reviewed and grey literature to help inform 
adaptation and resilience-building efforts across the region. 
By the end of the century, significant changes in over-land air temperature, 
over-lake precipitation, water levels, and ice cover are anticipated across 
the Great Lakes under a moderate (RCP 4.5) and high-emissions (RCP 8.5) 
scenarios. Similar climate and hydrological trends were found for all lakes, 
though each lake may experience these changes differently.
Over-land air temperatures are expected to increase significantly across 
the basin compared to 1961-2000. The greatest temperature increases are 
projected for the fall and winter seasons. Changes in average over-land air 
temperatures are expected to bring warmer winters, more extreme heat, 
a longer growing season, heavier precipitation, and less ice cover. The greatest
increases in over-land air temperatures are expected for lakes Superior 
and Michigan-Huron.
Over-lake precipitation is anticipated to increase in all seasons and over 
the year under both climate scenarios for all lakes, although the increase 
is generally less in the summer season. Changes in seasonal over-lake 
precipitation is anticipated to vary by lake and climate scenario. With 
warmer winters, snowfall is expected to decrease on average, with more 
precipitation falling as rain instead of snow. The greatest increases in 
over-lake precipitation are expected for lakes Superior and Ontario. 
Lake levels are anticipated to increase in variability as the climate changes, 
with more extreme high and extreme low values becoming possible with 
greater changes in global average temperatures. Lake level projections 
indicate significant deviations from lake-specific, long-term averages 
(1918-2019) across the basin with a slight upward trend on all lakes 
apparent in the latter half of the century. Lake Michigan-Huron is expected 
to experience the greatest variation in lake levels and has historically 
been the most variable among the Great Lakes (Wuebbles et al. 2019). 
Lakes Erie, St. Clair, and Ontario are also expected to see significant 
variations in lake levels.
Ice cover is expected to decline across all lakes, especially in the months 
of February and March under the high-emissions scenario. In the future, 
there may be more years with little to no ice cover and shorter ice seasons 
during winter and spring. Average ice cover over lakes Superior and Erie 
show the greatest projected declines, followed by lake Huron. Ice growth 
may also peak earlier for deeper lakes such as lakes Superior and Huron. 
Changes to the climate over the Great Lakes and its water levels and ice 
cover can cause wide-ranging environmental, social, and economic impacts 
on local communities. These impacts are cumulative, compounding, and 
interactive, which in turn can lead to even more severe consequences. 
The following are key climate change risks identified for the Great Lakes 
basin based on a review of the literature:
•	 More frequent extreme high and low water levels
•	 Increase in flooding and erosion
•	 More variable and intense precipitation
•	 Increase in storm-induced runoff carrying nutrients and contaminants		
into the lakes
•	 Increase in combined sewer overflows
•	 Increase in extreme weather events
•	 More toxic and non-toxic algal blooms, low-oxygen conditions,
	
and dead zones
•	 Increased stress on drinking water infrastructure
•	 Increase in unsafe ice conditions for travel and recreation
•	 Increase in the resuspension of contaminated sediments that can
	
accumulate up the aquatic food chain
•	 Increase in invasive species, pests, and diseases
•	 Potential for reduced or interruptions to shipping and hydropower
	
generation
•	 Loss of cold/coolwater fish species habitat
•	 Loss of wildlife habitat (e.g. breeding, spawning, and nursery),
	
including essential habitats such as coastal wetlands
•	 Loss of Indigenous traditional ways of life
•	 Loss of sense of place and identity
•	 Loss of livelihoods and local economic drivers
This list is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather to highlight important 
risks that could serve as a starting point to make informed decisions on 
adaptation planning.

Climate Change in the Great Lakes Basin: Summary of Trends and Impacts

1.0 	 Introduction
Climate change is threatening the health of the Great Lakes and the 
many ecosystem services they provide. 
The Great Lakes contain one-fifth of the world’s fresh surface water 
(Great Lakes Commission, 2021). Spanning two nations and many 
Indigenous communities, the Great Lakes provide drinking water to 
40 million people (see Figure 1). Its large network of streams, lakes, 
wetlands, grasslands, and forests are home to more than 3,500 species 
of plants and animals (Wuebbles et al. 2019). The Great Lakes also 
support many industries, including shipping, hydropower, agriculture, 
fishing, tourism and recreation, and provide important cultural and 
spiritual connections for people. If the Great Lakes region were a country, 
it would have the third largest economy in the world (Desjardins, 2017). 
However, climate change is threatening the health of the Great Lakes and 
the many ecosystem services they provide, affecting the people, plants, 
and animals across the basin who rely on the Great Lakes.
Through the 2012 Canada-United States Great Lakes Water Quality 
Agreement (GLWQA), Canada and the United States recognized the 
need to strengthen efforts to address new and continuing threats to the 
quality of the waters of the Great Lakes, including climate change impacts. 
The 2012 GLWQA incorporated a new Climate Change Impacts Annex 
(Annex 9) to facilitate the coordination of efforts to address climate 
change impacts within the Great Lakes basin. This Annex aims to identify, 
quantify, understand, and predict the climate change impacts on the
quality of the waters of the Great Lakes, and share information that 
resource managers need to proactively address these impacts. In order 
to implement the commitments under the Annex, Canada and the United 
States established a Climate Change Impacts Annex Subcommittee, 
co-led by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) and the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), with members 
from U.S. and Canadian federal government departments, state, provincial, 
and local governments, tribal and Indigenous organizations, watershed 
management agencies, non-governmental organizations, and academic 
institutions and organizations. 
This summary report was prepared by the Ontario Climate Consortium for 
the Climate Change Impacts Annex Subcommittee to characterize historical 
and future climate trends within the Great Lakes basin and summarize 
the impacts that are already being felt by communities across the basin. 
This report seeks to translate technical climate and hydrological data into 
practical information for decision-makers and increase understanding of 
climate change impacts to help inform adaptation and resilience-building 
efforts across the region.
The information presented in this report is based on a review of published 
literature (including peer-reviewed articles, reports, and news articles 
from both Canada and the United States); ice cover projections developed 
by the Nelson Institute Center for Climatic Research (CCR); and climate 
and water level projections developed by ECCC as part of a study called, 
“Assessing and Enhancing the Resilience of Great Lakes Coastal Wetlands” 
supported by the Great Lakes Protection Initiative (GLPI; 2017-2022).

Projections were developed to the end of the century on either a daily or 
monthly basis (see Box 1 for more information). This report summarizes 
several key hydroclimate parameters, including over-land air temperature, 
over-lake precipitation, lake levels, and ice cover:
•	 Over-land air temperature refers to air temperature over the lands
	
surrounding the Great Lakes
•	 Over-lake precipitation refers to precipitation that falls on
	
the lakes’ surfaces
•	 Lake levels refer to the surface water level of the Great Lakes
•	 Ice cover refers to the amount of ice that forms on the surface
	
of the Great Lakes
Section 2.0, Historical and Future Climate Trends, examines how 
over-land air temperature, over-lake precipitation, lake levels, and ice 
cover have changed within the Great Lakes basin and how these are 
expected to continue to change until the end of the century under two 
climate change scenarios. Climate trends are summarized by lake where 
information is available.
Section 3.0, Climate Change Impacts, discusses what these projected 
climate and hydrological changes mean for communities within the Great 
Lakes basin and highlights some of the major impacts that are already 
being felt by communities.
Section 4.0, Looking Ahead, presents a summary of the key climate 
change risks identified for the Great Lakes basin that need to be proactively 
addressed in order to reduce negative impacts and build resilience.

The projections used in this report have been developed by Environment 
and Climate Change (ECCC) and the Nelson Institute Center for Climatic
Research (CCR) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Observed historical 
data was retrieved from the NOAA-Great Lakes Environmental Research 
Laboratory (GLERL).
What are Climate Projections?
Climate projections are simulations of what Earth’s climate may look like 
in the future using climate models to simulate different atmospheric, 
oceanic, and land processes that influence climate. These simulations are 
based on plausible future scenarios of emissions patterns from human 
activities and concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols in the 
atmosphere (typically until 2100), known as Representative Concentration 
Pathways (RCPs). There are four main RCPs, representing scenarios of 
high emissions (RCP 8.5), moderate emissions (RCPs 4.5 and 6.0), and low 
emissions (RCP 2.6). These scenarios are based on different assumptions 
of future socioeconomic and technological developments, such as changes 
in population growth, technology, energy, and land use.
How Did ECCC Develop the Climate and Water Level Projections 
Used in this Report?
Not all climate models are able to capture the Great Lakes and their dynamics.
In order to obtain simulated responses of future climate within the Great 
Lakes basin, ECCC used data from select climate models that do capture the
Great Lakes at sufficiently high resolution, as well as simulating lake processes,
including lake evaporation. Modelled data from the Coupled Model 
Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) were available from NA-CORDEX, 
the North American component of the International Coordinated Regional 
Downscaling Experiment program sponsored by the World Climate Research 
Program (WCRP).
Two climate change scenarios were used, including RCPs 4.5 and 8.5, 
which represent the most commonly modelled scenarios. Under RCP 4.5, 
an intermediate climate change scenario, global average temperatures 
BOX 1:	 ABOUT THE METHODOLOGY USED TO DEVELOP THE 
HYDROCLIMATE PROJECTIONS FOR THE GREAT LAKES BASIN
could increase by 1.7 to 3.2°C (or 3.1 to 5.8°F) compared to 1986-2005 
by the 2090s (Government of Canada, 2018). Under RCP 8.5, the 
high-emissions scenario, global average temperatures could increase 
by 3.2 to 5.4°C (or 5.8 to 9.7°F) compared to 1986-2005 by the 2090s.
RCP 8.5 was simulated by seven model runs, while RCP 4.5 was simulated 
by six model runs. The modelled data have resolutions that range from 
approximately 25 km by 25 km to approximately 45 km by 45 km. 
Lake level projections have been determined based on over-lake 
precipitation, runoff into the lake, over-lake evaporation, water flow, 
and the regulation plans that control outflows from Lake Superior and 
Lake Ontario. Both the over-lake precipitation and over-lake evaporation 
were taken directly from the modelled data available from NA-CORDEX. 
A hydrological model called, WATFLOOD, was used to calculate surface 
runoff and the flow from rivers into each of the lakes.
Projections were developed to the end of the century on a monthly basis 
for various key climate parameters and water levels to inform the coastal 
wetland climate change vulnerability assessment as part of the “Assessing 
and Enhancing the Resilience of Great Lakes Coastal Wetlands” project. 
This report summarizes several of these key hydroclimate parameters.
How Did CCR Develop the Ice Cover Projections Used in 
this Report?
Unlike climate and water level projections, ice cover projections are only 
available for RCP 8.5. Ice cover projections were simulated by six model runs 
and have resolutions of approximately 25 km by 25 km. These simulations 
also include representation of the Great Lakes and their thermodynamics. 
Projections were developed to the end of the century on a daily basis. 
For more detailed information about the methodology used by ECCC to 
develop the climate and water level projections and adjust for biases, 
please see Appendix A. For information about the methodology used by 
CCR to develop the ice cover projections and adjust for biases, please see

2.1   	Over-Land Air Temperature (ECCC Projections)
KEY FINDINGS:
•	 Climate projections indicate significant increases in annual average 	 	
	 over-land air temperatures across the basin compared to the historical 	
	 period (1961-2000).
•	 The greatest temperature increases are projected for the fall and 
	 winter seasons.
•	 Changes in average over-land air temperatures are expected to bring 	
	 warmer winters, more extreme heat, a longer growing season, heavier 	
	 precipitation, and reduced ice cover.
•	 Average over-land air temperatures over the Lake Superior basin show 	
	 the greatest future warming, followed by Lake Michigan-Huron.
Over-land air temperature refers to air temperature over the lands 
surrounding the Great Lakes. In the Great Lakes basin, residents have 
benefited from the influence of the lakes on regional weather. Throughout 
the year, the Great Lakes help to moderate temperatures, cooling nearby 
lands in the summer and warming them in the winter, which support 
agriculture and other industries (Wuebbles et al. 2019). Under both cli­
mate scenarios, average over-land air temperatures are anticipated 
to increase in all seasons and over the year.
Figure 2 presents a series of graphs showing historical and projected 
over-land air temperatures for each lake basin under both climate 
scenarios averaged by month and time period. These graphs illustrate the 
anticipated changes in over-land air temperatures over the short (2030s), 
medium (2050s), and long-term (2080s) future compared to historical 
measured data (1961-2014) across the two climate scenarios (RCPs 4.5 
and 8.5). The 5th and 95th percentile values across the model runs are 
presented to highlight the range of possible over-land air temperatures 
over the lake basins for each month (see Box 2 for information on 
percentiles). Tables 2 and 3 present temperature values in degrees 
Celsius for RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively.
The 5th percentile represents the value 
below which 5 percent of the data 
falls. The 95th percentile represents 
the value below which 95 percent of 
the data falls, and 5 percent are above 
that value. Together, they make up 90 
percent of where all the data points 
fall. This range is helpful to understand 
where most projected climate, water 
level, and ice cover data fall within and 
removes extreme values that occur 
5 percent of the time on either end 
of the distribution, which may skew 
comparisons. 
BOX 2:	 WHAT ARE 5TH AND 95TH PERCENTILES AND WHY 
ARE THEY BEING USED?

(or 50th percentile)

For the climate and water level projections, observed historical and 
modelled future data are compared across 30 consecutive years (i.e. 1961-
2000, 2006-2035, 2036-2065, and 2066-2095). Meanwhile, for the ice cover 
projections, data is only available for 20 consecutive years (i.e. 1980-1999, 
2040-2059, and 2080-2099). Using data from multiple decades is important 
to ensure that climate trends are not driven by occasional extremes.
In some cases, the graphs display observed historical data up to the most 
recent year with data available in order to capture the breadth of historical 
variation and/or avoid a break in the timeline when data is displayed as a 
continuous time series. Historical climate data is currently available up to 
2019 for over-lake precipitation, lake levels, and ice cover, while historical 
climate data for over-land air temperature is available up to 2014.
Projections are presented for individual lakes where possible (see Table 1). 
For most parameters (except ice cover), lakes Michigan and Huron are 
presented as a single unit as they are hydrologically one body of water. 
Georgian Bay is part of Lake Huron and stakeholders interested in projections 
for this area should use the projections available for Lake Michigan-Huron. 
Projections for Lake St. Clair are only available for lake levels. For those 
interested in over-land air temperature and over-lake precipitation 
projections for Lake St. Clair, we suggest considering the projections 
available for Lake Erie.

2.0 	 Historical and Future 
	
Climate Trends 
“It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, 
ocean and land”– The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 
Sixth Assessment Report (2021)
In the last seven years (2014-2020), global average surface temperatures 
have been the warmest on record, with 2020 tied with 2016 as the 
warmest year (The Earth Observatory, 2021). As human activities continue 
to impact the climate, we will likely continue to see more record-breaking 
temperatures in the future. Human activities are estimated to have caused 
global average temperatures to increase by approximately 1˚C (or 1.8˚F) 
above pre-industrial levels (IPCC, 2018). In the contiguous United States, 
the regions bordering the Great Lakes are warming faster than the rest 
of the country (Hayhoe et al. 2018; Wuebbles et al. 2019). Meanwhile in 
Canada, average surface temperatures are warming twice as fast as the 
rest of the world as a whole, with northern Canada warming even faster 
(Government of Canada, 2019a).
As global climate change and the rate of warming over the Great Lakes 
continue, we can expect to see more changes to the climate across the 
basin in the coming decades. The following subsections provide a summary 
of how over-land air temperature, over-lake precipitation, lake levels, and 
ice cover have changed within the basin and how these are expected to 
continue to change until the end of the century. In order to prepare for 
the impacts of climate change on communities and ecosystems across 
the basin, it is important to understand what the future climate might 
look like.
The historical climate and hydrological data used in this report were 
retrieved from the NOAA-Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory 
(GLERL).

2.2	 Over-Lake Precipitation (ECCC Projections)
KEY FINDINGS:
•	 Average total over-lake precipitation is anticipated to increase in all 
seasons and over the year under both climate scenarios for all lakes.
•	 Changes in seasonal over-lake precipitation is anticipated to vary by 
lake and climate scenario.
•	 With warmer winters, snowfall is expected to decrease on average, 
with more precipitation falling as rain instead of snow. 
•	 Lake Superior is expected to experience the greatest increase in 
over-lake precipitation, followed by Lake Ontario.
Over-lake precipitation refers to precipitation that falls on the lake’s surface, 
which may vary from year to year. This is generally similar to precipitation 
that falls over the lands surrounding the Great Lakes, but differences can 
be observed based on wind patterns and local topography (Seglenieks 
and Temgoua, 2021). The impact of the Great Lakes on atmospheric stability 
can also result in more over-land precipitation in the summer and more 
over-lake precipitation in the winter (M. Notaro, personal communication, 
October 16, 2021).
Figure 3 presents a set of graphs showing historical and projected 
over-lake precipitation for each lake under both climate scenarios averaged 
by month and time period. These graphs illustrate the anticipated changes 
in total over-lake precipitation averaged over the short (2030s), medium 
(2050s), and long-term (2080s) future compared to historical measured 
data (1961-2019) across the two climate scenarios (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5). 
The 5th and 95th percentile values across the model runs are presented 
to highlight the range of possible total over-lake precipitation falling over 
the lakes for each month (see Box 2 for information on percentiles). Tables 
4 and 5 present average total over-lake precipitation values in millimetres 
and percentage differences compared to historical values for RCP 4.5 and 
RCP 8.5, respectively.
As Figure 2 illustrates, over-land air temperatures are projected to 
increase throughout the year across all lakes, especially in the months 
of January and February, and between July and December under both 
climate scenarios. These changes in average over-land air temperatures 
are expected to bring warmer winters, more extreme heat, and a longer 
growing season (see Section 3.0 for the impacts of these changes).
Average over-land air temperatures over the Lake Superior basin show 
the greatest warming compared to other lake basins under both climate 
scenarios, followed by the Lake Michigan-Huron basin. Annual average 
over-land air temperatures have historically (1961-2000) ranged from 
2.4˚C (or 36.3˚F) over the Lake Superior basin, the northern-most lake, 
to 9˚C (or 48.2˚F) over the Lake Erie basin, the southern-most lake. Under 
RCP 4.5, annual average over-land air temperatures could increase by 
approximately 3.5˚C (or 6.3˚F) over the Lake Superior basin and 3˚C 
(or 5.4˚F) over the Lake Erie basin by the end of the century. While under 
RCP 8.5, annual average over-land air temperatures are expected to 
increase even further by 5.6˚C (or 10˚F) over the Lake Superior basin 
and 4.8˚C (or 8.6˚F) over the Lake Erie basin by the end of the century. 
These projections indicate significant increases in annual average 
over-land air temperatures across the Great Lakes basin.
The greatest temperature increases are projected for the fall and winter 
seasons compared to average seasonal values between 1961-2000, which 
aligns with trends already being observed. Under RCP 4.5, winter average 
over-land air temperatures could increase by 3.4 to 5˚C (or 6.1 to 9˚F) by 
the end of the century across lands within the basin. While under RCP 8.5, 
winter average over-land air temperatures could increase even further by 
5 to 7.2˚C (or 9 to 13˚F) by the end of the century. With warmer winters, 
less ice cover can be expected on average over the Great Lakes, which 
has already been found to be declining (see Section 2.4 for historical and 
projected ice cover trends). Additionally, as warmer air can retain more 
moisture, heavier precipitation events that are already increasing can be 
expected to increase further in the region as more moisture is available to 
produce heavier storms.

Under both climate scenarios, average total over-lake precipitation is 
anticipated to increase in all seasons and annually over the next century 
though the amount may vary from year to year. As Figure 3 illustrates, 
the greatest changes in total over-lake precipitation are anticipated 
among projected values that fall within the 95th percentile across all lakes. 
Meanwhile, projected values that fall within the 5th percentile are expected 
to remain relatively similar to measured historical data (1961- 2019), with 
some months showing an increase.
Overall, changes in 95th percentile monthly total over-lake precipitation 
are not uniform across the lakes. For some lakes, the projections indicate 
precipitation patterns that vary greatly from measured historical data. 
For Lake Superior, the greatest changes in the 95th percentile of total 
over-lake precipitation are expected for the months of May, June, July, 
and September under both climate scenarios. For Lake Michigan-Huron, 
the greatest changes are anticipated for the months of March and June 
under both climate scenarios. For Lake Erie, the greatest changes are 
anticipated for the months of April, June, August, and September. 
Meanwhile for Lake Ontario, increases in total over-lake precipitation are 
anticipated for most months of the year. When coupled with the projected 
increases in over-land air temperatures (as discussed in Section 2.1), more 
extreme precipitation can be expected over the Great Lakes as warmer air 
can hold more moisture to produce heavier storms.
The greatest increase in total over-lake precipitation is expected for 
Lake Superior under both climate scenarios, followed by Lake Ontario. 
Annual total over-lake precipitation has historically (1961-2000) ranged 
from 755 mm (or 29.7 inches) over Lake Superior to 909 mm (or 35.8 
inches) over Lake Erie. Under RCP 4.5, annual total over-lake precipitation 
could increase by 20 percent over Lake Superior and 9 percent over Lake 
Erie by the end of the century. While under RCP 8.5, annual total over-lake 
precipitation is expected to increase even further by 24 percent over
 Lake Superior and 18 percent over Lake Erie by the end of the century. 
These projections indicate significant increases in annual total over-lake 
precipitation across the basin.
Changes in seasonal average total over-lake precipitation is anticipated 
to vary by lake. Under RCP 4.5, the greatest increases in precipitation 
by the end of the century are generally anticipated for fall and winter, 
with the exceptions of Lake Superior where spring shows the largest 
increase (43 percent increase compared to average spring totals between 
1961-2000), and Lake Ontario where summer shows similar increases as 
winter (15 percent increase compared to average summer totals between 
1961-2000). Meanwhile under RCP 8.5, the greatest increases are generally
 anticipated for spring and winter, with the exception of Lake Erie where 
fall shows similar increases as spring by the end of the century (19 and 20 
percent increase, respectively, compared to average seasonal totals between 
1961-2000). With warmer winters, snowfall is expected to decrease on 
average, with more precipitation falling as rain instead of snow. 
Lake levels refer to the surface water level of the Great Lakes (see Figure 4).
Currently, lake levels are referenced to the International Great Lakes 
Datum 1985 (IGLD85; see Box 3 for more information).

Figure 4: Illustration of Great Lakes surface water level elevations and depths (adapted based on the Michigan Sea Grant illustration)
IGLD85, or International Great Lakes Datum of 1985, is a common 
height reference system that is used to measure Great Lakes water 
levels (Vertical Control – Water Levels Subcommittee, 2017). This datum 
consists of elevations that were measured through geodetic leveling 
(a form of surveying), which was performed from the Atlantic Ocean 
(sea level), inland up the St. Lawrence River, and then to each lake along 
the connecting channels (Niagara, Detroit, St. Clair, and St. Marys River) 
(Coordinating Committee on Great Lakes Basic Hydraulic and Hydrologic 
Data, 1992). A new reference system needs to be established approximately 
every 25 to 30 years to account for differential movement of the earth’s 
crust in the Great Lakes region (Government of Canada, 2019c). IGLD85 
was implemented in January 1992, replacing the previous system, 
IGLD55. Currently, the Coordinating Committee on Great Lakes Basic 
Hydraulic and Hydrologic Data is preparing the next update to the IGLD 
(Vertical Control – Water Levels Subcommittee, 2017).
BOX 3:	 WHAT IS IGLD85?
2.3   	Lake Levels (ECCC Projections)
KEY FINDINGS:
•	 Lake level projections indicate significant deviations from lake-specific,		
long-term averages (1918-2019) across the basin with a slight upward		
trend apparent on all lakes in the latter half of the coming century.
•	 Projections indicate the potential for more frequent and severe
	
extreme high and extreme low water levels.
•	 The greatest variation in lake levels is anticipated for lakes
	
Michigan-Huron, Erie, St. Clair, and Ontario.
Through a binational partnership, water levels on the Great Lakes are 
continuously monitored by U.S. and Canadian federal agencies using a 
network of water level monitoring stations in the region (NOAA, 2021a). 
This dataset represents one of the longest sets of direct hydrometeoro­
logical measurements for any aquatic system in the world, spanning more 
than 150 years (Lofgren et al. 2002; Allan et al. 2013; Gronewold et al. 
2018). Over this time period, lake levels have ranged within a 2-metre (or 
6.6-ft) difference between the recorded maximum monthly average and 
minimum monthly average. However, in the past three decades, a greater 
degree of fluctuation has been observed relative to the 2-metre range. 
Great Lakes water levels are influenced by a number of factors, including 
over-lake precipitation, runoff from the drainage basin, evaporation from 
the lake surface, inflows from upstream lakes, outflows to downstream 
lakes, lake water diversions, water use, and regulation plans that control 
outflows from Lake Superior and Lake Ontario (Government of Canada, 
2019b). Lake water flows from Lake Superior to Lake Michigan-Huron, 
then travels south through connecting channels including Lake St. Clair

to Lake Erie, and then out through the Niagara River over Niagara Falls 
into Lake Ontario, before moving through the St. Lawrence River and into 
the Atlantic Ocean (see Figure 4). As noted previously, lakes Michigan 
and Huron are measured as one body of water because they share the 
same surface elevation above sea level and are connected at the Straits of 
Mackinac (NOAA, 2021c). Outflows from Lake Superior and Lake Ontario 
are overseen by binational regulatory boards and regulated through dams 
and control structures that can influence, but not control, water levels in 
the lakes (International Joint Commission [IJC], 2020). While outflows from 
Lakes Michigan-Huron, Erie, and St. Clair have no controls (US Army Corps 
of Engineers, 2021). It is important to note that ability to alter lake levels 
through the regulation plan is limited and dominated by changes in water 
supplies, which are driven by weather (Government of Canada, 2019b).
The lake level projections included in this report have been determined 
based on most, but not all, of the aforementioned factors that can alter 
water levels, including over-lake precipitation, runoff into the lake, 
evaporation, water flow, and the regulation of lakes Superior and Ontario 
outflows. It is important to note that these projections are not predicting 
exactly what future water levels will be for a certain year. Instead, they 
represent an envelope of possible values that the actual values will likely 
come from in the future.
Some projections for Lake Ontario under two RCP 8.5 models resulted in 
extremely high values due to the potential over-exaggeration of water 
accumulation from all Great Lakes flowing into Lake Ontario in the future 
and therefore have been excluded from our analysis. These extreme values 
have been excluded because it is impossible to anticipate what changes 
to the regulation plan might be made that would alter flows out of the 
system if extremely high inflows were to occur in Lake Ontario in the 
future. It is important to remember that projections of climate parameters 
and lake levels are based on current understanding of the climate system 
and assumptions made about the future behaviour of society, which 
will result in the amount of greenhouse gases that will be put into the 
atmosphere. There are many uncertainties and assumptions that are 
inherent in these projections and thus the projections are most useful in 
showing general trends of what could happen in the future.
Figure 5 presents a series of graphs showing historical and projected 
lake levels averaged by decade for each lake under both climate scenarios. 
Note that some periods are averaged over less than 10 years (i.e. 2011-
2019, 2025-2030, and 2091-2095). Historical lake levels are displayed 
from 1961-2019, while projections under both climate scenarios are 
displayed from 2025 to 2095. Lake-wide, long-term averages (1918-2019) 
are presented for each lake, which are benchmarks used in forecasting 
models and monitoring of the Great Lakes’ water budget (NOAA, 2021a). 
These graphs are intended to show the long-term variation in water levels, 
using box and whisker plots to show the minimum, maximum, average, 
and different quartiles for each period (see Box 4 for information on how 
to interpret box and whisker plots).
Box and whisker plots are a form of graph that present 
a breakdown of the data by quartiles (or 25 percent 
increments). The bottom whisker starts with the mini­
mum value and represents the range of the first quar­
tile. The middle line in the box represents the median 
(or second quartile). From the median to the top of the 
box is the third quartile. The top whisker shows the 
range of the fourth quartile, ending with the maximum 
value. The average can also be displayed, which is rep­
resented by an ‘x’ symbol in this report.

These graphs illustrate the cyclical nature of Great Lakes water level 
fluctuations, with some high periods and some low periods. The minimum 
and maximum values projected under both climate scenarios show the 
full range of possible lake levels that could be observed over each time 
period, including the most extreme values. Figure 5 illustrates a high degree 
of variation within each time period, signaling the potential for more 
frequent and severe extreme high and extreme low water levels in the 
coming decades. The lakes that are unregulated (i.e. lakes Michigan-Huron, 
Erie, and St. Clair) show a great degree of variation in future lake levels. 
Projections for Lake Ontario also indicate a great degree of variation. While 
outflows from Lake Ontario are regulated, inflows are uncontrolled (McNeil, 
2019). There are also limits to the amount of outflow that can be released 
from Lake Ontario due to the flow capacity of the St. Lawrence River. 
Figure 6 presents another set of graphs showing historical and projected 
lake levels for each lake under both climate scenarios averaged by month 
and time period (historical, 2030s, 2050s, and 2080s). These graphs illustrate 
the anticipated changes in lake levels averaged over the short, medium, 
and long-term future compared to measured historical data (1961-2019)

Figure 6: Historical and projected average 
lake levels under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 by month 
and time period for:
a) Lake Superior, b) Lake Michigan-Huron, c) Lake Erie,
d) Lake St. Clair, and e) Lake Ontario. Projected lake 
levels under both climate change scenarios are 
presented side by side with RCP 4.5 on left and RCP 
8.5 on the right. The dotted grey area shows historical
lake levels averaged by month between 1961 and 
2019 that fall within the 5th and 95th percentile 
range. The red line shows the long-term average 
reported for each lake between 1918 and 2019 as a 
point of reference. Future lake levels are projected
for three time periods: 2030s, 2050s, and 2080s, with 
each represented by a different colour and pattern. 
The top lines represent the 95th percentile of the 
projected values under six RCP 4.5 model runs and 
seven RCP 8.5 model runs, respectively, and the bottom 
lines represent the 5th percentile.  
across the two climate scenarios. The 5th and 95th percentile values are 
presented to highlight the range of possible average lake levels for each 
month. These ranges are anticipated to grow in the coming decades (i.e. 
there will likely be higher highs and lower lows), indicating once again 
that more frequent and severe extreme high and low water levels can be 
expected across all lakes in the future. Significant increases in 95th percentile
lake levels are anticipated under RCP 8.5, while significant increases in 
95th percentile lake levels are also anticipated under RCP 4.5 for lakes 
Superior and Ontario. 
Seasonal variation in Great Lakes water levels is well defined with relatively 
low water levels in the winter months, rising water levels in the spring 
and summer, and decreasing water levels in the late summer and early 
fall with less precipitation and increasing lake evaporation (Quinn, 2002; 
Gronewold and Stow, 2014). This seasonal variation seems to be persistent 
under both climate scenarios in the coming decades. 

Tables 6 and 7 present average lake level values in metres (IGLD85) 
and deviation from the lake-wide, long-term averages (1918-2019)

Overall, annual average lake level projections indicate variations from 
historical lake levels (1961-2000) for all lakes. Under both climate scenarios, 
Lake Michigan-Huron is expected to see the greatest variation in possible 
average annual lake levels in the future, which aligns with historical 
observations (Wuebbles et al. 2019).
2.4 	 Ice Cover (CCR Projections)
KEY FINDINGS:
•	 Ice cover projections indicate significant decreases in future lake ice 		
	 cover across all lakes, especially in the months of February and March 	
	 under the high-emissions scenario.
•	 Projections indicate the potential for more years with little to no 
	 ice cover and shorter ice seasons. For deeper lakes such as lakes 
	 Superior and Huron, ice growth may also peak earlier (in February
	  instead of March).
•	 Average ice cover over lakes Superior and Erie show the greatest 
	 declines, followed by Lake Huron.
•	 Lake Michigan is expected to see the greatest decline in the average 	
	 length of the ice season between December and May, followed by 
	 lakes Erie and Ontario.
Ice cover refers to the amount of ice that forms on the surface of the Great 
Lakes. Common metrics of ice cover include: area or percentage of the 
lake surface that is covered in ice; the length of time that the lake stays 
frozen; maximum annual ice cover; and the thickness of the ice that forms 
over the lake surface.
Historically, sections of the Great Lakes typically freeze every winter 
though the amount of ice cover and length of the ice season vary from 
year to year (NOAA, 2021b; US Environmental Protection Agency [US EPA], 
2021a). NOAA-GLERL has been monitoring and analyzing Great Lakes ice 
cover since the early 1970s, using the ice products developed by the U.S. 
National Ice Center and the Canadian Ice Service (NOAA, 2021b). Ice cover 
data for each lake is available dating back to 1973 (US EPA, 2021a). 
The formation and melting of ice cover can be characterized by three stages:
freeze-up, ice growth, and break-up (Brown and Duguay, 2010). In general, 
ice typically begins to form in the lakes in early December and can grow 
until mid-February to early March (Wang et al. 2018). By late April to late 
May, ice typically melts away completely. In presenting historical and 
future ice cover in this section, December to May is considered part of 
the same year (or ice season).
The extent and duration of ice cover can vary due to differences in the 
lakes’ latitude, orientation, depth (and therefore heat storage), as well as 
turbidity (which can affect the amount of light reflected off the lake’s 
surface, known as albedo; Wang et al. 2018). Compared to the deeper 
lakes, shallow lakes such as lakes St. Clair and Erie store less heat and 
typically have more ice cover and experience an earlier ice season (i.e. 
earlier freeze-up and break-up; US EPA, 2021b; Wang et al. 2018). 
In addition to the morphometry of the lakes, ice cover can also be influenced
by air temperature, precipitation, wind, and solar radiation, as well as 
multi-year and multi-decadal climate patterns such as the El Niño and 
Southern Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation, and the Atlantic 
Multidecadal Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (US EPA, 2021b; 
Wang et al. 2018). 
Overall, Great Lakes ice cover has been declining rapidly since the 1970s. 
Researchers at NOAA have found that, on average, maximum annual ice 
cover has been decreasing by 5 percent per decade (NOAA, 2018). This 
report focuses on changes in annual average ice cover and length of the 
ice season between December and May.
Figure 7 presents a series of graphs showing historical and projected ice 
cover for each lake under the high-emissions scenario averaged by month 
and time period. These graphs illustrate the anticipated changes in ice cover
over the medium (2040-2059; left), and long-term (2080-2099; right) future
under RCP 8.5 compared to observed historical data (1980-2019). The 5th 
and 95th percentile values across the model runs are presented to highlight 
the range of possible ice cover over the lakes for each month. Table 8 presents 
the projected values of percentage ice cover under RCP 8.5.

As Figure 7 illustrates, average ice cover is anticipated to decrease during 
winter and spring across all lakes, especially in the months of February and 
March under the high-emissions scenario. These changes suggest that less 
ice cover may form over the Great Lakes; there may be more years with 
little to no ice cover; and ice growth may peak earlier, especially in deeper 
lakes such as lakes Superior and Huron (see Section 3.0 for the impacts of 
these changes). Average ice cover over lakes Superior and Erie show the 
greatest declines, followed by Lake Huron. 
Historically (1980-1999), average ice cover during winter and spring 
ranged from 25.3 percent over Lake Erie to 6.1 percent over Lake Ontario. 
Under RCP 8.5, average ice cover during winter and spring could decrease 
by 19 percent over Lake Erie and 6 percent over Lake Ontario by the end 
of the century, compared to the historical period (1980-1999). These 
projections indicate significant decreases in average ice cover across the 
Great Lakes basin.
The greatest declines in average ice cover are projected for the winter 
months compared to average seasonal values between 1980-1999. Under 
RCP 8.5, average ice cover in the winter could decrease by 8 to 30 percent 
by the end of the century across the Great Lakes. While average ice cover 
in the spring could decrease by 3 to 18 percent by the end of the century 
across the Great Lakes. 
Table 9 presents the historical and projected length of the ice season 
between December and May for each lake in days. The 5th and 95th 
percentile values are included to highlight the range of possibilities 
for the length of the ice season, which may vary from year to year. 
On average, the length of the ice season ranged from 106 days to 
139 days across the Great Lakes between 1981-1999 (1980 was excluded 
because December 1979 data was not analyzed). Under RCP 8.5, the average
length of the ice season could range from 47 days to 124 days across the 
Great Lakes by the end of the century. For the most part, the number of 
days where the lakes are covered in ice is expected to decrease in the 
future though some years could still see an increase compared to the 
historical period. 
By the end of the century, Lake Michigan is expected to see the greatest 
decline in the average length of the ice season, decreasing by 72 days 
compared to 1981-1999. This is followed by Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, 
which may see a decrease by 66 and 50 days, respectively, by the end 
of the century compared to 1981-1999. These projections indicate a 
significant reduction in the average ice season across the Great Lakes 
basin during winter and spring.

3.0 	 Climate Change Impacts 
Across the Great Lakes basin, the impacts of climate change 
are already being felt.
Changes in climate and water levels impact people, infrastructure, 
and ecosystems across the Great Lakes region. Impacts can range from 
costly damages to infrastructure and property, threats to human health 
and safety, changes to ecosystems and biodiversity, and impacts on 
businesses and local economies. These impacts will be experienced 
differently by different people, depending on socio-economic factors 
and geographic location.
Climate change also acts as a threat multiplier, exacerbating the impacts 
of existing stressors such as pollution, invasive species, coastal development,
and inequality. This section highlights some of the major impacts of climate 
change that are already being felt by communities across the Great Lakes 
basin based on a review of published literature, including peer-reviewed 
articles, reports, and news articles. The impacts observed include the 
following: warmer surface water temperatures; ice cover reduction; flood­
ing, erosion, and storms; impacts on industries and livelihoods; 
and impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity.
3.1 Impacts of Warmer Water Temperatures
With warmer air temperatures and reduced ice cover, summer surface water 
temperatures are warming across the Great Lakes (Allan et al. 2013). In the 
upper Great Lakes, especially Lake Superior, summer water temperatures 
are warming even faster than regional air temperatures (Austin and 
Colman, 2007; O’Reilly et al. 2015). Surface water temperature has warmed 
fastest around the coastline and the eastern portion of Lake Superior 
(Bartolai et al. 2015; see Box 6). Meanwhile, warming of the other lakes 
has primarily been observed in the north-central (Lake Michigan) and 
eastern regions (lakes Huron, Erie, and Ontario). Warmer water temperatures 
inhibit the mixing of lake waters, increase oxygen depletion, promote the 
growth of harmful algal blooms, and lead to the decline of cold-water species. 
Many of these processes are interconnected and reinforce one another.
Stratification of lake waters is occurring earlier with shorter winters and 
earlier warming in the spring (see Figure 8; Kling et al. 2003; Allan et al. 
2013). In turn, stratification may last for a longer period of time and 
become established at shallower depths. Stratification refers to the 
layering and separation of warmer surface waters from cooler waters 
at the bottom of the lake (Kling et al. 2003). It prevents the mixing of 
water in the water column and oxygenation of water at greater depths, 
which can lead to more widespread and longer periods of bottom anoxia 
(i.e., depletion of oxygen) or dead zones (when oxygen is consumed by 
organisms). Persistent dead zones can result in massive fish kills, damage 
to fisheries, toxic algal blooms, and impacts on drinking water (see Box 6).

A study by O’Reilly and others in 2015 found Lake Superior to be the 
second fastest warming lake in the world, behind a lake in Sweden. While 
smaller lakes might be expected to warm more quickly, several factors 
may be driving the increase in warming in lakes similar to Lake Superior 
(Chung, 2015). Lakes that are normally covered with ice in the winter are 
experiencing earlier ice melt in the spring, which exposes the lakes to 
more solar radiation and increases the amount of heat absorbed by the 
lake. Summer stratification is also occurring earlier, which reinforces itself 
by inhibiting the mixing of colder water located at greater depths. 
BOX 5:	 WHY IS LAKE SUPERIOR WARMING MORE QUICKLY 
THAN OTHER LAKES?
The mixing of lake waters generally occurs when surface water cools from 
its maximum temperature in the year, typically in September, and begins 
to mix with warmer and less dense water at greater depths (Wuebbles 
et al. 2019). This mixing continues until water reaches a 4°C (or 39.2°F) 
threshold (the point at which fresh water reaches maximum density). 
However, when surface water temperature stays above 4°C, the lake may 
not mix fully to bring nutrients up from the bottom of the lake and bring 
down critical dissolved oxygen to deeper waters for fish and zooplankton 
species (Bartolai et al. 2015). This lack of mixing further contributes to 
increased thermal stratification and enhanced warming of surface water 
temperatures. Parts of southern Lake Michigan and Lake Ontario reportedly
had surface temperature that stayed above 4°C during the winters of 
2011/12 and 2016/17 (Wuebbles et al. 2019). As the smallest lake by 
surface area, Lake Ontario is particularly sensitive to this effect. 
Higher water temperatures promote the growth of certain types of 
bloom-forming algae and cyanobacteria (Wuebbles et al. 2019). When 
water temperatures are above 20°C (or 68°F), the growth rates of many 
bloom-forming cyanobacteria increase (e.g. Microcystis, Anabaena, and 
Cylindrospermopsis), which can lead to more severe harmful algal blooms 
(HABs). Of these, the Microcystis and Anabaena species are of greatest 
concern because they produce toxic chemicals that can damage the 
Warmer water temperatures also mean less available habitat for coldwater 
fish species (e.g. lake trout, brook trout, whitefish, emerald shiners, and 
rainbow smelt) and coolwater species (e.g. northern pike and walleye; 
Alofs et al. 2014, 2015; Dove-Thompson et al. 2011). For smaller and shallower 
lakes such as Lake Ontario, the increase in water temperatures can result 
in a significant loss in the volume of cold bottom water, constraining 
coldwater fish species to increasingly narrower bands in the water column 
where oxygen levels are sufficient and where the temperature is bearable 
(Briscoe, 2019b). As water temperatures increase, coldwater fish species 
will likely decline, and may be increasingly replaced by warmwater 
species (see Section 3.4 for implications on commercial, recreational, 
and subsistence fishing). 
Lake Erie’s dead zone is situated mostly in deep, offshore waters and 
can cover an area the size of Connecticut (Briscoe, 2019a). However, 
northeastern winds can push this water toward Ohio’s shoreline, 
where it threatens a number of major municipal drinking water intakes 
from Lorain (approximately 48 km or 30 mi west of Cleveland) to Ashtabula
(approximately 97 km or 60 mi to the east). This occurred in Westlake, 
Ohio, on August 9, 2006, when northeastern winds blew across the lake, 
which led warm, low-oxygen offshore waters to engulf the crib structure 
protecting the municipal drinking water intake, and subsequently enter 
three of the four water treatment plants at the Crown Water Treatment 
Plant. This lasted up to 12 days and manganese concentrations at the 
Crown Treatment Plant rose above 1 milligram per litre (mg/L) at times, 
exceeding the thresholds recommended by the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) of no more than 0.3 mg/L for pregnant and nursing women, 
and no more than 1 mg/L for healthy adults. Manganese causes water 
discolouration and has been linked to permanent neurological issues.

DRINKING WATER
3.2 Impacts of Ice Cover Reduction
While ice cover over the Great Lakes is variable from year to year, Great 
Lakes ice cover has been declining rapidly since the 1970s (NOAA, 2018; 
see Section 2.4). In coastal areas, lake ice helps to protect shorelines by 
reducing wave action and is important for communities that rely on ice 
roads, and for winter recreation. 
 
Ice cover helps to reduce wave energy/erosion that drives up against 
the coast. It also offers insulation and protection for spawning habitats 
in shallow areas for species that spawn during the fall and winter 
(Bartolai et al. 2015). With reduced ice cover in early and late winter 
and the potential for more frequent extreme high water levels, increased 
erosion risks can be anticipated especially for sandy beach systems found 
in southern Lake Huron, and much of lakes Michigan, Erie, and Ontario 
(Wuebbles et al. 2019). There is also increased potential for overwash and 
breaching of barriers, affecting barrier-protected and diked/impounded 
coastal wetlands, particularly at vulnerable locations, such as Presque 
Isle and Long Point on Lake Erie, and along baymouth barriers enclosing 
Sodus Bay and Hamilton Harbour on Lake Ontario. Coastal wetlands and 
shorelines at Point Pelee, Hillman Marsh, Rondeau, and Long Point have 
been damaged and breached by wind-driven waves during high lake 
levels. Diked coastal wetlands in Lake St. Clair have also been degraded.
 
For many people across the Great Lakes region, lake ice is an integral 
part of life and contributes to a sense of place and identity (Briscoe, 
2020a). For communities that rely on ice roads, ice cover provides mobility 
and access during the winter to essential resources such as food, gas, and 
other necessities. Ice cover is also important for winter recreational activities, 
such as snowmobiling and ice fishing. Declining ice cover can therefore 
result in the loss of essential transportation for some communities (see Box 7),
 and the loss of winter recreation and culture, as well as posing risks to 
people’s safety when they travel on unsafe ice conditions. In recent winters, 
it has been reported that more than 200 people have been rescued, 
and over three dozen have died in ice accidents on the Great Lakes and 
nearby waterbodies. 
liver and nerve tissues, respectively (Michalak et al. 2013). Contact with 
and consumption of water contaminated with cyanobacteria have been 
associated with skin and eye irritation, respiratory illness, gastrointestinal 
illness, and liver and kidney damage (Angel et al. 2018). Given these 
public health risks, restrictions on fisheries, coastal recreation, and drinking 
water are usually put in place when HABs occur (Sharma et al. 2018). 
Even nontoxic algal blooms can have significant impacts on the lakes, 
making lake water smell and taste bad and sometimes dangerous to drink, 
depleting oxygen, killing fish, and driving chemical processes that prime 
the lakes for larger blooms in the future (Michalak et al. 2013; Filippelli 
and Ortiz, 2020). In recent years, the normally pristine waters of Lake 
Superior have also experienced algal blooms near the Apostle Islands, 
an indication of the potential challenges that we might continue to 
expect under climate change (Wuebbles et al. 2019; Briscoe, 2019c). 
Meanwhile in Lake Erie, the severity of blooms has generally been on 
the rise since the early 2000s (Hartig et al. 2020). 
Warmer and lower oxygen waters promote increased microbial 
decomposition and the subsequent release of nutrients (e.g. phosphorous) 
and contaminants (e.g. mercury and other heavy metals) from bottom 
sediments (Kling et al. 2003). Heavy metals such as mercury become more 
soluble (and bioavailable) in the absence of oxygen because oxygen binds 
with these elements to form insoluble compounds that sink to the bottom
of the lake. This may lead to increased uptake by aquatic organisms, 
leading to increased accumulation of mercury and other contaminants in 
the aquatic food chain, impacting people and wildlife. When low-oxygen 
water interacts with Lake Erie’s bottom sediments and clay, heavy metals 
such as manganese and iron are released into the water (Briscoe, 2019a). 
Low oxygen water is also more corrosive and can damage water pipes, 
causing foul-smelling and poor-tasting water, and increases the release of 
trace metals from pipes, which may also pose threats to human health.

3.3 	 Impacts of Flooding, Erosion, and Storms
Flooding and erosion are already causing devastating impacts across the 
Great Lakes basin. On the western shores of Lake Michigan, for example, 
houses have begun to slip into the lake because of eroding coastal dunes 
(O’Connell, 2020b). The frequency and severity of flooding and erosion 
will likely increase under climate change, with more frequent and intense 
precipitation, earlier spring snowmelt, more precipitation falling as rain 
instead of snow, earlier ice breakup, and potentially more frequent extreme 
high water levels. Increased flooding and erosion can cause damage to 
infrastructure and property, pose risks to human health and safety, and 
impact people’s mental health and well-being. Flooding and erosion can 
also increase the resuspension of contaminated sediments and increase 
the risk of waterborne diseases (Gagnon et al. 2019). 
Recent high water levels across the Great Lakes have led to the flooding 
of homes, driveways, roads, and trails, as well as shoreline erosion, and the 
loss of beaches and vegetation (McNeil, 2019). Lake Ontario experienced 
a record-high water level in 2017 of 75.88 m IGLD85 (or 248.95 ft IGLD85), 
which was subsequently exceeded just two years later in 2019, with a 
new record of 75.92 m IGLD85 (or 249.09 ft) (IJC, 2019). Areas that were 
particularly impacted in both years include portions of Toronto Island, 
Clarington, Brighton, Prince Edward County, the Thousand Islands 
shoreline area, and the Bay of Quinte in Ontario, Canada (McNeil, 2019). 
Numerous states of emergency were declared across Canada and the U.S., 
and the resulting damages and necessary repairs have been costly 
(see Box 8 for examples of such costs). For residents and business owners 
along the Lake Ontario shoreline, the events of the past few years have 
not only brought significant financial impacts but also emotional and 
mental health impacts (O’Connell, 2020a). As more high and low water 
levels are anticipated across the Great Lakes under a changing climate, 
there is need to prepare for both high and low water level conditions 
(e.g. 2013 record-low water levels in Lake Michigan-Huron).  
Historically, lake ice forms across much of Lake Superior, creating an 
approximately 3-km (or 1.9-mi) ice road that bridges Bayfield, Wisconsin 
and Madeline Island (Briscoe, 2020a). This ice road provides free, year-round 
access for residents of Madeline Island to and from the mainland for food, 
gas, and other necessities. With declining lake ice cover, the ice road never 
formed in 2020. As a result, locals had to pay to take the ferry, which 
represents an additional cost of living. At the same time, the Madeline Ferry 
Line was losing money because ferrying a few passengers during the 
off-season is not enough to offset the cost of operation. To mitigate losses, 
the company added a winter surcharge, which in turn further increased 
the cost of transportation for residents of Madeline Island. 
BOX 7:	 THE ICE ROAD CONNECTING BAYFIELD AND 
MADELINE ISLAND IN LAKE SUPERIOR
Erosion damage is not limited to buildings, bluffs, and dunes (Eng, 2019). 
It can also affect the lakebed by digging out the bottom of the lake, which 
in turn increases the risk of larger waves that can cause more erosion damage
along the coast. In efforts to protect their properties against erosion and 
high waves, homeowners have erected their own barriers, but this 
piecemeal approach can exacerbate erosion of neighbouring properties. 
More frequent and intense precipitation is also anticipated to increase 
storm-induced runoff and associated nutrients and contaminants. Land 
surface runoff from the Great Lakes drainage basin contributes approximately 
half of the supply of fresh water to the lakes (Cherkauer and Sinha, 2010). 
Nutrients can accumulate rapidly in a small number of intense rain events 
(Wuebbles et al. 2019). Agricultural runoff is a major threat to the Great 
Island Flooding - Toronto Ontario
Lakes, particularly to Lake Erie where agricultural runoff is estimated to 
account for up to 89 percent of the phosphorous entering the lake (US 
EPA, 2018). In urban watersheds, more than 60 percent of the annual load 
of all contaminants are transported during storm events (Patz et al. 2008). 
Several locations along Lake Ontario are particularly vulnerable to nutrient 
inputs, including the Bay of Quinte, Hamilton Harbour, and the Toronto 
Waterfront (Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks, 
2020). Increase in nutrient loading will likely lead to an increase in algal 
blooms, which negatively impact the health of the lakes and pose threats 
to drinking water (see Section 3.1). Heavy precipitation can also increase 
combined sewer overflows, leading to the release of untreated sewage 
into the lakes, which lead to higher levels of E. coli bacteria (a public 
health threat), and beach closures (Patz et al. 2008; Wuebbles et al. 2019).

FLOODING, EROSION, AND STORMS
3.4 	 Impacts on Industries and Livelihoods
The industries and people who rely on the Great Lakes can also be 
affected by changing climate conditions within the Great Lakes basin. 
These include impacts to shipping, hydropower production, commercial, 
recreational and subsistence fishing, agriculture, tourism, and recreation 
(Hartmann, 1990; Wuebbles et al. 2019). 
The Great Lakes/St. Lawrence Seaway serves as a major transportation 
system and is one of the busiest shipping areas in the world. Shipping 
can be impacted by both low and high water levels. Low water levels can 
lead to unsafe conditions for shipping and navigation, especially in the 
shallower portions of the Great Lakes’ channels and harbours. More trips 
will likely be required in order to move the same amount of cargo, increasing
shipping costs and traffic. The dredging of harbours and channels may 
also be required, which already costs approximately US$20 million per 
year (Bartolai et al. 2015). High water levels can produce faster moving 
water in portions of the Seaway that also present unsafe conditions for 
shipping (Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Adaptive Management [GLAM] 
Committee, 2018). This occurred in Lake Ontario during the 2017 high 
water levels where record outflows of up to 10,400 m3/s (or 367,272 ft3/s) 
were observed. Any impacts to the shipping industry will have direct 
impacts on other industries that depend on the Great Lakes for transport 
(e.g. iron, steel, and grain; Hartmann, 1990). 
Lake waters are extensively used for hydropower production. In Ontario, 
the Great Lakes help generate 80 percent of Ontario’s electricity (Ontario 
Ministry of the Environment, 2016). In the Midwest U.S., most energy 
production infrastructure are located along waterways (Wuebbles et al. 
2019). The Great Lakes provide water for hydropower production as well 
as the water needed to cool power plants. With more frequent extreme 
low water levels and warmer water temperatures, less water is available 
for hydropower production and water levels could more frequently drop 
below water intake levels. Increased water temperatures also reduce their 
effectiveness for cooling power plants. As current energy infrastructure 
has been designed and built based on historical water levels and temperature
regimes, changing climate conditions could potentially interrupt or decrease 
regional power generation.

Commercial, recreational, and subsistence fishing can be affected by the 
impacts of climate change on fish species and populations, such as the 
loss of coldwater and coolwater habitats, increase in algal blooms and 
dead zones, loss of safe breeding/spawning habitats, and increase in 
invasive species. For some, the loss of opportunities to harvest coldwater 
fish species may be offset by increased opportunities to harvest warmwater 
species (Alofs et al. 2014, 2015; Dove-Thompson et al. 2011). However, for 
many Indigenous peoples, the decline of some fish species can impact 
their livelihoods and way of life, as well as traditional knowledge, food, 
and culture (Wuebbles et al. 2019; Briscoe, 2020b). For example, the fishing
communities of Saugeen First Nation and Chippewas of Nawash are 
finding that higher winds, loss of ice cover, and warmer temperatures are 
affecting populations of lake whitefish in Lake Huron and Georgian Bay, 
which many rely on for their livelihoods (Johnson, 2019). 
Climate change can have both positive and negative impacts on agriculture, 
which accounts for a third of the basin’s land use (Wuebbles et al. 2019). 
A longer growing season would be beneficial to agriculture. However, 
these benefits may be offset by more extreme weather events, more variable
precipitation, and an increase in pests and diseases. For example, 
the range of the bean leaf beetle, a pest for soybeans, already appears 
to be shifting northward (Kling et al. 2003). Additionally, increased 
evapotranspiration during the growing season may reduce water stored 
in the landscape, increasing soil moisture deficits in the fall, as well as 
demand for irrigation (Wuebbles et al. 2019). 
Climate change may also bring positive and negative impacts on tourism 
and recreation. For example, more frequent extreme high and low water 
levels can limit recreational opportunities such as boating and canoeing. 
Warmer winters and less snow and ice conditions on average will result in 
fewer opportunities for winter recreation, including skiing, snowmobiling, 
snowshoeing, and ice fishing. Although opportunities for warm weather 
recreation may increase, the loss of traditional cold-weather recreation 
is a loss in way of life and culture for many. Communities that depend on 
winter recreation and related tourism will likely be significantly impacted. 
Impacts on nature attractions such as beaches, ice caves, and parks can 
further impact tourism (Dawson and Scott, 2010; Briscoe, 2020a).  
3.5	
Impacts on Ecosystems and Biodiversity
Climate change can impact plants and animals across the Great Lakes basin, 
from species abundance, distribution, genetic composition, behaviour, 
and survival. Changing seasonal patterns can affect breeding, spawning, 
and other behaviours. For example, in Lake Erie, greater variability in spring 
warming has been associated with more variability in spring spawning 
species such as walleye (Wuebbles et al. 2019). Changes to one species 
can impact another through species interactions and dependencies 
(e.g. predator and prey relationships; Dove-Thompson et al. 2011). 
Climate Change in the Great Lakes Basin: Summary of Trends and Impacts

With climate change, habitat ranges will likely continue to expand for 
some plant and animal species as warming continues, while ranges 
shrink or shift northwards for others. For example, smallmouth bass 
have historically been limited in their northern distribution due to colder
temperatures (Alofs et al. 2014, 2015). However, with warmer water 
temperatures and longer ice-free season, populations of smallmouth bass 
have proliferated. As voracious predators, their expansion has reportedly 
led to the reduction of more than 25,000 populations of northern redbelly 
dace, finescale dace, fathead minnow, and pearl dace throughout lakes in 
Ontario. With warmer surface waters and reduced ice cover, shallow water 
habitats in many of the Great Lakes have also become more suitable for 
invasive species (e.g. carp, round goby, quagga mussel, and zebra mussel; 
Taylor et al. 2006). 
The distribution of forests will also likely change as warmer temperatures 
lead to the shrinking of boreal forests, and the northward shift of many 
tree species (e.g. birch, aspen, balsam fir, and black spruce) that will likely 
be replaced by more southerly species (Great Lakes Integrated Sciences and 
Assessments [GLISA], 2014). Currently, forest cover makes up approximately 
60 percent of land cover within the basin and forms an important part of 
the Great Lakes ecosystem (Bartolai et al. 2015). As temperatures warm 
and as the distribution of forests changes, pests and diseases (e.g. LDD moth) 
are also anticipated to increase, posing further threats to the health of 
trees and forests across the basin (Kling et al. 2003).  
Climate change also poses threats to coastal wetlands, which provide 
essential habitat for a large variety of plants and animals (Mortsch, 1998; 
Wuebbles et al. 2019). Over half of all Great Lakes fish species use wetlands 
for spawning and nursery habitat. It has also been reported that 30 species 
of waterfowl, 155 breeding bird species, and 55 species of reptiles and 
amphibians are supported by coastal wetlands across the basin. Coastal 
wetlands are particularly vulnerable to changing climate conditions and 
water levels. For example, open shoreline wetlands are vulnerable to high 
water levels and storm surges that lead to erosion of protective sand spits 
and bars at barrier-protected wetlands, and loss of wetland habitat. Low 
water levels can lead to the shrinking of wetlands and reduce hydraulic 
connectivity. Coastal wetlands are also being affected by coastal erosion. 
For example, it has been reported that more than 160 hectares of coastal 
wetlands have disappeared in Rondeau Bay in Chatham-Kent, Ontario, 
due to the eroding barrier beach (Zuzek, 2020). Currently, ECCC is 
undertaking a study to assess coastal wetland vulnerability and enhance 
wetland resilience through adaptation. The vulnerability assessment will 
provide a better understanding of the climate-related impacts on coastal 
wetlands and recommend adaptation strategies and actions for enhanced 
coastal wetland resilience. These results and recommendations will be 
made available when the study is completed in 2022. 
4.0 	 Looking Ahead
If climate change continues at its current pace, the Great Lakes will be 
very different by the time our children and grandchildren grow up.
By the end of the century, the climate, water levels, and ice cover over the 
Great Lakes are anticipated to change significantly.
Over-land air temperatures are expected to increase significantly 
across the basin compared to 1961-2000. The greatest temperature 
increases are projected for the fall and winter seasons. Changes in 
average over-land air temperatures are expected to bring warmer winters, 
more extreme heat, a longer growing season, heavier precipitation, 
and less ice cover. The greatest increases in over-land air temperatures 
are expected for lakes Superior and Michigan-Huron. 
Over-lake precipitation is anticipated to increase in all seasons and over 
the year under both climate scenarios for all lakes, although the increase 
is generally less in the summer season. Changes in seasonal over-lake 
precipitation is anticipated to vary by lake and climate scenario. With 
warmer winters, snowfall is expected to decrease on average, with more 
precipitation falling as rain instead of snow. The greatest increases in 
over-lake precipitation are expected for lakes Superior and Ontario.  
Lake levels are anticipated to increase in variability as the climate changes, 
with more extreme high and extreme low values becoming possible with 
greater changes in global average temperatures. Lake level projections 
indicate significant deviations from lake-specific, long-term averages 
(1918-2019) across the basin with a slight upward trend on all lakes 
apparent in the latter half of the century. Lake Michigan-Huron is expected 
to experience the greatest variation in lake levels and has historically 
been the most variable among the Great Lakes (Wuebbles et al. 2019). 
Lakes Erie, St. Clair, and Ontario are also expected to see significant 
variations in lake levels. 
Ice cover is expected to decline across all lakes, especially in the months 
of February and March under the high-emissions scenario. In the future, 
there may be more years with little to no ice cover and shorter ice seasons 
during winter and spring. Average ice cover over lakes Superior and Erie 
show the greatest projected declines, followed by Lake Huron. Ice growth 
may also peak earlier for deeper lakes such as lakes Superior and Huron. 
 
Changes to the climate system over the Great Lakes basin can cause 
wide-ranging environmental, social, and economic impacts. These impacts 
are cumulative, compounding, and interactive, which can in turn lead to 
even more severe consequences. Based on the climate projections and 
impacts discussed in Sections 2.0 and 3.0, the following are key climate 
change risks identified for the Great Lakes basin that could be considered 
by resource managers to help reduce the negative impacts of climate 
change and build climate resilience. These include: 
•	 More frequent extreme high and low water levels 
•	 Increase in flooding and erosion 
•	 More variable and intense precipitation 
•	 Increase in storm-induced runoff carrying nutrients and 
	
contaminants into the lakes 
•	 Increase in combined sewer overflows 
•	 Increase in extreme weather events 
•	 More toxic and non-toxic algal blooms and dead zones 
•	 Increased stress on drinking water infrastructure 
•	 Increase in unsafe ice conditions for travel and recreation 
•	 Increase in the resuspension of contaminated sediments that 
	
can accumulate up the aquatic food chain 
•	 Increase in invasive species, pests, and diseases 
•	 Potential for reduced or interruptions to shipping and 
	
hydropower generation 
•	 Loss of cold/coolwater fish species habitat 
•	 Loss of wildlife habitat (e.g. breeding, spawning, and nursery), 
	
including essential habitats such as coastal wetlands 
•	 Loss of Indigenous traditional ways of life 
•	 Loss of sense of place and identity 
•	 Loss of livelihoods and local economic drivers
This list is not intended to be exhaustive but rather to highlight important 
risks that could serve as a starting point to make informed decisions on 
adaptation planning.

Appendix A: Detailed Description 
of the Methodology Used by 
Environment and Climate Change 
Canada to Develop the Climate and 
Water Level Projections 
As noted in Box 1, this Appendix provides a more detailed summary of the 
methodology used by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) 
to develop the climate and water level projections included in this report. 
The information presented in this summary is based on a report by 
Seglenieks and Temgoua (2021, in review).
The modelled climate data used by ECCC came from the Coupled Model 
Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), which were available from 
NA-CORDEX, the North American component of the International 
Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment program sponsored by 
the World Climate Research Program (WCRP). These datasets are based 
on dynamically downscaled future climate simulations driven by Global 
Climate Models (GCMs). 
Downscaling refers to the process of deriving higher resolution, regional 
climate data from GCMs, which divide the earth up into large grid cells 
that are often larger than 100 km by 100 km. Dynamic downscaling is one 
of two types of downscaling, which produces what is known as Regional 
Climate Models (RCMs). This involves running a high resolution model 
over a smaller area of interest, rather than the entire globe, to derive 
simulations on a scale of tens of square kilometres. Since the climate over 
the area of interest is influenced by processes outside the boundaries of 
that area, RCMs rely on GCMs to simulate the boundary conditions for the 
area of interest. At this higher resolution, RCMs offer better representation 
of the Great Lakes and most are able to capture lake processes, such as 
lake evaporation.

Statistical downscaling is the other type of downscaling, which relies 
on an understanding of the historical relationships observed between 
local climate variables (e.g., precipitation) and large-scale variables 
(e.g., atmospheric pressure). Mathematical equations are used to define 
these statistical relationships that have been observed historically and 
these equations are then applied to projections from GCMs to derive 
local climate projections. 
NA-CORDEX was the only known source of RCM data that was publicly 
available at the start of ECCC’s coastal wetland vulnerability assessment 
project that had the necessary variables and temporal resolution to 
accurately calculate water levels. Seven RCMs were included as part of the 
NA-CORDEX project, and each RCM was driven by a subset of the 6 GCMs. 
Among these RCMs, ECCC selected ones that had over-lake precipitation, 
basin temperature, and lake evaporation output available. As a result, 13 
RCM-GCM combinations were included in ECCC’s study (see Table A-1). 
Most of these RCMs use a one-dimensional lake model called FLake, 
which helps to derive more realistic simulations of lake dynamics 
compared to the absence of any lake model.

Lake level projections were developed based on the following factors, 
including the Net Basin Supply (NBS) of each lake, the inflow of water from 
the upstream lake, and the outflow to the downstream lake. The NBS refers 
to the net volume of local water supply coming into each lake. 
One way of calculating the NBS is by taking the sum of total over-lake 
precipitation and runoff into the lake from its surrounding drainage basin, 
and subtracting the evaporation from the lake (or over-lake evaporation). 
This is known as the component NBS. Each of the three components of the 
NBS were calculated separately for each lake and then combined into a 
single NBS for each lake. 
Data for both over-lake precipitation and over-lake evaporation were 
taken directly from the datasets available from the NA-CORDEX study. 
Over-lake precipitation refers to precipitation that falls on the lake’s 
surface. Meanwhile, over-lake evaporation refers to the amount of 
evaporation from the lake’s surface. 
The use of a hydrological model was necessary in order to determine 
runoff into the lake from its surrounding drainage basin. Runoff into 
the lake refers to the sum of water flowing into the lake from all of its 
surrounding rivers, excluding water from the upstream lake if there is one. 
While the RCMs provided runoff from each grid cell of the RCM, there is no 
direct calculation of the amount of flow into each lake. Hence, ECCC used 
a hydrological model called, WATFLOOD, to calculate runoff into each lake, 
which is able to route the flow from each grid cell down the river network 
and into each connecting lake to ensure proper timing of the runoff. This 
model has been used successfully in the Great Lakes for many years and 
there is an established method to calculate runoff into each of the Great Lakes. 
It uses hourly temperature and precipitation data as input to calculate 
the separation of runoff into surface runoff, interflow, and baseflow. 
The temperature and precipitation data that were used in the hydrological 
model were available from the NA-CORDEX project. 
The Coordinated Great Lakes Routing and Regulation Model (CGLRRM) 
was used to calculate the lake levels and flow of the connecting channels 
for the upper lakes (i.e., Lake Superior to Lake Erie). The CGLRRM uses the 
NBS for each lake as input and considers the regulation of Lake Superior 
outflows in calculating the flow from connecting channels. This model has 
shown good results in simulating historical lake levels and flows when run 
with historical NBS. In order to calculate the connecting channel flow, the 
CGLRRM makes assumptions about the conveyance of these channels. 
As the effects of climate change on the conveyance of connecting channels 
are unknown, it was assumed that the channels would remain stable and 
that conveyance relationships would be constant throughout all simulations.
For Lake Ontario, a separate regulation plan simulation model was used to 
calculate outflow from Lake Ontario based on the current regulation plan 
– Plan 2014. This model has been developed by ECCC and considers the 
flow of the Ottawa River and other tributaries that enter the St. Lawrence 
River downstream of Lake Ontario. 
As noted in Section 2.3, some projections for Lake Ontario under two 
RCP 8.5 models resulted in extremely high values due to the potential 
over-exaggeration of water accumulation from all Great Lakes flowing 
into Lake Ontario in the future and therefore have been excluded from 
our analysis. These extreme values have been excluded because it is 
impossible to anticipate what actions might be taken to alter flows out 
of the system if extremely high inflows were to occur in Lake Ontario in 
the future. The excluded values were from the following two RCM-GCM 
combinations: 
1.	 CRCRM5-GFDL-ESM2M (November 2060 to the end of 2095) 
	
– number 6 in Table A-1
2.	 CRCRM5-MPI-ESM-LR (December 2066 to the end of 2095) 
	
– number 7 in Table A-1.
It is important to remember that projections of climate parameters and 
lake levels are based on current understanding of the climate system and 
assumptions made about the future behaviour of society, which will result 
in the amount of carbon that will be put into the atmosphere. There are 
many uncertainties and assumptions that are inherent in these projections 
and thus the projections are most useful in showing general trends of 
what could happen in the future.
A Note on Bias Adjustment 
Bias correction was performed by ECCC for the following variables: 
over-lake precipitation, over-lake evaporation, runoff, and NBS. Bias 
correction refers to the process of adjusting simulated data to improve 
fit against observed data. It is well accepted that bias correction needs 
to be done in hydrological studies in order to obtain realistic output. 
However, it is important to note that the bias-corrected data is not 
meant to perfectly mimic the reference data over the specified time 
period, rather it is designed to have the same overall characteristics 
as the reference data. 
Bias correction was performed on projected over-lake precipitation, 
over-lake evaporation, and runoff because the RCMs will typically show 
bias for some variables and time periods. ECCC used a multivariate bias 
correction function and selected the time period of 1961-2000 as the 
reference historical period because it captures both wet and dry 
conditions while not overlapping with ramp-up periods used in the 
climate projections (i.e., 2006-2095), which could skew comparisons. 
For each individual dataset, the bias correction was completed for the 
current climate and then applied for the future climate. This is based 
on generally accepted practice whereby the bias in the simulation 
of the current climate is assumed to be the same in the simulation 
of the future climate.
Bias correction was also performed on future NBS. This was done by using 
another method to calculate the NBS, known as residual NBS. The residual 
NBS is determined based on the change in water level and the difference 
between the incoming flow and the outgoing flow. As these levels and 
flows are based on measured values, they have lower uncertainty than the 
different components used to determine component NBS (i.e., over-lake 
precipitation, runoff into the lake, and over-lake evaporation). The residual 
NBS is therefore generally considered to have lower uncertainty than the 
component NBS, and while the two methods calculate the NBS differently, 
their resulting values should be the same. Hence, the coordinated residual 
NBS was used as the reference dataset to bias-correct the future component 
NBS that has been calculated based on simulation data.

Appendix B: Detailed Description of 
the Methodology Used by the Nelson 
Institute Center for Climatic Research 
to Develop the Ice Cover Projections 
As noted in Box 1, this Appendix provides a more detailed summary 
of the methodology used by the Nelson Institute Center for Climatic 
Research (CCR) to develop the ice cover projections included in this report. 
The information presented in this summary is based on peer-reviewed 
articles by Notaro and others (2015; 2016).  
The modelled climate data used by CCR also came from the Coupled 
Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Simulations from six 
GCMs were dynamically downscaled according to RCP 8.5 using one 
RCM – RegCM4 (see Table B-1). RegCM4 has a resolution (or a “grid cell”) 
of 25 km by 25 km and was interactively coupled with a one-dimensional 
energy-balance lake model and lake ice submodel to produce ice cover 
projections (among other variables) that capture the dynamics of the 
Great Lakes.

The RCM outputs ice thickness for each lake grid cell. When ice thickness 
is 2 cm or more, 100 percent of ice cover was assumed for that grid cell. 
Otherwise it was set to 0 percent. Downscaled daily percentage lake ice 
cover was produced for three time periods: 1980-1999, 2040-2059, and 
2080-2099. Given the volume of daily data, the time periods only cover 20 
consecutive years. Only data from December to May was analyzed in this 
report, which represents the typical ice season across the Great Lakes. 
A Note on Bias Adjustment 
Bias adjustment was performed by the Ontario Climate Consortium (OCC) 
as the RCM-lake model used in the downscaling process tends to produce 
excessive ice cover. A simple delta change method was used by adding 
the difference between the observed historical and modelled historical 
data to modelled future data. This is again based on the generally accepted
practice whereby the bias in the simulation of the current climate is 
assumed to be the same in the simulation of the future climate. 
The delta change method was applied at the monthly scale. Monthly means 
between 1980-1999 were calculated for the six RCM-GCM simulations and 
the observed historical data obtained from NOAA-GLERL. The delta was 
calculated by taking the difference between the observed historical and 
modelled historical data for each of the six RCM-GCM combinations. These 
monthly deltas were then added back to the aggregated monthly modelled 
data (for both historical and future). When the percentage lake ice cover 
was a negative value, 0 percent ice cover was assumed. 
 
The length of the ice season between December and May was calculated 
for each year using daily ice cover data. The annual length of the ice 
season was then aggregated over the three periods, covering 1981-1999, 
2041-2049, and 2081-2099. The years 1980, 2040, and 2080 were not 
included because December data from the previous year was either not 
available for the modelled data (i.e. December 2039 and December 2079) 
or not included for the observed data for consistency (i.e. December 1979).  
The same delta change method was applied to the average length of the 
ice season for the two future periods. The delta was calculated by taking 
the difference between the observed historical average length of the ice 
season and the modelled historical average length of the ice season for 
each of the six RCM-GCM combinations. The deltas were then added back 
to the modelled future average length of the ice season for 2041-2049 and 
2081-2099. When the average length of the ice season was negative, 0 
days was assumed.
