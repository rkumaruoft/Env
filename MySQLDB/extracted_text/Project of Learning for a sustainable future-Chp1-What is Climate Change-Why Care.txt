Chapter 1. What is Climate Change and Why Care?
In this initial inquiry, students will explore and learn about the differences between weather and
climate and understand the basic scientific principles of climate change through books, videos
and interpretations of an infographic. You may find there are more activities than a class can
complete. Several activities have been included so that every kind of learner can find ideas,
questions, and activities that inspire learning that leads to action.
Climate change is a wicked problem that is increasingly affecting human health, species
distribution, and the ability of the earth’s ecosystems to sustain our physical, economic, social,
and environmental needs. The reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) and other leading scientific organizations have become increasingly urgent. Alongside
this urgency, media reporting consistently uses a doomsday framing, which can leave viewers
with a sense of anxiety or paralysis.
In this inquiry, we suggest that educators begin by talking with children about the weather and
climate. This will help them understand the more difficult concept of climate change. We also
suggest framing learning pathways broadly by connecting to actions that students identify as
personally relevant and important to them.

Before you begin: Background Information for Educators
Canada’s climate is changing at an accelerated rate: since 1948 Canada’s annual average land
temperature has increased by 1.5°C—roughly double the global average level of warming
(Natural Resources Canada). “It has been clear for decades that the Earth’s climate is changing,
and the role of human influence on the climate system is undisputed,” said Masson-Delmotte.
Yet the new report also reflects major advances in the science of attribution – understanding the
role of climate change in intensifying specific weather and climate events such as extreme heat
waves and heavy rainfall events” (Climate change widespread, rapid, and intensifying – IPCC,
2021)
It is true that there are many natural forces that play a role in determining the Earth’s climate:
the Earth’s orbit around the sun, changing ocean currents, very large volcanic eruptions and the
Earth’s tilt, and there is a great deal of evidence that the world has warmed and cooled in
decades before humans existed. However climate changes have never occurred at a pace as
3
rapid or as drastic as we have seen since pre-industrial time, and these changes cannot be
explained by any natural phenomena (Prairie Climate Centre). These changes are a cause for
concern but, more importantly, they are also a call to action to mitigate current and future effects
and adapt to the changes that are already happening and/or likely to happen in the near future.
“Adaptation builds resilience and reduces risk related to current and future climate change
impacts. It involves adjusting plans, policies and actions, and can be reactive (i.e., occurring in
response to climate change impacts) or anticipatory (i.e., occurring before impacts of climate
change are observed).” (NRCAN, p. 19)
Climate vs. Weather
The difference between weather and climate is that whereas weather describes an event
occurring at a particular time and place - a storm moving in over a city for example - climate
describes the typical weather that a location experiences based on the study of weather
conditions over long periods of time. An often heard expression is that 'climate is what you
expect, and weather is what you get'. ( Let's Talk Energy - Climate vs. Weather: A collaborative
project with the Royal Canadian Geographical Society (RCGS) and Ingenium)
To better understand the difference between climate and weather, watch this video by National
Geographic that features Neil Degrasse Tyson.
Greenhouse Effect
“A greenhouse is used to create a warmer growing environment for plants that would otherwise
not survive in the colder conditions outdoors. In a greenhouse, energy from the sun passes
through the glass as rays of light. This energy is absorbed by the plants, soil and other objects
in the greenhouse. Much of this absorbed energy is converted to heat, which warms the
greenhouse. The glass helps keep the greenhouse warm, by preventing the warmed air from
escaping.” (Ingenium, 2022)
Climate Change Impacts
Some of the many impacts of climate change include: biodiversity, ecosystems, species loss
and extinction. If the global community is able to limit the increase in temperature to 1.5
degrees, the impacts on terrestrial, freshwater and coastal ecosystems are expected to be
lower. According to the Council of Canadian Academies’ expert panel on climate change risks
and adaptation potential, Canada faces substantial risk with a likelihood of significant losses,
damages, or disruptions in Canada over a 20 year timeframe in the following areas: agriculture
and food; coastal communities; ecosystems; fisheries; forestry; geopolitical dynamics;
governance and capacity; human health and wellness; Indigenous ways of life; northern
communities; physical infrastructure; and water.
Climate Change Knowledge & Understanding
Overall, Canadians are quite certain that climate change is happening. According to the national
survey Canadians’ Perspectives on Climate Change & Education (2022) conducted by Learning
for a Sustainable Future, 81% of all Canadians believe that climate change is happening.
However, the population is less certain that humans are the primary cause of the warming
climate; only 54% of respondents think that climate change is caused mostly by human activity.
4
When this understanding is contrasted with the widespread scientific consensus that climate
change is primarily caused by the human activity of burning fossil fuels, the urgent need for
more comprehensive education on the subject is made clear.
Another finding from the report, Canada, Climate Change and Education: Opportunities for
Public and Formal Education, found that 46% of students ages 12-18 are categorized as
“aware,” meaning they understand that human-caused climate change is happening, but they do
not believe that human efforts to stop it will be effective. This is an opportunity for schools to
help students understand that there are strategies and solutions to address climate change if all
sectors take action today.
General Introduction to the inquiries in this chapter:
This chapter offers 3 different structured and scaffolded inquiries to support What is Climate
Change and Why Care? Numerous strategies are included in each of the inquiries.
These explorations can be completed in their entirety as stated, however, because we know
inquiry is an organic and fluid process based on student input, educators may wish to take parts
of each of the 3 ideas presented and even adapt, modify or replace what’s suggested to create
their own inquiry with their class. It is therefore suggested that teachers review the whole
chapter first in order to determine and plan what works best with their particular group of
learners.
The following 3 inquiries are connected to curricular concepts as shown in this chart. These
curricular concepts are applicable across Canada.

Tool: Journaling
Encourage students to record their thinking and learning throughout the learning process. The
main reason for developing a journal is for students to then be able to look back and track their
growth and progression with their connection to climate change. Students scaffold their thinking
throughout their learning journey. The entries can be a combination of personal reflections and
assigned reflections. This can be done as illustrations, concept maps or written reflections.
Inquiry 1: Understanding Weather vs. Climate
Students will explore climate change concepts based on a non-fiction text and explore how
climate is different from weather.

A. Provocation
To hook student interest, introduce the provocation to initiate student thinking.
Book:
The book identified here is one suggested title to introduce the concept and spark discussion
on climate change, but there are numerous picture books and other literature that can be
used for the same purpose. This link from Lakehead University’s library offers a succinct
collection of relevant titles that could be found in other school or public libraries.
Alternatively, Learning for a Sustainable Future (LSF), has a site called Resources for
Rethinking (R4R.ca) that allows the user to do various searches. By clicking on their
Children's Literature link and identifying the grade and the theme of “Climate Change” in the
drop down boxes, another set of suggested titles will appear that could be helpful.
The following is the publisher’s synopsis of the book What is Climate Change by Gail
Herman.
What is Climate Change? By Gail Herman
The earth is definitely getting warmer. There’s no argument about that,
but who or what is the cause? And why has climate change become a
political issue? Are humans at fault? Is this just a natural development?
While the vast majority of scientists who study the environment agree
that humans play a large part in climate change, there is a
counterargument. Author Gail Herman presents both sides of the
debate in this fact-based, fair-minded, and well-researched book that
looks at the subject from many perspectives, including scientific, social,
and political.
Example Activity
●
Read the introductory chapter aloud. This introduction uses an example of how the
1
polar bear’s life has changed since 2016 due to the effects of climate change.
●
Follow this by listening to the first 2:06 minutes of “What is Climate Change”? (this
corresponds to Chapter 1: Things are Heating Up in the story and then continues to
explain what is happening as a result of rising temperatures).
●
The rest of the sound bite (from 2:05 - the end) explains the impacts of this
phenomenon around the world. You might want to have students listen to the entire
clip. In this case, have a large world map available to point out the various regions
mentioned (e.g., Arctic Ocean, Alaska, Lake Chad in Africa, etc.). As well, compare
the imperial measurements mentioned (i.e., 2 and 8 inches) to their metric
conversions, which students can visualize using a ruler.
As you read through the book, discuss how people, animals and plants are feeling and
affected by these changes.
Possible Discussion Questions:
●
What is your favourite weather? Why?
●
What would happen if it never stopped raining? Or if it didn’t rain at all?
●
Who or what is the cause of climate change?
●
Why has climate change become a political issue?
●
Is this just a natural development?
●
Are humans at fault?
●
Help younger students with question starters (Who, what, where, when, why and
how).
●
Look at the chapter titles in the book, and think about what questions you would ask
before reading the chapter.
●
Does climate change affect humans and animals?
●
How do the decisions made by the government impact people's lives in relation to
climate change?
Extension Activity Suggestions:
●
Get Outside: Challenge students to find examples of climate change actions from in
and around the school yard that they can photograph. For example, solar panels on a
building, wind mills, trees providing shade, green spaces replacing asphalt for
cooling, or different ideas for greening school grounds. Visit Evergreen for more
information and ideas: School Ground Greening Projects
●
Explore the activity from Green Teacher magazine called Weathering Climate
Confusion to clarify the difference between climate and weather while alerting
students to levels of public confusion about the two terms.
2
B. Question Generation
At this point in the inquiry, we want to harness students’ curiosity and build off the
provocations that have captured their interest by generating meaningful questions to
continue to drive the learning process. This section will outline pathways for question
generation depending on the provocation(s) that your class engaged with.
Use a Q Chart to assist in developing questions. This question creation chart provides an
example of this in practice. Learn more here.
Example Activity: Have students generate as many questions as they can in a given period
of time (4-5 minutes) based on what they heard/read in the book, What is Climate Change?
by Gail Herman. Write each question on a separate sticky note. Help students to understand
the types of questions they have asked by having them place their sticky note in the correct
quadrant.
Here is a sample of how to classify your questions using a simple, familiar text.
It may be helpful to colour code the chart as in this image below.
Those in the pink quadrant (factual), or remembering and
understanding, are the lowest order of questions. These answers
can usually be found “right there” in the text. Who climbed up
the water spout?
Those in the yellow quadrant (analytical), or applying and
analyzing, are those answers that can also be found in the text
but students need to “think and search” the text and make
inferences to find answers. How many times did the spider
climb the spout?
Those in the blue quadrant (predictive), involve understanding
and applying, requiring students to dig deeper into the text to try
to interpret what the author is saying. Why do you think the
spider decided to climb back up the spout?
Those in the green quadrant (evaluating), are highest order
thinking questions; students need to look beyond the text and evaluate and analyze what the
author is saying. Have you ever tried and failed at something the first time, and yet had
the courage to come back and try again? (myalwayslearning)

C. Knowledge Building
At this stage, students may be ready to engage in a group knowledge building activity. It will
encourage students to open their minds to many alternative ways of thinking about the
provocations and ideas that have been generated thus far in the inquiry process.
Have students continue their thinking through the Think, See, Wonder routine.
Example Activity : Have students look at the cover of the book and/or any of the
illustrations within the book or images from any other of the picture books found in this list.
Based on what they see and what they think from their previous knowledge, have them
brainstorm ideas for “what they wonder” about weather and climate.
D. Determining Understanding
Use responses to inform and guide the learning process. They can provide
insight into which concepts need clarity, what students are already well
informed about, and a general direction that students want to pursue.
Work with students to fill out the “Know” and “Want” columns of a
KWL (Know-Want-Learned) Chart in relation to the questions generated.
Use responses to inform and guide the learning process. Students can provide insight into
which concepts need clarity, what they are already well informed about, and a general
direction that many students want to pursue.
Sample KWL Chart:
TOPIC:
K – What I Already Know
W – What I Want to Know
L – What I Learned
E. Pursuing Learning
At this stage, students may begin research to pursue some of their questions, or
some of the following activities could be integrated into the process to ensure
that students have an understanding of foundational climate science. The
activities listed below will enrich the understanding of climate change.
4
Example Activity:
Climate Change 101 is a learning module that was created for Learning for a Sustainable
Future by Let’s Talk Science.This learning module is suitable for grades 3-4 students to
complete as a class or grade 5-6 students to complete individually or with a partner. It is
made up of three lessons on the science of climate change. Lesson 1: What are the
indicators of climate change, Lesson 2: What is the greenhouse effect?, and Lesson 3: How
can we tackle this problem?
F. Consolidation
This step is designed to encourage students to integrate and synthesize key
ideas. When students make connections and see relationships within and across
lessons, this helps them to solidify knowledge and deepen understanding.
Example Activities:
Journal reflection prompts:
This is why I care about climate change...
●
Thinking about my questions, this is why I think the question is important and what
I currently know…
●
Reflect how you would explain (text or drawing) any of the following to a
classmate, family member, or neighbour: climate vs. weather, how the
greenhouse effect works, the effects of climate change especially in our
community (or province/territory or nation).
15 Meaningful and Hands-On Climate Change Activities for Kids From We Are
Teachers students can choose to try any of the 15 science-based activities to reinforce
their understanding of weather vs. climate change. These 15 activities are all linked to
questions, instructions, and explanations, from credible websites and organizations.
Students can choose activities or teachers can assign ones for consolidation.
Assessment Idea
Teachers will assess learning at different points throughout the inquiry using multiple
methods. The following assessment provides an alternative evaluation method to standard
quizzes and tests that can be used after consolidation or at any point in the lesson to check
for understanding.
Using the RAFT (Role, Audience, Format and Topic) strategy helps students understand
their role and how to effectively communicate their ideas clearly to their chosen audience.
Example Assessment: You are school artists and you are invited to explain to the school
community the difference between weather and climate. You have been given space on a
graffiti wall where you can share your ideas and opinions about the difference between
5
weather and climate. Be ready to present it to the school community.
Take Action:
These ideas for action can be utilized at any point in the learning process,
whether it’s now or after completing more guided inquiries. Note, the
suggestions are consistent in each chapter.
Allowing time for students to take action is an essential part of the learning process on
climate change, as it empowers students and eases their eco-anxiety.
Ask the students what they want to do to positively impact climate change. List their ideas
and come up with a plan to put their action in place.
Ideas for Taking Action:
●
Educate your community about the risks posed by climate change
●
Create posters that represent some of the local risks to your community
●
Organize an assembly to present information in an engaging manner
●
Perform a school-wide waste audit, and make a plan for a less wasteful path
forward (one example is offered through EcoSchools at School Waste Audit)
●
Take a personal or class pledge to make lifestyle changes:
○
Reduce meat intake
○
Reduce use of single-use plastics
○
Eco-friendly options in place of single-use items (e.g., plastic water
bottles, paper coffee cups, etc.)
○
Walk or bike to school
○
Use both sides of paper
○
Turn off the lights when leaving a room
○
Unplug things when not in use
●
Plant trees
Action Project Examples:
Watch this video titled ‘Change the World’ in 5 minutes. It is about an elementary class
who has decided that they would spend the first 5 minutes of school each day of the week
implementing sustainable change to the world. It’s more of a movement that gives the youth
the power to make a difference.
Visit Young Voices for the Planet for a myriad of ideas!
The mission of Young Voices for the Planet (YVFP) is to limit and mitigate the magnitude
and impacts of climate change by empowering youth, through uplifting and inspiring success
stories, to take an essential role in informing themselves, their peers and their
communities—becoming leaders and changing laws, changing minds and changing the
world.

“OUTDOOR ED PROJECT: OUTDOOR LEARNING IS WHERE IT’S AT!”-Father Fenelon
Catholic School- Pickering, ON (2017) K-8
●
The students decided how to create different learning areas in the outdoors. As
small groups committed to designing and implementing ideas, student teams
worked to create the areas for climate change learning in their schoolyard. They
believe that it is vital for students to be a part of the learning outdoors and create
a strong connection to their learning environment. Students from Kindergarten to
Grade 8 were involved in ensuring that the project continues to be part of their
learning at school. See their project here.

A. Provocation
To hook student interest, introduce the provocation to initiate student thinking.
Infographics
“Infographics allow students to share information in a creative way,” as Sandy Cangelosi
claims in her online article, 4 Effective Uses of Infographics in the Elementary Classroom.
●
Share the “What is Climate Change?” infographic from Ingenium’s Let’s Talk Energy
resource with your students. Explore the visuals before deconstructing the text. In the
main image we see a polar bear, perched atop of an iceberg, which becomes the
smoke from a smokestack from a factory in a big city next to a flaming tree. There is
a lot happening in this imagery.
●
Have students discuss what messages the image is trying to convey.
●
Begin to deconstruct the text by size. The largest text tells us what the infographic is
about. As the text gets smaller, the information gets more detailed. Depending on the
grade level of your students you can decide how much information they will be able
to interpret.
Possible Discussion Questions:
●
An infographic tells a story about data. What is the main point of the story that this
infographic is telling?
●
What is the first thing you notice when you look at this infographic?
●
What picture or piece of information is standing out in your mind after viewing this
infographic? Why does that “speak” to you the most?
B. Question Generation
At this point in the inquiry, we want to harness students’ curiosity and build off
the provocations that have captured their interest by generating meaningful
questions to continue to drive the learning process. This section will outline pathways for
question generation depending on the provocation(s) that your class engaged with.
1
What Makes You Say That? Is a strategy that promotes evidential reasoning
(evidence-based reasoning.)
Example Activity:
●
How do some of the smaller images help to tell the story?
●
How does the size of the font help you understand the story this infographic is
telling?
●
What [vocabulary] words are directly associated with climate change? Create a word
wall to ensure that all students understand these important terms.
●
Have you read about or heard about an area affected by one of the effects of climate
change mentioned in the image? Where was this and what happened?
With your class, develop Umbrella Questions, focused questions on climate change that
are of interest to the students. It may take several drafts to develop umbrella questions that
meet both student and teacher expectations.
In the example below, the quotes are from the infographic and the questions are possible
questions that stem from the quote. These questions can be used as is or students can be
encouraged to generate questions based on the quotes.
Example Activity:
●
“Climate change affects biodiversity”
○
What is biodiversity?
○
How does climate change affect plants and animals?
●
“Climate change is due to natural factors and human factors”
○
What natural factors contribute to climate change?
○
What human factors contribute to climate change?
■
What can we, as humans, do to stop climate change?
●
“Greenhouse gas emissions are the main cause of climate change”
○
What are greenhouse gases and what causes their increase in our
atmosphere?
○
Are there any alternatives to energy that don’t produce greenhouse gases?
●
“Adaptation and mitigation are strategies for responding to climate change”
○
What does adaptation mean? What are adaptation strategies that respond to
climate change?
○
What does mitigation mean? What are some mitigation strategies that
respond to climate change?
C. Knowledge Building
At this stage, students may be ready to engage in a group knowledge building activity. It will
encourage students to open their minds to many alternative ways of thinking about the
provocations and ideas that have been generated thus far in the inquiry process.
2
Another strategy used in this infographic to “tell a story” is the use of colour. Each
colour—yellow, blue, grey and green—helps focus attention on different issues surrounding
climate change. Place 4 pieces of coloured construction paper on the board or on a piece of
chart paper and have students work in pairs or small groups to generate questions for each
colour on sticky notes (same colour if possible).
From these sticky note questions, work as a class to develop Umbrella Questions focused
on the “big ideas” of climate change. These questions will help ground the inquiry.
D. Determining Understanding
Use responses to inform and guide the learning process. They can provide
insight into which concepts need clarity, what students are already well
informed about, and a general direction that students want to pursue.
Example Activity:
If you used the KWL Chart in the book provocation from Inquiry 1, students could return to
their KWL chart and make revisions based on their new learnings.
Work with students to fill out the “Know” and “Want” columns of a
KWL (Know-Want-Learned) Chart in relation to the umbrella questions.
Sample KWL Chart:
TOPIC:
K – What I Already Know
W – What I Want to Know
L – What I Learned
E. Pursuing Learning
At this stage, students may begin research to pursue their umbrella questions,
or some of the following activities could be integrated into the process to
ensure that students have an understanding of foundational climate science. The activities
listed below will enrich the understanding of climate change.
Have students make a claim using the Claim Support Question strategy.
3
Example Activity:
1.
Make a claim (a statement that is an explanation or interpretation) from what you see
on the infographic.
2.
Identify support (things you see, feel or know) for your claim.
3.
Ask a question related to your claim. What isn’t explained that you can explore
further?
Alternatively you can have students use the Facts or Fiction routine to think more critically
about the truth in something presented to them.
Example Activity:
1.
What information do you think this infographic is trying to tell you?
2.
Who would decide that this information is important to know and learn?
3.
What information do you think needs proof to be believed?
4.
Are there any facts on this infographic that we could question and need more
information to understand or believe?
5.
What parts of this infographic do you think are true? What makes you think that?
6.
Are there any parts of this infographic that you think may not be true? What makes
you think that?
F. Consolidation
This step is designed to encourage students to integrate and synthesize key
ideas. When students make connections and see relationships within and
across lessons, this helps them to solidify knowledge and deepen
understanding.
Have students work in small groups in a Circle of Action to discuss and brainstorm
potential responsible and reasonable action.
Example Activity:
Knowing what we have learned about climate change so far, what can I do to contribute to
reducing the effects of climate change…
1. In my inner circle (of friends, family, the people I know)?
2. In my community (my school, my neighbourhood)?
3. In the world (beyond my immediate environment)?
Ask students to create a headline based on the material presented so far.
Example Activity:
1.
Write a headline that captures the most important aspect of this topic/issue.
2.
How does your headline differ from what you would have said before we explored
this topic?
3.
How has your headline grabbed the readers’ attention?
4
Assessment Idea
Teachers will assess learning at different points throughout the inquiry using
multiple methods. The following assessment provides an alternative evaluation
method to standard quizzes and tests that can be used after consolidation or at any point in
the lesson to check for understanding.
Use the 3-2-1 Strategy to have students summarize their learning by identifying 3 things
they have learned, 2 things they would like to learn more about and 1 question they still
have.
Example Activity:
1.
Three - After the lesson, have each student record three things he or she learned
from the lesson.
2.
Two - Next, have students record two things that they found interesting and that
they’d like to learn more about.
3.
One - Then, have students record one question they still have about the material
4.
Review - Finally, the most important step is to review the students’ responses. You
can use this information to help develop future lessons and determine if some of the
material needs to be taught again.
Take Action
These ideas for action can be utilized at any point in the learning process,
whether it’s now or after completing more guided inquiries. Note, the
suggestions are consistent in each chapter.
Allowing time for students to take action is an essential part of the learning process on
climate change, as it empowers students and eases their eco-anxiety.

Video 3: Climate Change for Kids | A fun engaging introduction to climate change for
kids [Learn Bright] - 11:34 minutes
This video explains climate change, we encourage teachers to watch the video and
identify the teachable moments or sections for your age group.
Video 4: Climate Change 101 with Bill Nye [National Geographic]- 4:09 minutes
Climate change is a real and serious issue. In this video Bill Nye, the Science Guy,
explains what causes climate change, how it affects our planet, why we need to act
promptly to mitigate its effects, and how each of us can contribute to a solution.

Bill Nye says that the most important thing to take away from this video is that ‘climate
change is real and it’s happening.’ This is a simple statement supported by a lot of
evidence, but it is something that is not agreed upon by everyone; why could this still be
the case? How might it be slowing progress?
Video 5: The Carbon Footprint of a Sandwich [NPR’s Skunk Bear] - 3:05 minutes
Follow the path of a BLT sandwich, from field to plate.
The connection in this video between human activity and the carbon dioxide produced is
not the most obvious one. Are you surprised at the impact of a slice of bread or a piece
of bacon? Why or why not? Are there certain foods that you think would emit less
greenhouse gases in production? How can you find out?
Possible Discussion Questions:
●
What did you hear that surprised you?
●
Did you learn anything new?
●
Do you have any questions about climate change?
B. Question Generation
At this point in the inquiry, we want to harness students’ curiosity and build off the
provocations that have captured their interest by generating meaningful questions
to continue to drive the learning process. This section will outline pathways for question
generation depending on the provocation(s) that your class engaged with.
Using the following Creative Question Starts, have your students work in pairs or small groups
to come up with as many questions regarding the information presented in the videos starting
with: “Why…?”, “What if…?”, “What is the purpose of…?”, “How would it be different…?”, “What
if we knew…?”, and “What would change if…?”
C. Knowledge Building
At this stage, students may be ready to engage in a group knowledge building
activity. It will encourage students to open their minds to many alternative ways of thinking about
the provocations and ideas that have been generated thus far in the inquiry process.
Intended for students to think about what they’re learning, use the Stop and Jot strategy to
have students record their thoughts while pausing at various times in the lesson.
Or

Use the Think, Pair, Share strategy to build confidence, encourage greater participation and
share what they’re learning.
Example Activity:
After watching several or all 5 videos suggested above (or after viewing other relevant videos
having to do with climate change), have students Stop and Jot down things they have learned
on sticky notes. Only one piece of paper should be used for each thought. Alternatively, this
could be done during and/or after each video as well. Once sufficient time has been provided,
students should share their points with a peer using the Think, Pair, Share protocol.
D. Determining Understanding
Use responses to inform and guide the learning process. They can provide
insight into which concepts need clarity, what students are already well informed
about, and a general direction that students want to pursue.
Work with students to fill out the “Know” and “Want” columns of a
KWL (Know-Want-Learned) Chart in relation to the Stop and Jot activity.
Sample KWL Chart:
TOPIC:
K – What I Already Know
W – What I Want to Know
L – What I Learned
E. Pursuing Learning
At this stage, students may begin research to pursue their various questions, or
some of the following activities could be integrated into the process to ensure that
students have an understanding of foundational climate science. The activities listed below will
enrich the understanding of climate change.
Try a sensory walk to have students explore new or different sensory experiences.
Example Activity: (this can be done during all seasons and weather!)
3
To make students aware of their environment using their senses, have them notice the weather
on that particular day. If it is windy, can they feel the wind on their body parts? What direction is
the wind coming from? Have them notice where the sun is and if they feel the heat. Have them
notice the shape of the clouds. Are they moving? Do the shapes of the clouds remind you of
anything? In the winter, if it is snowing, go outside and look at snowflakes closely. Look at your
snowflakes and compare them with a friend, are they the same?
For other ideas on focused sensory walks, explore A Walking Curriculum by Gillian Judson.
“Walking activities are designed to:
●
engage the body, emotions, and imagination in ways that can increase familiarity with
the local and natural contexts of school and learning;
●
increase attention to detail, particularity and their connection with place;
●
connect place-based learning activities with cross-curricular goals”
F. Consolidation
This step is designed to encourage students to integrate and synthesize key ideas.
When students make connections and see relationships within and across lessons,
this helps them to solidify knowledge and deepen understanding.
Have students synthesize their understanding by “Tweeting” It Out!.
Example Activity:
In its inception, Twitter would only post tweets of 140 characters or less. More recently in 2021
they have doubled the limit to 280, although studies have found fewer words (70-100) to be
most effective (What’s the Ideal Length of a Tweet?).With all of the information students have
gained from the videos they’ve watched, have students summarize their learning in a “tweet”
abiding by Twitter’s word count. They may wish to include hashtags as well to demonstrate their
social media skills but also their understanding of the content as they know it to date.
Assessment Idea
Teachers will assess learning at different points throughout the inquiry using multiple
methods. The following assessment provides an alternative evaluation method to standard
quizzes and tests, that can be used after consolidation or at any point in the lesson to check for
understanding.
Students are instructed to write down the positives, negatives and interesting features of a topic,
question or situation using the Plus, Minus, Interesting strategy.
Example Activity:
4
Once students have watched any or all of the videos, have them work in pairs to identify the
ideas presented in the videos that fit into each column. For example:
PLUS
MINUS
INTERESTING
List all of the positive ideas
that were presented in the
video(s).
List all of the negative ideas
or problems that arise from
the ideas presented in the
video(s).
List all of the interesting
ideas, neither positive or
negative, that arise from the
ideas presented in the
video(s).
Take Action:
These ideas for action can be utilized at any point in the learning process,
whether it’s now or after completing more guided inquiries. Note, the suggestions
are consistent in each chapter.
Allowing time for students to take action is an essential part of the learning process on climate
change, as it empowers students and eases their eco-anxiety.
Ask the students what they want to do to positively impact climate change. List their ideas and
come up with a plan to put their action in place.
Ideas for Taking Action:
●
Educate your community about the risks posed by climate change
●
Create posters that represent some of the local risks to your community
●
Organize an assembly to present information in an engaging manner
●
Perform a school-wide waste audit, and make a plan for a less wasteful path forward
(one example is offered through EcoSchools at School Waste Audit
●
Take a personal or class pledge to make lifestyle changes:
○
○Reduce meat intake
○
○Reduce use of single-use plastics
○
○Use eco-Friendly and/or reusable cups
○
○Walk or bike to school
○
○Use both sides of paper
○
○Turn off the lights when leaving a room
○
○Unplug things when not in use
●
Plant trees

Action Project Examples:
Watch this video titled ‘Change the World’ in 5 minutes. It is about an elementary class who
has decided that they would spend the first 5 minutes of school each day of the week
implementing sustainable change to the world. It’s more of a movement that gives the youth the
power to make a difference.
Visit Young Voices for the Planet for a myriad of ideas!
The mission of Young Voices for the Planet (YVFP) is to limit and mitigate the magnitude and
impacts of climate change by empowering youth, through uplifting and inspiring success stories,
to take an essential role in informing themselves, their peers and their communities—becoming
leaders and changing laws, changing minds and changing the world.
“OUTDOOR ED PROJECT: OUTDOOR LEARNING IS WHERE IT’S AT!”-Father Fenelon
Catholic School- Pickering, ON (2017) K-8
●
The students decided how to create different learning areas in the outdoors. As small
groups committed to designing and implementing ideas, student teams worked to
create the areas for climate change learning in their schoolyard. They believe that it
is vital for students to be a part of the learning outdoors and create a strong
connection to their learning environment. Students from Kindergarten to Grade 8
were involved in ensuring that the project continues to be part of their learning at
school. See their project here.
