APPENDIX 1 
Glossary of Terms
Glossary of Key Terms:
•	 Adaptation: Adaptation is how we respond or prepare for climate 
change and weather variability (INAC, 2010). It is the process by 
which people and natural systems respond to actual or anticipated 
climate, either to minimize or avoid harm or take advantage of new 
opportunities (IPCC, 2014). 
	‐ Proactive Adaptation: adaptation that occurs before a climate 
change impact is observed or felt.
•	 Adaptive Capacity: Adaptive capacity is the ability to adjust to changing 
circumstances. It includes the ability of systems, institutions, humans, 
and other animals and plants to adjust to potential damage, to take 
advantage of opportunities, or to respond to consequences (IPCC, 2013).
•	 Climate Change: a change in global or regional climate patterns, 
in particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century 
onwards and attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric 
carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels (Oxford Dictionary, 
2019).
•	 Climate Model: Computer driven representations of potential future 
climate conditions, including changes in temperature, precipitation, and 
other physical characteristics of the climate system (Hayhoe, 2017)
•	 Climate Projection: A climate projection is an estimation of future 
climate, determined by a climate model (IPCC, 2013).
•	 Climate Resilience: Resilience can be thought of as the ability of the 
community to prevent, respond to, or recover from a disturbance (e.g. a 
climate change impact) (US Government, 2020).
•	 Climate Scenario: A climate scenario is a possible picture of what future climate could look like. Climate 
scenarios are developed and used to investigate and understand the potential impacts of human induced 
climate change (IPCC, 2001).
•	 Community-Based Monitoring: a process where citizens, community 
groups, government agencies, industry, members of the academic 
community, and/or local institutions work together “to monitor, track, 
and respond to issues of common community concern” (EMAN and 
CNF, 2003). 
	‐ Indigenous Guardians Program: many communities have 
implemented an Indigenous Guardians program, where guardians 
monitor ecological health, maintain cultural sites, and protect 
sensitive areas and species (ILI, 2019). Guardians serve as the “eyes on 
the ground” in Indigenous territories (ILI, 2019). To learn more, visit 
the Indigenous Guardians Pilot Program (https://www.canada.ca/
en/environment-climate-change/services/environmental-funding/
indigenous-guardians-pilot-program.html), Indigenous Leadership 
Initiative (https://www.ilinationhood.ca/our-work/guardians/), and 
Indigenous Guardians Toolkit (https://www.indigenousguardianstoolkit.ca). 
•	 Consequence or Impact: The effect of extreme weather, climate events and climate change on natural and 
human systems (IPCC, 2014).
•	 Critical Infrastructure: The physical structures, facilities, networks and other assets which provide services 
that are essential to the social and economic functioning of a community or society (UN-ISDR, 2017)
Appendices  |  Guidance Book: Resources For Winter Roads, Wildfire, Flooding, & Coastal Erosion      3 
•	 Consequence or Impact: The effect of extreme weather, climate  
events and climate change on natural and human systems (IPCC, 2014).
•	 Critical Infrastructure: The physical structures, facilities, networks and 
other assets which provide services that are essential to the social and 
economic functioning of a community or society (UN-ISDR, 2017)
•	 Exposure: The presence of people, livelihoods, species or ecosystems, 
environmental services and resources, infrastructure, or economic, 
social, or cultural assets that could be negatively affected by a climate 
impact (IPCC, 2013). 
•	 Flooding: Flooding is the overflowing of water onto land that is normally 
dry (Lyle, 2017).
	‐ Coastal Flooding: Coastal flooding occurs along the coast of a sea, 
ocean, or other large body of open water. The likelihood and intensity 
of coastal flooding is increased by severe weather and sea level rise 
(Maddox, 2014).
	‐ Inland Flooding: There are two types of inland floods - fluvial flooding 
and pluvial flooding. Fluvial or riverine floods occur in areas along 
rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water and may result from rainfall, 
snow and ice melt, and ice jams. Pluvial flooding can happen without 
being near an open/flowing bodies of water. They are a result from 
excessive rainfall and often accompanied by high groundwater levels 
(Maddox, 2014).
•	 Geospatial: relating to data that is associated with a particular location.
•	 Hazard: a process, phenomenon or human activity that may cause loss  
of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, social and 
economic disruption or environmental degradation (UN-ISDR, 2017)
	‐ Climate Hazard: a physical process or event that can cause harm to 
human health, livelihoods, or the natural environment (The World 
Bank, 2019). Examples of climate hazards include thunderstorms, 
drought, rain, hail, snow, lightning, fog, wind, temperature extremes, 
air pollution, and climate change (Hobbs, 1987).
•	 Hazard Assessment: The process to determine the extent, intensity, 
frequency, or likelihood of a hazard occurring.
•	 Hydrology: the branch of science concerned with the properties of  
the earth’s water, and especially its movement in relation to land.
4      Climate Change Adaptation Planning Toolkit for Indigenous Communities
•	 Indigenous Knowledge: A holistic system of knowledge acquired  
over time through experience or observation and is tied to the cultural, 
linguistic, spiritual and subsistence ways of Indigenous peoples (CIER 
and UBC, 2011).
•	 Resilience: Resilience is the ability/capacity of a system to absorb 
disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change in order to 
maintain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and 
feedbacks (Walker et al., 2004).
•	 Risk: Risk is a measurement of the potential impacts of a hazard over 
time. Risk is the probability of an event occurring multiplied by its 
negative consequences if they occur (Ebbwater Consulting, 2016).
•	 Risk Assessment: The process to determine risk levels.
•	 Vulnerability: The conditions determined by physical, social, economic and environmental factors or 
processes which increase the susceptibility of an individual, a community, assets or systems to the impacts 
of hazards (UN-ISDR, 2017). 
•	 Sustainable Development: Sustainable development is development  
that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability 
of future generations to meet their own needs (Brundtland, 1987).
	‐ Deborah McGregor (2006) offers an additional perspective on the 
concept of sustainable development and Indigenous Knowledge/
Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK): “…many environmental 
professionals believe that science and technology, at least on their 
own, cannot extricate us from our current crises. Other approaches 
are desperately needed and, thus…TEK has come to be viewed as a 
current, relevant, and viable system for understanding the situation 
and providing a basis from which to work toward solutions...” (p. 2). 
	‐ “The relationship with Creation and its beings was meant to be 
maintained and enhanced, and the knowledge required for this to 
occur was passed on for generations and over thousands of years. The responsibilities that one assumed 
were part of ensuring the continuation of Creation—what academics, scientists, and environmentalists 
might today call “sustainability.” (McGregor, 2006, p.3)
	‐ “…all of Creation is important, all must be respected. If we lose or disrespect even the tiniest and 
seemingly most insignificant being, our own survival becomes threatened.” (McGregor, 2006, p. 3) 
 
 
 
•	 Winter Roads: Winter roads are carved from the ice and snow to  
provide temporary access to isolated regions where building 
conventional year-round roads is too expensive because there are too 
many river crossings and large boggy areas to traverse (Northern Policy 
Institute, 2015).

Although their community was spared, the fires were a wake-up call for the District of Logan Lake, BC. The 
community worked to produce a plan, incorporating several innovative ideas. These included teaming up with 
the local high school, whose students worked to reduce the amount of debris and forest fuels accumulated 
on the forest floor. For small BC communities working to develop their own protection plans, this program 
serves as a video blueprint.

•	 Step 6: Monitoring Progress and Change
CANWET is a GIS-based software designed to inform individuals working in river basin and watershed 
management, water supply and wastewater treatment infrastructure, food security, and climate change 
adaption. The software is easy to use, has an open source GIS environment, and is uses commonly available 
spatial data.
Greenland International Consulting offers training sessions to support use of this software. CANWET has 
been used in assimilative capacity studies, watershed and sub-watershed studies, master drainage plans, 
infrastructure planning, and source water protection studies.
CANWET can be highly technical, it is recommended that a consultant, 
working group in the community, or person with an environmental 
background is hired in the community. This type of work can become 
complex and require a lot of time, which some chief and councils may be 
limited because they are dealing with competing interests. The consultant, 
working group, or “environmental champion” that is hired must be able to 
relay information back to the community and decision-makers in ways that 
are easily understood to get support for important decisions. They should also 
have some authority in decision-making.

In Canada, overland flooding costs the Canadian economy more than any other hazard we face, and is the 
single largest draw on the Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements (DFAA). Flood mapping identifies the 
boundaries of a potential flood event and is critical to support informed decisions and investments to reduce 
the impacts of flooding in communities across Canada. In consultation with provincial and territorial partners 
and key stakeholders, the federal government has developed new documents in the Federal Flood Mapping 
Guidelines Series. These are a series of evergreen guidelines that will help advance flood mapping activities 
across Canada. The publication of these documents will contribute to better addressing overland flooding – 
Canada’s costliest hazard – by strengthening flood mapping across the country.

Public Infrastructure Engineering Vulnerability Committee (PIEVC): 
The Engineering Protocol
Developed by: Engineers Canada
Region: National
Resource type:
•	 Step 3: Risk Assessment and Community Sustainability 
The Public Infrastructure Engineering Vulnerability Committee has developed a step-by-step guide called 
the “Engineering Protocol”. The Protocol is used to evaluate vulnerability risks to buildings or other public 
infrastructure systems due to climate change impacts. The five-step process includes: 
•	 Step 1: Project definition; 
•	 Step 2: Data gathering and sufficiency; 
•	 Step 3: Risk assessment; 
•	 Step 4: Engineering analysis (optional); and,
•	 Step 5: Conclusions and recommendations.
A Project Manager can use the protocol to systematically review historical climate information and project the 
nature, severity, and probability of future climate changes and events. It also establishes the adaptive capacity 
of specific infrastructure as determined by its design, operation, and maintenance. It estimates the severity of 
climate impacts on various infrastructure components (i.e. deterioration, damage or destruction) to identify 
high risk components and the nature of climate change threats. This information can be used to make 
informed decisions regarding which infrastructure components require design adjustments, or changes to 
operational or maintenance procedures.
Engineers Canada encourages use of the Protocol for all types of infrastructure going forward. It is available 
for use at no financial charge through a license agreement with Engineers Canada. Users of the Protocol are 
required to sign a non-disclosure agreement. PIEVC also offers various training workshops.
