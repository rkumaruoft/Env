About This Resource
Getting Ready to Finance: Project Preparation Template Instructions is one of several resources 
included in the Getting Ready to Finance Toolkit — a toolkit designed to help Canadian 
municipalities work with private investors and traditional public funders to realize resilient 
infrastructure projects in their communities. As the name suggests, this resource provides 
detailed instructions on how to use the Project Preparation Template which is also found in the 
Toolkit. 
The goal of the Template Instructions is to ensure that municipalities have all the information 
they need to fill out Getting Ready to Finance: Project Preparation Template. The two resources 
are designed to complement one another and are structured identically (i.e., divided into seven 
sections, each of which includes several information fields with a total of 35 information fields). 
We recommend referring to the Template Instructions while filling out the Project Preparation 
Template. 
The Project Preparation Template and other complementary resources can be found on the 
Getting Ready to Finance Toolkit webpage. Visit icleicanada.org/project/getting-ready-to-
finance/ to access the Toolkit and download all the resources you will need to identify bankable 
resilient infrastructure projects in your community.

Risk Assessment
The Natural Hazard Risk Assessment portion of the Project Preparation Template is designed to help 
understand the impacts of natural hazard(s) on the community. This can be done so by measuring: 
•	
The likelihood of the natural hazard risk (magnitude and frequency), and
•	
The socio-economic impacts on the community.
Socio-economic impacts are measured using four key indicators:
•	
loss of lives/missing people,
•	
% people directly affected,
•	
% local economic loss, and
•	
% population without essential services.
Data provided in must be supported with reliable quantitative and/or qualitative sources such as 
reports, studies, and/or Indigenous Traditional Knowledge.

•	
Other (if other, please specify)
16. Problem statement
Describe the main natural hazard that will be addressed by the project, and how the natural 
hazard has or will impact the community. To do this, you may choose to describe the context, 
type of hazard including magnitude and intensity, the speed of onset as well as duration of the 
hazard, and/or how imminently a future event causing significant damages can be expected.
Context 
Define the threat(s) of concern and their effects on the community. Start by describing the 
threat(s) at the root of the problem statement. This typically includes the natural hazards and 
extreme weather events identified in information field 14. As you discuss which of the hazards 
are related to the project, touch on how these affect/have affected your community and outline 
the resulting negative effects. Negative impacts could include:
6
•	
Extensive property damage
•	
Prolonged power outages
•	
Health impacts
•	
Injuries and deaths 
•	
Financial costs
•	
Population displacement 
•	
Greenhouse gas emissions
•	
Local air quality
•	
Demand for health services, emergency 
response, hospitalization, and negative 
health outcomes 
•	
Increased demand for water, wastewater 
services, and electricity
•	
Delays to outdoor city operations and 
outdoor events/community spaces
•	
Stress on built infrastructure
•	
Water contamination and flooding 
•	
Hazardous travel conditions
•	
Supply chain issues
•	
Travel and transit interruptions
•	
Employee absence resulting in extra costs 
•	
Service delays
•	
Etc.
Also discuss who is most vulnerable to these aforementioned impacts. This could include:
•	
Unhoused populations
•	
Medically dependent individuals
•	
Elderly
•	
Children and youth
•	
Outdoor workers
•	
Indigenous people
•	
Low-income individuals
•	
Etc.
If applicable, it can be worth briefly mentioning that certain hazards can lead to or exacerbate 
other hazards. For example, extreme heat could in turn lead to increased frequency and 
severity of wildfires which have indirect negative impacts such as causing further displacement, 
infrastructure damage, health and safety risks, biodiversity loss, etc.
Type
Define the nature of threat and whether this type of event is:
•	
Climatological (e.g., extreme temperatures, droughts, and wildfires)
•	
Geophysical (e.g., earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis)
•	
Hydrological (e.g., avalanches and floods)
•	
Meteorological (e.g., hurricanes and storms/wave surges)
Speed of onset
Describe how fast the event may occur. This could be: 
•	
Minutes
7
•	
Extreme heat can occur within hours… and its consequences can last from days to months.
•	
Flooding and extreme rain events could occur rapidly within hours… and the consequences 
could take weeks to months to fully recover from.
•	
Extreme weather events such as wind and ice storms can occur in hours… with their 
consequences lasting anywhere from days to months, depending on their severity.
•	
Wildfires can occur within hours to days… and last anywhere from days to months, impacting 
and displacing thousands.
•	
Average annual temperature increases can occur over many years, unnoticed to many… and 
can last anywhere from decades to centuries.
Problem statement example
Flooding and extreme rain events can cause delays and service disruption that will affect 
the city’s outdoor operations and outdoor events/community spaces, increase demand on 
emergency services, increase stress and demand on aging infrastructure, and in turn lead 
to water contamination and flooding resulting in additional costs and displacement. As 
temperatures warm, rain may also increase in frequency in place of snow, causing increased 
power failures, damages to buildings, and increased stress and resources on municipal 
operations and services affecting water, wastewater, buildings, and human resources. There will 
also likely be an increase in drinking water advisories, the need for resources to reduce sodium 
in drinking water systems, and hazardous travel conditions leading to supply chain issues, travel 
interruptions, and employee absence that will result in additional costs and/or service delays.
Many within the community will be affected including but not limited to: Low-income residents, 
persons with a disability, medically dependent persons, children and youth, Indigenous

populations, transient populations, new immigrants, and unhoused populations. This type of 
event could happen quickly, within hours, and the consequences could take weeks to months to 
fully recover from.
17. Total population at risk 
Specify the population at risk in the area exposed to the main natural hazard. What part of the 
demographic is at risk? This can be the population of the entire city/town, a neighbourhood, a 
certain demographic of people within the city (e.g., households near a floodplain), etc. Once the 
type of population affected is identified, statistical information (e.g., population size) can typically 
be found on municipal, provincial or federal databases such as Statistics Canada, or through a 
quick online search.
18. Supporting data sources for risk prior to project 
Provide supporting data sources to indicate risk prior to the implementation of the project. Include 
up to two data sources to support the values entered. In addition, justify why the chosen data 
source(s) are relevant for each indicator. Reliable sources to support the data are essential and 
all data sources should be available through hyperlinks or as attachments including any internal, 
unpublished sources. 
It is preferred for data to originate from internal, verified sources such as financial reports, cost 
analyses, or impact statements and reports. If data is not available internally, data may be obtained 
from a wide variety of sources including:

data that supports the assumption made for the indicator. For example:
•	
 Traditional Indigenous Knowledge including Traditional Ecological Knowledge
•	
 Unpublished assessments/reports internal to the organization
Examples for four socio-economic indicators
Loss of lives/missing people
If the associated climate event (e.g., flooding, wildfires, etc.) has happened in the past and 
was severe enough to cause fatalities, injuries or missing people, please indicate this as it will 
help stress the importance of mitigation and adaptation strategies. If there is no internal data 
available, municipal impact statements, news articles, or government databases may provide 
such information through a quick online search. Be sure to indicate where you retrieved this 
information, especially if it is not from internal sources.
% people directly affected
The percentage of people directly affected can include:
•	
Number of people displaced by an event (e.g. flood, wildfire evacuation, etc)
•	
Number of people without essential services (e.g. water, power, heating and cooling, shelter, 
etc)
•	
Number of people whose property was damaged
•	
Number of people who use the public service (e.g. recreation center, disaster hub, cooling 
center, park etc)
•	
Number of people whose health was affected (e.g. wildfire smoke causing respiratory issues 
in individuals)
You may also include who was most affected such as vulnerable populations, individuals with 
medical concerns, etc. 
10
This type of data may be found within internal reporting documents. If internal data is not 
available, public impact statements from your municipality, local news articles, or regional 
and federal government databases (such as the Canadian Disaster Database) may provide 
this information through a quick online search. Be sure to indicate where you retrieved this 
information, especially if it is not from internal sources.
To calculate an approximate percentage, you can sum the number of people you indicated 
above who have been affected by the event and divide it by the total population of your city to 
produce an estimate.
% local economic loss
The percentage of local economic loss can include:
•	
Health care system costs
•	
Infrastructure damages
•	
Insurance costs
•	
Costs due to disrupted essential services (e.g., power outages, lack of public transportation, 
etc)
•	
Remediation and restoration costs (e.g. contaminated water remediation)
•	
Damage to natural assets and ecosystems (e.g. damage to tree canopy after a windstorm 
resulting in loss of ecosystem services)
•	
Lost work hours
•	
Lowered work productivity
•	
Rising insurance premiums from flooded buildings

19. Project implementation risk
Use this section to provide a deeper understanding of the major risks and difficulties that will be 
or could be encountered when carrying out this project, as well as your strategies for handling and 
reducing their impact. The following examples outlines common risks and challenges associated with 
project implementation. Please include any that are relevant to your specific project, and feel free to 
attach supporting documents related to the anticipated risks and challenges. Financial risks and risks 
to cash flow should particularly be discussed from a private investor’s point of view.
Examples of implementation risks
Environmental risk 
•	
Risk: Construction activities might temporarily disrupt local flora and fauna.
•	
Strategy: Implement environmental management plans and work closely with 
environmental consultants to minimize the impact.
Social risk 
	
	
•	
Risk: Residents might experience inconvenience due to construction noise, dust, and temporary 
traffic rerouting.
•	
 Strategy: Engage with the community early and maintain open lines of communication. 
Provide clear signage and information about construction schedules and alternative 
routes.
Financial risk 
•	
Risk: Unforeseen challenges during construction may lead to costs exceeding the budget.
•	
 Strategy: Have a well-defined budget with contingencies. Monitor and control expenses 
diligently, and secure additional funding sources as backups.
14
•	
Risk: Risks related to timing, project prosecution, ROI, and procurement.
•	
 Strategy: Transfer some risk to a private party who can bear it through bundling 
projects together to bring costs down.
•	
 Strategy: Increase the scale of the project to make it more appealing. Explore leasing or 
buying in bulk potentially with other municipalities to pool resources together, create a 
bundled contact and increase collective purchasing power. Add in extra value, engage 
them over the long term.
Regulatory risk 
	
	
•	
Risk: Delays in receiving necessary permits and approvals can hinder the project timeline.
•	
Strategy: Engage with regulatory bodies early in the planning process, ensure 
compliance with all requirements, and maintain transparent communication.
Timing risk
•	
Risk: Adverse weather conditions could slow down or halt construction activities, extending the 
project timeline.
•	
 Strategy: Develop a flexible project schedule that accounts for potential weather-
related delays with provisions for accelerating activities during favorable conditions.
Other risk
•	
Stakeholder Engagement Risk: Lack of community buy-in and support may affect the project’s 
smooth implementation.
•	
 Strategy: Conduct community engagement sessions, address concerns proactively, and 
highlight the long-term benefits of the project for residents and the broader community.
20. Natural hazard risk transfer
Describe the measure(s) (i.e., strategies and/or procedures) to be taken during the implementation 
phase of the project to avoid transferring the risk associated with the natural hazard to a nearby 
area and/or to another community. A strong project proposal considers infrastructure solutions 
that comprehensively and effectively address the upstream and downstream impacts of the 
natural hazard risk.

Social, Economic, and 
Environmental Benefits
27. Community resilience – Expected outcomes
Strong project proposals demonstrate an important improvement to the infrastructure asset’s 
resilience and decrease in socio-economic impacts on the population(s) exposed to a natural hazard 
risk. To describe the expected community resilience outcomes of the project, it can be helpful to 
refer to the objectives (information field 4) and problem statement (information field 16). What will 
the project accomplish by meeting its objective(s)? What impact will this have on the community? Will 
the issues outlined in the problem statement be solved, either fully or partially? 
Examples of outcomes 
This project would…
•	
…reduce critical infrastructure impacts such as essential services interruptions or building 
damages.
•	
…reduce the amount of critical infrastructure at risk.
•	
…reduce impacts on health and safety of Canadians.
•	
…reduce significant economic activity disruptions.
•	
…reduce the cost of recovery/replacement.
•	
…reduce the impact on Canada’s vulnerable regions.
•

28. Expected return on investment (ROI) 
ROI is a value that provides economic justification for investments. It is a measurement of the 
benefits that can be expected from a project relative to the costs of its implementation.  
To calculate the ROI of the project, use the calculation below. These calculation instructions are 
based on the Disaster Mitigation and Adaptation Fund (DMAF) Applicant Guide. Please make 
sure to consult the funding application you are interested in to ensure this step is necessary and/or 
meets the funder’s requirements. 
ROI Formula 
ROI = 
Cost of damages during the asset life cycle
Total Eligible Project Cost
The ROI is a ratio that measures the estimated disaster losses avoided within the asset life cycle. 
For example, an ROI of 2:1 means that for every dollar spent under DMAF, at least two dollars are 
anticipated to be saved in future natural disaster losses. 
How to calculate ROI 
To calculate ROI, you will need certain values. The table below summarizes the inputs needed for the 
ROI calculation. An example is provided further below to demonstrate how the ROI is calculated for 
projects under the DMAF.

damages
Calculation required.  
See Methodology and Table 4 for details.
Likelihood of the 
main natural hazard
Quantified value in years
Based on the likelihood of the main natural hazard 
identified.
Remaining life 
span of the funded 
asset(s)
Quantified value in years
Calculation required. 
Provide the number of years of the remaining 
lifespan of the infrastructure asset, which includes 
any life extension projected from your project.  
For example, if the current lifespan of the asset 
is 30 years, and your project is expected to 
increase its lifespan for an additional 20 years, the 
“remaining lifespan of the funded asset” is 50 years. 
If your project involves multiple assets, calculate 
the average lifespan of all project assets. Use the 
average as the input value. 
For example, if the project involves assets A, B, and 
C. If: 
•	
Lifespan of Asset A= 25 years 
•	
Lifespan of Asset B= 100 years 
•	
Lifespan of Asset C= 25 years 
The average lifespan of the assets:  
= (Sum of Lifespan of Asset A, B, C) ÷ 3
= (25+100+25) ÷ 3  
= 50 Years

Methodology 
Cost of damages during the asset life cycle =
Estimated damages on a yearly basis x Remaining life span of the funded asset(s)
How is the “Cost of damages during the asset life cycle” calculated?
Estimated damages on a yearly basis = 
Total estimated cost of damages
Likelihood of the main natural hazard
How is the “Total estimated cost of damages” calculated? 
You will need to consider the estimated social, economic, environmental,  and  heritage/culture 
damages or losses that the project could prevent and the kinds and extent of damages that apply to 
your project in dollars, as of the year of the funding application. See Table 4 for examples. Damages 
and losses caused by natural disasters can include direct, indirect, tangible, and intangible costs. For 
each category, please describe how your estimates were determined. 
Once you have determined the social, economic, environmental, and heritage and cultural damages, 
this is the “Total estimated cost of damages”. This value is used in the ROI formula. 
Reliable sources to support the data included in this calculation are essential. Data sources and a 
strong explanation must be provided to support the value. All data sources should be hyperlinked or 
included as attachments including any internal, unpublished sources. 
You can use quantitative data from similar geographic areas/communities to demonstrate the 
impact of the hazard as long as you justify how that would translate to your community.

Example calculation of ROI
The natural hazard is expected once in every 10 years with a total estimated cost of damages of 
$100 million. The asset has a remaining asset lifespan (which includes the potential extension of 
the lifespan due to the DMAF investment) of 40 years. The total eligible project cost is $50 million. 
Information provided by the prompt: 
•	
Likelihood of the main natural hazard: 1 in 10 Years 
•	
Total Estimated Cost of Damages: $100 million 
•	
Total Eligible Cost: $50 million 
•	
Remaining lifespan of funded assets: 40 years 
1. Calculate the “Estimated damages on a yearly basis” 
Estimated damages on a yearly basis = 
Total estimated cost of damages
Likelihood of the main natural hazard
 = $100,000,000
10 years
= $10,000,000 per year
2. Calculate the “Cost of damages during the asset lifecycle”
Cost of damages during the asset life cycle = 
Estimated damages on a yearly basis x Remaining life span of the funded asset(s)
= $10,000,000 per year x 40 years
= $400,000,000
23
3. Calculate the ROI
ROI = 
Cost of damages during the asset life cycle
Total Eligible Project Cost
 = $400,000,000
$50,000,000
= 8
4. Answer
ROI =  8
For every one dollar invested, there is an expected savings of eight dollars in damages and 
long term replacement costs.
29. Economic benefits
Describe what economic benefits your project would have and provide the following information:
•	
How any economic benefits might be generated (e.g., capital and operating cost reductions, 
extension of asset life, lower total cost of ownership, revenue generation) 
•	
Which economic indicators you would measure (e.g., financial savings, percentage cost savings, 
payback, internal rates of return, revenue)
•	
How the solutions in this project would generate value and would be financially efficient and 
effective
•	
An estimated number of direct jobs created by the project
•	
If the project would generate employment for underrepresented groups
Example of economic co-benefits by project type
All projects
•	
Planning, design, construction, and maintenance would require skilled and unskilled labor, 
leading to job opportunities.
24
Energy system resilience projects
•	
Construction of microgrid projects would offer opportunities for skill development and training 
in the renewable energy sector. Overtime, projects like this would equip the municipality’s 
workforce with skills relevant to the global shift towards sustainable energy.
•	
District energy systems can use local fuel sources (e.g., waste heat, geothermal), which would 
keep energy dollars within the municipality and strengthen the community’s resilience.
•	
Energy centres have access to economies of scale for natural gas and electricity purchasing, as 
well as cost avoidance measures such as peak shaving for Ontario’s Class A rate structure. These 
energy cost savings would be transferred to the connected customers. 
Flood resilience projects
•	
Mitigating flooding damage through rainwater retention could mitigate excess water flow 
into residents’ basements, overflowing stormwater systems, and other public infrastructure 
that would then require significant repairs. It is estimated that the cost of repairing a flooded 
basement is ~$40,000.
•	
By preventing flooding conditions, services such as public transit and energy production 
would not be disrupted. Disruption to these services during a weather event typically costs the 
municipality a great deal of revenue loss. In large municipalities, disrupted transit alone could 
result in over $1 million whereas power outages can cost billions of dollars.
•	
With less severe flooding events and water runoff, the need to repair and maintain stormwater 
systems would decrease, reducing operating and restoration costs.
•	
Flood mitigation measures would be expected to reduce costs of flood damage to property 
owners and could result in reduced insurance premiums. 
•	
Flood mitigation measures would be expected to reduce the number of temporary business 
closures and disruption after rain events.
Resilient building retrofit projects
•	
Metal roofing would prevent the destruction of housing and mitigate the spreading of wildfires. 
This would lead to fewer repair expenses and insurance claims in the long-term compared to 
typical roofing structures.
•	
Homes that are retrofitted and built back with metal roofing would increase the value of the 
homes and the safety of the surrounding neighbourhood, raising selling prices of the homes as 
they are sold in the future and potentially increasing municipal income from property taxes.
Resilient development projects
•	
Not only would the development of a disaster hub support the municipality’s activity and 
business, it would also support surrounding local businesses and community members in the 
surrounding neighbourhoods.
•	
Developing a disaster hub could lead to more public services available and more rental capacity 
for ice rinks and facilities.
•	
Development using the latest technology and energy efficient systems would reduce energy fees 
in the long-term, saving a significant amount of operating expenses.

30. Social benefits
In this section, describe benefits that go beyond current standards for similar infrastructure projects, 
such as improving the community’s ability to adapt to climate change, increasing public safety, or 
creating job opportunities. 
Example of social co-benefits by project type
Energy system resilience projects
•	
A microgrid would ensure consistent energy supply, particularly to essential services like 
emergency centers. This would in turn enhance the municipality’s resilience and ensure the 
safety and well-being of its residents during emergencies.
•	
The incorporation of a hydro turbine would signal a commitment to green and sustainable energy 
solutions, setting a precedent for future infrastructure projects.
•	
The incorporation of a hydro turbine would provide an opportunity for schools and institutions 
to educate students about renewable energy, environmental stewardship, and the importance of 
infrastructure in society.
Extreme event resilience projects
•	
By directly addressing and mitigating extreme weather, heat, and wildfire risks, this project would 
safeguard the surrounding residential areas and public. By ensuring that the community has 
access to critical resources during times of crisis, the project would minimize potential public 
health crises linked to extreme heat, wildfires, and extreme weather.
•	
Facing and preparing for a common threat often brings communities together. These efforts 
could foster stronger bonds among residents.
Flood resilience projects
•	
Flood events from major rainfall, which often occur suddenly, are a significant hazard to public 
safety. By improving stormwater management, this project would increase the ability of the 
stormwater system to handle large rain amounts and decrease the risks of flash floods. Beyond 
the immediate threat of flooding, stagnant water can become breeding grounds for disease 
vectors and flood damaged properties can be impacted by black mold. By efficiently managing 
stormwater, this project would also reduce the risk of waterborne diseases and unsafe housing. 
In addition, the added vegetation would improve air quality and offer a reprieve from pollutants 
and allergens.
•	
Regular flooding events can lead to stress and anxiety among the affected residents, especially 
if they result in loss or damage of property. By addressing the root cause and offering a lasting 
solution, this project would contribute significantly to the mental well-being of the residents, 
ensuring peace of mind during heavy rainfall events.
•	
This project would increase resident’s flood risk awareness, particularly about their residence’s
26
vulnerabilities, as well as what they can do to increase their resilience to flood events.
•	
This project would increase resident’s knowledge of financial programs available at various 
government levels for climate change adaptation, notably regarding flood risk management.
•	
Increased preparedness to flood risk would mitigate flood risks at the household level and 
increase the community’s ability to recover from flooding events.
•	
Increased flood risk resilience at the residential building level would reduce impacts on 
household and community healthcare due to lesser stress, potable water contamination, 
overtime work, etc.
•	
Directly addressing and mitigating flood risks, the project would safeguard not just the marina 
but also potentially the surrounding residential areas and public spaces. By reducing erosion 
and overflows of water during flooding, the project would minimize potential public health crises 
linked to waterborne diseases, contaminants, and infrastructure deterioration.
Green infrastructure projects
•	
Naturalized areas, filled with native vegetation, not only serve functional purposes but also 
enhance the beauty and recreational value of neighborhoods. The green spaces created through 
this could become hubs for community activities, promote mental well-being, and increase 
property values.
Large infrastructure projects
•	
Infrastructure projects of this magnitude create employment opportunities. From engineers to 
construction workers and environmental consultants, the project would provide a significant 
boost to the local job market, benefiting the economy of the municipality and surrounding areas.
•	
The project’s construction and maintenance phases would create numerous job opportunities 
for residents, from technical roles in engineering and environmental science to manual labor and 
project management. 
Resilient development projects
•	
Redevelopment of the marina and surrounding green spaces would provide park space and 
enhanced public access along waterfront where none currently exists, enhancing resident’s 
experience and natural assets in the neighbourhood.
•	
As a demonstration of sustainable urban planning, the project can serve as an educational tool 
for schools and institutions. 
Water and wastewater system resilience projects
•	
•	
A strengthened dam would ensure that towns downstream, including their residents and 
properties, are shielded from potential catastrophic dam failures. Considering the intensifying 
impacts of climate change, such as more frequent and severe storm events, fortifying the dam 
would not just be an upgrade but a necessary adaptation for safeguarding lives and assets.
27
•	
While not immediately apparent as a ‘social’ benefit, ensuring that essential services like water 
access are uninterrupted has long-term socio-economic advantages. Stable infrastructure 
encourages businesses to operate in the region, supports property values, and reinforces the 
City’s reputation as a resilient, forward-thinking community
Wildfire resilience projects
•	
Beyond the immediate benefit of reducing fire hazards, this project would foster a sense of 
security among residents. Knowing that their homes, key municipal buildings, and community 
resource centers are fortified against wildfires, residents could live with a decreased sense of 
anxiety regarding potential fire outbreaks.
•	
By introducing community incentives for FireSmart on private property, the project would provide 
financial aid and indirectly educate the community about fire safety. 
•	
 By introducing the community to Fire Smart Canada and its resources, the project would provide 
resilient retrofits to residences and educate the community about climate change, wildfires, and 
extreme weather events. 
31. Environmental benefits
Indicate if your project offers environmental co-benefits.
Example of environmental co-benefits by project type
Education and awareness projects
•	
Climate change education and resources could lead to greater local awareness of global warming, 
its effects, and its causes. This could lead to greater local climate action which could have 
significant benefits on the surrounding environment.
Energy system resilience projects
•	
The integration of energy storage solutions in the microgrid would provide the capability to store 
excess energy during low-demand periods and release it during peak demands or emergencies. 
This would serve as a buffer against potential brownouts or blackouts.
Flood resilience projects
•	
Beyond the immediate threat of flooding, the project would address riverbank erosion. Stabilizing 
the riverbank would protect infrastructure and also preserve the natural habitats of several 
species, maintaining the ecological balance of the area.
•	
An operational wastewater treatment plant plays a pivotal role in ensuring that effluents released 
into the environment are treated and harmless. By safeguarding the plant from floods, the project 
would ensure that untreated wastewater does not overflow and contaminate the surrounding 
environment, preserving the river’s ecosystem and the quality of water sources downstream.
28
•	
In addition to decreasing flood risks, proper stormwater management also helps reduce the 
runoff of pollutants into local water bodies. By filtering and controlling stormwater, the project 
would help maintain the quality of local water bodies. 
•	
Flooding can disrupt local ecosystems, especially aquatic habitats. By regulating water flow, 
the project would ensure the stability and health of local aquatic environments, preserving 
biodiversity.
•	
Improving the storm sewer system to reduce flooding also offers an opportunity to make street 
upgrades to support urban living and improve the public realm. These would include upgrading 
sidewalks, adding bike lanes where possible, improving lighting, and planting street trees. These 
public realm upgrades would make neighbourhoods safer, more accessible, and promote active 
transportation which in turn would reduce GHG emissions.
Green infrastructure projects
•	
Enhancing the green spaces as part of this project could involve planting native trees and shrubs. 
These act as natural barriers and play a role in carbon sequestration, contributing to GHG 
reduction.
•	
Incorporating urban greening as part of this project would absorb CO2, provide shade, and 
enhance the urban ecosystem.
•	
By filtering stormwater through bioswales and other green infrastructure, pollutants and 
contaminants would be removed before they infiltrate groundwater or enter waterways. This 
could reduce risks related to waterborne diseases and contamination events.
•	
Green infrastructure, especially tree canopy coverage, can reduce urban heat islands. Trees 
provide shade and release water vapor, cooling the surroundings and providing relief during 
extreme heat events.
•	
Green infrastructure provides habitats for various fauna and flora, promoting biodiversity by 
supporting birds, pollinators, and other urban wildlife.
•	
By using green infrastructure to promote natural infiltration and groundwater recharge, this 
project would ensure sustained water supply for both natural ecosystems and human use.
•	
Trees and vegetation act as carbon sinks, capturing and storing carbon dioxide from the 
atmosphere. This could contribute to the municipality’s efforts in reducing its overall GHG 
emissions.
•	
More green infrastructure could decrease the need for air conditioning during hot periods, 
leading to reduced energy consumption and associated GHG emissions.
•	
Tree planting along streets would increase shade, carbon storage and sequestration, and water 
filtration.
Resilient community planning project
•	
Elevating the access roads would ensure unobstructed access during floods and also mitigates 
the risk of landslide or subsidence, particularly in periods of heavy rain or rapid snowmelt.
•	
By design, emergency exit routes would double as active transportation pathways, encouraging 
residents to opt for walking, cycling, or other non-motorized modes of transport. This would 
reduce the community’s reliance on vehicles, leading to a decrease in related GHG emissions.

Budget and Work Plan
32. Estimated total project costs 
Create a rough project budget to estimate the total project costs.
33. Anticipated sources of funding
Has this project been submitted to another federal funding program? If so, indicate which sources of 
funding are anticipated. 
34. Operations and maintenance costs
Include details on the operation and maintenance the project will require and ongoing/or year-to-year 
operations and maintenance funding. How will the completed project be maintained? How will the 
maintenance be funded?
35. Possible sources of cash flow 
Possible sources of cash flows for the resilient infrastructure can be direct, indirect, or independent.
Directly from resiliency infrastructure
These cash flows may flow either directly to investors (e.g., earmarked user fees, generation of carbon 
credits), or flow through beneficiaries (e.g., tax increases, insurance premium reductions).
Indirectly from the infrastructure but dependent on it
The existence of the infrastructure may enable a municipality to enact a mechanism that gives rise to 
cash flows (e.g., tax increment financing, local improvement charges, development cost charges).
Independent of the infrastructure
A municipality may repay investors through sources of cash flow that are completely independent of 
the resiliency infrastructure (e.g., taxation, general operating revenues). Doing so likely requires an 
enabling political environment (e.g., high climate risk awareness and sense of urgency to act among 
citizenry).
