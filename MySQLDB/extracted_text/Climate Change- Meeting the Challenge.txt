TEACHING AND LEARNING STRATEGIES  
1. Put the term “climate change” on the board. Have students brainstorm both the meaning and impact of 
climate change. 
2. Discuss with students the difference between the terms “global warming” and “climate change”. 
3. Create a word wall in the classroom to place terms/words from this unit for students to refer to 
throughout the unit. 
4. Have students read, “Excerpt from the Declaration of the National Forum,” (Appendix 1a). As they read, 
students will look for terms to add to the word wall and make a list of concerns which they would like to 
study in this unit. 
5. As a class, discuss the lists of concerns and make a class list to post for future reference. 
6. Refer students to the sections on the web-based poster, “The Climate System – a Balancing Act, Future 
Climate and Where We Live.” Students will complete the “Climate Change in Ontario” web (Appendix 1b), 
by filling the clouds with the information they have gained on climate change in Ontario.  
ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION  
List of concerns will be checked for completion. 
 
Web activity, “Climate Change in Ontario,” will be checked for completion. 
ENRICHMENT 
As an alternative to teaching the entire unit on climate change, teachers can use the “jigsaw” cooperative group 
strategy to have students research and learn about climate change in Ontario. The class will be divided into group 
of 7, and each student will be assigned one of the extension activities listed at the end of each of activity. 
 
One member of the group will explore the basic information about climate change: 
- 
define the meaning and impact of climate change; 
- 
define the difference between the terms “global warming” and “climate change”; 
- 
read “Excerpt from the Declaration of the National Forum” and create a list of concerns; and 
- 
create a mind map of the impact of climate change. 
 
The member will provide a one-page summary note for the rest of the group, as well as a panel of a poster to 
illustrate the topic for the rest of the class. 
Climate Change: Meeting the Challenge, Grade 9-12 
 
 
 
All of the panels will be put together to form a display in either the classroom or a prominent place in the school.  
 
To ensure individual accountability, each member of the group will be evaluated on an individual basis using the 
rubric included in Activity 7.

APPENDIX 1A – THE DECLARATION OF THE NATIONAL FORUM ON 
CLIMATE CHANGE The National Forum on Climate Change was sponsored by the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy in order to raise public awareness of climate change issues as well as to bring a citizen’s viewpoint to the debate. The Forum met in February, March, and April 1998. The Forum involved Canadians from all parts of the country who had received the Order of Canada or equivalent honours. Most of the individuals who attended the Forum had little or no knowledge of climate change beyond what they hadread and seen in the media. They came to the table with an open mind, and a desire to represent the citizens of Canada as a whole.
 
THE DECLARATION  
 “We, the members of the National Forum on Climate Change, believe that climate change will touch the lifeof every Canadian. Decision taken today on this complex and controversial issue will have implications for our communities, our children, and future generations. Climate change, caused by a build up of greenhouse gases, could lead to dramatic changes in sea levels, storm patterns, and average temperatures. Every Canadian has a role to play in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The time for action is now. On the balance of evidence and in the face of uncertainty, we have concluded that there are two compelling reasons to take immediate action on climate change:
- If the challenge is as serious as many scientists believe, an effective response will call for major shifts in North American’s attitudes and lifestyle, and will lead to dramatic adjustments in the global economy. Early action will allow us to create momentum for the difficult adjustments that may be necessary in the years ahead.
- If concerns about climate change turn out to be premature or overstated, there will be time and opportunity to adjust our response. In the meantime, Canadians will have taken out a measure of insurance, and will reap important side benefits as a result of early action. These benefits will include reduced pollution, better urban air quality, a more efficient economy, and jobcreation resulting from the introduction of new technologies. Canadians have little to lose and everything to gain by taking action immediately. Each of us can and must make a difference” (National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy, 1998).
CLIMATE CHANGE Climate change occurs when long-term weather patterns are altered –for instance, through human activity. The Declaration (1998) indicates that climate change will result in the fluctuation of average global temperatures as a result of greenhouse gases emissions. Greenhouse gases act as a barrier that traps heat in our atmosphere, similar to how a greenhouse roof traps in heat. The trapping of this heat contributes to the warming of the Earth, and is what helps to keep Earth a comfortable temperature, making it possible for us to live here. However, since the rise of the industrial revolution, human activities have increased the concentration of greenhouse gases, such as Carbon Dioxide, by 40%. With more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, global temperatures are increasing 10 times faster than at the end of the last ice age (May, 2014).Itispredictedthatgreenhousegasemissionswilldoublebytheyear2100,unlesswemakesignificant behaviouraland technological changes. Scientists believe this will result in temperature increases of 1.5 -4.5 degrees C. From 1948 to 2013, Canada has experienced a 1.6 degrees Celsius increase in average annual temperature (AAFC, 2014). This type of major changeisassociatedwithothermajorclimaticchangeslikethelastIceAge.
 
 
 
Climate Change: Meeting the Challenge, Grade 9-12 
 
 
Potential Impacts 
 A.
 Climate Change and Agriculture
- Climate Change can have both positive and negative impacts for agriculture.
- Warming temperatures can allow for longer growing seasons as a result of milder and shorter winters. This provides opportunity to improve soil quality, increase number and types of crops we can grow, as well as decrease costs of feeding livestock, increased survival rates of young, and lower energy costs.
 
- Frequency of droughts may increase resulting in a decrease in crop yields –this would make crop production more vulnerable. For example, in the 2002 drought, crop yields were reduced by approximately 50% of the “Average yields during normal or more suitable growing conditions” (AGR.GC, 2015)B.
 Climate Change and Fresh Water
- We rely on our drink water through fresh water from lakes and rivers.
- Climate change increases risk for drought to due decreased rainfall, as well as flooding due to extreme rainfall events. For example, in August 2018, Toronto experienced a heavy rainfall event resulting in 50 to 100 millimeters of rainfall in less than 3 hours (Merali, 2018). This resulted in massive flooding in the city, causing damage to residential homes, corporations, and public services.C.
 Climate Change and Human Health
- Summers may become longer with more severe heat, which puts seniors, children and those with respiratory problems at health risks
- Shorter, warmer winter, and hotter summer days result in increased production and vitality of ticks, mosquitoes and other vector species –this can increase the spread of infectious diseases such as Lyme disease, West Nile virusD.
 Climate Change and Oceans
- Oceans act as carbon sinks, as they absorb carbon dioxide, helping to mitigate climate change. As carbon dioxide concentrates increase and water temperatures continue to rise, oceans become more acidic. This acidity level can cause bleaching and even death of coral reefs.
- It is estimated that by 2050, 5% of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia will remain. This impacts both wildlife and humans –fish species rely on coral reefs for their ecosystem; and humans rely on fish from coral reefs as a huge source of protein (World Wildlife Fund, 2015)E.
 Climate Change and Polar Regions
- Climate change is heavily amplified in Polar Regions. In the past 100 years, average air temperatures in the Arctic have increased by 5 degrees Celsius. This heavily impacts summer sea ice –with the increase in ice and snow melt, water temperatures continue to rise, and also decreases habitat available.
- Antarctic ice sheet accounts for nearly 90% of all fresh water in the world. As this ice sheet continues to melt, it is predicted to have significant effects on global sea level rise. F.
 Climate Change and Wildlife
- According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a 1.5 degree Celsius rise in temperature can put 20-30% of species at risk of extinction. It is believed that if temperatures rise by more than 3 degrees Celsius, ecosystems across the globe will struggle to survive. 
- As climate change continues to occur at a rapid rate, species are struggling to adapt. Most species that are at risk or threatened, reside in areas that are more severely impacted by climate change. 
- For example,polar bears are experiencing a significant loss in habitat as the Arctic warms nearly two times as fast as the global average. The sea ice melts earlier and forms later each year. This results in polar bears having to den later in autumn, and onto sea icein the spring to hunt. As a result, bears are going longer periods of time without eating, decreasing their body weight and physical conditions –limiting their chances for survival (World Wildlife Fund, 2015). 
 
Taking Action There are several ways that Canadians and their governments can take action on climate change; here are just a few:

APPENDIX 4A – FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT CLIMATE 
CHANGE AND AGRICULTURE How will climate change affect agriculture in Canada?Climate change presents a variety of opportunities and challenges for agriculture in Canada. As temperatures increase and there are shorter frost periods, there is a possibility for longer growing seasons. This provides an opportunity to grow crops that we may not have been able to before. However, with extreme weather patterns there is an increased likelihood of both droughts and floods. The change in weather patterns make it difficult for agricultural systems to adapt, therefore reducing crop yields by nearly 50% during normal or suitable growing conditions. Additionally, dry, hot temperatures create more favourable conditions for weeds, insects, and pests. Livestock also face numerous challenges. With shorter and warmer winters, the spread of insects and disease will be more prominent. While cold stress on animals would decrease in the winter, this advantage would be offset by an increase in heat stress during the summer.Climate change will modify rainfall, evaporation, runoff, and soil moisture storage. With a warmer, dryer climate, there will be increased pressure to develop crop varieties resistant to drought. Agriculture is the largest consumer of water in arid and semi-arid regions like the Canadian Prairies --climate change would mean good quality water supplies would become even more crucial and contentious than they are today.Which gases are the largest contributors to global warming?There are four key greenhouse gases emitted by human activities including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases.  The burning of fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas for electricity, heat, and transportation is the primary source of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and account for 65% of global greenhouse gas emissions.  Methane (CH4) is produced through agricultural activity, manure from ruminant animals such as sheep, cattle, horses, and biomass burning. Globally, methane accounts for 16% of greenhouse gas emissions. Nitrous oxide is released primarily through agricultural activities such as fertilizers, and account for 6% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Finally,fluorinated gases, or F-gases, are the result of industrial processes, refrigerators, as well as other consumer products including hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexaflourides. F-gases account for 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions (Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Data, 2017).What levels of greenhouse gases are in our atmosphere?Since the industrial revolutions, carbon dioxide concentrations have increased by 43%. In the 1700s, CO2 concentrations were recorded at 280 parts per million (ppm) to 401 ppm in 2015. Methane concentrations have doubled since the industrial revolution andwere recorded at 1,800 parts per billion (ppb) in 2015.  Finally, nitrous oxide concentrations have risen from 280 ppb in 1920 to 328 ppb in 2015. The rises of these concentrations are primarily the result of human activities including agriculture and fossil fuel uses Which greenhouse gases are created by Canadian agriculture?Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada estimates that agriculture accounts for 10 per cent of Canada's total greenhouse gas emissions. Livestock and manure account for 58 per cent of these gases; crops for 37 per cent. About two-thirds of these gases are in the form of nitrogen oxide, or N20, while one-third of these gases are CH4, or methane. The production of carbon dioxide levels through agriculture has abated to an almost negligible amount. However, agriculture can be useful in sequestering, or trapping, carbon from our atmosphere.
Climate Change: Meeting the Challenge, Grade 9-12 
 
 Which management practices are most effective in reducing the impact of climate change?
• There are severalways that producers can manage their operations to make them as environmentally friendly as possible. Agriculture can help minimize the impact of climate change if producers:Plant shelter belts to help minimize the effects of wind, soil erosion, nutrientloss, and to help conserve water
• plant trees and shrubs which act as carbon sinks
• convert from traditional plowing practices to conservation tillage (reduced orzero-till)
• growcovercropsduringthewinter,suchasalfalfaorhay
• let marginal lands rest (i.e. take these lands out ofproduction)
• rotate crops to preservesoils
• plant vegetation with deeper roots to prevent soilerosion
• Apply synthetic fertilizers through improved applications such as banding, slow-release nitrogen, and inhibitors
• store manure ascompost.While there will always be some emissions of greenhouse gases through agriculture, improved farm management will ensure a reduction of these gases to an acceptable level. Improved practices might even mean a net removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through its storage in soils.Visit http://climatechangeconnection.org/solutions/agriculture-solutions/for more detailed information on Agricultural SolutionsWhat is the best way to reduce methane emissions when storing manure?How manure is stored can greatly affect the amount of greenhouse gases it emits. Manure releases methane and nitrous oxide emissions; therefore,the storage method a farmer chooses to use is important. Methane is produced in anaerobic conditions; meaning decomposition takes place in absence of oxygen. Stock piling, liquid and slurry systems rely on anaerobic conditions to decompose manure. For this reason, it is encouraged that farmers avoid using these systems. Farmers are encouraged to use covers for manure storage, as these roofs will help to trap gasses manure emits. In fact, covers used in liquid systems have helped to reduce methane emissions by up to 95% (MB, 2015). In addition to reduction of emissions, covers help to reduce and control odors.How valuable are trees for preventing climate change?Trees play a valuable role in combating climate change as they act as carbon sinks. Studies conducted by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada have determined that shelterbelts are extremely beneficial in sequestering greenhouse gases: “A mature poplar tree sequesters 266 kilograms (kg) of carbon, green ash traps 63 kilograms (kg); a white spruce tree will capture 143 kg; and, a caragana tree will sequester 39 kg. At the recommended spacing for shelterbelts, these values translate into 106 tonnes per kilometre (t/km) for poplar, 25 t/km for green ash, 41 t/km for white spruce, and 26 t/km for caragana.These figures don't include the amount of carbon that will become sequestered in the trees roots, which may equal roughly 50 to 75 per cent of these amounts. These figures do not include the carbon stored in the roots, which may be equal to 50 to 75 per cent of the carbon stored above ground (Benefits of Agro-Forestry, 2014).”Beyond the above benefits, shelterbelts help to reduce energy usage as they create significant amount of shade, reduce wind, prevent snowdrifts on roadsides, as well as protect soil and crops.

2. Students will refer to the web-based poster to find the answers to their questions. Students will then 
search the Ministry of Natural Resources website to find out more about climate change and our forests - 
https://www.ontario.ca/page/forestry.  
3. Students will complete the flow chart handout (Appendix 5), to show the potential impact of climate 
change on our forests. 
4. New vocabulary related to climate change will be added to the word wall by the class. 
ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION  
Flow charts will be evaluated for accuracy and completion. 
ENRICHMENT 
As an alternative to teaching the entire the entire unit on climate change, teachers can use the “jigsaw” 
cooperative group strategy to have students research and learn about climate change in Ontario. The class will be 
divided into group of 7, and each student will be assigned one of the extension activities listed at the end of each 
of activity. 
 
One member of the group will be assigned to study the impact of climate change on forests, making specific 
reference to: 
• 
impact on growing season; 
• 
transitions from forest to grassland; 
• 
transition in the type of tree grown; 
• 
transition of forested areas further north; 
• 
ways to manage change; and 
• 
different pest threats to forests in a warmer climate. 
Refer to both the web-based poster and the Ministry of Natural Resources website: 
https://www.ontario.ca/page/forestry. 
 
The member will provide a one-page summary note for the rest of the group, as well as a panel of a poster to 
illustrate the topic for the rest of the class. 
 
Climate Change: Meeting the Challenge, Grade 9-12 
 
 
All the panels will be put together to form a display in either the classroom or a prominent place in the school.

Earth and Space Science, Grade 12, University Preparation (SES4U) 
Recording Earth’s Geological History  
By the end of Grade 12, students will: 
D1.1  analyse the relationship between climate and geology, and, using geological records, assess the impact of 
long-term climate change on life on Earth.  
Chemistry, Grade 12, College Preparation (SCH4C) 
Chemistry in the Environment  
By the end of Grade 12, students will: 
Climate Change: Meeting the Challenge, Grade 9-12 
 
 
F1.1  evaluate, on the basis of research, the effectiveness of government initiatives or regulations, and the 
actions of individuals, intended to improve air and water quality, and propose a personal action plan to 
support these efforts. 
TEACHING AND LEARNING STRATEGIES  
1. Teacher will lead a brainstorming activity on greenhouse gas emissions, placing the term “greenhouse 
gases” in the centre of the board. Students will brainstorm ways in which we produce greenhouse gases. 
2. Refer to the web-based poster and discuss: 
• 
where Canada stands internationally on greenhouse gas emissions;  
• 
sources of greenhouse gases in the home; and 
• 
greenhouse gas emission overall in Canada. 
3. Make copies of Appendix 7A, “Sources of Greenhouse Gas emissions,” and hand out to class. Have 
students write a 250-word summary of what they have learned about greenhouse gas emissions. 
4. In small groups, students will complete the concept map, “Reducing Greenhouse Gases,” (Appendix 7B). 
Upon completion, groups will present their information to the class. 
5. Individually, students will create an action plan to reduce personal greenhouse gas emissions, using the 
handout provided (Appendix 7C). 
6. New vocabulary related to climate change will be added to the word wall by the class.  
ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION  
Students’ pledges will be marked for completion.  
ENRICHMENT 
As an alternative to teaching the entire the entire unit on climate change, teachers can use the “jigsaw” 
cooperative group strategy to have students research and learn about climate change in Ontario. The class will be 
divided into group of 7, and each student will be assigned one of the extension activities listed at the end of each 
of activity. 
 
One member of the group will be assigned to study how Canada is doing in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and 
how we can reduce our emissions. Consider the following: 
• 
where we stand internationally; 
• 
how we produce gases; 
• 
small-scale and large-scale producers and how they can reduce their emissions; and 
• 
how individuals can reduce their emissions. 
 
The member will provide a one-page summary note for the rest of the group, as well as a panel of a poster to 
illustrate the topic for the rest of the class. 
 
All the panels will be put together to form a display in either the classroom or a prominent place in the school.  
 
To ensure individual accountability, each member of the group will be evaluated on an individual basis using the 
rubric included in Activity 7.

APPENDIX 7A – SOURCES OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS Major industrial sources of greenhouse gas emissions include power generation facilities that use fossil fuels to produce electricity, heat or steam; integrated steel mills; oil and gas extraction; facilities involved in mining, smelting and refining of metals; pulp, paper, and saw mills; petroleum refineries; and chemical producers. Other specific activities contributing to total greenhouse gas emission include transportation, use of solvents, waste disposal, wastewater treatment, and agriculture related activities. Land use change and forestry are excluded from the national inventory totals. Figure 1:

APPENDIX 7B – CONCEPT MAP-REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES As a group, identify six sources of greenhouse gases (e.g. CO2). For each of the sources, identify one large and one small producer (company/individual) of the greenhousegas. Make suggestions on how each on can reduce its production.
