ABSTRACT
This research letter investigates the role of feelings of responsibility to reduce climate change (i.e. ‘felt responsibility’) as an
antecedent to climate change-related political behaviors and intentions, including willingness to join a campaign, likeli-
hood of supporting pro-climate presidential candidates and past contact with elected ofﬁcials. Using nationally representa-
tive survey data (n ¼ 1029), we ﬁnd that felt responsibility has a signiﬁcant positive relationship with future behavioral in-
tent, but not past behavior. Implications and future research are discussed.
Key words: felt responsibility; climate change; political participation; mitigation; behavioral intent; past behavior
INTRODUCTION
Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing hu-
manity today. There is overwhelming and increasing evidence
that human-caused climate change is causing a range of signifi-
cant harmful impacts [1]. Without aggressive action to reduce
emissions, the effects are likely to worsen—threatening the
well-being of people everywhere [2]. Although individual behav-
iors to limit one’s personal contribution to emissions can help
[3], political actions demanding stronger climate policies are
also necessary to bring about more systemic change [4, 5]. In the
USA, relatively few Americans take political actions (not includ-
ing voting). A 2018 survey found that only 19% of Americans
said they had contacted an elected official in support of a cause
they care about in the past year [6]. On climate change specifi-
cally, in 2020, only 2% of Americans said they were participating
in a campaign to convince elected officials to take action to
reduce climate change and only 13% said they had contacted
their elected officials to take action to reduce climate change in
the past year [7]. Thus, an important question is: what factors
predict political participation on the issue of climate change?
This study examines felt responsibility—a construct that has re-
ceived little attention in the literature—as a predictor of a vari-
ety of climate change-related political behaviors.
Modifying a conceptual definition posited by Bateman and
O’Conner [8], we define felt responsibility as a psychological con-
struct reflecting the extent to which individuals feel compelled to
take action toward a desired result. Feelings of responsibility
serve to translate abstract beliefs and attitudes about an issue
like climate change into concrete action (e.g. Value-Norm-Belief
Theory; [9]). The few studies that have investigated individual
feelings of responsibility toward the environment suggest that it
is an antecedent to pro-environmental behavior [8, 10–12]. As
such,
felt
responsibility
may
be
a
potential
target

interventions and communication efforts to increase public and
political will for climate action [13]. Although past research has
found that felt responsibility positively predicts support for cli-
mate policy and personal mitigation behaviors [8, 11], little re-
search has systematically investigated feelings of personal
responsibility specifically as a predictor of climate change-related
political participation. This study seeks to address this gap in the
literature. Our hypotheses are as follows:
H1: There will be a positive relationship between an individual’s
felt responsibility toward climate change and their willingness to
join a campaign to convince elected officials to take action to re-
duce climate change.
H2: There will be a positive relationship between an individual’s
felt responsibility toward climate change and their willingness to
support presidential candidates who support taking action to re-
duce climate change.
H3: There will be a positive relationship between an individual’s
felt responsibility toward climate change and their past contact
with elected officials to take action to reduce climate change.
METHODS
Participants
Data for this study come from the nationally representative
Climate Change in the American Mind survey conducted in
April 2020 (n ¼ 1029; [14], demographics shown in Table 1). The
sample was drawn from the Ispsos KnowledgePanel
V
R (an online
panel of members drawn using probability sampling methods).
The survey took an average of 25 min to complete.
Measures
Predictor variable
Felt responsibility. A 4-point Likert item ranging from 1 ¼ Strongly
disagree to 4 ¼ Strongly agree asked participants to respond to
the following: ‘I feel a personal sense of responsibility to help re-
duce global warming’.
Outcome variables
Willingness to join a campaign. Participants were asked ‘How will-
ing or unwilling would you be to join a campaign to convince
elected officials to take action to reduce global warming?’ with
responses on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 ¼ I definitely would
not do it to 5 ¼ I am participating in a campaign like this now.
Support for pro-climate presidential candidates. Participants were
asked ‘If a candidate for US president strongly supports taking ac-
tion to reduce global warming, would you be more or less likely to
do each of the following, or would it make no difference?’
Participants then responded to three items measured on a 5-point
scale with response options ranging from 1¼ Much less likely to
5¼ Much more likely. Items included were ‘Vote for the candidate’,
‘Donate money to the candidate’s campaign’, and ‘Voice support
for the candidate on Facebook, Twitter or other social media’.
These items were averaged to create an index of overall support
for pro-climate presidential candidates (a ¼ 0.89).
Past contact with elected officials. Participants were first asked how
many times, over the past 12 months, they had ‘written letters,
emailed or phoned government officials about global warming’.
Those who indicated that they had done so once or more were
then asked ‘When you contacted a government official did you. . .’
with responses of 1 ¼ Urge them to take action to reduce global
warming?, 2 ¼ Urge them not to take action to reduce global
warming? and 3 ¼ Other. Based on these two items, we computed
a dichotomous variable such that participants who indicated that
they had contacted a government official at least once and urged
them to reduce climate change were given a score of 1. All other
responses were given a value of 0, including people who either
had never contacted government officials about climate change
or those who had, but had urged them not to reduce it.
Control variables
We controlled for a number of variables to better isolate the ef-
fect of felt responsibility in the presence of other known

predictors of climate change-related political participation [11,
15], and thus to obtain more accurate effect size estimates.
Demographics. Ipsos KnowledgePanel provided age, income, edu-
cation,
gender
and
race
information
as
file
variables.
Descriptive statistics for income, education, gender and race are
shown in Table 1, while descriptive statistics for age (as well as
most other variables) are shown in Table 2. Gender was recoded
to 0 ¼ Male and 1 ¼ Female. Race was recoded 0 ¼ White and
1 ¼ Non-White. A total of 63.3% of participants were considered
White and 36.7% of participants were considered Non-White.
All percentages presented are unweighted.
Political ideology. Participants were asked ‘In general, do you
think of yourself as. . .’ with responses on a 5-point scale ranging
from 1 ¼ Very liberal to 5 ¼ Very conservative.
Party identification. Participants were asked to respond to the ques-
tion, ‘Generally speaking, do you think of yourself as a... ’.
Respondents
could
choose
from
‘Republican,
Democrat,
Independent, Other and No party/not interested in politics’. Those
who selected ‘Independent’ or ‘Other’ were prompted to identify,
in a follow-up question, which party they lean toward via the ques-
tion, ‘Do you think of yourself as closer to the...’, with the response
options of ‘Republican party, Democratic party or Neither’. These
two items were combined and recoded into a new variable which
sorted
the
responses
into
one
of
five
response
categories:
1¼ Democrat,
2¼ Lean
Democrat,
3¼ Independent,
4¼ Lean
Republican and 5¼ Republican. Those who indicated ‘No party/not
interested in politics’ were treated as missing.
Worry. Participants were asked ‘How worried are you about
global warming?’ with responses on a 4-point scale ranging
from 1 ¼ Not at all worried to 4 ¼ Very worried.
Risk perception. Participants were asked ‘How much do you think
global warming will harm. . .’. Participants then responded to
eight items, each measured on a 4-point scale with response
options ranging from 1 ¼ Not at all to 4 ¼ A great deal. Items in-
cluded were ‘You personally’, ‘Your family’, ‘People in your
community’, ‘People in the USA’, ‘People in developing coun-
tries’, ‘The world’s poor’, ‘Future generations of people’ and
‘Plant and animal species’. These items were averaged to create
an index of risk perception (a ¼ 0.97).
Descriptive norms. Participants were asked ‘How much of an ef-
fort do your family and friends make to reduce global warming?’
with responses on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 ¼ No effort to
5 ¼ A great deal of effort.
Injunctive norms. Participants were asked ‘How important is it to
your family and friends that you take action to reduce global
warming?’ with responses on a 5-point scale ranging from
1 ¼ Not at all important to 5 ¼ Extremely important.
Analysis
To test H1 and H2, hierarchical multiple regressions were con-
ducted to determine whether felt responsibility had a positive
and significant relationship to willingness to join a campaign
or support for pro-climate presidential candidates after ac-
counting for the control variables. To test H3, a hierarchical bi-
nary logistic regression was conducted to test whether felt
responsibility positively predicted past contact with elected
officials
after
accounting
for
the
control
variables.
We
assessed multicollinearity by examining tolerance and VIF
scores for every variable in all of the models. All VIF scores
were below 4 and all tolerance scores were above 0.25, indicat-
ing that no issues with multicollinearity were present. All
study hypotheses and analyses were pre-registered at the
Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/y467q (In response to
reviewer requests, the analyses presented in this manuscript
deviate from the pre-registered analysis plan in two key ways:
(i) we added party identification as a control variable in all
analyses and (ii) past contact with elected officials was added
as a control variable in the models predicting support for pro-
climate candidates and willingness to join a campaign given
that these are also plausible predictors of our dependent varia-
bles. The original, pre-registered analyses are available in the
Supplementary Materials. We found that the results did not
substantively differ with these additional covariates.). The
analyses presented here are unweighted. Previous work sug-
gests that results typically do not differ greatly between
weighted and unweighted data; however, unweighted analy-
ses have the additional advantage of increased statistical
power [16]. Results for the weighted analyses are available in
the Supplementary Materials. Consistent with prior work, we
do not find any substantive differences between the weighted
and unweighted results. Sample weights were created and
provided by the sample vendor, Ipsos.
RESULTS
Table 3 presents zero order bivariate correlations for the pre-
dictor and outcome variables and Tables 4–6 present regres-
sion results addressing the hypotheses. Consistent with H1
and H2, felt responsibility had a positive and significant rela-
tionship with willingness to join a campaign (b ¼ 0.12, P < 0.01;
Table 4) and support for pro-climate presidential candidates

(b ¼ 0.13, P < 0.001; Table 5). However, in both cases, felt re-
sponsibility explained only 1% of variance in the dependent
measure, constituting a small effect size [17]. The relationship
between felt responsibility and past contact with elected offi-
cials was non-significant (odds ratio ¼ 1.17, P > 0.05; Table 6),
thus H3 was not supported.
DISCUSSION
We found that felt responsibility to help reduce climate change
has a significant positive relationship with intent to engage in
climate change-related political behavior, but not past behavior.

individuals intend to perform certain behaviors, a range of bar-
riers may inhibit them from acting on those intentions [15, 18].
Past research found that respondents’ most commonly cited
barriers to contacting elected officials about global warming in-
clude the fact that nobody has ever asked them to, they don’t
think it would make a difference, they don’t see themselves as
an activist and they don’t know which elected officials to con-
tact [19]. Future research could test interventions that might re-
duce such barriers to action by increasing the reach of advocacy
appeals and addressing issues associated with outcome expect-
ations, activist identification and whom to contact.
Felt responsibility predicted only a small amount of variance
in willingness to join a campaign and support for pro-climate
presidential candidates, indicating that its importance as a pre-
dictor of political participation may be nuanced. Future research
may benefit from investigating felt responsibility as a mediator
between other variables—such as risk perception or worry—and
political participation, as this has been fruitful in other research
[11]. Additional research might also differentiate between feelings
of personal and collective responsibility, as well as examine other
subpopulations of interest. For example, a recent study of health
professionals found that the perception that health professionals
as a group have a responsibility to educate the public and policy-
makers about climate change was a strong predictor of willing-
ness to engage in climate change advocacy [20]. It is also
important to note that our measure of felt responsibility was
based on a single survey item. This may have limited our ability
to capture additional dimensions that perhaps more strongly re-
late to climate change-related political participation, such as ask-
ing participants about feelings of responsibility to engage in
specific political actions (contact elected officials, support pro-
climate candidates) as opposed to felt responsibility to reduce cli-
mate change generally. Additionally, we cannot draw any causal
conclusions about the effect of felt responsibility on intentions to
engage in climate change-related political behavior given that
our data are purely observational. Future research could advance
our understanding by utilizing multi-item measures of felt
responsibility and experiments to assess causality.
CONCLUSION
Accelerating reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to avert
the worst effects of climate change is an imperative for human-
ity. Although myriad responses will be needed, political partici-
pation is a key to generating the political will be necessary for
more ambitious action. Understanding the factors that can lead
to this—however small—gives us insight into ways to increase
public demand for stronger leadership and more robust climate
solutions.
