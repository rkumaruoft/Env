The most costly impact of climate change affecting 
Canadians is residential basement flooding, that is 
often made worse through poor land-use planning 
and management.
With about 9% (3.3 million) and 11% (3.9 million) of the Canadian population 
residing in 1-in-100 and 1-in-200-year floodplains, respectively, these percentages are 
expected to increase as floodplains expand in response to more extreme precipitation 
driven by climate change (Mohanty and Simonivic 2021) and to the loss of natural 
infrastructure (e.g., forests, grasslands and wetlands that act as “sponges”).  Also, 
outside the boundary of floodplains, residential flooding is impacting an increasing 
number of homes and communities due to high intensity precipitation events – 
referred to colloquially as “water bombs” – that render historically safe communities 
vulnerable to flooding.
Against this backdrop, this study examined whether catastrophic flooding affects 
Canadian residential real estate (house sold price, days on market and number of 
listings) and mortgage markets (arrears and deferrals). The primary audience to 
which findings of this report bears direct relevance includes homeowners, mortgage 
providers, municipalities and financial regulators.   
Five cities that experienced one-or-two catastrophic floods (i.e., events triggering 
upwards of $25 million in insurable claims), from 2009-2020, were considered 
in the real estate component of the study: Grand Forks (British Columbia: 2018), 
Burlington (Ontario: 2014), Toronto (Ontario: 2019), Ottawa (Ontario:  2019 and 
2017) and Gatineau (Quebec: 2017).  Two cities were considered relative to the 
impact of flooding on mortgage arrears and deferrals.  Aggregated mortgage arrears 
and deferrals data was provided by a Canadian financial institution which requested 
that the cities analyzed remain anonymous.
Relative to study design, the impact of flooding on the real estate and mortgage 
markets was measured for periods of six months pre- vs. post-catastrophic flood 
event.  For example, if a flood event occurred on January 1, 2020, the time period 
under investigation would include six months pre-flood (July 1, 2019 to December 
31, 2019) and six months post-flood (January 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020).  Attribution 
of “flood only impacts” was determined by juxtaposing (or “subtracting out”) 
changes in nearby non-flooded control communities (i.e., areas with virtually 
identical demographic and housing characteristics) over identical times of six months 
pre- vs. post-flooding.  Thus, all data presented in this report reflects the isolated or 
“net effects” of flooding.

Residential Real Estate 
The net impacts of catastrophic flooding on residential housing, averaged across the 
five aforementioned cities (and six flood events), for six months pre- vs. post-flood 
event, were as follows:
As context, for a house that would sell at the Canadian average price of $713,500 (as 
of December 2021; WOWA 2021), if the neighbourhood was subject to catastrophic 
flooding, and assuming the average 8.2% impact of flooding on price, the house 
would be sold for $654,993, reflecting a “flood discount” of $58,507.
A 19.8% longer time period to sell a house in a flooded community may not be 
material to sellers, as the median time to sell a house in Canada is 65 days (Realtor 
2021), which would translate into an additional 13 days on market.  This longer 
time frame may reflect caution on the part of buyers practicing due diligence when 
purchasing a house in a flood prone community. 
A 44.3% reduction in the number of houses listed for sale following a catastrophic 
flood may be due to: (a) expectation of a lower listing price in the aftermath of 
flooding, (b) waiting for the “stigma” of flooding to pass, and/or (c) time required to 
remediate a house following flood damage prior to listing (Hino and Marshall 2020; 
Sanders et al. 2020).  Arguably, 44.3% fewer house listings reflects stress on those 
who would otherwise position their house on the market – additionally, stakeholders 
in the real estate sector, including real estate agents, stagers, lawyers, mortgage 
brokers and lenders, would also realize an impact (Zhang and Leonard 2019).
A case study (Fredericton, NB) suggested that for communities within cities that flood 
on a near annual basis for at least a decade (vs. one or two catastrophic floods per 
decade), the impact of flooding can be priced into the real estate market permanently.

Residential Mortgages
When evaluating the net impacts of catastrophic flooding on residential mortgage 
arrears and deferrals for two Canadian cities, for six months pre- vs. post-flood event, 
the results showed no consistent or material impact. Post-flood mortgage arrears 
and deferrals increased in the flood-impacted region of one community (relative to 
the non-flood impacted control), while in the second city, the results reversed. This 
outcome suggests that factors other than flooding may be consequential to mortgage 
arrears and deferrals (Balmbra 2021).
Importantly, the rate of mortgage arrears and deferrals in flooded vs. non-flooded 
communities largely fell within market norms.  The total number of arrears and 
deferrals in flood-impacted and control regions ranged from 0.32 – 7.07 per 1,000 
homes over a six-month period, which translates to a worse-case scenario of 1.18 
arrears and deferrals per 1,000 homes per month.  The consequences of  flooding 
appear to be relatively immaterial regarding mortgage arrears, particularly 
considering that impacts would generally last only a few months post-flood (Zhang 
and Leonard 2019).

Mitigating Residential Flood Risk
Currently, available and/or suggested developments to help limit the impact of 
flooding at the community and/or individual house level include, but are not limited 
to, the following:
•	 Home Flood Protection Guidance: Banks, credit unions, real estate 
brokers, mortgage providers and Property & Casualty insurers are increasingly 
distributing the infographic Three Steps to Cost-Effective Home Flood 
Protection, to provide direction to homeowners regarding practical actions 
to lower risk of basement flooding. Most steps in this infographic are 
deployable with no special expertise and for minimal cost. https://www.
intactcentreclimateadaptation.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-Steps-to-
Home-Flood-Protection_March-2021_Space-for-Partner-Logo.pdf
•	 Climate Adaptation Home Rating Program (CAHRP): The federal 
government of Canada launched the CAHRP in 2021, as a companion to 
EnerGuide home energy audits.  CAHRP can help homeowners to navigate the 
flood retrofit process, and expand on the eligibility requirements of the Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation’s (CMHC) deep home retrofit program 
and Canada Greener Home Grants to include more climate resilience/
flood risk mitigation measures. https://liberal.ca/wp-content/uploads/
sites/292/2021/08/wildfires-ENG-1.pdf 
•	 Flood Risk Maps: Federal, provincial, territorial and municipal governments 
are updating flood risk maps to aid city planners, developers, engineers and 
municipal risk officers to identify and remediate areas at high risk of flooding.  
These maps, where publicly available, may guide homeowners to make 
informed decisions to limit flood risk. 
•	 Residential Flood Risk Scores: Federal, provincial, territorial and 
municipal governments should develop a system that establishes a flood risk 
score for any residential property, based on address/postal code (as exists in the 
US - https://floodfactor.com/).
•	 Natural Infrastructure: Federal, provincial, territorial and municipal 
governments should develop and enforce guidelines and standards to retain and 
restore natural infrastructure (e.g., forests, grasslands, wetlands) to limit current 
and future flood risk. In addition to government led initiatives, residents should 
also be proactive and use natural infrastructure, for example, to a greater extent 
on their personal properties (e.g., wild gardens and naturalized driveways). 
•	 Community Flood Risk Mitigation: Through guidelines supported 
by the Standards Council of Canada and the National Research Council,

communities can act now to identify areas at high risk of flooding, and 
subsequently deploy actions to mitigate risks (in some cases flood risk protection 
may be beyond practical and cost-effective remediation). https://www.

The “bad news” regarding the impact of flooding on residential housing is that 
climate change and extreme weather-related flood risk, at times combined with poor 
land-use planning, will get more challenging across many regions of Canada (IPCC 
2021), and if left unchecked, will increasingly distress the residential housing market.  
The “good news” is that Canada has developed, or is in the process of developing, a 
wealth of guidance to help homeowners and communities to mitigate flood risk.
The challenge going forward is to apply known and evolving best practices, guidelines 
and standards to mitigate home and community-level flood risk with a sense of 
urgency, which is the applied and philosophical centerpiece of Canada’s National 
Adaptation Strategy (https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/
climatechange/climate-plan/national-adaptation-strategy.html).

Property-level residential flooding of detached, 
semi-detached and row housing is occurring 
more frequently across Canada, driven in part 
by “increasing trends in extreme precipitation in 
North America”, which models and theory suggest 
will continue as the climate warms (Kirchmeier-
Young and Zhang 2020).  
With about 9% (3.3 million) and 11% (3.9 million) of the Canadian population 
residing in 1-in-100 and 1-in-200 year floodplains, respectively – and with flood risk 
on the rise (Mohanty and Simonovic 2021; IPCC 2021) – if left unchecked flooding 
may impact the “safety and soundness of the Canadian financial system” (OSFI 2021).
Testimony to the adverse impact of flooding is the increase in Canadian home 
insurance premiums of 20-25% over the period 2015-2019, with more than half 
of this upturn attributable to flood damage (Moudrak and Feltmate 2020).  The 
Property & Casualty (“P&C”) insurance implications of residential flooding are 
material and understood.  What is not known, and therefore is the focus of this study, 
is the impact severe flooding may have on Canada’s housing market, relative to:
If left unchecked

and soundness 
of the Canadian 
financial system”
A North American 
examination of 
catastrophic loss 
impacts on real 
estate values has 
shown that “the 
homeowner has 
the most financial 
risk associated with 
climate impacts”
Quantitative documentation regarding the effects of flooding on real estate 
parameters is available primarily from the United States and the United Kingdom 
(Belanger et al. 2018).  Consistent with this, a North American examination of 
catastrophic loss impacts on real estate values has shown that “the homeowner has 
the most financial risk associated with climate impacts” (Chopik 2019).  
Canadian studies have tended to be more anecdotal, yet insightful – as suggested by 
Appraisal Institute of Canada CEO Keith Lancastle, “challenges stemming from climate 
change have resulted in individual property owners seeing reductions in the value of  their property, 
or the need to take additional steps to help protect that property from the impacts of  climate change” 
(Meyer 2020).
Introduction
Treading Water: Impact of Catastrophic Flooding on Canada’s Housing Market

As profiled in Canada’s Changing Climate Report 2019 (ECCC 2019), and by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2021), climate change and extreme 
weather are effectively irreversible, and will continue to challenge Canada’s real 
estate market.  Although initiatives within Canada, and globally, to mitigate 
greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act 
2020) and sequester carbon are commendable, these efforts will slow, but not stop, 
climate change.
Relative to insurable losses, flooding is the most pervasive and costly extreme weather 
risk in Canada (Feltmate et al. 2020).  More specifically, catastrophic insured losses 
(i.e., events that trigger > $25 million in claims) associated with extreme weather 
in Canada over the period from 1983-2021 are presented in Figure 1.  From 1983-
2008, insurance losses averaged $250-$450 million per year.  From 2009-2021 
losses increased, averaging $1.96 billion per year, and for 12 of 13 years (finishing 
2021) annual losses were in excess of $1 billion per year. The causal factor driving 
over 50% of the escalating claims was “too much water in the wrong place”, and 
specifically, residential basement flooding.

Source: IBC (2022) & CatIQ (2022)
Note: claims have been normalized for inflation ($2021) and per capita wealth accumulation.
In addition to increasing residential insurance premiums, cap rates (i.e., the 
maximum level of flood insurance available) for basement flooding are trending 
lower, while the percentage of homes in cities across Canada deemed uninsurable 
relative to flooding is migrating upwards (IBC 2020; Malik 2019).  Beyond the 
financial impacts, in worst case scenarios severe flooding has “turned basement 
apartments into death traps.” (Zaveri et al. 2021).  
The insurance ramifications and general stigma of flooding may affect the price 
that buyers are willing to pay for a home (Ortega and Taspinar 2018; Macdonald 
2019).  Beyond the mental stress of owning a flood prone home, the financial burden 
of a higher insurance premium, lower flood risk cap and/or lack of insurance 
coverage, may make a property undesirable to a potential buyer in the absence of an 
adjustment on purchase price (Chopik 2021).
The average cost of remediating weather-induced flooded basements in Canada is 
$43,000 (Moudrak and Feltmate 2019). If homeowners are without flood insurance, 
or if flood insurance is limited at a low cap, then restoring an impacted basement 
can be a sizable financial challenge. This may be especially true for homeowners 
under conditions where they are “cash strapped” (48% of Canadians report a 
monthly surplus of < $200; CPA 2019).  As such, the cost of basement flood 
remediation could factor into the purchase/sale price of a property.

Flood risk could influence the potential for mortgage arrears, either today or in the 
future if flood risk is left unchecked.  For example, flood risk resulting in a substantial 
increase in an insurance premium could prove problematic for a homeowner with 
limited liquidity (i.e., those with limited surplus monthly cash flow).  Alternatively, 
following a flood, if insurance coverage was materially below remediation costs, or 
there was no flood coverage, homeowners might have to draw down on limited funds 
to remediate damage (for which not acting is not an option with a basement full of 
sewer water), thus potentially forcing the owner into mortgage arrears.
To address these issues, the quantitative method to assess the impact of catastrophic 
flooding on the Canadian real estate and mortgage markets follows below.  
Additionally, practical and cost-effective actions that are within the power of 
homeowners and communities to “get ahead of the curve on flood risk”, rather than 
chasing it, are profiled.

The impact of  community-level residential 
flooding was assessed relative to four categories 
of  response variable: 
Average final sold price of a house
Average days on market to sell a house
Average change in number of houses 
listed for sale
Average change in mortgage arrears 
and deferrals*
* Mortgage arrears refers to a contractual agreement that has not received payment on interest or 
principal by its due date, and that is generally not agreed upon by the lender and borrower.  Mortgage 
deferrals refers to the inability of the borrower to make timely payments on interest or principal 
owed. In these instances, borrowers may defer contractual payments, and restart regular payments once 
the deferral period expires.  The lender and borrower generally agree upon deferrals.  
City and Community Selection Criteria
Cities and communities considered for inclusion in the study were those that 
experienced significant flooding, following the rationale that if flooding had the 
potential to be impactful, it would manifest under a worst-case scenario (otherwise 
referred to as a “sledgehammer” effect; Schindler 1987).
Consistent with the above rationale, flood-impacted cities and communities included 
in the study shared at least two of the following three characteristics:
a.	 experienced P&C insurance claims post-flood event > $25 million (i.e., the 
definition of a “catastrophic” event)
b.	 magnitude of flooding > 1-in-50 year event (i.e., a major flood), and
c.	 community did not have a history of catastrophic level flooding, as otherwise 
flood risk may be priced into the market
The geographic range of cities included in the study was Pan-Canadian 
(representing western, central and eastern Canada). Cities in Canada’s territories 
were not included, as historically flooding has tended to be less problematic in most 
northern communities (Feltmate and Moudrak 2021).
Method
Treading Water: Impact of Catastrophic Flooding on Canada’s Housing Market
18
Residential housing examined in the study was either detached, semi-detached or 
row housing (1-2 story dwellings only).
The period over which flood events were considered was 2009-2020, during which 
time insured losses related to natural catastrophic events escalated to an average of 
approximately $2 billion per year, compared with $422 million per year from 1983-
2008 (Feltmate and Moudrak 2021). In 2021 alone, insured losses were $2.1 billion.  
Accordingly, the potential for catastrophic flooding to impact residential housing and 
mortgage arrears, if at all, would be most evident from 2009 onwards.
Canadian cities/communities meeting the above criteria were identified utilizing 
several sources, including media reporting of major flood events in Canada from 
2009 onwards, and public reports issued by IBC (http://www.ibc.ca/on/disaster/
water/flooding-in-canada).
Provinces and cities that met the above criteria included:
•	 Provinces: British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick
•	 Cities: Grand Forks (BC), Burlington (ON), Toronto (ON), Ottawa (ON), 
Gatineau (QC) 
Inclusion of the above cities in the study was also dependent on the availability of 
data pertaining to:
•	 Real Estate: Average change in (a) sold price of a house, (b) days on market to 
sell a house, and (c) number of houses listed for sale, and
•	 Mortgage: Average change in (a) mortgage arrears, and (b) mortgage deferrals
The primary real estate brokerages that helped to secure real estate data were 
Sotheby’s Realty Associates® and Whitehill Realty International Inc®.
Aggregated mortgage arrears and deferrals analyses were performed for two flooded 
communities (within Canada), based on anonymized data made available by a 
Canadian financial institution which requested that the cities for which the data was 
provided remain anonymous.
Control for Spatial Pseudoreplication
Real estate value and mortgage arrears considered in this study could be influenced 
by factors unrelated to catastrophic flooding (e.g., a factory closing, coincident with 
a flood, could depress housing prices in a community independent of the flood). 
To limit the erroneous conclusion of flood effects when none were present (i.e., 
Type 1 errors; Sokal and Rolff 1981), changes in real estate and mortgage variables 
Method
Treading Water: Impact of Catastrophic Flooding on Canada’s Housing Market
19
were quantified in flooded vs. non-flooded communities, in close promixity, over 
identical time frames (as described below). The net differential, or delta, in variable 
changes between flooded vs. non-flooded communities could then, with confidence, 
be attributed to flooding and not to extraneous factors. For example, if the average 
price of housing in a “flood-impacted” community increased 6% for six months 
pre- vs. post-flooding, and increased 10% in the “non flood-impacted” control, the 
impact of flooding on price would be the delta, or minus 4%.
To limit the misattribution of flood impact between flooded vs. non-flooded 
communities, due to spatial psuedoreplication (Hurlbert 1984), care was taken to 
ensure both communities had similar characterists in terms of the following: 
a.	 geographic proximity (< 1 km apart), or contiguous
b.	 population density/size (+/- 5%) 
c.	 demographics (age distribution of home owners, educational level,  income 
level, marital status, languages spoken)
d.	 average sold price of houses, average days on market, average number of 
houses on market (prior to flood events that impacted flooded communities)
e.	 own vs. rent
f.	 houses considered in both communities included detached, semi-detached 
and row housing, 1-2 story dwellings only
Community Descriptive Characteristics
Characteristics of flooded vs. non-flooded control communities examined in this

Attribution of Flood Impact
The attribution of flooding, as 
the causal mechanism affecting 
real estate and mortgage 
arrears examined in this study, 
is definitive, based on controls 
to account for the spatial 
pseudoreplicative design of this 
study (Eberhardt and Thomas 
1991; Hurlbert 1984).
Specifically, attribution of flooding to explain 
differences in real estate variables and mortgage 
arrears, between flooded vs. non-flooded control 
communities, rested on two precautionary steps. First, 
communities were contiguous or in close proximity 
(< 1 km), and as such, non-flood influences would 
likely have a blanket geographic effect.  Second, there 
were no material differences between communities 
regarding median age, household income, education status, 
marital status, languages spoken and home ownership (see Table 
1).  Seemingly, therefore, flooded and non-flooded 
communities were financial and social analogues.
Additionally, across all communities (i.e., flooded and control), 93% (+/- 1%) 
of houses had finished basements. Detached, semi-detached and row housing 
characterized all communities in virtually identical proportions.
Real Estate Variables
Average Sold Price of Houses 
Net change in the average sold price of houses, across five Canadian cities (and six 
flood events), spanning six months pre- vs. post-flooding, was 8.2% lower (ranging 
from -1.1% to -17.1%) in flooded vs. non-flooded communities (see Figure 2 a-f).  
Additionally, change in average sold housing price was consistently negatively 
impacted, without exception, in flooded vs. non-flooded communities, suggesting that

flooding was the causal mechanism affecting a lower sold price – i.e., the probability 
that an unknown or spurious factor would consistently mimic the expected impact of 
flooding on housing price is low (Balmbra 2021).

Case Study – Fredericton
This case study considered the impact of catastrophic flooding on real estate parameters within a city 
subject to flooding on a near annual basis.  The hypothesis was that under conditions where flooding 
is “often and predictable”, the impacts of flooding should be permanently factored into the real estate 
market.  Relative to flooding in a specific year, if the hypothesis is correct, there would be no statistical 
difference (over a period of six months pre- vs. post-flooding) between flood-impacted and non-flood 
control communities, regarding average sold price of a house, days on market to sell a house, and 
number of houses listed for sale. 
As a candidate city, Fredericton, 
NB, met the criteria to test the 
above hypothesis.
Fredericton experienced major 
floods every year from 2008-2018, 
with the single exception of 2016.  
These floods varied in impact 
between communities within the 
city, due to varying combinations 
of heavy precipitation, ice jams, 
snowmelt, heavy snowfall and late 
spring thaw.  Losses due to flooding 
ranged from $1.4-$25 million in 
insurable claims, with average 
losses of $13.4 million/year 
(excluding 2011, 2015 and 2017, 
for which specific $ losses could not 
be verified).
In April, 2019, Fredericton 
experienced a catastrophic flood 
(CBC 2019).  For six months pre- 
vs. post this flood event, real estate 
variables were measured for flooded 
and non-flooded communities.

Fredericton, NB: Descriptive statistics of flooded vs. non-flooded control communities (all 
data/statistics pertain to 2021: https://www.realtor.ca/en 2021). 
There was no statistically 
significant difference in the sold 
price of houses and days on 
market to sell a house, for the six 
months pre- vs. post-flooding, 
between flood and non-flood 
impacted communities in 
Fredericton relative to the 2019 
flood (see figures on next page).  
This result is consistent with 
the hypothesis that regular and 
predictable flood risk does factor 
into home sale price and the 
time to sell a property.

However, following the 2019 flood, the number of houses listed for sale in flooded communities was 
statistically less, compared to the non-flooded control, for six months pre- vs. post-flooding.  Fewer 
houses listed for sale, post-flooding, may be attributable to:
a.	 expectation of a lower listing price in the aftermath of flooding, 
b.	 waiting for the “stigma” of flooding to pass, and/or 
c.	 time required to remediate a home following flood damage prior to listing. 
The most notable outcome of repeated flooding across communities is the large-scale incorporation of 
flood risk into housing price, independent of a community being flooded in a given year.  Conversely, in 
communities where flooding is infrequent and not geographically pervasive, the impact of flooding on 
house price is community-specific.

Mortgage Variables
Arrears and Deferrals
The net change in average mortgage arrears and deferrals, across two Canadian 
cities, spanning six months pre- vs. post-flooding, differed between communities A 
and B.  In Community A, the mortgage arrear and deferral rate (per 1,000 homes) 
was higher in the flooded community, whereas in Comminity B, the arrear and 
deferral rate was higher in the non-flooded community (see Figure 5 a-b).
Notably, the total number of arrears and deferrals ranged from 0.32/1,000 homes 
(Figure 5a, pre-flood) to 7.07/1,000 homes (Figure 5b, post-control), in both cases 
over six months.  Accordingly, the “worst case scenario” of arrears and deferrals of 
7.07/1,000 homes, per six months, translates to 1.18 arrears and deferrals per 1,000 
homes per month.  This rate of mortgage arrears and deferrals, on a monthly basis, 
in flooded and non-flooded communities, suggests that flooding is not debilitating 
relative to Canada’s residential mortgage market, particularly considering that 
impacts would generally last only a few months (Zhang and Leonard 2019).   
Figure 5 (a-b): Change in the rate of mortgage arrears and deferrals, in flooded (blue) vs. non-
flooded (green) communities within two Canadian cities, for periods six months pre- vs. post-
flooding.  Net Δ refers to the difference in percent change in total number of mortgage arrears and 
deferrals between flooded and non-flooded communities, pre- vs. post-flooding (Chi2 < 0.05 reflects 
a statistical difference in response variable between flooded vs. non-flooded communities). 
**Note: Based on data availability the above correction for mortgage arrears and deferrals per 1000 homes does not 
distinguish between homes with/without mortgages.  According to Statistics Canada, the national average of homeowners 
having not paid off the mortgage on their principal residence equals 57% (as of 2016) (Statistics Canada, 2019).
The implications of flooding to the Canadian residential real estate market follow below, presented with practical 
and affordable actions to mitigate risks at the household and community-level.

The magnitude and frequency of climate change 
and extreme weather-related flood risk is becoming 
increasingly challenging globally (IPCC 2021), 
and across many regions of Canada (ECCC/Bush 
and Lemmen 2019).  The consequences of this 
risk convey material costs to real estate markets 
internationally (Mackenzie 2021) and within 
Canada, with relevance to the primary stakeholders 
of this report: homeowners, mortgage providers, 
municipalities and financial regulators. 
Over the period 1983-2008, catastrophic insurable claims in Canada hovered around 
$250-450 million per year, whereas from 2009-2021 claims average $1.96 billion 
per year, with more than half of this escalation attributable to flooding (IBC 2022; 
CatIQ 2022; Feltmate and Moudrak 2021).  It was against this backdrop that this 
study examined the impacts of catastrophic flooding on Canada’s residential housing 
and mortgage markets.
Housing Market
The impact of intermittent catastrophic flooding on the residential housing market 
within communities across five Canadian cities and six flood events (Grand Forks, 
BC, 2018; Burlington, ON, 2014; Toronto, ON, 2019; Ottawa, ON, 2019 and 2017; 
Gatineau, QC, 2017) was significant. Average flood impacts on the real estate 
housing market, for periods of six months pre- vs. post-flooding, were: 
For every city 
examined, the 
percentage change 
in the average sold 
price of homes 
was lower (less 
advantageous), 
without exception, 
in flooded vs. non-
flooded communities
Notable was the fact that for every city examined, the percentage change in the 
average sold price of houses, over the six-month period pre- vs. post-flooding,

was lower (less advantageous), without exception, in flooded vs. non-flooded 
communities.  For most homeowners their home is their prime investment and 
retirement fund, therefore, any compromise to the intrinsic value of this investment 
is material (Claveau 2020; Macdonald 2019).
Transactionally, in the aftermath of flooding, the seller determines asking price and 
timing when listing a house for sale, and the buyer controls days on market and 
purchase price.  Strategically, sellers and buyers would probably tend to under- and 
over-weigh flood risk, respectively.
Additionally, properties impacted by flooding would generally bear increased costs 
for maintenance and repair, and increases in property taxes related to municipal 
resilience and recovery investments.  Overall, real estate with higher climate-related 
flood risk will have higher TMI costs (Taxes, Maintenance and Insurance) than lower 
risk properties (Chopik 2021).
Beyond the six-month post-flood period, the study did not examine whether real 
estate parameters might rebound, as some studies suggest could happen (Clayton 
et al. 2021; Pfeffer 2017; Zhang 2016).  A longer timeframe of examination is 
suggested for the next stage of this study.
Under conditions where a city experiences significant flooding on a near annual 
basis, the impact of flooding can be incorporated permanently into the real estate 
market (Macdonald 2019). Evidence of this effect was observed in this study.  
More specifically, in Fredericton – which experienced ten major floods from 2008-
2018 – for six months pre vs. post major flooding in 2019, no changes in average 
housing price and days on market were observed between flooded and non-flooded 
control communities.  However, fewer houses were listed for sale in flood-impacted 
communities post-flooding, presumably due to the time required to prepare a house 
for sale following a flood (Beltran et al. 2018; Zhang and Leonard 2019).
Rental Market
Although not considered in this study, the impact of residential flooding is relevant 
to those renting basement apartments.  When rental homes are impacted by disasters 
such as flooding, occupants have little say in when or how repairs are made, and 
research indicates that these properties recover from flood damage more slowly than 
owner-occupied residences (Wesseler 2021).  Additionally, those renting basement 
apartments, as a group, tend to have lower incomes and are often forced to compete 
for reasonably priced housing in tight markets – as a result, renters can find 
themselves in poor-quality apartments in neighbourhoods struggling with inadequate 
infrastructure (Wesseler 2021).  These suboptimal conditions can predispose those

with limited resources to pay up to half their wages 
for housing, making it difficult for them to save for 
emergencies (Hino and Burke 2021). In addition, 
only 50% of Canadian renters purchase tenant 
insurance, leaving half of renters exposed to personal 
property loss (e.g., loss of clothing and furniture), 
liability costs (e.g., injury) and/or additional living 
expenses (e.g., extended stay in a hotel) should a 
home become uninhabitable following a weather 
induced flood event (CBC 2018; Belairdirect 2021).  
Accordingly, unexpected flood costs, compounded 
by the potential for lost time from work to remediate 
an apartment, can lead to homelessness.  Clearly, 
residential flooding is a challenge for homeowners 
and renters alike. 
Mortgage Market
In contrast to the substantial impacts of flooding on multiple characteristics of the 
real estate market, there was no material impact on mortgage arrears and deferrals.
Criteria to qualify for a mortgage in Canada appears to be sufficiently robust that 
homeowners have adequate resources to absorb flood costs and restore their homes, 
post-flood, without compromising their mortgage.  In jurisdictions where mortgage 
qualification is less robust (e.g., in various states across the United States), borrowers 
may suffer defaults (Duprey et al. 2021).
Additionally, despite an average cost of $43,000 for weather-induced basement 
flooding in Canada, homeowners may absorb the costs by drawing upon sewer-
backup and/or overland flood insurance (overland flood insurance became available 
in Canada starting on or about 2015, in the aftermath of catastrophic floods in 
Calgary and Toronto in 2013) (Feltmate and Moudrak 2021).
Mortgage Securitization
Devaluation of a residential property due to flooding is relevant to both mortgage 
providers and their insurers (e.g., Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, 
Canada Guaranty Mortgage Insurance Company).  Mortgage approvals and 
rates depend, in part, on the loan-to-value ratio of  an insured property.  If  the 
“value” of  a mortgaged property is compromised by “unanticipated flood risk”, 
lenders and insurers may erroneously approve, or misprice, mortgage rates and

mortgage insurance.  To minimize this risk against a backdrop of escalating flood 
impacts across Canada (ECCC 2019), mortgage providers and insurers could make 
home flood assessment a mandatory condition for coverage.  Additionally, as flood 
susceptibility evolves, the capital reserves of lenders (e.g., those under the authority 
of such agencies as the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions) might 
require adjustment depending on future risk.
Actions to Mitigate Residential/Community 
Flood Risk
Clearly, the consequences of catastrophic flooding are material to the Canadian 
residential housing market.  Arguably, the consequence of greatest concern to 
homeowners would be property devaluation (Macdonald 2019).  Adding to the 
financial burden of home remediation is the psychosocial or mental health stress 
Canadians experience in the aftermath of flooding.  For up to three years following 
a basement flood event, on a stress scale of 0-5 (with five being the worst), 48% of 
impacted homeowners rank their stress as 4.5-to-5 when a major precipitation event 
occurs, supported by such typical statements as, “It’s something you never want to experience 
again in your life” (Decent and Feltmate 2018).
Against this background, the discussion now turns to practical, meaningful and 
cost-effective means to limit risk of community-level and residential flooding.  The 
demand for disclosure of climate-risk is an important precursor to caveat emptor (buyer 
beware), empowering the homeowner to understand, accept and respond to climate-
risk and resilience in the context of property ownership (Chopik 2019).  Additionally, 
communities and residents do not have to be victims of circumstance regarding flood 
risk – although risk may not be eliminated, it can be managed by implementing a 
number of flood mitigation measures, guidelines and standards developed in Canada 
since approximately 2015 forward.
Actions and guidelines to limit home and community-level flood risk include, but are 
not limited to, the following.

Climate Adaptation Home Rating Program (CAHRP)
As suggested by the federal government of Canada, “as climate change intensifies, it will 
only become more important for Canadians to understand what positive, affordable and practical 
measures they can take to protect their homes and communities against flood.” In response, 
CAHRP was launched in 2021, as a companion to EnerGuide home energy audits.
CAHRP will help homeowners to navigate the flood retrofit process and expand on 
the eligibility requirements of the CMHC deep home retrofit program and Canada 
Greener Home Grants to include more climate resilience/flood risk mitigation 
measures. https://liberal.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/292/2021/08/wildfires-

Flood Risk Maps
Federal, provincial, territorial and municipal governments are updating flood risk 
maps to aid city planners, developers, engineers and risk officers to identify and 
remediate areas at high risk of flooding.  In the Federal Government of Canada 
Budget 2021, $63.8 million was dedicated, over three years, to Natural Resources 
Canada, Environment and Climate Change Canada, and Public Safety Canada, to 
work with provinces and territories to complete flood maps for higher risk areas in 
Canada (GOC 2021a).
As flood risk maps become available, homeowners, municipalities, builders and 
developers should utilize this resource to deploy flood risk measures for homes and 
properties at risk today, and avoid building in areas subject to flood risk tomorrow.

Residential Flood Risk Scores
Federal, provincial, territorial and municipal governments should develop a system to 
establish a flood risk score for any residential property, based on address/postal code 
(as exists in the US - https://floodfactor.com/).
Approximately 142 million addresses in the US can receive a flood risk 
score, for free, on a ten point scale (Brinkhurst 2020).  A system such as this 
– sensu Flood Factor Canada – would motivate homeowners to protect 
their property from flood risk in cases where scores were not favourable.
As suggested by the designers, First Street Foundation: “the most important 
element of  Flood Factor is its simplicity.  Behind the scenes, the team at First Street 
Foundation has created a first-of-its-kind methodology that adjusts for the reality 
of  a changing climate and how it will impact flood risk into the future, accounts for 
local adaptation, and incorporates the four major contributors to flooding: tidal, rain, 
riverine and storm surge, all at the level of  granularity needed to calculate flood risk for 
individual properties.  Despite the complexity of  the modelling, the user experience is 
accessible and compelling” (Brinkhurst 2020).
Canadian homeowners and renters would benefit greatly, by way of home flood 
protection, if they had access to a Flood Factor Canada-style system, which could also 
be added to real estate listings.  This system would serve to pull, rather than push, 
Canadians to protect their home from flooding.
Natural Infrastructure
Federal, provincial, territorial and municipal 
governments should develop and enforce guidelines 
and standards to retain and restore natural 
infrastructure (e.g., forests, grasslands, wetlands), in 
both urban and rural areas, to limit current and future 
home and community-level flood risk.  This guidance 
may consider both risk assessment and planning policy 
reform.  In the Federal Government of Canada Budget 
2021, $200 million was dedicated to Infrastructure 
Canada, over three years starting 2021-22, to establish 
a Natural Infrastructure Fund to support natural 
and hybrid (built) infrastructure projects to mitigate 
flood risk (GOC 2021a).

Discussion
This directive, as presented by the Federal government, “will improve social well-being, 
mitigate the impacts of  climate change, and prevent costly natural disasters.”  Home flood 
protection touches upon all three of these benefits.
As suggested by Brindamour and Feltmate (2021), “Forests, grasslands and 
wetlands aren’t simply decoration on the landscape. They help with flood management 
and protect us from drought, remove carbon emissions and provide clean water, all while 
supporting a diverse habitat for plants and animals. Joint research between the Intact 
Centre and the Insurance Bureau of  Canada report that through the preservation of  
wetlands, we can reduce flood damage costs by up to 40 per cent. Natural infrastructure 
also helps to keep our cities cool. On a sunny day in an urban centre, building and 
road surfaces can get up to 50 degrees hotter, while natural surfaces remain closer to air 
temperatures.  It’s clear why natural infrastructure is quickly gaining momentum as a 
front-line climate adaptation solution. Climate mitigation, adaptation and economic benefits 
make nature a winner. We need to protect the natural infrastructure we have and restore 
what we’ve damaged.”
In addition to government led initiatives, residents should also be proactive and use 
natural infrastructure, for example, to a greater extent on their personal properties 
(e.g., wild gardens and naturalized driveways).
Community Flood Risk Mitigation
Canada has a wealth of community-level, focused 
flood risk mitigation guidelines, created and supported 
by such organizations as: Standards Council of 
Canada, National Research Council, Canadian 
Standards Association, professional associations, 
insurance providers, conservation authorities and 
their equivalents, NGOs, academics, and builders and 
developers (Moudrak and Feltmate 2019).
These guidelines provide a practical and cost-
effective framework to help larger cities, and smaller 
communities with limited resources, to identify regions 
within their boundaries that are subject to flooding, 
while outlining actions to keep people and property out 
of harm’s way.

measures are profiled in Figure 7.  By definition, as communities improve their 
flood risk profile, benefits will accrue to residential housing.  By deploying flood risk 
measures “before the big storms hit”, communities and homeowners may avert the 
need to deploy thousands of sandbags (generally under time-limited conditions).  
Sandbags should be a measure of last resort in a community prepared for flood risk.

Examples of Flood-Resilient Design Considerations
Riverine/Fluvial Flooding 
Occurs when water levels in watercourses 
rise and spill over their banks. Flooding is a 
natural river process but may be exacerbated 
by climate change, as well as past human 
intervention in the watershed. Riverine 
flooding is often seasonal, with contributing 
and compounding factors including 
snowmelt, spring thaw, extreme rainfall, ice 
and debris jams.
•	 Proactively maintain and replace culverts, bridges, dikes, levees, pump stations 
and other flood-control structures, and resize these structures during infrastructure 
replacement/renewal cycles to accommodate extreme weather event conditions.
•	 Proactively manage vegetation and maintain riparian buffer zones — vegetated 
“buffer-strips” — along watercourses, including debris removal.
•	 Flood-proof properties on flood plains through the use of elevation, flood-resilient 
materials and design, and the elevation of mechanical and electrical equipment, to 
achieve a level of tolerable flood risk as defined by a local, regional or provincial/
territorial authority.
•	 Upstream of populated areas, attenuate and store stormwater and runoff using 
natural systems and grey infrastructure.
•	 In high-risk areas, build community-scale structural flood mitigation works (such as 
berms and dikes) to supplement other flood-proofing measures.
•	 In areas of chronic flood concern, buy out property owners and/or relocate properties.
•	 Establish forecasting and warning systems that can provide sufficient operational 
lead time to deploy flood-protection measures in case of a flood emergency.
Overland/Pluvial Flooding 
Occurs when excess stormwater flows over 
private properties, entering homes through 
their lowest openings (such as basement 
windows and doors) and causing damage.
•	 Proactively clear catch basins and culverts.
•	 Remove snow from critical overland flow paths before the spring thaw.
•	 Regrade lots and roadways to carry overland water away from properties, onto rights-
of-way.
•	 Attentuate and store stormwater and runoff using natural systems and grey 
infrastructure.
Storm/Sanitary Sewer Back-up
Occurs when the storm and/ or sanitary sewer 
systems are overloaded, causing surcharge 
and backup into basements.
•	 Install backwater valves on storm and sanitary sewer laterals.
•	 Disconnect roof leaders from storm and sanitary sewers.
•	 Seal and bolt manhole covers in low-lying areas, where stormwater accumulates and 
has a higher risk of contributing to sewer surcharge.
•	 Implement stormwater diversion projects (for example, install pipes to carry excess 
stormwater from overwhelmed areas to areas with greater capacity).
Foundation System Failures
Occurs when foundation drainage systems 
fail and water enters basements though 
foundation drains or seeps through 
foundation walls.
•	 Disconnect downspouts and sump pump discharge pipes from foundation drains.
•	 Install sump pumps and sump pump backup power systems, equipped with alarms.
•	 Repair foundation cracks and install flood-damage-resistant materials in basements 
during home renovations.
•	 Install an impermeable layer of soil around homes (that is, in foundation backfill 
areas) to reduce the risk of water infiltration and seepage through foundation walls.

In December 2020, as part of its strengthened 
climate plan, the Government of Canada 
committed to develop Canada’s first National 
Adaptation Strategy with provincial, territorial 
and municipal governments, Indigenous Peoples, 
and other key partners.  
A key directive of the strategy is to identify key priorities to “unite actors across Canada 
through shared priorities, cohesive action, and a whole-of-Canada approach to 
reducing climate change risks” (GOC 2021b).
No shared priority will unite Canadians from coast-to-coast more than protecting 
their homes, owned or rented, from flooding.  As this study quantified for the first 
time, flooding in Canadian communities compromises the residential real estate 
market in three material ways: (a) lower average sold price of houses, (b) increase 
in average number of days on market to sell a house, and (c) reduction in average 
number of houses listed on market.  The cohesive action to limit the residential 
impact of flooding is in-hand, starting with the newly minted (2021) Climate 
Adaptation Home Rating Program (CAHRP) to be developed as a companion 
to EnerGuide home energy audits.
The National Adaptation Strategy’s recognition of a whole-of-Canada approach 
is key to advancing home flood protection.  The IPCC (2021) reported that there 
will be no “new normal” on climate change, but rather escalating extreme weather. 
With flood protection at its centerpiece, the National Adaptation Strategy 
could help to secure what for many Canadians is their #1 financial investment – 
their home.
