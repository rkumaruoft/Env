limate, the Earth’s ecosystems, their biodiversity, 
and human civilization are all closely linked. Cli-
mate change is man-made, the consequences of 
which exceed the capacity of the various ecosystems to 
adapt. The loss and damage caused (1) is becoming an in-
creasingly palpable and visible threat to human health (2, 
3).
Summary
Background: All over the world, climate change is exerting negative and complex effects on human living conditions and health. 
In this narrative review, we summarize the current global evidence regarding the effects of climate change on mental health. 
Methods: A systematic literature search concerning the direct effects of acute extreme weather events (floods, storms, fires) and 
chronic stresses (heat, drought) due to climate change, as well as the indirect effects of climate change (food insecurity, 
 migration), on the diagnoses of mental disorders, psychological distress, and psychiatric emergency admissions was carried out 
in PubMed and PsychInfo, and supplemented by expert selection. 1017 studies were identified, and 128 were included.
Results: The heterogeneity of study methods does not permit any overall estimate of effect strength. The available evidence 
shows that traumatic experiences due to extreme weather events increase the risk of affective and anxiety disorders, especially 
the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder. Heat significantly increases the morbidity and mortality attributable to mental illness, as 
well as the frequency of psychiatric emergencies. Persistent stressors such as drought, food insecurity, and migration owing to 
climate change can also be major risk factors for mental illness. 
Conclusion: The consequences of climate change are stress factors for mental health. Therefore, as global warming prog-
resses, an increasing incidence and prevalence of mental illness is to be expected. Vulnerable groups, such as the (already) 
mentally ill, children, and adolescents, need to be protected. At the same time, there is a need for further systematic research on 
the mechanisms of action and effects of climate change on mental function.

Although it may not be possible to establish a clear 
causal relationship, climate change has nevertheless 
led to an increase in frequency and intensity of natural 
disasters and extreme weather events. These are 
 having a most obvious impact on human health and 
are used in the scientific literature to operationalize 
climate change (2, 4). This overall situation is also as-
sociated with long-term changes to living conditions 
which can have a stressful impact on mental well-
being (3).
In this narrative review, we summarize current 
 global evidence of the direct and indirect effects of 
climate change on mental health, underlining 
 available information about those particularly vulner-
able groups such as children and adolescents.

Methods 
Using the literature databases PubMed and PsycINFO, 
a systematic search was conducted for the direct 
 effects (natural disasters, i.e., floods, storms, fires; 
 extreme weather conditions, i.e., heat and drought) 
and indirect effects (climate-related migration, food 
insecurity) of climate change on mental health 
(ICD-10/DSM-5  diagnostic codes; mental distress; 
psychiatric hospital admissions). It was concluded on 
November 16, 2021. 
Additional literature recommendations were for-
mulated by a panel of experts from the German As-
sociation for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Psycho-
somatics and Neurology (DGPPN) on the subject of 
climate change and mental health (eMethods). The 
search included studies involving all human popu-
lations, worldwide. After removing any duplicates, a 
total of 1017 articles published between 2000 and 
2021 were screened, leaving 128 articles for final 
 inclusion (eFigure). A detailed description of the 
methodology used can be found in the eMethods.
Results 
In the following, we will first present the evidence 
covering the direct effects on mental health of acute 
and chronic exposure to climate change, followed by 
their indirect effects. The Figure provides a schematic 
representation of the association between the effects of 
climate change and mental health. The results of the 
most important studies mentioned are presented in de-
tail in eTables 1–3, while Tables 1 and 2 contain brief 
accounts. Preference is given to reports of systematic 
reviews and results of meta-analyses. 
Direct effects: Acute exposure
Floods
Climate change has led to an increase in flood events, 
which in turn are particularly associated with an in-
creased prevalence of anxiety disorders, post-traumatic 
stress disorders (PTSD) as well as symptoms of 
 depression (5–9). 
A meta-analysis of the consequences of flooding in 
the United Kingdom showed that, six to 12 months 
after the extreme weather event of flooding, the point 
prevalence for PTSD was significantly increased in 
those affected in comparison with the lifetime preva-
lence in the general population (30.36% versus 7.4%) 
(5). Even three years after a flood disaster, the health-
related quality of life of those directly affected by 
flooding is severely restricted in comparison with un-
affected persons with regard to anxiety/depression 
(odds ratio [OR] = 4.30; 95% confidence interval 
[2,48; 7,72]) (10). The main predictors of developing 
a mental health condition after a flood disaster are so-
cioeconomic vulnerability, long-term displacement 
(7), persistent material damage (9), and insurance-
 related problems (8) (eTable 1). The buffer effect of 
social support after a flood disaster is reduced by the 
severity of the impact of the floods (11). Vulnerable 
personal living conditions result in a greater risk of 
developing symptoms of depression (12). However, 
tourists who had been exposed to flooding and then 
returned to an unaffected home country also demon-
strated long-term symptoms of PTSD, depending of 
the severity of their exposure (13, 14). Children and 
adolescents are particularly vulnerable (15). It is as-
sumed that they have at their disposal fewer coping

strategies after traumatic flood disasters and experi-
ence less self-efficacy (16). In particular, children 
prone to rumination have an increased risk of devel-
oping symptoms of depression after experiencing a 
flood (17).
Storms
Storms and tornadoes cause damage and destruction 
and, consequently, mental stress to patients with pre-
existing mental disorders. They can also create new 
psychiatric disorders in previously healthy individuals 
(in particular anxiety-mood disorders, PTSD) (18–21). 
After hurricane Katrina in 2006 in New Orleans 
(USA), the 30-day prevalence of anxiety-mood dis-
orders, including PTSD, rose to 49.1% in those di-
rectly affected (19). Hurricane-related post-traumatic 
stress symptoms are still measurable up to 12 years 
after the event (Table 1, eTable 1) (20, 22).
The likelihood of posttraumatic symptoms and de-
pression increases with the severity of exposure, even 
more so in the case of physical injury, death or serious 
injury to household members, low income, and storm-
related property damage (22). Other risk factors for 
depression and post-traumatic symptoms include loss 
of social support and socioeconomic decline (23–26). 
The expansion of deserts worldwide has resulted in 
more frequent adverse health effects from dust 
storms, the consequences of which are similar to 
those of fine particulate air pollution (27).
Even prenatal exposure to hurricanes can result in 
increased anxiety and elevated cortisol levels (111.11 
versus 76.49 pg/mg, p <0.001) in early childhood 
(28). Adolescents and young adults with family dys-
function and other traumatic experiences are particu-
larly vulnerable (25, 29). Between 20.3% and 49.4% 
of health-care first responders after a hurricane reach, 
or even exceed, the clinical cut-off score for PTSD 
(30, 31). The mentally ill are also particularly at risk 
from destroyed supply chains and infrastructure: Fol-
lowing hurricane Katrina in the USA, the successful 
treatment completion rate among discharged patients 
with a comorbid mental disorder declined signifi-
cantly from 36.8% to 18.7% (32). 
Fires
A recent review shows high prevalences of PTSD 
(15.6–60%), depression, and generalized anxiety in 
adults between the post-acute phase (three months) and 
up to years after a wildfire or bushfire (33) (Table 1, 
 eTable 1). The principle risk factor is the fire trauma 
itself, i.e., a high level of exposure to a fire has a 
stronger effect on mental health than a low level of 
 exposure (34).
An increased rate of mental disorders (PTSD 
 during the subacute phase after a wildfire: 92 %, de-
pression after 18 months: 33.3 %, anxiety disorder 
after 18 months: 27 %) was also found after wildfires 
and bushfires in the child population of the mentioned 
review (33). An Australian longitudinal study showed 
that experiencing bushfires in childhood can be most 
stressful. In adulthood, 20 years later, the prevalence 
of lifetime anxiety disorder is greater than in an unaf-
fected control group (21.5% versus 16%, relative risk 
[RR] = 1.37 [1.05; 1.78), p <0.05). Lifetime and point 
prevalence rates after 20 years for depression and eat-
ing disorders were not significantly increased as a re-
sult of experiencing a fire in childhood (35). If other 
traumatic experiences are added to the fire event 
 during further life, however, there is an increased 
prevalence of lifetime PTSD for children (7.8% ver-
sus 5.8%, RR = 1.80 [1.11; 2.93], p <0.05), but not 
without this cumulative effect (35).
The negative income development in areas after a 
fire disaster can lead to increased violence, especially 
against women, resulting in negative effects on their 
mental health several years after the fire disaster (36). 
A systematic review of the consequences for the 
health of firefighters confronted with wildland fires 
came to the result that 10 to 20% of responders re-
ported post-traumatic stress symptoms (37). Other 
vulnerable groups are elderly people with dementia, 
inhabitants of rural communities, and indigenous 
populations (38).
Direct effects: Chronic exposure
Heat
Heat is associated with increased morbidity, a surge in 
psychiatric emergencies, and a significantly increased 
risk of dying from mental disorders: Thus, the morbid-
ity of mood disorders, organic mental disorders, schizo-
phrenia, and neurotic and anxiety disorders increases 
with high outdoor temperatures and during heatwaves 
(39, 40). For example, the risk for mental morbidity 
during heatwaves was increased by 6.4% (39) (Table 2, 
eTable 2).
Heat is associated with increasing numbers of psy-
chiatric emergencies and (emergency) admissions to 
psychiatric hospitals (e1, e2). There is a notable posi-
tive association between heat and hospital admis-
sions, especially for psychoses (39) and dementia 
(e3). The availability of outpatient healthcare services 
and of green open spaces, on the other hand, appears 
to be a protective factor (e4).
Mental disorders are also among the most import-
ant risk factors for heat-related deaths, tripling 
(OR = 3.61) the risk of dying during a heatwave (39, 
e5, e6). In extreme heat, the use of alcohol, medi-
cations, and illegal drugs is associated with an in-
creased risk of mortality. A systematic review also 
shows in 15 of 17 studies a positive association be-
tween higher temperatures and the incidence of sui-
cides (RR = 1.04–1.37) (eTable 2) (e7). In the week 
after moderate and extreme heat, there is an approxi-
mately twofold increased (cumulative) risk of mortal-
ity from suicide (RR = 1.8 and 2.16, respectively) 
(e8). Until the beginning of a national suicide preven-
tion program in Finland, temperature variations ex-
plained more than 60% of suicide variance (e9). For 
several decades in North America, suicide rates were 
associated with the average monthly temperature, in-

creasing by 0.7% (USA) and 2.1% (Mexico) for a 
1° C temperature increase (e10). 
There are comparatively few studies available on 
children and adolescents. However, a deterioration of 
mental health and increase in emergency department 
contacts for mental disorders with rising temperatures 
was also demonstrated for this young group 
(e11–e14).
Drought
People who are, or were, affected by drought have a 
26% higher likelihood (OR = 1.26; p <0.01) of mental 
problems than those not affected (13.3% versus 10.8%) 
(e15). The direct and indirect, and especially economi-
cal, effects of drought promote the development of 
 depression and anxiety disorders as well as increased 
alcohol and substance use (e16). Drought is also associ-
ated with increased suicide rates. Australian long-term 
data revealed that, with increased values of the drought 
index, there was a 15% increased risk of suicide for 
rural middle-aged men (e17). 
As a result of malnutrition and loss of livelihood, 
as well as due to economic factors (e16), droughts 
have the effect of potentially chronic psychological 
stress factors (e19), especially for those working in 
agriculture (e18). In addition, there is a potential for 
increased family tension, emotional stress, and 
 domestic or intimate-partner violence (e16, e20, e21).
Indirect effects
Apart from the direct effects of environmental pollution 
and natural disasters or extreme weather events, 
 climate change is also associated with indirect and sys-
temically mediated health effects (e22).
Food insecurity
Not only can drought be the cause of food shortage and 
the destruction of, or alteration to, agricultural areas 
(e16), but the nutritional content and quality of cereal 
crops may also decrease, resulting in the development 
of deficiency symptoms (e23). 
Poor nutrition can impair cognition and also cause 
mental symptoms, such as fatigue, lethargy, depres -
sion, manias, and psychoses (e23, e24). Food insecur-
ity in British families, for example, was associated 
with maternal depression, psychotic disorders, 
 domestic violence, and behavioral problems in 
children (e25), see eTable 3 for details.
Malnutrition in children can impair (neuronal) 
 development, resulting in an increased risk of mental 
illnesses such as depression and attention deficit hy-
peractivity disorder (e23). Other vulnerable groups 
include women and the elderly in whom a particularly 
strong dose-dependent relationship is evident be-
tween food insecurity and distress (e26, e27) as well 
as mental disorders (e28, e29).  
Climate-related migration 
Economic and institutional crises can also arise from 
climate change. The destabilization of states, groups, 
and regions induced by climate change can lead to 
 violent conflicts and wars, acting as a driver of environ-
mentally induced migration (e30).
The forced, permanent displacement of people in-
creases the probability of their developing anxiety 
and affective disorders (e31–e34). Negative experi-
ences and difficulties in the adjustment process after 
migration also lower self-esteem, promote depressive 
symptoms, and increase the risk of suicide (e35). 
Refugees also have a higher risk of developing 
 psychotic disorders than non-refugee migrants (e36).
Children and adolescents in particular suffer from 
migration-related stressors. In a systematic review, 
Kien and colleagues (2019) report of point prev -
alences of between 19% and 52.7% for PTSD, 10.3 to 
32.8% for depression, 8.7 to 31.6 % for anxiety dis-
orders, and 19.8 to 35% for emotional and behavioral 
problems (e37) (eTable 3).
Flight and migration are considerable psychologi-
cal stressors (e22, e30, e38). Apart from those stress 
factors which initially forced people to migrate, their 
experience of migration itself can be characterized by 
numerous material and psychological losses. Stress, 
separation and loneliness, loss of identity, no sense of 
belonging, lack of social values and networks with no 
support and socioeconomic resources are significant 
risk factors for mental health (e16, e30, e31, e39). 
Children can be separated from their parents during 
flight (e40) and are particularly at risk of experiencing 
violence during (e41, e42), as well as after, flight (e43).
An uncertain residence status, with its associated 
restricted rights, and difficulties with integration are 
additional stress factors during migration to a foreign 
country (e44, e45). At the same time, there are also 
barriers to accessing psychiatric health care (e45, e46).
Environmental migration often involves moving 
from rural to urban areas, thus often depriving those 
affected of an environment with green spaces as a 
protective factor and putting a strain on mental health 
with additional city-specific risk factors, such as air 
pollution and noise (e31, e47). Added to this, there is often 
deterioration in living and working conditions (e48).
Discussion
These results indicate that, with progressive global 
warming, a greater mental health burden on the general 
population and an increased need for care for mental 
disorders are to be expected. Heat makes many mental 
disorders worse, with subsequent increases in morbid-
ity and mortality. Natural disasters raise the prevalence 
of, above all, PTSD, depression and anxiety disorders 
of those affected. 
The effects of climate change on health are un-
equally distributed (e49–e52). Increased geographical 
exposure, the underlying health status, and limited 
adaptive and coping capacities can increase the vul-
nerability of individuals or populations. Mentally ill 
people as well as children and adolescents belong to 
those groups of people who are particularly 
 vulnerable to the effects of climate change (e50).

Climate change-related disasters can destroy infra-
structures of the health care system and, at the same 
time, raise demands on health care (e55). Germany 
too is affected by an increasing number of natural dis-
asters and weather extremes; a progressive disease 
burden of mental health is to be expected as a result of 
climate change (e53, e54). 
There is further need for research on the newly 
 developed syndromes brought on by climate change, 
including “solastalgia” (emotional reaction to the 
 destruction of the environment) and “climate anxiety” 
(expectation of future involvement) (e56, e57).
Adaptations of the care systems to the anticipated 
increased psychiatric and psychotherapeutic needs 
and to the expanded spectrum of diagnoses resulting 
from climate change appear to be an urgent necessity.  
Limitations
It should be added by way of caveat that studies look-
ing at the mental health effects of climate change can-
not be randomized and only minimally controlled. As a 
result, their level of evidence is usually low to moder-
ate. Furthermore, the quantitative summary of evidence 
is difficult in that operationalizing climate change ef-
fects has so far been very heterogeneous and often indi-
rect. There is a need for studies with comparable 
methodology and coverage of mental disorders 
 (according to DSM-5/ICD-10) as well as specific 
mechanisms of action.
Conclusions
These available studies demonstrate that the conse-
quences of climate change are stress factors for mental 
health. Therefore, as global warming progresses, an in-
creasing incidence and prevalence of mental illnesses 
are to be expected. The slowing down of climate 
change by reducing CO2 emissions and measures to 
also counteract the long-term effects of climate change 
(for example, green areas in towns, heat protection in 
hospitals) are urgently needed. Health resilience pro-
grams at individual and societal levels are needed to at 
least attempt to address the impending stresses on hu-
manity’s mental health from climate change (e55).

Methods
The systematic literature review was completed on 16 November 2021.
Topics currently under discussion in the scientific literature dealing 
with the association between climate change and mental health were 
identified and defined using a deductive approach.
The effects of heat, drought, floods, storms, fires, and air pollution 
were grouped together under direct effects. 
Indirect effects included long-term impacts and consequences of the 
destruction of habitats and ecosystems, in particular with respect to 
 climate change-related migration, food shortage, climate justice, and vul-
nerable groups.
Inclusion criteria
The inclusion criteria were as follows:
●Article in German or English
●Published from 2000 (to November 2021)
●Human populations with no age restriction
Direct effects
●Heat, floods, storms, fires, drought, air pollution
●Psychiatric diagnosis (ICD-10/DSM-5 diagnoses, including mental 
distress) or psychiatry-relevant indicators (for example, psychiatric 
emergency admission, specific symptoms as an indicator for deterio-
ration of mental health) as dependent variables
●Original studies, quantitative data
●Also: systematic reviews or reviews containing a systematic literature 
search
Indirect effects
●Not necessarily psychiatric diagnoses (but also psychological impacts)
●Including qualitative data, but not exclusively original studies
●Relevance for the association between climate change and mental 
health and/or psychiatric care
●Search strategy
 eBox 1 shows the search concepts for the systematic review in the 
Pubmed literature database. The review produced n = 239 hits for direct 
effects and n = 76 hits for indirect effects (as of 16.11.2021) (eBox 1).
eBox2 shows the search terms used for the systematic review in the lit-
erature database PsycINFO. The review produced n = 356 hits for direct 
effects and n = 392 for indirect effects (as of 16.11.2021) (eBox 2).
Over and above the systematic literature search, literature suggestions 
were also taken into account as formulated by participants of an expert 
committee of the DGPPN on the subject of climate and mental health. A 
total of 113 additional articles were subjected to the inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria.
Data extraction
The following information was extracted from the full text review and used 
for the inclusion and exclusion decision:
●Authors and year of publication
●Region
●Study design
●Sample
●Independent variable/exposure
●Dependent variable

Narrative synthesis and evaluation
The present review was developed by applying a predefined concept of 
keywords and search strategy, and a precise examination of titles, abstracts 
and, where relevant, the full text of articles. It is not, however, claimed to 
be a full systematic review. A full systematic report of the results was made 
difficult by the large number of very diverse operationalized surveys. How-
ever, good systematic review articles and meta-analyses have already been 
published on some topics, such as overheating. The synthesis of the find-
ings is therefore based, where possible, on systematic reviews as well as on 
a selection of relevant publications and outcomes. A selection is presented 
in more detail in the eTables 1–3 and assessed using the four-level GRADE 
evaluation system.
It should also be noted that the topics of climate injustice and increase 
in air pollution, which are less a consequence than a corollary of climate 
change and were initially intended to be addressed as a separate supple-
ment in this review, could not be included in the narrative synthesis due 
to the large amount of evidence and for reasons of space.
DGPPN panel of experts
The DGPPN set up a task force covering the subject of “Climate Change 
and Mental Health”, with their first meeting taking place in September 
2021. Five more meetings were held in the following 12 months. Under the 
direction of two members of the DGPPN board of directors, appropriate 
experts from psychiatric research and clinical practice were invited to par-
ticipate.
The 16 members of the task force are:
Prof. Dr. Dr. Andreas Heinz, Prof. Dr. Andreas Meyer-Lindenberg, Prof. 
Dr. Mazda Adli, Dr. Barbara Bornheimer, Dr. Lasse Brandt, Prof. Dr. Dr. 
René Hurlemann, Dr. Sebastian Karl, PD Dr. Hans Knoblauch, Dr. Nina 
Marsh, Prof. Dr. Christoph Nikendei, Sandy Pistol, Prof. Dr. Steffi Riedel-
Heller, Anna-Karina Schomburg, Dr. Kirsten Shukla, Dr. Dr. Stefan Wein-
mann, Franziska Welzel.
