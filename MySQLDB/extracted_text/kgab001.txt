Rationale and remit of Oxford Open Climate Change
With the raging novel coronavirus pandemic, it is all too easy to
lose sight of the other wave of potential global catastrophe that
is building up. Even the dramatic imagery of extreme bushfires
in 2019 and 2020 seems nearly forgotten because of the super-
imposed health crisis. In the case of Australia, this memory
fade is aided by the remarkable swing to La Ni~na conditions and
a flip in the Indian Ocean Dipole, which together brought abun-
dant rains that broke the previous drought of several years and
actually caused major regional flooding events (but note that La
Ni~na intensifies drought and thus intensifies the fire conditions
along the US West Coast). Climate change all but slipped off the
active agendas of international politics, underscoring important
lessons in the nature of global crises, crisis communication and
governance [1].
Yet, climate change has not conveniently stopped to allow
us to deal with the pandemic. In fact, 2020 tied with 2016 for
the warmest year on record in terms of global mean tempera-
ture [2, 3]. However, while 2016 temperatures were especially
high because of an El Ni~no event, this was not the case for 2020.
This makes the warmth of 2020 even more remarkable.
The increasing temperatures coincide with an increase in
climate extremes, emphasizing the importance of anticipating
and adapting to compound and complex risks [4]. The climate
extremes include deep droughts that facilitated the rapid
spread of violent bushfires in 2019–20 [5]. For example, 19 mil-
lion hectares were burnt in Australia [6], along with 20 million
hectares in Siberia in the first half of 2020 alone [7], and 5.6
million hectares along the US West Coast [8]. Other major areas
were burnt in Canada, China, the Amazon rainforest and
Indonesia. The immediate causes vary from lightning strikes to
human carelessness and intentional actions, but the underlying
issue facilitating widespread growth of the fires beyond control
has been exceptional regional drought, often associated with
exceptional high-temperature anomalies. In the Amazon rain-
forest, droughts together with increasing human-made defores-
tation (commonly with fire) and land-use could bring the
Amazon region closer to its tipping point—abruptly turning into
savanna and consequently into an additional CO2 source [9, 10].
The trend toward intensified climate extremes also includes
dramatic changes in hurricane, typhoon and tropical cyclone
activity and intensity. These changes tend to be region-specific
and are modulated by superimposed natural multiyear cycles
such as the El Ni~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian
Ocean Dipole. For example, 2020 saw extraordinarily high activ-
ity of Atlantic hurricanes and tropical storms [11], about average
Indian tropical cyclone activity, and a remarkably quiet Pacific
hurricane (typhoon) season [12]. With shifts in ENSO and the
Indian Ocean Dipole, these activity patterns are expected to
change between regions, but the overall trend seems to be to-
ward fewer, but more intense, storms [13]. Such storms, as well
as extra-tropical cyclones, drive massive rainfalls, storm surges,
flooding, wind damage and widespread coastal erosion.
Another important expression of the increasing climate
extremes trend concerns the global increase in heatwaves [14]
and marine heatwaves [15]. This increase causes expanding
heat stress and heat death conditions that affect sustainability
of the human habitation niche [16, 17] and that have critical
impacts on marine ecosystems [15, 18].
Increasing warming leads to shifting climate zones and
associated animal and vegetation migrations [19], including
expansions in the spread of pests and disease vectors (e.g. ma-
laria). Links have also been suggested between the worsening of
locust plagues and both warming and increases in rainfall
extremes in East Africa [20], posing an additional threat to food
security. This region’s widespread rainfall anomalies are wet
expressions of the multiyear Indian Ocean Dipole cycle, which
coincide with pronounced droughts over Australia that inten-
sify fire conditions. The Indian Ocean Dipole cycle is thought to
gain intensity with the ongoing global warming [21].
Rising temperatures are also likely to reduce cereal yields
[22] and change the nutritional quality of the grain that is pro-
duced [23]. Variations in the availability of food due to wide-
spread changes in climate-related growing conditions are likely
to reduce yield gains and increase food costs, affecting the af-
fordability of food for the world’s poor [24]. Furthermore, tem-
perature extremes have direct physical effects on the well-being
of infants [25] and on the productivity of rural populations with
little access to technology [26]. These impacts are likely to fur-
ther degrade food security of the world’s poorest [27].
Concurrent extremes—superimposed upon long-term trends
and now further exacerbated by the global pandemic—have
made starkly visible the persistent social inequities in access to

resources, infrastructure and information that underpin social
vulnerability and reinforce climate injustices [28]. These social
aspects not only exacerbate the uneven impacts of climate
extremes, but also causally connect patterns in outcomes of dis-
parate extreme events. Consequently, they demand innovation
in governance [29] and explicit attention to equity in climate ad-
aptation and governance [30, 31].
Profound impacts of climate change on land ice and sea ice
drive long-term consequences such as sea-level rise and imme-
diate issues such as fundamental impacts on high-latitude eco-
systems, respectively [32]. There are also less well understood
but potentially very dangerous feedbacks related to processes
such as permafrost decomposition and associated CO2 and
methane releases [33, 34]. This ties in with the growing concern
that we are moving perilously close to major climate/environ-
mental tipping points, such as collapse of permafrost, rainforest
and/or major portions of the world’s great ice sheets. Because
crossing a tipping point causes long-term irreversible change (for
a concise discussion, see Moore [35]), not even the most aggres-
sive climate mitigation would succeed in bringing climate back
to anything like present-day conditions. Instead, there would be
variations around a new stable state that has considerably less
ice volume, severely reduced permafrost and enhanced methane
and CO2 levels caused by the permafrost reduction.
Transitions between different stable climate states have not
yet happened during historical times but are known from the
geological
past
under
natural
climate
forcing.
Therefore,
deeper-time (paleoclimate) assessments are essential for devel-
oping a better understanding and future prediction capacity re-
garding the stability and sensitivity of different climate states
and either slow or abrupt (tipping-point) transitions between
them. Moreover, most paleoclimate abrupt transitions involve
several climate subsystems, and thus hold important clues
about interconnecting processes between them, which cannot
be investigated using the instrumental record alone. For exam-
ple, during the glacial Dansgaard–Oeschger events, an interplay
between land ice, sea ice, ocean circulation and possibly the car-
bon cycle led to a global imprint of abrupt warming events
(within decades) that were initialized in the North Atlantic re-
gion [36, 37].
Climate change–related impacts on natural ecosystems are
of grave concern because these impacts are superimposed
upon other major stressors. These other stressors include
over-exploitation and other detrimental methods in food pro-
duction
and
low-cost
manufacturing,
excessive
land-
clearance for agriculture and infrastructure, and damage and
pollution associated with mining for resources, such as water,
minerals, metals, fuels and building materials. The accumu-
lated stresses on natural ecosystems not only threaten biodi-
versity, but also influence the resilience of humanity’s diverse
livelihoods to the impacts of climate change because the eco-
systems offer many critical ecosystem services (direct and in-
direct contributions to human well-being, including climate
regulation, water purification, pest and disease control and
cultural aspects).
There are further emerging concerns about climate change–
related impacts on how goods and services are produced and
consumed, and how such activities are financed. As climate
change can present risks and opportunities for companies and
those financing or investing in them, banks have begun to as-
sess physical climate risks in their corporate loan portfolios, us-
ing climate scenarios and methodologies for evaluating key
credit risk metrics [38]. Moreover, strengthening policy response
to limit the global mean temperature well below 2C above pre-
industrial levels, including carbon dioxide removal approaches,
presents new types of risks and opportunities associated with
transitioning to a low-carbon economy. Risks of crossing tipping
points in the climate system, and their impacts on economic
developments, are another poorly explored area that requires
urgent research [39].
In sum, humanity is facing a future in which a broad under-
standing across all relevant disciplines is needed for climate
change processes, impacts, mitigation strategies including neg-
ative emissions approaches, adaptation needs and socioeco-
nomic implications. This understanding must integrate across a
complex, interwoven suite of aspects that includes physics, bi-
ology, bio- and geo-chemistry, natural background variability,
change monitoring, social dimensions, behavioral responses,
governance and legal matters, business and economics, plan-
ning and implementation issues, and matters of diversity, eq-
uity and equality.
Oxford Open Climate Change aims to provide a platform to
high-quality contributions across all these topics and facets of
the problem to facilitate the multidisciplinary dialogue and un-
derstanding that will be needed for a successful international
response to climate change across all levels of society.
