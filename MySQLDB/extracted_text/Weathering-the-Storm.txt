6  WEATHERING THE STORM
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In recent years, the financial and social costs of natural 
catastrophes in Canada have escalated beyond histor-
ical levels. Residential flooding has been a key driver 
behind this trend, which has led to upward pressure on 
residential insurance premiums, mental health stress for 
homeowners impacted by flooding, potential increases 
in residential mortgage defaults, and lawsuits directed to 
builders and municipalities that fail in their fiduciary duty 
to anticipate and mitigate flood risk. 
Fortunately, a range of practical solutions can be 
deployed to reduce and limit risk of flooding across a 
variety of circumstances. These include proactive mainte-
nance of flood control structures, re-grading of lots and 
roadways, constructing new or upgrading stormwater 
storage facilities, and many other measures (Table 1). 
Public engagement and education programs on flood 
prevention and maintenance activities can also drive the 
uptake of flood-resilience initiatives in existing commu-
nities, particularly for “lower cost” solutions that depend 
on homeowner participation and support.
To effectively prioritize these different approaches 
to mitigating flood risk, a flood hazard and vulnerabil-
ity screening framework can help identify areas in  
existing residential communities that require the most 
immediate attention. Drawing on extensive engage-
ment with key stakeholders across Canada, this report  
outlines such a framework, consisting of the following  
key considerations:
•  Age of development: in the absence of major  
retrofits, older areas in Canada (e.g., pre-1970’s) 
are typically more flood-prone, compared to  
newly-built subdivisions;
•  History of flooding: in absence of major retrofits,  
where municipal records (e.g., flood reports) indicate 
that repeated floods have occurred, these areas may 
be the most flood-prone;
•  Design standards: areas where community design 
standards were less stringent (e.g., permitting develop-
ment in the floodplain) are typically at a higher risk  
of flooding;
•  Proximity to the floodplain: areas located closer to  
the floodplain are typically at a higher risk of flooding; 
•  Topography: lower-lying areas are typically at a 
higher risk of flooding;
•  Land use changes and intensification rates: 
areas where significant urbanization and growth 
 has occurred, and where natural capacity to absorb 
rain water has diminished (e.g., as a result of losing 
permeable areas to development), are at a higher risk 
of flooding; 
•  Sewer system types: areas with combined sewer sys-
tems (CSS) (e.g., systems that carry sanitary and storm 
water in one pipe), or partially-separated sewers, com-
pared to fully separated systems, are typically more 
flood prone; and
•  Presence of critical infrastructure, essential services 
and social vulnerabilities: each of these criteria would 
prompt more urgent response to the identified 
flood-hazard areas.
Application of the framework will enable communities 
to make better-informed decisions when prioritizing 
areas for flood-resiliency programming. The purpose 
of the report is to serve as a seed document for a future 
National Standard of Canada, to be developed based  
on this framework.
Guidance in this report has been well-vetted, as it 
draws heavily on the insights of municipal planners, 
engineers, consultants, conservation authorities, devel-
opers,homebuilders, insurance industry representatives 
and stakeholders across Canada.
The report was supported financially and technically 
by the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) and the 
National Research Council (NRC), in response to 
commitments made by Canada as a signatory to 
the Paris Agreement1, the United Nations’ Sendai 
Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR)2, and 
in support of the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean 
Growth and Climate Change. Consistent with the 
intent of these international and national commit-
ments, this report serves to help Canadians weather 
not only the storms of today, but to also ensure a more 
flood-resilient and climate-ready tomorrow.

Table 1: Examples of Flood Risk Reduction Approaches, by Types of Flooding (Residential Communities, Canada) 
Types of Flooding
Examples of Flood Risk Reduction Approaches
Riverine flooding (also known as fluvial flooding)
Occurs when water levels in watercourses rise and spill 
over their banks. Riverine flooding can be caused by 
extreme rainfall, snowmelt, ice build-up and debris jams.
• Proactive maintenance of culverts, bridges and other 
flood control structures;
• Proactive vegetation management along water-
courses, including debris removal; and
• Flood-proofing properties adjacent to watercourses 
(e.g., through installing floodwalls and berms, re-grad-
ing lots and encouraging homeowners to elevate 
electrical equipment above potential flood levels).
Overland flooding (also known as pluvial flooding)
Occurs when excess stormwater flows over private prop-
erties, entering homes through lowest building openings 
(e.g., basement windows and doors) causing damage.
• Proactive clearing of catch basins and culverts to allow 
overland water to drain;
• Removal of snow from critical overland flow paths prior 
to spring thaw to prevent overland flow obstructions;
• Re-grading of lots and roadways to carry overland 
water away from properties, onto the right of ways; 
and
• Introducing additional storage facilities (e.g., through 
stormwater ponds, underground tanks, etc.) to store 
rainwater and reduce overland flow.
Storm and/or sanitary sewer back-up*
Occurs when the storm and/or sanitary sewer systems 
are overloaded, causing surcharge and back-up into 
basements.
• Installing backwater valves (i.e., backflow preven-
tion devices) on storm and/or sanitary sewer laterals 
to prevent surcharging sewer water from entering 
basements;
• Disconnecting roof leaders from sanitary sewers;
• Sealing and bolting manhole covers in low lying areas, 
where water accumulates and has a higher risk of con-
tributing to sewer surcharge; and
• Implementing stormwater diversion projects (e.g., 
through installing pipes that carry excess stormwater 
from overwhelmed areas to areas with more capacity).
Foundation system failures*
Occurs when foundation drainage systems fail and water 
enters basements though foundation drains / seeps 
through the foundation walls.
• Installing sump pumps and sump pump back-up  
systems; and
• Installing impermeable layer of soil around homes  
(i.e. foundation backfill areas) to reduce the risk  
of water infiltration and seepage through  
foundation walls
*Please refer to CSA Group’s Guideline on Basement Flood Protection and Risk Reduction (CSA- Z800-18) 
for a comprehensive list of best practices to address storm and sanitary sewer back-up, and foundation  
system failure risks. 
8  WEATHERING THE STORM
Climate change and extreme weather events are on 
the rise in Canada, bringing ever-increasing costs to 
governments, businesses, and ultimately all Canadians.3 
In the past decade, flooding has emerged as the most 
pervasive and costly natural disaster in the country,  
causing financial and mental distress to Canadians  
across many regions. To limit the impacts of flooding, 
all levels of government (federal, provincial, territorial, 
municipal and Indigenous governments) are making  
new infrastructure investments and implementing flood 
risk reduction strategies. 
This report outlines approaches that can be deployed 
by municipalities, utilities and local agencies (e.g., 
watershed managers such as conservation authorities 
in Ontario) to reduce flood risk for existing residential 
communities in Canada.i 
The report is organized as follows:
• Chapter 1 examines the need for climate adaptation, 
particularly flood risk reduction, at the level of existing 
residential communities in Canada;
• Chapter 2 outlines common challenges pertaining to 
riverine flooding, overland flooding, storm and sanitary 
sewer back-up, and foundation system failures that can 
lead to basement flooding;
• Chapter 3 proposes a high-level screening framework 
for selecting areas within communities where flood risk 
reduction work should be prioritized; 
• Chapter 4 outlines some approaches that can be 
deployed by municipalities, utilities and local agencies 
to reduce flood risk in Canada; and
• Chapter 5 provides concluding remarks and next steps.
The report also includes a summary of key updates made 
to the National Building Code since 1941 that impact the 
flood-resilience of residential buildings (Appendix A), 
as well as seven case studies of physical interventions 
that have been implemented in residential communities 
across Canada (Appendix B).
1.1 Escalating Costs of Natural Disasters and 
Flooding in Canada
Climate-related natural catastrophes and associated 
economic losses are expected to continue increasing 
in coming years. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) projects continued global warming and 
increased global frequency of heavy precipitation events 
in the 21st century,4 with Canada to warm faster than the 
global average and experience more frequent and severe 
weather.5 Similarly, Environment and Climate Change 
Canada (ECCC) predicts growth in the frequency and 
severity of extreme weather events in Canada.6 For exam-
ple, a recent study by the Fraser Basin Council states that 
if there was a major flood event (1-in-500 year) in British 
Columbia’s Lower Mainland between now and 2100, 
it would trigger economic losses estimated between 
$20 to 30 billion, which would be the largest disaster in 
Canadian history.7
The projected trends in climate related catastrophes are 
already manifesting themselves and present a significant 
economic concern. According to Public Safety Canada, 
the number of natural disasters for which provinces and 
territories required and obtained federal assistance 
under the Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements 
(DFAA), increased dramatically between 1970 and 2015. 
Similarly, the Office of the Auditor General of Canada 
noted that from 2009 to 2015,8 DFAA’s compensation 
to provinces and territories was greater than all of  
the previous 39 fiscal years combined (see Figure 1).9  
The DFAA’s spending on flooding was estimated at 75% 
of all weather-related expenditures.10
CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION – THE NEED FOR CLIMATE 
ADAPTATION IN CANADA
i For insights into approaches for building new residential communities in Canada that are more flood-resilient, please refer to the Intact Centre 
report, Preventing Disaster before It Strikes: Developing a Canadian Standard for Flood-Resilient Residential Communities , which is being developed 
into a national standard of Canada (CSA-W1006). Guidance on actions that can be implemented at the level of individual homes to reduce flood risk is 
available through the CSA Group Guideline on basement flood protection and risk reduction (CSA- Z800-18).

The Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC) found that “property and casualty (P&C) insurance payouts from extreme 
weather have more than doubled every five to 10 years since the 1980s.”11 While P&C insurance payouts in Canada 
averaged $405 million per year over the period of 1983 to 2008, for the last nine years leading up to 2017, insurance 
payouts for catastrophic losses averaged at $1.8 billion per year. Water-related losses were a significant driver in the 
increased payouts, explaining over 50% of the increase. The insurance gap in Canada is also significant: for every 
dollar insured of losses borne by insurers in Canada, three to four dollars are borne by governments and home and 
business owners.

1.2 Repeated Flooding Stresses Canada’s 
Mortgage Holders
Approximately 1.7 million Canadian households, or 
19% of Canada’s population, are at risk of riverine and/
or overland flooding.ii For areas where flood insurance 
coverage is limited or not available, and where Canadians 
are at the highest risk of flooding, this represents a 
significant economic concern. Flood damages can cost 
homeowners tens of thousands of dollars to repair. For 
example, the average flood damage costs for impacted 
homeowners in the Greater Toronto Area is estimated 
at $43,000.iii Meanwhile, as of 2017, the Canadian 
Payroll Association reported that almost half of work-
ing Canadians live paycheque to paycheque, with 47% 
indicating difficulty to meet financial obligations if their 
paycheques were delayed by a week.12 Consequently, 
there is an emerging risk facing Canada’s mortgage 
market, where flood-related mortgage arrears may 
become more frequent following flood events, as saving 
rates remain low and more households are subject to 
repeated flooding. Furthermore, flood-prone areas may 
become stigmatized, which further drives down property 
values in these areas, potentially below the outstanding 
mortgage balance.
1.3 Climate Risk and Flooding Impact Credit 
Ratings
Global credit rating agencies, including DBRS, Moody’s 
and Standard & Poor’s are beginning to examine climate 
change risks and potential impacts on ratings of trad-
able assets, including municipal bonds.13 The Carbon 
Disclosure Project (CDP) predicts that tax base, debt 
levels and management quality are the three main areas, 
which credit rating analysis for municipal bonds will start 
to incorporate to determine how well municipalities are 
addressing climate risks.14 In November 2017 Moody’s 
Investors Service, (the bond credit rating dimension of 
Moody’s Corporation), outlined four key credit risks asso-
ciated with climate change that Moody’s credit rating 
analysts look at when examining local and state 
government risks:
1. Economic disruption (e.g., property loss/damage; 
lower revenues; business interruption; increased debt; 
and higher insurance costs);
2. Physical damage (e.g., property loss/damage; loss of 
utilities, transportation and communication networks);
3. Health and public safety (e.g., loss of life, mental dis-
tress, jeopardized critical emergency service provi-
sions); and
4. Population displacement (e.g., short-term displace-
ments and longer-term population migration).15
Notably, flood risks comprise a significant focus for cli-
mate risk assessment metrics for Moody’s, where points 
two, three, four and five below relate to flood risk:
1. GDP Coastal Counties/Total State GDP, 2016;
2. Tropical Cyclone Damage (1980–2017)/State GDP, 2016;
3. Coastal Dwelling Units in 100/500 Year Floodplains/
Total Coastal Dwelling Units;
4. Damage from Non-Tropical Cyclone Weather Events 
(1980-2017)/State GDP, 2016;
5. Non-Coastal Dwelling Units in 100/500 Year 
Floodplains/Total Non-Coastal Dwelling Units; and
6. Agricultural, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting/Total State 
GDP, 2016.16
In Canada, where flooding is the most common extreme 
weather risk facing municipalities, the focus of credit 
rating analysis for municipal bonds will undoubtedly 
reflect the initiatives deployed by local governments  
to improve their flood-resiliency. Measures to mitigate 
physical exposure to climate risks will weigh heavily in 
credit ratings.17
1.4 Flooding Gives Rise to Lawsuits
Flood-related lawsuits involving homeowners,  
developers, local governments, watershed managers  
(i.e. conservation authorities), Indigenous communities, 
provinces, and private businesses, are on the rise in 
Canada. Table 2 provides some examples of these law-
suits, demonstrating the need for flood-resilience at all  
levels of government, as well as business and society 
to limit legal risks.

ruled that the sewers were designed to withstand a “5-year storm” as provin-
cial guidelines required, and the town was not obliged to do more. However, 
the court noted that current design standards might not protect municipalities 
in future lawsuits, in light of “recent climate phenomena” and other scientific

1.5 Flooding Impacts the Mental Health of 
Canadians
Mental health impacts, associated with flooding, can 
include general mental distress, anxiety, post-traumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD), and depression. Mental distress 
is defined as “sufficient intensity to disrupt a person’s 
normal life patterns.”19
In Canada, several studies have found that Canadians 
have experienced mental distress because of flooding 
both in the immediate term and over the long term:
• A 2017 study of 200 households in Montreal that expe-
rienced flooding found that “almost 70% of respon-
dents reported having suffered from anxiety, sleep 
disturbances or concentration problems since the 
floods;”20 
• A 2004 study of 176 households in Manitoba found that 
over a third experienced psychological distress follow-
ing a major flood event;21 
• A 2016 study of men and women affected by the 2013 
Alberta floods found a 164% increase in anti-anxiety 
medication and a 232% increase in sleeping aids for 
women in High River, one of the worst-hit areas;22 and
• A 2000 study of Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean residents 
following 1996 floods found that 12% had to take sick 
leave or were absent from work, and 6% took an early 
retirement.23 
Findings from an Intact Centre study of 100 households 
in flood-affected neighbourhoods in Southern Ontario 
(2018) confirm this finding of mental distress. Notably, 
three years after living through a flood, nearly 50% of 
households are “significantly worried” about flooding 
when it rains. Furthermore, homeowners who experi-
enced basement flooding had to take, on average,  
seven days off work following the flood event.24

CHAPTER 2: CHARACTERIZATION OF COMMON FLOOD RISK 
CHALLENGES IN CANADA
This section outlines common flood risk challenges in Canada as related to riverine flooding, overland flooding,  
storm and sanitary sewer back-up and foundation drainage system failures. The challenges range from information 
limitations to guide adequate planning and land use management decisions, to physical conditions such as aging 
infrastructure and lack of infrastructure maintenance. 
One crosscutting challenge is that stormwater infrastructure (Table 3) is designed to accommodate certain  
prescribed runoff levels associated with rainfall events (i.e. design storms), which are determined based on histori-
cal rainfall records. However, if precipitation patterns change over time (e.g., due to climate change), the historical 
designs based on probabilistic models that worked in the past, may not be adequate in the future. For example, as 
the global concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases, the average air temperature is expected  
to increase as well, causing the hydrologic cycle to become more active. Increasing air temperature accelerates  
evaporation rates, which in turn feeds storm systems and may cause more frequent and severe rainfall events.25 
Table 3: Stormwater Infrastructure (Examples)
Urban Stormwater Management
River Flood Management
• roadside ditches;
• stormwater pipes/drains and sewer pipes;
• manholes;
• inlets and catch basins;
• inlet control devices;
• culverts and culvert grates; 
• control gates;
• outfalls;
• overland flow routes; and
• stormwater management flood control systems  
(e.g., ponds and storage chambers). 
• watercourses (e.g., rivers, creeks, streams, channels);
• bank protection (e.g., lining, revetment);
• hydraulic structures (e.g., bridges and culverts)
• flood control structures and barriers (e.g., dikes,  
walls, diversions); and
• flood control systems (e.g., dams, reservoirs).
In the following subsections, the challenges pertaining to riverine flooding, overland flooding, storm and sanitary 
sewer back-up, as well as foundation drainage system failures are described separately. However, it is important  
to acknowledge that flooding mechanisms are interrelated and often interdependent. During extreme events this 
interrelated nature of flood causes can lead to compounding flood risks and thereby result in greater flood damages.
Moreover, inter-jurisdictional watershed management practices can also influence flood risk and can lead to  
issues where land use changes in upstream jurisdictions can increase flood risks in the downstream jurisdictions.  
For example, in Manitoba, the communities of Brandon, Winnipeg and The Pas have all experienced elevated flood 
risks due to certain agricultural land use practices across upstream areas of Saskatchewan, Alberta and the USA. 
Therefore, coordinating inter-jurisdictional plans and watershed-based studies is important to mitigate potential 
increases in flood risk for downstream jurisdictions. Notably, this requires large-scale watershed-based analyses.  
An example of such inter-jurisdictional coordination is the Red River Basin Commission26, which oversees the  
management and flood risk reduction activities for Red River (which flows through South and North Dakota, 
Minnesota and Southern Manitoba).
14  WEATHERING THE STORM
2.1 Riverine Flooding
For the purposes of this document, riverine floodingiv  
is defined as excess stream flow in a watercourse, such 
that land outside of the normal river banks is submerged 
or inundated. Riverine flooding can be caused or exacer-
bated by extreme rainfall, snowmelt, physical conditions 
(e.g., ice, sediment and debris jams, watercourse  
configuration changes and capacity limitations).
Common Challenges:
1. Lack of up-to-date floodplain maps, which take  
into account changes in climate, land use and  
development, as well as naturally-occurring changes  
in watercourses and floodplain conditions that were 
not anticipated in the original community design.
2. Legacy floodplain encroachment, where existing  
development is located in, or in close proximity to,  
the floodplain.
3. Ice, sediment and debris jams.
4. Inadequate design standards for flood protection 
infrastructure (e.g., dikes and floodwalls) to withstand 
extreme weather events. 
5. Financial and technical challenges to retrofit existing 
flood protection infrastructure to meet contemporary 
design standards.
6. Deteriorated and/or aging riverine flood protection 
infrastructure (e.g. flood walls and reservoirs).
7. Undersized watercourse crossings (e.g., bridges,  
culverts and piped conveyance systems) including 
those that are prone to debris build-up, ice jams, 
scouring and deposition.
8. Long-term reliance on temporary riverine flood-protec-
tion measures, which were not intended or designed  
as permanent measures to address riverine flood risk.
2.2 Overland Flooding
For the purposes of this document, overland flooding 
is defined as flooding that occurs when urban runoff 
exceeds the combined hydraulic capacity of the area’s 
storm sewers, ditches and catch basins, causing excess 
water to flow on the streets and then onto, between, 
and across residential properties. Overland flooding can 
happen anywhere in the community.
In cold weather climates, the compounded impacts of 
“rain on snow” events, frozen ground, obstructed over-
land flow paths (e.g., roads and ditches filled with ice and 
snow), as well as frozen culverts, catch basin inlets and 
leads - can all further exacerbate overland flooding.
Common Challenges:
1. Physical limitations in overland drainage due to poor 
grading and legacy development practices (e.g., pre 
1980’s, when the streets and rights-of-way were not 
explicitly designed to convey excess runoff by way of 
gravity away from private properties).
2. Low-lying areas tend to be at a higher risk of overland 
flooding due to runoff accumulation in these areas.
3. Increased imperviousness over time, which contributes 
to increased volumes and rates of stormwater runoff 
not accounted for in the original design of stormwater 
infrastructure.v 
4. Culvert grates, inlets and catch basins not designed to 
contemporary standards (e.g., older stormwater inlet 
systems are often prone to blockage and thus convey 
less runoff than designed, leading to more runoff flow-
ing overland).
5. Culvert grates, inlets and catch basins not regularly 
maintained and cleaned.
6. Reverse slope driveways and lot grading practices, 
whereby the overland stormwater runoff can flow 
towards homes, as opposed to away from homes, 
along the roadways.
7. Obstruction of overland drainage routes due to lack of 
maintenance or land alterations.
8. Obstruction of storm sewers due to poor maintenance.
9. Sedimentation and infilling of roadside ditches; 
blocked driveway culverts. 
iv Riverine water levels fluctuate naturally. Flooding, causing property damage typically occurs during events exceeding 5-year events,  
which commonly overtop watercourse banks.
v Increased imperviousness can occur both on private and public land through infill development, intensification, construction of new roads  
and parking lots, driveway widening and house expansions.

WEATHERING THE STORM 15
vi Storm sewers can also back-up to surface through catch basins, manholes, culvert inlets and ditch inlets, contributing to overland flooding.
2.3 Storm and Sanitary Sewer Back-Up Flooding
For the purposes of this document, four distinct sewer 
systems types are considered:
• Storm sewer back-up occurs when storm sewers are 
blocked or overloaded by stormwater runoff, causing 
surcharge and back-up into homes through storm 
sewer laterals connected to the foundation drain 
system. As well, high water levels in storm sewers can 
prevent adequate foundation drainage, leading to 
basement flooding through foundation wall infiltration 
and seepage.vi 
• Sanitary sewer back-up occurs when sanitary sewers 
are blocked or overloaded through inflow and infil-
tration, preventing sanitary effluent to be properly 
conveyed away from home to the sanitary sewer.
• Combined sewer back-up occurs when combined 
sewer systems (whereby storm and sanitary are  
conveyed in a common pipe) are blocked or over-
loaded by stormwater runoff, preventing sanitary  
effluent to be properly conveyed away from home  
to the combined sewer, or reverse flow from the  
sewer main to the home.
• Sewer systems can be also partially separated,  
whereby a stand-alone storm sewer system was  
built to collect surface runoff and provide relief  
for combined sewer systems.
Notably, the development of basements into living 
spaces, especially in older homes, increases sewer 
back-up damages and associated costs.
Common Challenges:
1. Storm sewer design capacity limitations in older  
neighborhoods (e.g., storm sewer systems designed  
for low intensity events, without consideration of  
dual drainage).
2. Infiltration of groundwater into sanitary sewers  
through aging or defective pipes, pipe joints, 
and leaky manholes.
3. Inflow into sanitary sewers from foundation  
drains, downspouts, roof leaders, manhole lids,  
and cross-connections (e.g., from catch basins and 
storm laterals).
4. Low-lying areas have a higher risk of sewer surcharge 
due to standing water that accumulates above man-
holes after a flood event, increasing risk of inflow into 
the sewer.
5. Sediment and other build-up in sanitary sewer  
pipes (e.g., silt, sand, debris, fat, oil, grease, sanitary 
products and other detritus) that reduces sewer  
capacity overtime.
6. Deteriorated structural condition of storm and sanitary 
sewer pipes (e.g., sags forming in pipes can cause sed-
iment build-up and reduce sewer capacity; partial pipe 
collapses that can increase inflow into sewers and lead 
to sink holes).
7. High water levels in receiving waterbodies (e.g., rivers, 
creeks and lakes) can reduce the ability of storm and 
combined sewer systems to drain effectively.
8. Failures of wastewater treatment plants and pumping 
stations (e.g., during extreme rain events) that can 
cause both storm and sanitary sewer back-up.

16  WEATHERING THE STORM
2.4 Foundation Drainage System Failures
There are three basic foundation drainage approachesvii:
1. Sump Pump System: a mechanical system, which  
has a sump pit to collect foundation drainage from  
the home’s weeping tiles. Once the sump pit fills to  
a prescribed level, the water is pumped by a small 
pump to the surface, where it is typically discharged 
directly to the surface flowing away from the home.  
In locations where the lawn space is constrained,  
the water can be discharged into a shallow lateral pipe 
and then into a storm sewer, ditch or a catch basin. 
Historically, sump pump systems were installed in  
areas with limited depth to drain foundation by gravity 
to a storm sewer. Since the mid-1990’s sump pump  
systems have become more common in Canada as 
their reliability has improved.
2. Gravity Drain Systems - Connected to a Storm Sewer: 
systems where foundation water is collected around 
basement footings by weeping tiles and then conveyed 
through a lateral to the storm sewer, flowing by gravity. 
For this to be a viable drainage approach, the storm 
sewer needs to be deeper than the basement (usually 
2.4 meters below the road centerline) and typically  
the hydraulic grade line for a prescribed event  
(e.g., a 1-in-100 year storm) is also below the  
basement foundation level.
3. Gravity Drain Systems - Connected to a Foundation 
Drain Collector: in some areas, where storm sewers 
are shallow and sump pumps have not been used to 
provide foundation drainage, foundation drainage is 
conveyed similar to Approach #2, however rather than 
discharging to the storm sewer, it is conveyed through 
a lateral to a dedicated foundation drain collector 
(FDC) system. This pipe eventually discharges to a 
waterbody or deep storm sewer typically located a 
significant distance downstream.
Common Challenges:
1. Where a direct gravity connection exists between the 
storm sewer and basement foundation drain (Approach 
#2), surcharged storm sewers can lead to basement 
flooding through water back-up and associated foun-
dation wall seepage.
2. Poor backfilling practices (e.g., where soil was not 
properly compacted) can cause surface water to 
infiltrate more quickly - and in large amounts - to the 
weeping tiles overwhelming them and causing base-
ment flooding.
3. Older homes (e.g., 80 years+) often lack appropriate 
foundation drainage systems like weeping tiles, or 
sump pump systems, or these systems have deterio-
rated beyond their reasonable life, causing foundation 
drainage water to accumulate around the basement 
footing and walls, seeping into the basement.
4. Lack of, or inadequate back-up power for, sump  
pump systems, which may cause flooding during  
power supply disruptions.
5. Homes located within areas with high groundwater 
levels can be exposed to a greater flood risk, as the 
system’s capacity is consumed by both groundwater 
and other foundation drain sources (e.g., rain and 
snowmelt).
6. Homes built in areas where more permeable soil is 
underlain by an aquitard (solid, impermeable area 
underlying or overlying an aquifer) are especially 
susceptible to foundation seepage problems, as the 
upper soils allow the water to move downward quickly, 
while the lower aquitard layer prevents this water from 
draining.
7. Unintended increase in groundwater elevations due to 
reduced usage of groundwater resources for industrial 
or municipal purposes, or due to infrastructure renewal 
(e.g., as old clay and concrete sewer pipes with leaking 
joints are replaced with new sealed pipes, the ability 
for pipes to informally accept groundwater is reduced, 
increasing groundwater levels and putting properties 
at risk of groundwater seepage).
vii Modern-day home foundation drainage systems collect and convey water, which gathers around basement footings from both surface water and 
groundwater sources. Historically, other systems were used, for example where homes had gravity drain systems connected to the sanitary or com-
bined sewer system and where weeping tiles around foundation walls were directed to the sanitary sewer laterals. This was a major source of inflow/
infiltration and contributor to sewer back-up risk.

CHAPTER 3: FRAMEWORK FOR PRIORITIZING FLOOD-RESILIENCY  
WORK IN EXISTING RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITIES, CANADA
This chapter proposes a high-level screening frame-
work for selecting areas within residential communities 
where flood risk reduction work should be prioritized. 
Contributions from Hiran Sandanayake, Senior Engineer, 
Water Resources, City of Ottawa and Robert Muir, 
Manager, Stormwater, Asset Management Department, 
City of Markham are acknowledged, whose inputs 
informed the early development of this frameworkviii.
Table 4 illustrates a conceptual evolution of flood risk 
assessment, of which the proposed high-level screening  
framework is the first, “foundational” step (denoted in 
grey). Information requirements to execute the frame-
work are detailed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, on flood hazard 
and flood vulnerability requirements respectively. 
As communities in Canada elect to study flood  
risk in more detail, information requirements grow  
in concert with the intended level of understanding  
of flood risk (e.g., “intermediate” and “advanced”  
assessment steps in Table 4). For insights relating to  
more advanced methods of flood risk assessment,  
several frameworks can be leveraged (e.g., Engineers 
Canada’ PIEVC Engineering Protocol27, APEGBC’s 
Professional Practice Guidelines for Legislated Flood 
Assessments in a Changing Climate in BC28 and the  
forthcoming flood risk assessment guidelines under 
the federal Canadian Floodplain Mapping Guidelines 
Series.)29 Such assessments can be used to guide the 
selection and application of more technical solutions  
for flood risk reduction, while providing more refined 
insights of flood risk (e.g., property-level understanding 
of flood risk). Third-party flood risk assessments can also 
be used to complement municipal analyses, for example 
assessments conducted by the (re)insurance industry.

3.1 Foundational Flood Hazard Assessment 
Table 5 summarizes criteria for screening areas within communities in terms of their potential for exposure to  
flood hazards. Each criteria can be assigned a score (e.g., Low: 1, Medium: 2, High: 3). As areas within communities  
are analyzed, scores can be assigned and tallied. The higher the absolute score for a particular area, the higher its 
exposure to flood hazards. Not all criteria are considered equal in terms of influencing flood hazard exposure.  
Criteria that would typically merit greater weighting (i.e., more likely to result in flooding) are highlighted in grey.  
It is expected that users of the flood hazard assessment framework below will determine their own weightings  
relating to each of the locally-relevant criteria, as reflective of their unique flood risks and stormwater management 
objectives and priorities. The subsequent sections explain each criterion in more detail.

3.1.1 General Hazard Assessment Considerations
Age of Development
Since 1941, the National Building Code of Canada (NBC) sets technical provisions for design and construction of  
new buildings. The Provinces and Territories are responsible for establishing building codes within their jurisdictions 
and rely on the NBC for the national framework. With NBC updates taking place approximately every five years,  
it is possible to track the history of major flood-resiliency measures introduced in the code and consequently, their 
implementation across residential developments. While the extent and timing of NBC implementation varies across 
different jurisdictions in Canada, Appendix A outlines key flood-resiliency updates and timing to the code, which 
provides a starting point for flood risk screening based on the age of development. 
Moreover, some key dates in the evolution of stormwater management in Canada can be used to draw further  
insights about potential flood risk challenges associated with “certain eras” of residential development (see Box 1).
Box 1: History of Stormwater Management in Canada: Four Key Eras
The Storm Sewer Era (1880-1970)
From approximately 1880-1970, the solution to the problem of increased volumes and flows of urban stormwater 
was the provision of a sewer network which transported stormwater from upstream urbanized areas to downstream 
receiving waters - creeks, rivers, lakes and oceans. Generally sanitary effluent was also conveyed through the same 
combined network, and these flows were discharged without treatment. Design criteria included prescribing a design 
rainfall input of specified return period, usually in the range of 2-10 years (occasionally up to 25 years), and a proce-
dure (the Rational Method) for computing the peak flow resulting from this rainfall over a duration equal to the time of 
concentration. Pipes were sized to convey these peak flows. The benefits of the storm sewer solution included minimal 
local flooding except under extreme storm conditions. However, as urban areas grew significantly, the costs of large 
collector sewers and erosion control measures increased. Generally, the environmental cost of pollution in receiving 
waters was not recognized throughout most of the storm sewer era. 
The Stormwater Management Era (1970-1990)
Through the 1970s and 1980s, increased volumes and flows were treated via two additional means: a) the insertion of 
stormwater storage facilities (i.e. ponds) within, or at, the downstream end of the storm sewer network and, b) in many 
but not all jurisdictions, explicit consideration of the major overland system to convey flows, which exceed the capac-
ity of the minor system (pipes and ponds). New developments in this era generally had separated sanitary and storm 
systems. Design criteria included the prescription of a design storm input for each of the minor and major systems 
and a restriction on post-development flows - in general, these typically could not exceed pre-development flows 
under design storm conditions. Specified return periods were typically 2–10 years for the minor system and 100 years 
for the major system. Design procedures included the use of numerical urban runoff models with design storm inputs 
for computing the flow at any time and point in the system. Pipes and ponds were sized to convey and store these 
flows. Relative to the storm sewer era, stormwater management solutions minimized local and downstream flooding, 
reduced the cost of sewers in many cases and provided waterfront property around the stormwater ponds.  
However, long-term costs, including those for pond maintenance and erosion control downstream of the ponds, 
remained. Although pollution of receiving waters was generally recognized in this era, the cost was not explicitly  
considered in the design process.
22  WEATHERING THE STORM
The Urban Stormwater Best Management Practices Era (1990-2000)
Since the 1990’s, concern over the residual problems associated with stormwater management, and deteriorating 
water quality including erosion, have led some jurisdictions into the urban stormwater best management practices 
(BMP) era. Early Canadian examples included the Cities of Edmonton, Winnipeg, Hamilton, Toronto, Ottawa and 
Montréal, and the Greater Vancouver Regional District (Marsalek 1999). This era is distinguished from the stormwater 
management period in that the problem was expanded to include the quality, as well as the quantity of stormwater. 
The solution is extended to include a wide range of urban stormwater BMPs such as extended detention ponds, 
infiltration basins and trenches, porous pavement, sand filters, water quality inlets and use of vegetation. Additional 
benefits of the BMP solution (over the stormwater management solution) include reduced erosion and improved  
water quality in receiving waters; however, these are offset somewhat by additional maintenance costs.
New Paradigms (2000-present)
The current era of stormwater management in Canada reflects the increasing sophistication of drainage management 
over time. It emphasizes the importance of flood control in the context of holistic watershed management and inte-
grated urban water management. Drainage systems designs for this era often place emphasis on sustainability criteria 
and protection of ecological systems (e.g., through pollution reduction and erosion control). Some jurisdictions in 
Canada (e.g., the Province of British Columbia) have set out runoff volume control targets, prescribing methods for 
runoff retention and detention, as well as implemented hierarchical approaches to stormwater management, starting 
with source control at a lot level, followed by stormwater conveyance (e.g., via roads and public spaces), followed by 
end-of-pipe treatment prior to discharge.

History of Flooding
Municipal records indicating repeated flood complaints are helpful in identifying areas where flooding is a chronic 
problem. These records may also help characterize specific flood issues (e.g., the specific mechanism of flooding, 
extent, frequency, associated impacts). 
Flood Forecasting and Warning Systems
Forecasting and warning of flood events is complex and traditionally relates to the domain of watershed managers. 
The key determinant in gauging the effectiveness of flood forecasting and warning systems relates to the amount 
of advance warning time. Where notices are provided sufficiently in advance to allow for orderly evacuations and/
or timely implementation of flood defences, the flood forecasting and warning systems are deemed to operate well. 
In urban settings, it is more challenging to provide a meaningful notice of flood events (e.g., as compared to larger 
watersheds, with slower response times). 
WEATHERING THE STORM 23
3.1.2 Riverine Flooding - Hazard Assessment Considerations
Regulatory Event Standard and Floodplain Mapping
Provinces and territories across Canada have historically applied different floodplain management regulations,  
typically prohibiting new residential development in the active portion of the floodplain (often referred to as the 
floodway) and restricting development in the flood fringe (the area outside of the floodway with slower and shallower 
flowing water). In some cases (often referred to as Two-Zone or Special Policy Areas), residential properties are subject 
to implementation of appropriate flood protection measures, if they are within the floodplain. Table 6 provides flood-
way and flood fringe definitions currently used in different parts of Canada. In general, the higher the return period 
used for regulatory flood definition, the lower the risk of riverine flooding.
The relative age, accuracy and extent of floodplain maps also plays a role in riverine flood risk (as discussed  
in Chapter 2). The first large-scale floodplain mapping effort in Canada took place in 1980s, under Canada’s  
Flood Damage Reduction Program (FDRP). In some areas in Canada, subsequent updates to floodplain maps  
(post FDRP) have been limited. That said, there are still some urban areas, which were constructed long before  
formal flood plain mapping were developed, hence these existing residential communities can be at a higher risk  
of flooding.

WEATHERING THE STORM 25
Proximity to the Floodplain
Residential developments that are in close proximity 
to, or partially or fully within, the Regulatory flood-
plain, or within spill zones from riverine systems, may 
be at higher risk of direct and indirect flooding during 
extreme weather events. However, it is also important 
to recognize that permanent and non-permanent flood 
protection defenses, such as diversions, dikes and dams, 
can mitigate the risk of riverine flooding. Therefore, as 
indicated in Table 5, where a jurisdiction considers flood 
protection defenses permanent (because they have been 
engineered to withstand extreme weather events and 
are properly maintained), then the riverine flood risk and 
associated regulation may be deemed reduced by that 
jurisdiction.
3.1.3 Overland Flooding - Hazard Assessment 
Considerations
Topography
Low-lying areas, particularly those prone to overland flow 
from comparatively large drainage areas, are at risk of 
surface flooding due to the tendency for these areas to 
accumulate runoff and pond, particularly in the absence 
of adequate outlets. There can also be a correlation to 
increased basement flooding through inflow to the sani-
tary system in low-lying areas.
These low-lying areas can cover many city blocks and 
may not be immediately evident until a major storm event 
has occurred. By way of example, reviews of historical 
basement flooding records in Edmonton, Alberta have 
shown a higher correlation of basement flooding occur-
ring in these locations, which in some cases are the areas 
where old creek beds, lakes or slews used to be prior to 
subdivision development. High-level topographic map-
ping can provide an initial indicator of these locations for 
flood risk evaluations.
Land Use Intensification/Imperviousness
Due to changing planning policies across Canada, 
which have the objective of reducing urban sprawl, 
increasing development efficiencies, and reducing 
infrastructure-servicing costs, many municipalities are 
increasing population densities within their urban limits. 
This approach, over time, leads to greater hard surface 
cover (e.g., buildings, parking lots and amenity areas). In 
addition, there is also a trend towards upsizing homes 
whereby, on larger lots, small homes are demolished 
and much larger homes, with impermeable landscaping, 
are built (or multi-family homes are introduced in place, 
where single-family homes used to be). This practice can 
contribute to higher volumes and rates of surface water 
runoff. Moreover, communities developed within, or in 
close proximity to, floodplains are often more desirable 
neighborhoods, where intensification occurs at a faster 
rate, exacerbating neighbourhood exposure to riverine 
flood risk.
3.1.4 Storm and Sanitary Sewer Back-Up Flooding - 
Hazard Assessment Considerations
Sewer System Type
As noted earlier, there are generally three types of  
sewer systems: combined (single pipe carrying day-to-
day sanitary effluent and storm flows), separated (inde-
pendent systems to convey sanitary and storm flows) 
and partially separated systems (combined systems in 
transition to separation). Typically, due to the operating 
nature of combined sewer systems, they have the highest 
risk of sanitary sewer back-up, since they surcharge 
quickly due to storm runoff capture. However, partially 
separated sewers or combined sewer systems, where 
combined sewer overflow is restricted and does not 
provide sufficient relief, can also present a high flood risk 
(e.g., in the City of St. Catharines, City of Montreal and 
City of Ottawa).
As sewer systems undergo retrofits, such as sewer sep-
aration projects for combined sewer areas, typically the 
public side becomes fully separated, but the private side 
may or may not be (e.g. downspouts, weeping tiles and 
private catch basins may completely or partially remain 
connected to the combined sewer); this can complicate 
flood investigations.

26  WEATHERING THE STORM
Minor (Storm Sewer) and Major (Overland) System Design Standards/ Level of Service (LOS) Assumptions 
Design standards of storm and sanitary infrastructure can be used to gauge risk. For example, a storm sewer 
designed to a 2-year standard would have approximately a 50% chance of surcharging in any given year, whereas  
a storm sewer designed to a 10-year return period, would have a 10% chance of surcharging in any given year.  
The same would apply to overland flow systems (major system), whereby in some eras of development there was  
no acknowledgement of this part of the drainage system (“dual drainage” systems were not considered, hence  
overland flow was not designed to safely drain by gravity to a suitable outlet). Post 1980’s, many jurisdictions adopted 
the dual drainage (major-minor) approach, and set standards for overland flow conveyance. Many municipalities use 
the 100-year standard (event that would on average have a 1% chance of occurrence in any given year) to design major 
overland systems. However, it is important to acknowledge that the risk that a 100-year flood happening at least once 
during a 25-year period is not 1% but 22% (and 40% for a 50-year period). The relationship between return period and 
the mean probability of occurrence per year is illustrated below (Table 7).

Wastewater Pumping Station Design and Location 
Wastewater pumping stations, if located within a riverine flood plain, or defined overland flow routes, can be at 
greater risk of failure due to flooding, power outages during extreme events and other operational issues. While most 
systems have built-in safety features (e.g., including relief overflows), even these can be prone to failure or reduced 
effectiveness during extreme weather events, exacerbating flood risk. Some pumping stations may be located in rela-
tively remote areas, which can result in longer response times during emergency situations.

WEATHERING THE STORM 27
3.1.5 Foundation Drain System Failures -  
Hazard Assessment Considerations
Sump Pump System
Sump pumps are mechanical devices which rely on power 
and working conditions to operate. In the absence of 
power, the systems fail and water begins to accumulate 
around foundation walls, increasing the risk of basement 
flooding. Similarly, if the pumps are not well-maintained 
or fail due to overuse, they can also result in basement 
flooding. Having a secondary (back-up) sump pump pro-
vides additional relief should the primary sump pump fail. 
Where sump pump discharge is to the surface, it must 
be directed away from the house to a location where it 
does not immediately return to the foundation. This can 
be an issue on small, poorly graded properties, or where 
discharge pipes are disconnected, blocked or frozen.
Gravity Drain Systems - Connected to the  
Storm Sewer
Where storm sewers are sufficiently deep (i.e., 2.4 m 
below roadway centerline), basement foundation drain-
age can be conveyed by gravity to the sewers directly. 
However, during large storms these sewers can sur-
charge, which will prevent basement water from being 
released into the sewer; or lead to a reverse flow from the 
storm sewer to the home. Under the most extreme con-
ditions, sewer water flow can back-up into the basement 
through the foundation drainage system.
Gravity Drain Systems - Connected to the 
Foundation Drain Collector
Where storm sewers are too shallow and not serviced  
by sump pumps, a third pipe, referred to as a Foundation 
Drain Collector (FDC) can be used. In areas where the 
soils are highly permeable and the groundwater levels 
low, the chances of having external water enter the FDC 
is low; that said where groundwater levels are high and 
the FDC trench is founded on an aquitard, the chances  
of build-up of water around the FDC increases and so 
does the risk of basement water infiltration.
Areas with perennially or seasonally high ground  
water may also be susceptible to higher flood risk  
(e.g., storm and sanitary sewers can be influenced by 
inflow and infiltration due to high groundwater reducing 
available capacity, as well, foundation drains around 
homes can become overwhelmed during periods of  
high groundwater).

2. Social agencies: The next most important priorities 
for protection were agencies that protect population 
from risks to human life and that provide services and 
housing to vulnerable populations.
3. Recreation centers, shopping malls, transit stations, 
schools, universities/colleges.
4. Financial and environmental services: Financial and 
environmental impacts were ranked as less important. 
Impacts that were reversible, temporary or insurable 
are deemed to have lower relative importance.33
3.2.2 Vulnerable Populations
The Government of Canada acknowledges that the envi-
ronment can affect health, and that some populations in 
Canada are more vulnerable to environmental risks as a 
result of physical differences, behaviours, location and/or 
control over their environment.34 The Red Cross identifies 
the following ten populations in Canada as vulnerable 
(high-risk):
1. Seniors;
2. Persons with disability;
3. Indigenous residents;
4. Medically dependent persons;
5. Low-income residents;
6. Children and youth;
7. Persons with low literacy levels;
8. Women;
9. Transient populations; and
10. New immigrants and cultural minorities.35
The presence of select institutions, such as daycares, 
schools and nursing homes, where vulnerable popula-
tions may be concentrated, also needs to be factored 
into flood vulnerability analyses. Notably, some munici-
palities in Canada have created well-being indices,  
identifying locations with high concentrations of 
vulnerable populations, which can be helpful for  
flood vulnerability assessments.36 
3.2 High-Level Flood Vulnerability Assessment
For areas that are deemed to be at an equal specified 
risk of flooding (using Table 5), the presence or absence 
of critical infrastructure, essential services and greater 
concentrations of vulnerable populations, can be used 
for further prioritization of flood risk reduction work.  
For the foundational flood risk assessment, in addition  
to the number of residential properties at risk of flooding, 
a measure of critical infrastructure assets at risk of flood-
ing and the density of vulnerable/high risk populations at 
risk of flooding can be considered for priority setting. 
3.2.1 Critical Infrastructure and Essential Services
According to Public Safety Canada, critical infrastructure 
refers to “processes, systems, facilities, technologies, 
networks, assets and services essential to the health, 
safety, security or economic well-being of Canadians and 
the effective functioning of government.”30 Loss of critical 
infrastructure assets, or disruption to essential services, 
may have significant and adverse economic, social and 
environmental impacts within a community. Accordingly, 
the process of flood risk assessments and prioritization, 
needs to incorporate an analysis of critical infrastructure 
assets and essential services from the standpoint of 
consequence of loss31. Examples of critical infrastructure 
assets include: water, stormwater and wastewater treat-
ment plants, pumping stations, utilities, transportation, 
and health care facilities. At the municipal level, essential 
services can typically include: 
• Fire and police protection;
• Health care provision;
• Emergency response facilities and routes;
• Water treatment and distribution;
• Wastewater treatment and collection;
• Stormwater management and flood protection;
• Garbage and recycling collection;
• Public transportation;
• Maintenance of roads and sidewalks and streetlights.
Public opinion surveys can be used to prioritize critical 
infrastructure assets to protect from flooding. For exam-
ple, EPCOR conducted a public opinion survey in 201832, 
which identified areas of higher priority to protect from 
flooding as per input from City of Edmonton residents,  
as follows:
1. Essential services: The highest priorities for flood pro-
tection were hospitals and urgent care facilities, as well 
as essential services such as fire, police, emergency 
response and essential utilities.

3.3 Application of the Framework for Prioritizing Flood-Resiliency Work in Existing Residential 
Communities: Case Study from Credit Valley Conservation, Ontario
Presented below is a case study from Credit Valley Conservation (CVC), demonstrating the utility of the framework 
described above. The case study was prepared by Christine Zimmer Senior Manager, Water and Climate Change 
Science, CVC, Amna Tariq, Engineer, Water and Climate Change Sciences, CVC, and Kamal Paudel, Senior Specialist, 
Data Management and Business Intelligence, CVC.
Stormwater management has evolved rapidly over the last 40 years, as reflected in the varied levels of service within 
most municipalities in Canada. Updating infrastructure to ensure appropriate levels of service comes at a significant 
financial cost. Municipalities need to identify high-priority areas and select the best measures to reduce these risks. 
To assist in a more holistic understanding of flood risks, Credit Valley Conservation (CVC) and partner municipalities 
initiated a flood risk mapping exercise in the Credit Valley watershed in Ontario. 
The first step was applying the screening method from the Intact Centre’s 2018 Flood Hazard High-Level Screening 
Framework. As the level of geographic information system (GIS) information varied across the watershed, only the 
following layers from the framework were used, where available:
• Age of development within each dissemination area (a standard geographical unit used by Statistics Canada);
• History of flooding (flood complaints and location of reported flood damage);
• Proximity to the floodplain (including flood vulnerable structures); and
• Reported insurable losses.
The first step highlighted the threats to stormwater management infrastructure.
The second step was to consider the impacts to services and populations that are less resilient to flooding (shelters, 
schools, hospitals, and senior care facilities). To account for these social vulnerabilities, the following layers were 
added to the infrastructure vulnerability mapping: 
• Vulnerable populations within each dissemination area (including children, seniors, and low-income renters);
• Medical centres/facilities;
• Utilities (including telecommunications);
• Emergency service infrastructure (including fire, police and medical services) and;
• Community facilities used for as emergency centres (including evacuation centres, community centres and schools).
The two steps of flood hazard and social vulnerability screening provided a sense of the potential flood prone areas 
for prioritizing flood mitigation measures. 
A broader suite of considerations were also used to support watershed and stormwater master planning in the  
region (including drinking water supply, water quality, soil erosion, water balance, and overall public well-being).  
To reflect these considerations, CVC built on the Intact Centre’s approach and included additional information to  
conduct further assessments: 
• Locations of stormwater ponds/flood storage facilities;
• Locations with current and projected water quality issues;
• Locations with identified opportunities to implement green infrastructure solutions; and 
• Groundwater table information.
After completing various steps of the assessment, CVC found that certain layers influence the outcomes of the  
assessment in unique ways, and need to be weighted accordingly. CVC is now performing sensitivity analyses  
across the watershed, taking into account the different needs of each municipality. Weighting criteria will be ranked 
according to the specific risks facing each community. For example, maintaining baseflow and groundwater quality 
may be critical to groundwater-dependent municipalities, while established lake-based municipalities may prioritize 
flood risk reduction, erosion and water quality control. Municipal partners have been engaged across a range of 
departments, including health, planning, emergency and water management. 
Mapping will be used to identify areas where further research is needed to understand flood vulnerabilities and  
select the best management practices to reduce them.

ranted in this space. Similarly, stakeholders suggested there is a need for more in-depth research relating to opera-
tions and maintenance (O&M) activities for stormwater and river management infrastructure. 
WEATHERING THE STORM 31
4.1 Flood Risk Reduction Guidance
Below is a list of approaches that relate to flood risk 
reduction guidance that communities across Canada 
may wish to adopt going forward to increase their 
flood-resiliency:
1. Develop and regularly update flood risk assessments, 
which address all flood hazards to provide direction  
for infrastructure renewal, community redevelopment 
and intensification. 
2. Regularly review design storms and Intensity, Duration 
and Frequency (IDF) curves to ensure they are repre-
sentative of the current climate.
3. Ensure that official plans, municipal guidelines and reg-
ulations stipulate that new development, intensification 
and re-development plans reduce, or at least do not 
increase, the risk of flooding for existing communities. 
4. Ensure that official plans, zoning by-laws and regula-
tions restrict alterations to properties located in high 
flood risk areas that could increase flood damages 
(e.g., in high flood risk areas, prohibit construction  
of new walkout basements, use of basements as living 
spaces and increases in impermeable landscaping).
5. Ensure that regulations restrict residential develop-
ments that encroach on floodplains (for example, 
through infill, intensification and re-development), 
subject to some exemptionsix.
6. Ensure that municipal guidelines require locally-based 
source controls to counter the impacts of local infill/
intensification causing increases in imperviousness  
in communities over time.
7. Ensure that municipal guidelines require downspout 
disconnection for all homes from combined and sani-
tary sewers. 
8. Where necessary, define and protect overland flow 
paths through easements or ownership.
9. Develop and regularly update protocols for collecting 
accurate flood report data from residents to inform 
future flood risk investigations and remedial works  
(e.g. 311 calls).
10. Ensure that procedures are in place that clearly 
outline responsibilities for flood risk management 
and stormwater infrastructure operations and mainte-
nance for key stakeholders (homeowners, conserva-
tion authorities, municipalities, etc.).
11.Secure adequate resources for stormwater manage-
ment services, including inspections and maintenance 
programs. To this end, consider the implementation 
of dedicated stormwater rates, structured to incent 
private-side flood risk reduction actions.
12. Ensure that flood forecasting and warning protocols 
are in place, which include standard messaging and 
communication protocols. 
13. For frequently flooded areas, maintain a stock of  
emergency flood-protection supplies (e.g., temporary 
flood barriers and sandbags). Ensure that local  
community and emergency responders are trained  
on their deployment.
ix In some communities, there are designated “special policy areas”, whereby development that encroaches within the floodplain can still proceed, 
subject to flood proofing/protection measures. These measures may include raising building openings, electrical and mechanical systems above the 
regulatory flood level, installation of backflow valves, and the use of flood damage resistant materials in basements.

4.2 Operations and Maintenance Programs
Riverine Flooding
1. Regularly (e.g., every 5 to 10 years) inspect and  
maintain watercourse corridors through strategic  
vegetation management and debris removal.
2. Regularly (e.g., annually) inspect and maintain  
culverts, bridges and other flood control structures 
(e.g., dykes and dams).
3. Proactively drain water in designated flood storage 
systems (e.g., reservoirs, ponds, cisterns, etc.) prior  
to major forecasted flood events.
4. Where ice jams are common, proactively monitor  
and manage riverine ice.
Overland Flooding
1. Inspect and maintain critical overland flow paths  
prior to major forecasted flood events.
2. Remove snow in critical overland flow paths prior  
to spring thaw.
3. Proactively clear and thaw critical catch basins and cul-
verts prior to spring thaw and major forecasted flood 
events. 
4. Proactively clear fallen leaves from catch basins,  
culverts and inlets in the fall.
Storm and Sanitary Sewer Back-Up
1. Regularly (e.g., annually) inspect and maintain catch 
basins, outfalls and inlets.
2. Regularly (e.g., every 5 to 10 years) inspect and  
maintain storm and sanitary sewers. For problematic 
areas, develop a frequent cleaning list of storm and 
sanitary sewers.
3. Where cost-effective (e.g., at the time of neighbour-
hood re-development), implement roof leader and 
foundation drain disconnection programs.
4. Identify and remediate areas of significant inflow and 
infiltration into the sanitary sewers (e.g. through sewer 
flow monitoring, dye testing, smoke testing, CCTV 
inspections, etc.). 
4.3 Public Engagement
1. Educate residents on private-side flood prevention 
measures and maintenance activities (e.g., using 
insights from CSA- Z800-18 basement flood protection 
and risk reduction guideline). 
2. Provide information packages and electronic reminders 
to residents as related to flood prevention measures 
and maintenance activities on their property.
3. Engage with home inspectors, realtors, insurance and 
mortgage brokers to partake in public education pro-
grams on flood risk reduction.
4. Implement public art projects to raise awareness of 
flood risk (e.g., use art to indicate high water levels  
for riverine and overland flooding).
5. Encourage realtors to disclose past history of floods for 
properties, as well as current flood risk scores  
(e.g., as determined through home flood risk assess-
ments performed by trained home inspectors).
6. Market any available subsidies so that residents are 
better-aware of financial incentives to implement 
flood-resiliency measures on private properties.

4.4 Selected Physical Interventions to  
Reduce Flood Risk
Presented below are some physical interventions that municipalities, utilities and relevant authorities can implement 
to reduce flood risk for existing residential communities in Canada. The list of physical interventions presented herein 
is not exhaustive, and has been developed based on input from the consulted experts, who contributed to the  
development of this report. 
Prior to implementation of these interventions, flood risk assessments of varying complexities may need 
to be conducted, including modelling, environmental assessments, cost-benefit analyses, etc. Care should  
be exercised when selecting interventions for implementation, as addressing one flood risk in isolation may  
introduce or exacerbate other flood risks. As well, some best practices may only be economically viable at the  
time of re-development or infrastructure renewal. Depending on the intervention, multiple storm water management 
objectives (e.g., flood risk reduction, water quality improvement and urban heat island reduction) can be achieved 
through individual or combined application of the interventions listed below, and should be considered accordingly. 
Note the capital cost and ease of implementation rankings, which accompany each intervention listed below would 
be expected to vary depending on local conditions and issues. Further, capital cost rankings are not normalized with 
consideration of performance effectiveness. Each application should be assessed on its own merits relative to  
performance objectives.

CHAPTER 5: CONCLUSION 
AND NEXT STEPS
As communities in Canada continue to invest in disaster 
risk reduction and climate adaptation initiatives, this 
report provides a framework for prioritizing flood-resil-
ience efforts and outlines approaches to reducing flood 
risk that are deemed effective by local governments.
The intention is that a future National Standard of 
Canada will be developed to expand on the foundational 
framework outlined in this report. Such a guideline would 
ensure that flood-resiliency initiatives implemented by 
local governments are selected in a transparent and 
efficient manner. 
To complement this guideline, stakeholders noted  
that there are a number of key areas requiring  
further research.
 These include: 
• Best practice research relating to flood forecasting 
and warning systems (including determination of an 
appropriate flood monitoring system density, the pros 
and cons of using advanced radar systems for flood 
forecasting, and effective approaches for communicat-
ing with the public during flood emergencies);
• Best practice research relating to operations  
and maintenance (O&M) of stormwater and river  
management infrastructure, including research on  
routine inspections and maintenance activities,  
as well as infrastructure assessments and  
performance monitoring;
• A review of approaches that would explain how  
to model the impacts of “rain on snow” events  
and spring melt events for stormwater management  
planning; and
• A review of financing approaches for stormwater  
management and infrastructure retrofits in light  
of a changing climate.
As Canada moves forward to meet the climate  
adaptation and disaster risk reduction commitments 
under the Paris Agreement,37 the United Nations’ Sendai 
Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR)38 and the 
Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate 
Change, the development of the National Standard  
of Canada for flood-resilience in existing communities 
warrants significant attention.

36  WEATHERING THE STORM
DEFINITIONS
Backwater valve: a device that prevents storm or  
sanitary sewage in an overloaded main sewer line from 
backing up into a basement. The valve automatically 
closes, if the flow from storm or sanitary sewage reverses, 
and attempts to back-up into a basement from the  
main sewer.
Coastal Flooding: flooding associated with a defined 
shoreline along an ocean. Can occur due to a combina-
tion of high tides, storm surges, waves, rising sea levels. 
Combined Sewer: sewer that is designed to carry  
both wastewater and stormwater.
Design Flood: a flood standard associated with a peak 
flow used for planning, infrastructure design or floodplain 
management investigations. It is typically defined by its 
probability of occurrence, or estimated using a selected 
design storm. 
Design Storm: a temporal rainfall distribution used for 
the assessment and design of drainage systems, which 
incorporate statistical rainfall data (intensity, durations 
and frequencies (IDF)) for a given geographic location.
Dual Drainage: combination of minor system designed 
for more frequent storms and major system designed  
to convey runoff for infrequent storms.
Floodplain: an area adjacent to a lake, river or coast, 
which can be expected to be regularly inundated or  
covered with water. It typically includes two zones:
• Floodway: the channel of the river or stream and  
the adjacent land that must remain free from  
obstruction so that the regulatory flood can be  
safely conveyed downstream.
• Flood Fringe: the remaining portion of the floodplain, 
where flood depths, flow velocities, or wave energies 
are relatively lower and some development may be 
permitted, if adequate levels of flood protection  
are provided. 
Flood Mechanisms: the condition, which causes a  
specific type of flood (e.g., blocked culvert leading to 
overland flooding).
Flood Mitigation: a sustained action taken to reduce  
or eliminate long-term risk to people and property  
from flood hazards and their effects. Mitigation distin-
guishes actions that have a long-term impact from those 
that are more closely associated with preparedness for, 
immediate response to, and short-term recovery from 
specific events.
Flood Risk: flood risk is a combination of the likelihood  
of occurrence of a flood event and the social or economic 
consequences of that event when it occurs.
Flood Risk Map: maps that contain the flood hazard  
or inundation delineations along with additional 
socio-economic values, such as potential loss or  
property vulnerability levels. These maps serve to  
identify the social, economic and environmental conse-
quences to communities during a potential flood event. 
Floodproofing: any combination of structural or 
non-structural measures that reduce or prevent flood 
damage to the structure and/or its contents.
Flood Protection: any combination of structural and 
non-structural improvements, additions, changes, or 
adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate  
risk of flood damage to real estate or improved real  
property, water and sanitation facilities, or structures  
with their contents.
Groundwater Seepage: groundwater that enters  
through weeping tiles, sump pits, crawl spaces, cracks, 
pores or gaps in foundation walls, cracked pipes or  
other openings. 
Impervious surfaces: surfaces that resist the absorption 
of water into the ground (e.g., paved surfaces such as 
roads and parking lots, as well as buildings, driveways 
and hardscaping).
Infiltration (Sewer): extraneous water entering a sewer 
system (sanitary or storm), including building sewers  
(laterals), from the ground through defective pipes,  
pipe joints, connections or manhole walls. 
Inflow (Sewer): extraneous water directly discharged into 
a sanitary sewer system, including service connections, 
from roof leaders; cellar, yard or area drains; founda-
tion drains; drainage from springs and swampy areas; 
manhole covers; interconnections from storm sewers; 
combined sewers and catch basins; storm waters; surface 
runoff; street wash waters or drainage.
Infill: development within urban boundaries not related 
to large-scale development plans, but rather smaller 
scale development in remnant vacant parcels.
Inlet Control Device (ICD): a device typically fitted inside 
catch basins to reduce the rate of flow into storm sewers. 
Intensification: land use planning phenomenon whereby 
existing urban lands are transformed into higher densi-
ties (people and coverage).
WEATHERING THE STORM 37
Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curve: a graphical 
representation of the probability that a given depth  
of rainfall will occur, shown in rainfall intensity (e.g., in  
millimeters per hour) with respect to rainfall duration  
(e.g., hour).
Lateral: any pipe from a building connected to the 
main sewer.
Lake Flooding: flooding associated with defined land 
area along a lake. Can occur due to a combination of 
high water levels, waves, and storm surges. 
Minor Drainage System: storm sewers, catch basins, 
inlets, inlet control devices, street and roadway gutters, 
ditches and swales designed to convey runoff from 
frequent storms. 
Major Drainage System: streets, trunk sewers, 
channels, ponds, ditches, swales, natural streams 
and valleys that accommodate runoff, including excess 
runoff from storms over and beyond the minor drainage 
system capacity. 
Overland Flooding: flooding that occurs when runoff 
exceeds the hydraulic capacity of the storm sewers, 
ditches and catch basins, causing excess water to 
flow on the streets and then onto, between, and across 
residential properties. It can happen anywhere in 
the community. 
Peak Flow: the maximum flow rate occurring during 
a specified flood event measured at a given point in 
a river, overland, or in a pipe system.
Re-development: conversion of existing urban uses 
of lower value and significance to other preferred uses 
per a community plan (e.g. brownfield redevelopment 
to residential uses).
Regulatory Flood: the defined flood event used to 
delineate areas prone to flooding for the purposes 
of regulating land use. The minimum regulatory flood 
criteria standard in Canada is the 100-year return period 
flood, which is the peak flood flow with a one percent 
chance of occurring in any given year. Some regions, 
provinces, and territories implement standards that 
are more stringent. 
Riverine Flooding: excess stream flow in a watercourse, 
such that land outside the normal banks is submerged 
or inundated. Riverine flooding can be caused or exacer-
bated by extreme rainfall, snowmelt, physical conditions 
(e.g., ice, sediment and debris jams, watercourse configu-
ration and capacity limitations), as well as elevated water 
levels in receiving waterbodies. 
Roof leader: a drainpipe that conveys storm water from 
the roof of a structure to a sewer for disposal onto the 
ground and removal from the property (also referred 
to a downspouts).
Runoff: the amount of water deriving from precipitation/ 
snowmelt, not otherwise evapotranspirated or stored, 
that flows across the landscape. 
Sanitary Lateral: An underground sewer pipe that 
connects a private sanitary drainage system to a public 
sanitary sewer main. This type of service is designed to 
collect sanitary sewage; however, in older systems it 
may also convey storm water.
Sanitary Sewer: part of the public sewage works 
for the transmission of sanitary sewage (includes 
human and industrial waste, and septic waste, but 
not typically stormwater).
Sewer Back-Up (Surcharge): a condition when the sewer 
flow exceeds the hydraulic capacity of the sewer, causing 
back-up.
• Storm sewer back-up occurs when storm sewers are 
overloaded by stormwater runoff causing surcharge 
and back-up into homes through storm sewer later-
als connected to the foundation drain system. Storm 
sewers can also back-up to surface, contributing to 
overland flooding.
• Sanitary sewer back-up occurs when sanitary sewers 
are overloaded through inflow and infiltration prevent-
ing sanitary effluent to be properly conveyed away 
from home to the sanitary sewer.
• Combined sewer back-up occurs when combined 
sewer systems (legacy design whereby storm and 
sanitary were conveyed in a common pipe) are over-
loaded by stormwater runoff preventing sanitary 
effluent tobe properly conveyed away from home 
to the combined sewer. 
Source Control: techniques used to reduce the volume, 
rate and improve quality of stormwater runoff by manag-
ing rainfall close to where it falls.
Standardization: the development and application of 
standards that establish accepted practices, technical 
requirements, and terminologies for products, services, 
and systems.
Stormwater: precipitation that washes off driveways, 
parking lots, roads, yards, rooftops, and other surfaces. 
38  WEATHERING THE STORM
Stormwater Management: the planning, design and 
implementation of systems that mitigate and control 
the impacts of man-made changes to runoff and other 
components of the hydrologic cycle. Stormwater man-
agement is also referred to as “rainwater management” 
in much of the world. 
Storm Lateral: An underground sewer that connects 
a private storm and/or foundation drainage system to 
a public storm sewer main. 
Storm Sewer: a sewer, the purpose of which is to carry 
stormwater (including surface and rainwater, melted 
snow and ice) and water in underground pipes and 
foundation drains.
Sub-catchment: a physical demarcation of a land area, 
which contributes runoff to a common point. Watersheds 
and sub watersheds are comprised of many sub-catch-
ments. In urban settings, sub-catchments typically drain 
to an outlet (e.g. a watercourse or lake).
Sump pump: A mechanical device located in sump pits 
(depression proximate to the foundation, which collects 
the foundation water), used to pump foundation drain-
age discharge and/or groundwater to the surface of the 
lot or to a sewer lateral. 
Swale: A sloped, shallow channel used to convey storm-
water toward appropriate stormwater management 
Third pipe system: An underground stormwater or 
foundation drainage collection system. Third pipe 
systems are typically designed to convey foundation 
drainage, roof drainage or a combination of foundation 
and roof drainage via a “third pipe” under the public 
street (i.e., after the sanitary and storm pipe). 
A Foundation Drain Collector (FDC) system is an 
example of a third pipe system.
Wastewater (Sanitary Sewage): A mixture of blackwater 
(used water from sanitary appliances that contains human 
fecal matter or human urine), greywater (used water, 
other than blackwater, from sanitary appliances or from 
other appliances in a kitchen or laundry), and discharges 
from industrial, commercial and institutional facilities.

APPENDIX A: HISTORICAL REVIEW OF NATIONAL BUILDING 
CODE CHANGES THAT IMPACT THE FLOOD-RESILIENCE 
OF RESIDENTIAL DWELLINGS
Prepared by: Michel Frojmovic, Director, Acacia Consulting 
Prepared for: Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation and Canadian Home Builders’ Association
Acacia Consulting conducted a review of Canada’s National Building Codes (NBC) from 1941 to 2015 to identify key 
flood-resiliency updates introduced to the code over time. The review pertained to code provisions that focus on 
measures on the private-side of the property line to address storm and sanitary sewer back-up risk, overland flooding 
and groundwater seepage.
Access to the digital copies of the NBC were provided to Acacia Consulting by the National Research Council of 
Canada (NRC). Where applicable, the National Plumbing Code (NPC) provisions were reviewed as well. 
Table 9 summarizes key findings from the review. The column Edition & Section identifies the year of the code edition 
and the corresponding section. The column Code Provisions either summarizes or recites the provision for concision.

APPENDIX B: SELECT PHYSICAL INTERVENTIONS  
IMPLEMENTED TO REDUCE FLOOD RISK IN EXISTING  
RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITIES, CANADA
Davis Creek Flood Control System,  
City of Hamilton, Ontario
 
Twin cell culvert system, Davis Creek, City of Hamilton, 
Ontario. Left cell is to be fitted with an automated flood 
gate; right cell is fitted with a back-up manual gate.
Location: City of Hamilton, Ontario
Construction dates: 2012 - 2015
Implemented on public property: Public property -  
King Street, Red Hill Valley Parkway, Southeast Ramp, 
City of Hamilton, Ontario
Engineering Team: Ron Scheckenberger, Project 
Manager and Aaron Brouwers, Project Engineer  
(Amec Foster Wheeler)
Related Best Practices: Introduction of on-line storage 
facilities / Construction of new flood control infrastruc-
ture to provide over-control and reduce peak flows 
in flood vulnerable areas
Description: The $400 million Red Hill Valley Parkway 
in the City of Hamilton is built in the bottom of a valley 
and as such is at risk from riverine flooding. In order to 
address flood risk and improve the overall safety of the 
Parkway for motorists, Amec Foster Wheeler developed 
an innovative flood control system on the largest tribu-
tary to the Red Hill Creek. The Davis Creek flood control 
system uses over 350,000 m3 of natural valley storage 
(online) upstream of the Parkway. A twin cell box culvert 
conveying Davis Creek through a highway ramp struc-
ture was originally proposed to be partially blocked to 
temporarily hold back flood waters, much like a conven-
tional on-line dry stormwater detention facility. However, 
such simple blockage of the culverts would introduce the 
risk of overtopping if not properly managed. Therefore, 
Amec Foster Wheeler designed an automated gate sys-
tem whereby the gates remain open until the watershed 
experiences a large flood (a 25 year storm or greater), at 
which point it would close, effectively backing up water in 
the natural Davis Creek valley. Should the flood continue 
to approach critical levels, the gate would slowly open, 
avoiding an overtopping condition. 
Drainage area: 12.5 km2 (about 20% of the whole  
of the Red Hill Valley, which is about 63 km2).
Cost: 
• Planning and design: CAD $100,000
• Construction: $1,800,000
• Annual O&M costs: to be confirmed, the O&M  
manual is under development.
Performance results: The automated gate system 
reduces flood peaks downstream in the Red Hill Creek 
by 15% for a 100 year event which is the design standard 
used for the expressway. This improves the highway 
safety and substantially reduced overall infrastructure 
costs related to lower roadway platform elevations 
(resulting in less fill), smaller bridge crossings and 
associated channel geometry. A back-up power system 
(generator) ensures that the gate system is operational 
in the event of a power outage and a manual override, 
in the event of total system failure or an overtopping 
flood can open up the gate. In addition, the system 
is capable of communicating status of its operations 
(closed or open) to operations and maintenance staff 
at the City of Hamilton, in order to inform them of flood 
stage in case human intervention is required to operate 
the gates.
Non-flood related benefits from project implementation: 
• Biodiversity benefits: small and medium wildlife  
(e.g., deer and other small mammals) can move through 
the valley; similarly, fisheries access is unencumbered 
by any man-made barriers as the culvert system is open 
the majority of the time.

Manitoba
Restored wetland in Pelly’s Lake, Manitoba.
Location: Pelly’s Lake, Holland, Manitoba
Construction dates: 2014-2015
Implemented on public property: The area straddles 
the property of seven landowners, which the LaSalle 
Redboine Conservation District manages under an  
easement agreement.
Engineering Design Team: Ken Rakhra, Province of 
Manitoba and the LaSalle Redboine Conservation  
District staff.
Related Best Practice: Using natural infrastructure 
solutions (e.g., wetlands and ponds) to complement grey 
infrastructure solutions for stormwater management.
Description: The 121-hectare Pelly’s Lake water retention 
area is located on a heavily-drained agricultural land 
upstream of a high-flood-risk area of the Boyne River,  
a tributary of the Red River. The Red River has a history 
of severe flooding and contributes approximately  
60% of the nutrient load to Lake Winnipeg, the most 
eutrophic large lake in the world. 
In 2015, a retention structure was built to manage water 
releases at Pelly’s Lake, effectively transforming a natural 
slough and marginal agricultural land into an engineered 
wetland and reservoir. The key benefits of the engineered 
wetland include the ability to control water releases for 
flood attenuation and late-season recharge of waterways 
further downstream (a drought mitigation benefit). 
Cost: 
• Planning and design: $10,000 (including engineering 
time, soil samples and consultant fees)
• Capital cost: $1,017,183
• Annual O&M cost, including harvesting of cattail: 
$125,000
Performance monitoring results: In 2017, University of 
Saskatchewan researchers assessed the net economic 
benefits of Pelly’s Lake project at $3,700,148 CAD, assum-
ing a 20-year life cycle and 3% discount rate. This assess-
ment reflected the value of flood attenuation, nutrient 
load reduction (phosphorus and nitrogen) and carbon 
dioxide offset benefits.
Non-flood related benefits from project implementation:
• Biodiversity benefits: the project increased the  
diversity of plant and bird species (e.g., the University 
of Saskatchewan researchers observed increase in 
waterfowl and songbirds species). 
• Water quality improvements: reduction in nutrient  
load to Lake Winnipeg (phosphorus and nitrogen) 
through cattail harvesting. Cattail, which flourishes in 
the wetland area, consumes large amounts of nitrogen 
and phosphorus, which helps reduce the nutrient load.

Flooding Investigation in Orleans, City of Ottawa, 
Ontario 
 
Storm sewer surcharging on St. Joseph Boulevard in 
Orleans, City of Ottawa (2006). 
Location: City of Ottawa, Ontario
Construction dates: 2009 - 2010
Implemented on public property: The study area con-
sisted of seven residential sewersheds in the Orleans 
community in City of Ottawa, with a total area of approx-
imately 1,400 ha. 
Engineering Team: Four of the seven basins were studied 
internally by the City of Ottawa Staff. The remaining 
three basins were studied by Stantec Consulting, Delcan 
(now Parsons) Engineering and Jean Francois Sabourin 
and Associates. 
Related Best Practices: Detailed dual drainage analysis 
to optimize the existing storm system / Installation of 
inlet control devices (ICDs) throughout all basins to min-
imize sewer surcharge / Major system improvements to 
maximize storage and improve conveyance / Installation 
of new storm sewers to provide relief at critical low points 
/ Replacement of storm sewer manhole covers. 
Description: On July 3rd, 2006, part of the Orleans 
community in Ottawa was hit with a storm that was 
greater than the 100-year return frequency rainfall event. 
Subsequently, on August 2nd, 2006, the area was hit 
with another significant rainfall event. During both of 
these storms, significant ponding occurred on some City 
arterial roadways and on private property, but the vast 
majority of flooding reports were due to water entering 
basements via the city sewer system. Over 800 homes 
reported basement flooding. As a result, the City of 
Ottawa undertook a detailed dual drainage analysis of 
the affected area to find alternative solutions that would 
provide basement protection, similar to today’s stan-
dards. The solution consisting of the following:
• Installation of ICDs in all catch basins.
• Replacement of all storm manhole covers with solid 
covers to eliminate ICD by-pass.
• Re-grading of pathways and street sections to 
direct flow away from homes and towards major 
system outlets.
• Re-grading the entrance of depress driveways to stop 
excess street runoff from spilling into these driveways.
• Constructing high-level storm sewers to drain low 
points in critical arterial roadways that suffered exces-
sive ponding depth and were therefore a significant 
safety hazard.
• Upgrading storm sewers that were acting as 
“bottlenecks” in the system. 
Drainage area: 1,400 ha 
Cost: 
• Planning and design: CAD $675,000
• Construction: $4,325,000
• Annual O&M costs: work undertaken as part of 
regular infrastructure O&M.
Performance results: In 2011, the Orleans community 
suffered another large event that closely resembled the 
2006 storm events. There were no reports of basement 
flooding in the seven basins where flood remediation 
work was implemented. Complaints related to excessive 
ponding on residential streets, encroachment of ponding 
onto private properties and erosion of landscaping and 
gardens due to major system flow relief. Following the 
2011 event further tweaking of the system was done to 
minimize future impact to private property; however in 
most cases City staff simply informed the public about 
the benefits of keeping the water on the surface 
(“Better on the street than in your basement”).

Flood Alleviation Program (FLAP),  
City of St. Catharines, Ontario
Location: St. Catharines, Ontario
Implementation dates: annual program (1995 – present)
Implemented on public or private property: Private 
property
Type of intervention: The St. Catharines Flood Alleviation 
Program (FLAP) offers grants of up to $3,500 to eligi-
ble residents to help cover the costs of installing flood 
protection devices such as backwater valves, sump pump 
and weeping tile disconnection on private property.
Related Best Practices: Downspout disconnection from 
sanitary and combined sewers / Foundation drain discon-
nection programs to reduce potential for inflow into the 
sanitary sewer system / Public engagement.
Description: The objective of the FLAP program is to  
provide immediate basement flooding protection for 
homeowners, while long term solutions are investigated 
and implemented. It is specifically intended to protect 
houses that have been flooded due to main sewer sur-
charging during heavy rainfalls. 
The program provides a grant to homeowners with  
documented basement flooding problems related to 
sewer surcharges. Once a homeowner applies to the 
program, the application is reviewed. A team of staff then 
visits the property to determine the cause of flooding, 
identify a solution and approve a scope of work. Typically 
the scope of work includes a backflow prevention device 
installed on the building’s main sewer lateral, the discon-
nection of foundation drains from the sanitary sewer and 
reconnection to a sump for discharge to the surface, as 
well as basic restoration works. 
Homeowners are required to obtain competitive  
quotes for the eligible works from plumbing contractors. 
The City does not recommend or pre-qualify any of the  
contractors. The amount of the grant is determined by 
the lowest quote. In a typical FLAP installation, the  
homeowner does not incur any out-of-pocket costs. 
The homeowner then arranges for a plumbing contrac-
tor to obtain a plumbing permit and perform the work. 
Once the work is complete and has passed the plumbing 
inspection the grant is released to the homeowner, who 
in turn will pay the contractor. All warrantee issues are the 
responsibility of the contractor. 
Once installed, minor maintenance work is required by 
the homeowner to ensure the backwater valve continues 
to operate properly on a semi-annual basis. 
Drainage area: This is a city-wide program.
Cost: 
• The annual budget for FLAP grants is currently 
$100,000. However the number of homeowners  
applying for the program varies significantly from year 
to year and depends heavily on the number of extreme 
rainfall events. In years where the demand exceeds 
the budgeted amount, additional funds are via in-year 
budget amendments. Residents have never been 
turned away due to lack of budget funding.
• Since the program’s inception in 1995, over 1.6 million 
dollars of FLAP Grants have been provided to  
approximately 700 properties.
• In addition to the grant cost there are additional  
staff costs operate the program. The program covers 
the costs of a plumbing permit ($220 per property)  
and a CCTV inspection of the sanitary lateral ($200  
per property). 
Annual O&M costs: There are no significant annual  
O&M costs incurred by the City for this program. The 
homeowner is responsible for maintaining the devices 
and any utility costs (e.g. electricity for the sump pump).
Performance monitoring results: The mainline backwater 
valves are reliable, but subject to failure if the home-
owner does not perform routine maintenance. This has 
occurred, especially in instances where home ownership 
has changed and the new homeowner may not be aware 
of the device and maintenance requirements.
St. Catharines has also installed monitors on the sump 
pumps to measure the amount of weeping tile flows 
which are being taken out of the sanitary sewers. Based 
on these flow measurements it is estimated that 110 cubic 
metres of flow is diverted from the sanitary sewer for 
each weeping tile disconnection annually. 
WEATHERING THE STORM 45
Non-flood related benefits from project implementation:
There are several additional benefits to the program. 
First, the program encourages residents to notify the 
city about flooding issues. When the city staff investigate 
these issues, they may find other problems on public 
and private side that increase flood risk. For example, 
they may find that there are partial blockages of the 
main sanitary sewer, deteriorating conditions of the 
lateral, cross connections and illegal sump pumps 
configurations (e.g. sump pumps discharging into the 
sanitary sewer), as well as other issues that would have 
otherwise remained unobserved and unaddressed.
The program provides an opportunity to educate resi-
dents about plumbing and wastewater collection system 
issues and actions they can take to protect themselves 
from flooding. This can help some homeowners to obtain 
or maintain basement flooding insurance coverage. 
Lessons learned / public feedback: The FLAP program 
has been successful, with over seven hundred properties 
benefitting from the City’s assistance. The number of 
applications in any given year depends on the number 
of extreme rain events. While FLAP is not a solution to 
all types of flooding, it can be an effective short-term 
solution to sewer back-up. 
There has been strong support for this program from  
City Council, as it is seen as a direct and immediate 
action to assist homeowners in flood risk reduction. 
In comparison, infrastructure upgrades may take several 
years to be completed.
As a general point, residents who have not been  
flooded are not interested in the program. The work  
can be disruptive (e.g. breaking up a concrete basement 
floor to install a backwater valve or sump pit). However, 
residents who have been flooded are often motivated  
to participate in the program.

Combined Sewer Separation Project, 
City of Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island
Location: Charlottetown, PEI
Construction dates: 2004 – 2006 and 2012 - 2016
Implemented on public property: Brighton and Spring 
Park neighborhoods
Engineering Team: Pat Hughes, Project Manager (CBCL 
Ltd.) and Luc Van Hul, Project Manager (WSP Engineer 
Ltd.) 
Related Best Practices: Constructing separate sewer 
system to reduce sanitary sewer bypasses and provide 
additional capacity and relief.
Description: Prior to the separation project, the com-
bined sewer line in two Charlottetown neighborhoods 
would collect sewage from residential, commercial and 
industrial properties as well as storm water and direct 
the flow to the city’s wastewater treatment plant. During 
heavy rainfall events or the spring snowmelt, the precip-
itation would mix with untreated effluent, and at times 
exceed the capacity of the treatment plant and excess 
water that contained untreated sewage would flow into 
the Hillsborough Harbour.
In 2004, the City of Charlottetown Water and Sewer 
Utility authorized CBCL to provide preliminary design, 
site inspection and contract administration services for 
the construction of 6.3 km of new sanitary gravity sewer 
and forcemain in the Brighton area of Charlottetown. 
The project involved installation of a new dedicated 
sanitary sewer system in an area currently serviced with 
a combined sewer system. New sanitary services were 
installed to each property and connected at the right-
of-way. A lift station was installed to pump flows from 
the new, deeper sanitary system. The project features 
included:
• 905 m of 300 mm dia. sewermain
• 4,320 m of 200 mm dia. sewermain 
• 850 m of 200 mm dia. sewermain 
• 3,300 m of 100 mm dia. sewer service laterals
• 220 m of 150 mm dia. forcemain
• Approximately 341 service laterals
• 105 manholes
• Pump sewer shed – size 159 acres ( 64.4 hectares)
• A 7.5 hp sewage duplex pump lift station, equipped 
with a manual transfer switch for emergency power 
supply in event of electrical supply failure.
Following commissioning of the Colonel Gray Drive 
sewage pumping station and the gravity sewer, the 
existing combined sewer started functioning as a 
dedicated storm sewer. Separated flows from the 
Brighton area were then pumped at the Brighton lift 
station into the City’s existing 60-inch combined trunk 
sewer located in the Spring Park sewershed until the 
next phase of the project. 
Following the completion of upgrades at the 
Charlottetown Pollution Control Plant to secondary 
treatment, and completion of the separation of com-
bined sewer in the Brighton area of Charlottetown, 
and as a continued effort to resolve the operational 
and environmental issues associated with combined 
sewer overflows, the City of Charlottetown retained 
WSP to proceed with a project to separate the remaining 
combined sewer system within the Spring Park area.
The project generally includes the design and installa-
tion of new sanitary sewer mains, services, manholes, lift 
stations, forcemains and reinstatements throughout the 
combined sewer area. The project also included trench-
less technologies such as CIPP rehabilitation of a sewer 
main and directional drilling in the areas with limited 
space and/or no easement. The design was primar-
ily based on the requirements of the Atlantic Canada 
Wastewater Guidelines Manual for Collection, Treatment 
and Disposal, and the new sanitary sewer system is 
expected to have a service life of 100 years or more. 
Design of the new system accounted for the ultimate 
potential serviced population (in this case 100+ years) 
within the tributary sewersheds. WSP performed sewer 
system design, detailed design of two new submersible 
pumping stations, and detailed design of a wet well/dry 
well pumping station upgrade.
The project was phased over 5 years of construction  
with several tenders issued to ensure a timely design and 
construction. All work, including the consulting and con-
struction, was carried out while the existing mains and 
services were in operation. Due to the proximity to high 
traffic areas, this project required the development and 
implementation of a traffic control plan.
Cost: 
• Brighton Section: $4,200,000 
• Spring Park Section : $18,000,000
Performance results: Prior to the separation of the sani-
tary flows from the combined system there were roughly 
50 precipitation related events in a year where untreated 
sewage would be discharged into the receiving waters. 
Following the separation project there are fewer than five 
events per year that exceed the treatment plants capac-
ity. The next steps for improvement include additional 
inflow and infiltration reductions in the other dedicated 
sanitary sewer collection networks. 
Non-flood related benefits from project implementation: 
Improved water quality in the Hillsborough Harbor and 
shellfishing, which is managed successfully under the 
conditional management plan in the harbor.

Scotia Street Secondary Dike Installation Project, 
City of Winnipeg, Manitoba
Location: City of Winnipeg, Manitoba
Construction dates: 2004-2010 (constructed in phases)
Engineering Team: UMA/AECOM
Related Best Practice: Flood-proof properties adjacent 
to watercourses to meet the desired level of service.
Description: During the spring of 1997, Manitoba expe-
rienced the “Flood of the Century” (i.e., approximately 
a 1:100 year event) against which the City of Winnipeg 
successfully protected itself. However, in that effort the 
city did have to provide materials and equipment for the 
emergency construction of secondary dikes around some 
800 properties, of which 750 properties were provided  
a total of 8 million sandbags. Following the 1997 flood,  
a study was undertaken to assess the feasibility of con-
structing permanent secondary ring-dikes to provide 
enhanced protection to groups of at-risk homes. One  
of the key factors used for determining priorities was  
the benefit-cost ratio, considering potential future  
emergency flood-protection costs. 
The Scotia St. was one of the areas identified as being 
a high priority, with a favourable return on investment, 
considering future anticipated costs. The Scotia St. 
Secondary Dike project provides improved flood  
protection to over 25 homes located on the river-side  
of the Primary Line of Defense (i.e., the street) over 
approximately 470 m length of the Red River. The dike 
generally runs parallel to the river along the rear-yards  
of detached single family dwellings. The project was 
completed in a number of phases as details and agree-
ments were worked out with impacted property owners. 
The alignment of the new dike is protect from encroach-
ment by a continuous easement area and is also covered 
by the City’s Secondary Dike By-law. The overall Scotia 
St. Secondary Dike corridor is over 1km long and encom-
passes works constructed prior to this project, and other 
properties that did not require 
supplemental protection. 
While the clay-core dike heights exceeded 1.5 m at some 
locations, the dike crest is below FPL because home-
owners were not willing to accept greater impacts to the 
landscaping of their properties. Furthermore, additional 
surcharge loads to the riverbank would have necessitated 
riverbank stabilization works that would have driven down 
the down the benefit/cost ratio to the point that it may 
not have been economically rationalized. Nonetheless, 
the project has realized very significant benefits to the 
property owners and the City by:
• Providing a continuous, consistent and engineered 
dike protecting high-risk properties;
• Reducing the frequency that supplemental  
flood-protection is required;
• Significantly reducing the number of sandbags 
required;
• Providing a flat unimpeded surface on which to place 
supplemental flood-protection; and
• Protecting the alignment from encroachments by way 
of established easements and specific By-laws.
The City of Winnipeg’s Secondary Dyke By-law 7600/2000 
designates Secondary Dyke Corridors, and regulates 
construction within Secondary Dyke Corridors. This bylaw 
also ensures that the City has access to inspect and 
maintain the corridor. Ultimately because any one seg-
ment of the dike protects all others along the dike, 
the by-law serves to protect interests of the group  
as a whole. 
Funding:
• Secondary Diking Enhancement Program, established 
after the 1997 flood, with cost-sharing arrangement  
of 45% Federal, 45% Provincial, and 10% City.
Cost: 
• Construction: approximately $415,000 (2004-2010)
• Annual O&M costs: No budgeted annual maintenance. 
Dike is maintained by private property owners.
Performance results: Since completion of the project, 
supplemental flood-protection (i.e., sandbags) have  
not been required in this protected area, while sandbags 
were required in both 2009 and 2011 at other nearby  
properties that were not included in the program.  
The estimated cost of providing sandbags to this  
area in 1997 was approximately $1M.

Downtown Flood Mitigation Project,  
City of Calgary, Alberta
Location: Calgary, Alberta
Construction dates: 2017-2021
Implemented on public property: The river flood  
mitigation infrastructure is located along the south 
side of the Bow River, between Peace Bridge and 
Reconciliation Bridge in downtown Calgary. This initiative 
comprises of three projects. 1) West Eau Claire Park,  
2) Centre Street Bridge Lower Deck Flood Barrier,  
and 3) Eau Claire Promenade.
Engineering Contact: Andrew Forsyth, River  
Engineering section, The City of Calgary 
Related Best Practice: Construction of a new 1:200  
year river flood mitigation barrier to reduce damage  
from peak river flows in downtown Calgary along the 
Bow River.
Description: The City of Calgary takes a holistic 
approach to flood mitigation, relying on multiple lines 
of defense to build flood-resiliency at the watershed, 
community and property level. During the 2013 flood, 
the downtown core was overwhelmed, power was lost, 
and businesses could not be accessed for at least six 
days. Downtown is home to 124 head offices, more than 
9,000 residents and 150,000 jobs, so increased flood 
protection in this area is critical. 
River flood mitigation in this area includes the West 
Eau Claire Park (complete Fall 2018) and Eau Claire 
Promenade barriers which are connected to the Centre 
Street Bridge Lower Deck Flood Barrier. This infrastruc-
ture is seamlessly incorporated into the downtown river-
front public realm space by including earthfill sections of 
flood protection into the pathway system and by shroud-
ing the concrete flood barrier wall with aesthetically 
pleasing benches, as well as incorporating a short section 
of the wall into a planted flower garden area. 
The Eau Claire Promenade barrier will also be a combi-
nation of earthen berm and concrete flood wall along 
the existing river public pathway system. This barrier ties 
to the flood protection provided by the West Eau Claire 
Park barrier. The barrier system also benefits from the 
removable flood barriers that are part of Centre Street 
Lower Deck Flood Barrier. The barriers have an average 
height of approximately 1 m above the existing pathway. 
This is high enough to contain the design river flow rate 
and provide a height allowance of 0.5 m (i.e. freeboard) 
as a safety factor and to account for debris, wave action, 
gravel deposition and climate change. 
These flood protection measures result in reduced busi-
ness and economic interruption, as well as increased  
resilience for critical services and public infrastructure. 
The Government of Alberta provided funding through 
the Alberta Community Resilience Program to complete 
these projects. 
Drainage area: This project will protect 80 hectares of 
Calgary’s downtown core to the 1:200 year flood level.
Construction costs: Eau Claire Promenade barrier: 
$25.6M (design underway), West Eau Claire Park  
barrier: $3.2M and Centre Street Bridge Barrier:  
$1.7M (complete 2018).
Performance results: Once complete, the project will 
connect existing flood barriers at West Eau Claire and 
Centre Street Bridge as a single piece of infrastructure 
and mitigate up to a 1:200 year flood event, in combina-
tion with operations of existing upstream reservoirs. With 
construction of a future (conceptual) reservoir upstream 
of Calgary on the Bow River, flood protection for 
Calgary’s downtown could be increased to an estimated 
1:1000 year flood event.
Non-flood related benefits from project implementation: 
Improved public space adjacent to the Bow River, as 
flood protection works harmoniously with the Eau Claire 
Park and Promenade design and is integrated into  
public spaces.
