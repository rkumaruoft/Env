Preface
The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) took the initiative for the
development of this “Handbook on Methods for Climate Change Impact Assessment
and Adaptation Strategies” as part of UNEP’s participation in the development of
guidelines and handbooks for Climate Change Country Studies. The project is also part
of the World Climate Impact Assessment and Response Strategies Programme
(WCIRP) and as such contributes to the International Climate Agenda.
Climate Change Country Studies can be divided into four related activities:
1.  Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories;
2.  Mitigation Studies (Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Studies);
3.  Impact Assessment and Adaptation Studies; and
4.  National Communications.
Guidelines for national Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories have been developed by
IPCC/OECD/IEA with assistance from UNEP/GEF. These Guidelines have been
adopted by the first Conference of Parties (CoP) to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
Guidelines for Mitigation Studies are being developed by UNEP Collaborating Centre
on Energy and Environment, Risø, Denmark, in co-operation with several developing
countries and countries with economies in transition in a series of UNEP/GEF funded
country studies.
Guidelines for National Communications have been developed by the UNFCCC.
It is emphasised that in no way should the development of this Handbook on Methods
for Climate Change Impact Assessment and Adaptation Strategies suggest that adapta-
tion to climate change is considered to be of greater importance than mitigation. Only
mitigation can prevent climate change and its consequences. However, since we are
already committed to some climate change and since it is unlikely that the reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions will be sufficient to prevent climate change, it is better to be
prepared than to leave it for future generations to live with.
The project for development of this version of the handbook was funded, through
UNEP, by the Governments of Denmark and The Netherlands. The project was co-
UNEP/IVM Handbook
iv
ordinated by the Institute for Environmental Studies, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam. All
communications between the editors and the lead authors were carried out by the
convening editor Ian Burton, who took also the lead in the generic chapters introduction
and getting started written by the editors.
The last version of  this handbook (version 1.3; October 1996) was used by several
country study teams in developing countries conducting impact and adaptation
assessments. The handbook was tested specifically by the country study teams of
Antigua and Bardua, Cameroon, Estonia and Pakistan in the UNEP/GEF project
“Country Case Studies on Climate Change Impacts and Adaptations Assessments”.
Their comments, recommendations, and suggestions for improvement have been
incorporated in this version. Apart from this, internationally recognised experts (see
acknowledgements) reviewed, on request of the editors, the sectoral chapters. These
reviews were compiled by the convening editor and sent to the lead authors for
consideration. The editors are convinced that the above input, together with a new
organisation, especially in the generic issue chapters, has improved this version of the
handbook substantially.
This Handbook on Climate Change Impact Assessment and Adaptation Strategies is
made available by UNEP to the Parties to the UNFCCC.
Although significant effort has been put into making this handbook more useful and
better applicable for developing countries and countries with economies in transition
than the last version, it is likely that it can be improved further. The country study
teams (and other readers) that will use this handbook are therefore encouraged to
comment candidly on the format and content and if possible give recommendations for
improvement. The users and readers of this handbook are invited to send their
comments to either Jan F. Feenstra at the Institute for Environmental Studies,
Amsterdam, or Alex Alusa at UNEP Headquarters, Nairobi.

The uses of this handbook
In many countries, governments are seeking advice from a wide range of disciplines on
the potential impacts of climate change on the environment and their society and
economy. This handbook is designed to help those conducting research supporting such
advice. Underlying the research are two fundamental questions: “What does climate
change mean to us?” and “What might be done about it?” This handbook is designed to
provide newcomers to the field of climate impact and adaptation assessment with a
guide to available research methods, particularly for answering the first question. The
handbook will also serve as a ready reference for many others currently engaged in
impacts and adaptation research.
The situations in which climate impact assessment are required can be quite varied. A
common situation is that studies are needed at the national or country level, among
others as inputs for the National Communications as required by the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). So-called “Country Studies”

have been supported through the UN Environment Programme, the governments of the
Netherlands, the United States, and others. Typically in these studies some key sectors
of the economy are selected for special attention. In other instances specifically
vulnerable regions are selected for study. Impact studies are not necessarily con-fined
within the boundaries of one country. International river basins have been the subject of
climate impact studies and so have ecological regions such as deserts, grasslands,
mountains, and small islands.
This handbook is essentially as an introduction to a wide range of methods that can be
used to design assessment studies of climate change impacts and related adaptation
strategies. It does not serve as a “stand-alone”, step-by-step, or “how to do it” docu-
ment. It is not prescriptive nor does it describe only a single method by sector. The
intent of providing an overview of methods is to give readers enough information to
select the method most appropriate to their situation. However, not enough information
is given to apply a method. To carry out an impact assessment, reference must be made
to more detailed literature, software and data may need to be obtained from elsewhere,
and in many instances individual or small group training and consultation sessions will
be required.
The designs are likely in most cases to include detailed workplans that specify methods
to be used; the time, financial resources, and skills that will be allocated and brought to
bear; and the related operational and logistic support. To develop research designs and
workplans the users need to understand enough about the methods to make reasoned
choices appropriate to their circumstances, including the target audience or clients. This
clearly requires an appreciation of the various methods, including the amount of detail,
the accuracy, and the reliability of their output. An important consideration is the
assumptions that it is necessary to make in order to carry out any particular impact
study. Users also need to be able to judge the requirements that must be met in order to
make effective use of the methods.
What is climate change impact assessment?
Climate change impact assessment refers to research and investigations designed to find
out what effect future changes in climate could have on human activities and the natural
world. Climate change impact assessment is also frequently coupled with the
identification and assessment of possible adaptive responses to a changing climate. To
the extent that adaptation can reduce impacts, the assessment of adaptation measures is
part of impact studies. Thus impacts may be described as “gross” or unmodified
impacts, and as “net” impacts after adaptation has been taken into account. Climate
change impact studies are necessarily conjectural. That is to say, impacts cannot usu-
ally be experimentally confirmed or verified. Clearly it is not possible to conduct a
controlled experiment by changing the global atmosphere to test the effects of changes
on human and natural systems.
Introduction
xxi
In the absence of controlled experiments, other ways have to be developed to try to find
out what the impacts of climate change may be. There are five approaches which have
been applied as investigative techniques to try to cast more light on the potential
impacts of future climate change:
1. Palaeological, archaeological, or historical studies of how climate changes and
climate variations in the past have affected human and/or natural systems.
2. Studies of short term climatic events which are analogous to the kind of events that
may be expected to occur with human induced climate change, such a droughts, and
floods. This approach (the use of climate analogies) has been developed into a
formal method called “forecasting by analogy”.
3. Studies of the impact of present day climate and climate variability.
4. The creation of models , often quantitative of the relationship between climatic
variables and selected impacts sectors to try to answer the “what if” kinds of
question.
5. Expert judgement, which refers to a variety of methods whereby especially well
informed and experienced specialists are brought together to develop a consensus
view.
Models are the method used most frequently in impacts assessments, and it is to the
description and evaluation of such models that this handbook is primarily devoted.
Inevitably these studies are predicated upon a number of assumptions many of which
are themselves likely to be proved wrong with the passage of time . Forecasting, or
telling the future, by whatever method used, is notoriously unreliable. The first three
approaches listed (historical climate impacts, analogue impacts, and contemporary
climate impacts) are therefore important as inputs to the assumptions made in models,
and serve as the best ‘reality check” available. The fundamental problem that all of
these methods face is that all approaches are based on observations and experience with
climate change and climate variability. Climate change may introduce new conditions
that have not been seen and that are not understood. While the results of these
assessments may be the best information we have on potential impacts of climate
change, they should not be interpreted as reliable forecasts of the future.
Why do we need climate impact assessments?
Over the past three decades, since 1970 or even earlier, the scientific evidence for
human induced climate change has become steadily stronger. By 1995 the international
scientific community of atmospheric and related scientists, organised in the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), was able to conclude in a cauti-
ously worded statement that “the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible
human influence on the climate” (IPCC, 1996). With all the appropriate qualifiers and
UNEP/IVM Handbook
xxii
scientific caveats, this means that human induced climate change has been detected.
Climate change is a present reality.
This leads to two further questions:
1. How important or serious are the impacts of human induced climate change likely
to be?
2. What can and should be done to prevent and modify these impacts, and when and
how should it be done?
The answer to the second question has been construed in the UNFCCC as falling into
two main dimensions, mitigation (or sometimes limitation) and adaptation. Methods for
the study of greenhouse gas emissions and their mitigation have been fully described
elsewhere. This handbook focuses upon the second category of response, adaptation.
Information about climate impacts is needed both to help decide upon both the urgency
and the desirability of mitigative and adaptive measures, actions, and policies, and their
appropriate combinations. Since climate change is a global problem, decisions with
respect to both mitigation and adaptation involve actions or choices at all levels of
decision-making, from the most local and community level (including families and
individuals) to the broadest international levels, involving all national governments and
many transnational bodies as well. The intended target audience or client for impact
studies therefore is also very wide ranging, and this will affect the design if the study in
many ways.
The guidance literature
There are three important references in the guidance literature that research teams may
wish to consult at the design stage of a study. The antecedents of the present volume
were designed for different purposes but the authors of this handbook have, where
appropriate, drawn on this earlier work.
The first in time was the SCOPE report (Kates et al., 1985) This edited volume of
papers describes climate impacts in a number of sectors and is especially strong in its
consideration of socio-economic impacts and responses. The second is the IPCC
Technical Guidelines for Assessing Climate Change Impact and Adaptations (Carter et
al., 1994).This document lays out a general approach to impacts and adaptation
assessment, and in particular proposed seven steps that can be followed in a study
design. These are also described in Parry and Carter (1998).
The third is the guidebook prepared for the US Country Studies Program, which fol-
lows the IPCC approach and presents a detailed, step-by-step guide to a few model-
based methods per sector for country-level assessments (Benioff et al., 1996). To
strengthen comparability of studies, a limited set of models is presented (usually one per
Introduction
xxiii
sector). By comparison this handbook is designed to address a wider range of needs,
and is addressed to a wider range of potential users.
Handbook organisation
Clearly impact and adaptation studies can be designed for such a variety of circum-
stances, addressed to such a variety of clients, and focused on anything from a very
specific impact on one small part of the socio-economic or natural system to a broad,
multi-sectoral, integrated study at a national or regional level, that it is practically
impossible to specify a design that can serve all purposes. This handbook is organised
in two parts: Part I treats generic and cross-cutting issues, and Part II presents methods
for studying impact and adaptation in the selected sectors of water, coastal resources,
agriculture, rangelands, health, energy, forests, biodiversity, and fisheries.
Part I includes a “getting started” chapter, which deals with issues, methods, and
consideration common to all impact and adaptation studies. The next two chapters
discuss how to design and where to obtain scenarios. Chapter 2 treats scenarios of
climate change, and Chapter 3 treats scenarios of the socio-economic context in which
climate change impacts and adaptation may occur. Chapter 4 describes the need for
integration across sector studies and interaction with stakeholders, and suggests ways of
establishing such integration and interaction. Chapter 5 treat adaptation to climate
change, the sort of options that exist and how to evaluate them.
In order to maintain some comparability among the chapters in Part II, dealing with
methods in specific sectors, the authors were asked to follow a common format insofar
as their subject matter permits. Therefore each of the chapters begins with a brief
introduction that defines and describes the scope of the problem. The likely or known
climate change impacts in the sectors are briefly described. Against this background an
array of the various methods is presented. The purpose of this presentation of a selected
number of methods is to illustrate the range of different levels of complexity in the
methods. Some of the less demanding methods, in terms of data, modelling
requirements, and the like, are presented alongside the more complex and demanding
methods. The aim is always to be user friendly, and to provide enough information to
permit users to make a more informed choice in the design of impact studies, as well as
to begin identification and preliminary assessment of adaptation.

At the beginning of an assessment of climate change impacts and adaptation strategies,
a number of important questions should be addressed. It is the purpose of this chapter
to identify these questions, and to suggest some of the factors that may enter into their
resolution. It is not the intent of this chapter or of the handbook to prescribe answers.
The proper design of an assessment can be achieved only by those who will carry it out
in consultation with the potential users or clients.
Too often decisions are made quickly in the interests of “getting started” which later
come to be regretted. This is because the design decisions entail commitments to
inclusions and exclusions which are difficult, costly, and often impossible to change at a
later date. For that reason it is often better to take a little extra time, and exercise a little
patience, at the outset to make sure that the choices have been made as wisely and with
as much understanding and forethought as practicable.
This chapter provides a list of questions that should be widely discussed at the outset,
and to which satisfactory answers should be agreed by all the main parties, including

the sponsors (those providing the funds), the researchers (those carrying out the
research and those directing it), and the affected community (those who may be affected
by climate change or response to it and thus have a stake in the analysis).
It is unlikely that the questions can be fully resolved at the outset of the assessment. It
may be a good idea, therefore, to provide for a periodic reassessment of these questions,
to ensure that the objectives agreed at the outset are still being met.
How is the problem to be defined?
At the outset it is important to have a good sense of the definition of the problem to be
studied. Each of the sectoral chapters which follow (Chapters 6 to14) begins with a
general statement of the problem. While this will not be sufficiently specified in site-
specific terms, it is intended to point in the general direction suggested by current
knowledge and research results. Study designers and users of this handbook will want
to develop more specific problem statements for themselves.
Many of the succeeding questions may be viewed as part of the problem definition.
Thus problem definition may be treated in a holistic manner, where a brief problem
statement can serve as a focus and criterion against which to judge the relevance of
specific ideas. Problem definition may also be broken into some component parts as
suggested in the following questions.
What are the goals of the assessment?
Often the goals of the assessment are specified by the client (sponsor) or are strongly
set or implied by the circumstances of the assessment. It is important to clarify the
objectives at the outset, since they determine to a large extent the problem definition,
scope, and boundaries of the assessment.
Many climate impact assessments have been designed to serve the policy interests of
national governments. Other levels of jurisdiction, from local to regional, may also be
interested in the results. Often there are multiple objectives, where, for example, a
national government may wish to have impact research results to inform its own policy,
and at the same time contribute to an international assessment (for example, meeting a
government’s obligations under Article 3 of the UNFCCC to reduce vulnerability to
climate change).
What time? What space?
The decision with respect to the spatial extent of the assessment and the length of time
into the future that will be considered clearly depends on the factors previously
discussed.

One crucial question is the sort of climate changes to be considered. This topic is
covered in detail in Chapter 2, Climate Change Scenarios. It is common practice to
think of climate change as long-term changes in means, for example, that mean global
temperature may rise globally by 1.0 to 3.5 C by 2100 and precipitation may vary by
plus or minus 10 to 20 percent (IPCC, 1996), and by equivalent regional changes in
means, where these can be derived from GCMs.
What are the assessment boundaries?
At first it may appear relatively straightforward to place boundaries around a climate
impact assessment. For example, “We are going to assessment the impact of sea level
rise on mangrove forests”, or “We are going to study the impact of climate change on
agriculture”. The question of boundaries will come up in at least two related ways:
geographic boundaries and study depth.
Geographic boundaries
The matter of geographic boundaries of the assessment is important. Countries are
often faced with the choice of studying the entire country or a region such as province,
river basin, or ecological zone. For small countries, this issue is not typically relevant
as the whole country can readily be studied. For large or even medium-sized countries,
this issue can be challenging. Focusing on a region or a river basin allows for more in-
depth analysis. In these cases the compatibility and integration issues will be very
important. For instance, it is of limited use to study irrigated agriculture in one region
while water availability is studied in another region. Studying the entire country gives
results that appeal to a broader audience and allow national policy issues to be more
readily addressed, but it may be harder to fully integrate large geographic scale studies.
Typically the trade-off is between depth and breadth.
The depth of the assessment
A difficulty that is quickly encountered is that the impacts in most sectors are connected
to other impacts in other sectors, and themselves have secondary tertiary and N order
effects. Where is the analysis to stop? For example, damage to mangrove forests may
affect breeding of fish species, which in turn affects fish populations, which affect
coastal fishing communities, which affect local and perhaps regional nutrition, which
affects human health and raises demands for alternative food supplies from agriculture,
which is itself under climatic stress, and so forth. To assess the importance of climate
as a factor in the decline of fish populations, and the importance of fish in nutrition, it is
important to know what other factors may be affecting the fish population (such as
overfishing), and how costly fish is compared with alternative protein supplies.
Such ramifications of climate impacts can spread throughout an ecosystem, throughout
a socio-economic system, and from a local impact to regional and wider geographical

areas. It is tempting to think that such expanding ripple effects get progressively weaker
proceeding away from the initial focus in time and in space. This is not necessarily the
case. It depends in part of the condition of the systems or targets impacted. Where these
are vulnerable, or their adaptive capacity is reduced for other reasons, the impacts may
actually become more severe with distance.
Any assessment team should therefore engage in a discussion during the “getting
started” phase of the boundaries of the assessment, and how these are to be determined
and then followed.
What sectors and areas are to be included in the
assessment?
The choice of the scope of the assessment is crucial. Clearly this is dependent upon the
objectives, but it is commonly found that the researchers themselves have ideas about
the most appropriate sectors to include. The focus of an assessment can be as small as a
single cultivar (the impact of climate change on wet rice production), or extend to a
whole agricultural system, or to all the socio-economic and natural systems in a specific
country or region. Sometimes another spatial unit of analysis may be selected, such as
an island, (Antigua and Barbuda), a river basin, (the Indus), an ecosystem (savannah),
or other features such as lakes, mountains, and so forth.
The choice of the content of the assessment is often constrained by the availability of
financial and other resources. It is in the nature of the climate impacts problem for a
wider scope to be preferred, especially at this stage of development of the field where
there are so many unknowns. Both the science and the policy requirements tend to lead
to studies designed to gain a broad overview, rather than to providing precise answers
to narrow and hypothetical questions.
In those many cases where all related sectors cannot be studied, the researchers should
point out potentially important interactions in their report.
How can we ensure comparability?
It is always tempting for researchers to follow their own inclinations and hunches, and
to allow the nature of the problem as they see it to determine the choice of methods, and
the ways in which they are applied. Often such curiosity-driven research can be highly
productive and innovative. In research that is aimed at providing understanding which
will serve a policy process, this often conflicts with the need for the research results
from one subject area to be comparable with those in other areas. This requirement is
important if the results of individual component studies are to add up to something more
than the sum of their separate parts. This tension applies both within studies and
between studies. For example, in a country assessment of the impacts of climate
change, the results will not be comparable or compatible if the various sector
Getting Started
1-5
components (e.g., water, agriculture, health, biodiversity) use different scenarios of
climate change or different assumptions about the future state of the economy.
Consistency is essential in these matter. The same applies outside the assessment, for
example, if the results of an impact assessment in one region are to be comparable with
those in another region, or an adjacent country, which may share the same river basin.
How can the project be sufficiently integrated?
The domain of climate impact studies is so broad that the tendency for individual
component studies to be conducted in relative isolation is very strong and hard to resist.
The question of integration is not the same as the question of comparability. Integration
refers to a much closer examination of the ways in which sectors and regions interact.
The complex issue of integration is discussed in Chapter 4. Assessment teams are
invited to read Chapter 4 at the outset and to try among themselves to resolve the
question of how much integration is to be attempted and in what way.
How should adaptation be addressed?
The magnitude of climate change impacts estimated from a assessment is often very
sensitive to the assumptions made about adaptation. It is difficult to predict exactly how
people will respond to climate change. Will they continue their behaviour from the past
because they do not understand climate change and its implications or will they know
exactly what to do to efficiently adapt? Studies have made very different assumptions
about adaptation, and thus have yielded very different estimates of impacts. It is
therefore important to consider adaptation at the design phase of the assessment and to
decide how it is to be brought into the impacts research at an early stage. Where a
assessment is being organised by sectors, it can be helpful to select one person from
each of the sectoral groups to serve as members of a cross-cutting group specifically
devoted to the adaptation questions. These and related issues are addressed in Chapter
5.
Should we carry out a pilot project?
The questions raised above are all issues of assessment design. They are crucial.
Decisions made at the beginning of the analysis can determine the shape and content of
the research, arbitrary or hasty decisions may be regretted later. Where studies are to be
conducted in a national or broad regional context, it may therefore be useful to carry
out a preliminary assessment to help guide the choice.
Instead of simply bringing the members of a assessment team together to try to resolve
the “getting started” questions, it may be helpful to carry out a preliminary pilot
exercise. A quick and inexpensive way to do this is to draw together a wider group of
experts (not restricted to the assessment team) from the different sectors and regions,
together with specialists in climatology, social and economic studies, insurance, disaster
UNEP/IVM Handbook
1-6
research, and so forth. By pooling their knowledge and experience, it may be possible to
arrive at a consensus view or a collective expert judgement of priority sectors or regions
and results. Given the natural tendency for experts to stress the importance of their own
subjects of research or expertise, it is also helpful to include some persons in such an
exercise who have a broad perspective and are not associated with any particular sector
or region, and who have a less direct stake in any outcome of the preliminary
assessment.
What plans should be made for the
communication and use of results?
During a preliminary assessment there may also be an opportunity to take into
consideration the wider context of the assessment. Questions that assessment designers
may wish to address include the following:
• 
What outputs will be most useful to policy makers? How will the results of the
assessment be made available to the policy and decision-making process? How will
the results of the assessment be communicated to a wider audience and the general
public, as well as those most at risk?
• 
How will the assessment be related to national economic and social development
strategy and plans?
What types of method and tools should be used?
There is a range of different approaches or methods that can be used in the assessment
of climate change impacts. These include quantitative and predictive models, empirical
studies, expert judgement, and experimentation. Each of these approaches has it own
advantages and weaknesses, and a good strategy may be to use a combination of
approaches in different parts of the assessment or at different stages of the analysis. In
addition to formal modelling approaches, consideration should also be given to methods
of stakeholder involvement, and the use of expert judgement. In some cases empirical
studies of current climate impacts may be useful. There are also other tools that may be
used, such as geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing. Each of these
is briefly described below. Consideration should be given to using these approaches in
appropriate combinations.
The sectoral chapters of the handbook (Chapters 6 -14) present details of a range of
these methods and approaches. The purpose of this discussion is to provide a guide to
the sectoral chapters, so that users will be forewarned and forearmed in what to look
for. The treatment of the different methodological approaches is not uniform or
standard across the chapters, however, because the sectors are quite different in their
susceptibility to different kinds of analysis, and in some sectors (e.g., agriculture and
water) modelling approaches are much more highly developed that in others (e.g.,
Getting Started
1-7
human health and energy). In such sectors other approaches are more commonly in use
and seem better suited to the kind of data and the kinds of problem to be addressed.
For a more detailed discussion of the types of assessment methods, see the IPCC
Technical Guidelines for Assessing Climate Change Impacts and Adaptations (Carter et
al., 1994).
Quantitative models
Where feasible, it is desirable to use models where the variables can be expressed in
quantitative terms, so that a variety of tests can be carried out (e.g. sensitivity tests),
and so that results can be expressed in more precise terms. However, one has to keep in
mind that the results generated by these models may look very precise, but should be
handled with caution since the underlying assumptions – not only climate and socio-
economic scenarios but also assumptions about processes – can be rather weak or
incorrect.
Assessment designers can use the following sectoral chapters in this handbook to
provide a quick picture of the available models. In many cases it will be preferable to
adopt an existing model and modify it as necessary to meet specific assessment needs.
A crucial test in the choice of modelling approach and specific model is data needs.
Often the data needs are high and difficult to meet, and this may lead to simplification
of the model or even in some cases the development of a new model or models.
The choice of model is best conducted by experienced modellers, since detailed
foreknowledge of the problems likely to be encountered is especially valuable. Where
experience with climate impacts modelling itself is not available, experience with other
types of modelling can be of great help.
This discussion deals with impact models. These are to be distinguished from climate
scenarios, and socio-economic baseline models or scenarios. They are also to be
distinguished from the decision-making and choice models discussed in Chapter 5,
Adaptation.
There are broadly three kinds of quantitative models that can be used in climate impacts
studies: biophysical models, socio-economic models, and integrated system models. The
ideal that is being sought is a model or models which deal with climate and socio-
economic and natural systems in an interactive way. Many of the available models,
however, are simple cause and effect models, in which one or more climatic variables
are changed and the consequences predicted and measured. In reality we are dealing
with an interactive system in which one set of cause and effect relationships leads to
another. The integrated systems models represent an on-going effort to deal with this
complexity.
It should be noted that models do not do everything. Models that address only one
sector or aspect of a system may simulate that sector or aspect well. But they may not
UNEP/IVM Handbook
1-8
include interactions from important related sectors or other aspects of the system.
Models that integrate across sectors or systems may capture interactions and be useful
for assessing broader scale effects. But their simulations of specific sectors or aspects
of systems may be less reliable than the sector or aspect-specific models. Thus, the
choice of a model should depend in part on what questions are being asked, that is,
whether they are broad or narrow questions. Users of this handbook should recognise
the weakness of any model they choose before using the model and interpreting the
results.
Biophysical models
Biophysical models are used to analyse the physical interactions between climate and an
exposure unit. Details of specific models together with their merits and shortcomings
are provided in the sectoral chapters.
There are basically two types of biophysical models, empirical statistical models and
process based models. Empirical statistical models are based on the quantitative
relationship between climate and the particular sector or system under current climate.
The models can be quite useful for simulating effects of climate within the existing
range of observed climate and assuming other critical factors do not change. When
these models are used to simulate climate change, it is implicitly assumed that the
statistical relationship between climate and the sector does not change. Thus a linear
relationship based on observations is assumed to continue to be linear outside the
observations.
In contrast, process based models are based on physical laws, first principles about the
workings of a system, or assumedly universal regularities. In principle, these can be
applied outside of the geographic area or climate zone in which they were developed. In
reality, there is much uncertainty about the exact biophysical processes under climate
change, especially when other factors are included. For example, we are uncertain how
the CO2 fertilisation effect will work in field or natural conditions, especially if there is
severe drought from climate change (for more discussion see Carter et al., 1994).
Economic models
Most of the impact models of the kinds introduced above are concerned with the
prediction of first-order impacts of climate change on such variables as crop yield, run-
off, or the range of insect and disease vectors. To estimate second-order effects and
beyond, such as those on production of cereals, on water supply, or on industrial
output, can require, among other things, the use of economic models. A more detailed
discussion of economic models can be found in Carter et al. (1994). The chapters in this
Handbook do not give full consideration of economic models, although such they are a
necessary addition to first order impact studies if the socio-economic assessment of
climate impacts is to be complete.
Getting Started
1-9
It is important to distinguish three types of models, which depend on the scale of
analysis. At the finest scale, economic models describe the behaviour of a single actor,
such as a farmer or a firm. They can be used to estimate how an individual actor may
respond to climate change. For example, a farm level model can be used to determine
whether a farmer might add irrigation, switch crops, or abandon farming in response to
yield changes. Actor (or micro-) level models do not simulate changes in consumer
demand or in prices; so a key factor for the individual actor, prices, is assumed to be
unchanged.
Sector (or meso-level) models simulate behaviour in a sector of the economy. Economic
models of agriculture may simulate the agricultural economy of a country or the world.
Such models can simulate changes of behaviour in all actors in a sector, including
consumers. Agriculture models can estimate changes in production and trade patterns.
These models do not simulate interactions between the sector and the rest of the
economy.
Economy wide (or macro-level) models simulate economic activity across all sectors of
the economy. They can estimate changes in total production, employment, and other
macro-economic variables. Like biophysical models, economic models can be divided
among empirical statistical models and process based models. Empirical statistical
economic models are based on observed empirical relationships between economic
variables. As with biophysical models, these types of economic models may have
limitations with regard to estimating conditions outside of the observed data or when
there is a significant change in basic economic conditions. In contrast, general
equilibrium models are based on laws of economics and can be thought of as process
based models. They may be more appropriate for simulating economic activity when
there is a basic change in economic conditions. The empirical statistical models tend to
be static whereas the process based models can be dynamic. Economy wide models tend
to have less detail about individual sectors than do sector-based models.
Integrated systems models
Most of the methods and models described in this handbook are designed for specific
sectors. Assessments based upon single sector studies, or even single sector studies
added together, fail to address the interactive complexity of climate impact phenomena,
for instance, through competitive land and water use. For this reason, research attention
is being devoted to the development of integrated systems models. The design of
integrated studies and integrated models is discussed in Chapter 4. Although
interactions between sectors can be crucially important, building an integrated systems
models is typically beyond the means of a climate change impact and adaptation
assessment. Instead, adjusting sector studies for first-order interaction is often feasible
and a reasonable approximation to full interactions.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
1-10
Empirical studies
Empirical observations of the interactions of climate and society and natural systems
can be of value in anticipating future impacts. This is commonly achieved through
analogue methods, in which variations over space or past time can substitute for future
changes. Three kinds of analogue can be identified: historical events, historical trends,
and regional or spatial analogues of present climate.
A particular advantage of empirical studies emerges as they are extended into the area
of adaptation because it becomes possible to ask decision makers, stakeholders, and
those impacted directly about how they adapt or have adapted in the past. It is also
possible to confirm their responses through direct observations.
Empirical studies can be combined effectively with quantitative model scenarios. Such a
combination of approaches permits modelling work to be solidly grounded in
experience, and permits the extension of empirical studies into the future.
Expert and stakeholder judgement and participation
A useful method of obtaining a rapid assessment of the state of knowledge concerning
the likely impacts of climate change is to solicit the judgements and considered opinions
of experts in this and related fields. The use of expert judgement may be especially
appropriate in preliminary or pilot studies, as discussed above. Expert judgement may
therefore be used in anticipation of other types of approach, and be an aid in the design
of such studies.
There are many ways of organising inputs to studies by expert judgement. Often this is
done informally in committees and small group discussions. While the most highly
regarded experts may be drawn upon in this way, such approaches tend to lack
transparency, and there is always the possibility that a different group of experts would
have arrived at different conclusions. The use of expert judgement can also be
formalised into a quantitative assessment method, by classifying and then aggregating
the responses of different experts to a range of questions.
More recently, decision support systems that combine dynamic simulation with expert
judgement have emerged as promising tools for policy analysis. Here subjective
probability analysis is required where simulation empirical models are lacking.
Remote Sensing and GIS.
Remote sensing from aircraft and satellites is the science and art of collecting data
about objects located at the earth’s surface by using sensors mounted on observation
aircraft and satellites and of interpreting the data to provide useful information. The
main civil application areas of remote sensing are cartography, agriculture, food
security, forestry, environment, geology, water resources, marine resources,
atmospheric quality, and regional planning.
Getting Started
1-11
Remote sensing can very effectively be used in combination with GIS, which is a
computer system capable of holding digital maps called geographical layers or spatial
information (represented by points, lines, and polygons) and their associated statistical
and/or descriptive data called attribute data. The development of GIS has allowed
geographically referenced data to be analysed in complex ways. GIS facilitates the
analysis of multiple layers of data and allows statistical analysis of multiple factors
while maintaining their spatial representation. A very important advantage of the use of
GIS is that such systems facilitate the future collection of relevant data as well as
future, more complex analyses.
The data requirements for effective use of GIS are high. Data need to be geographically
referenced using compatible systems, and it is important that the spatial resolution of
the various layers be as similar as possible. Such detailed and compatible data often do
not exist, and therefore the costs of developing such a database can be very high. Other
specific limitations include the cost of the software (although less expensive products
are available) and the need to train technicians to use the software.
There are many GIS software packages available on the market such as IDRISI (Clark
University), GRASS (US Army Corps of Engineers), Arc/Info (ESRI), and others. All
of these package vary widely in cost, sophistication, ease of use, and manner of
handling spatially referenced data.
The application of a GIS in impact assessments includes (1) depicting past, present, or
future climate patterns; (2) using simple indices to evaluate present-day regional
potential for different activities based on climate and other environmental factors; (3)
mapping changes in the patterns of potential induced by a given change in climate, thus
showing the extent and rate of shifts; (4) identifying regions that may be vulnerable to
changes in climate; and (5) considering impacts on different activities with the same
geographical region so as to provide a basis for comparison and evaluation (Carter et
al., 1994). GIS can also been used in conjunction with general circulation models
(GCMs), biophysical simulation models, and integrated databases to conduct regional
and global impact analyses.
GIS can also be a valuable tool in integrated impact assessment for storing, combining,
and analysing the geographic information used and developed by the different
assessment teams. If country assessment teams decide to use GIS in their studies, it is
essential that all assessment teams use the same or at least compatible systems.
How do we keep on track and assess progress?
Climate impact assessment and adaptation studies are complex, multidisciplinary
enterprises. There are bound to be strong centrifugal forces operating which send
assessment participants in different directions. If the assessment is to retain coherence,
it is important to create at the outset a procedure for periodic review and assessment of
progress and to be prepared to make “course corrections”. Therefore it is suggested that
meetings of the study team be held at frequent enough intervals to permit collective
UNEP/IVM Handbook
1-12
assessments of progress to be made, and to ensure that the agreed answers to this list of
questions remain valid and are providing sufficient guidance to the component studies.
Where this turns out not to be the case, appropriate adjustments should be made under
the guidance of the project leadership.

2.1 Introduction
The world on which climate change will have its impact will not be the same as the
world of today. Many things will change, some even faster than climate. Populations
and economies figure prominently among these. In many countries, population is
projected to double or even triple over the next century. In some countries, the economy
is flourishing and growing very fast. In others, growth is less. In some, the economy is
actually shrinking. These changes will have a variety of effects. Higher populations
implies more people to be affected by climate change. It also implies a higher demand
for food, for water, for places to live, for energy. More prosperous people will have
more to lose to climate change, but will also have more to spend to protect themselves.
They will be less dependent on agriculture, and have better health care. Changes in
population and economy will not only alter the impact of climate change on human
systems, but also have ramifications for natural systems through, for example, altered
land use and environmental pollution.
For such reasons, it is important to have an idea of how populations and economies will
develop over the coming century and how this will affect the impacts of and adaptation
to climate change. This is commonly done with scenarios, reflecting expert knowledge

and output of extensive models. This chapter discusses how such scenarios can be
developed and to what use they can be put. It also provides a further background to
socio-economic scenarios in the context of climate change impact research. Box 2.1
illustrates many of the points raised, drawing on the scenarios build for the Pakistan
country study (Pakistan Ministry of Environment, Local Government and Rural
Development, 1997).
Box 2.1 Socio-economic scenarios for Pakistan.
Socio-economic scenarios were developed in the UNEP country study for Pakistan (Pakistan
Ministry of Environment, Local Government and Rural Government, 1997). The scenarios
comprise a range of issues, and are intended to be used in all impact and adaptation analyses
for Pakistan (the first step toward integrated assessment, cf. Chapter 4). Quantitative
scenarios were constructed for total and urban population, total and sectoral economic
activity, total and crop-specific agricultural production, total and sectoral energy demand, and
total and activity-specific industrial output. In addition, a suite of issues was addressed in a
more qualitative manner (although supported with numbers in many cases). These include
literacy, health care, import tariffs, forest cover, and infrastructure. As a result, a reasonably
complete characterisation of future Pakistan emerges, with sufficient detail to analyse the
more subtle effects of socio-economic development on the impacts of climate change and the
ability to adapt.
Three scenarios were developed, with two “anchor” years: 2020 and 2050. For the period up to
2020, the scenarios are borrowed from existing sources, scenarios developed for various
planning studies in and for the country. The period 2020-2050 was developed, with less detail,
for the purpose of the impact and adaptation study. The business-as-usual scenario is based
on a projection of observed trends, corrected for recent structural reforms. A high scenario is
based on more optimistic assumptions about developments in economy and policy. Similarly,
a low scenario is based on more pessimistic assumptions.
2.2 Background
2.2.1 Definition
A scenario is “a coherent, internally consistent and plausible description of a possible
future state of the world”, according to Carter et al. (1994). Webster’s New Dictionary
and Thesaurus (1990, p. 487) more modestly defines a scenario as “an outline of future
development”. The definition of Carter et al. is the ideal, Webster’s version is the
practice. The development and use of scenarios has a long tradition, going back to at
least De Jouvenal (1967) and Kahn and Wiener (1967).
A scenario differs from a forecast in that a scenario is a plausible future, whereas a
forecast is the most likely future. Being only a plausible future, a scenario is ideally
part of a set of scenarios, which together span the range of likely future developments.
Scenarios and forecasts have in common that they are internally consistent.
A scenario differs from a projection in that a scenario is a plausible future of a suite of
interrelated variables, whereas a projection often is a simple extrapolation of current
Socio-Economic Scenarios
2-3
trend, and often only concerns a single variable. Internal consistency is not a necessary
property of projections.
2.2.2 The scope of socio-economic scenarios
Climate scenarios are scenarios of climatic conditions. They are treated in Chapter 3.
Socio-economic scenarios are scenarios of the state and size of the population and
economy, in the broadest sense of the words. Socio-economic scenarios comprise the
number of people in a country, as well as their age, health, gender, values, attitudes,
religion, education, where and how they live, and so on. Socio-economic scenarios
comprise the gross domestic product, as well as income distribution, relative importance
of economic sectors, imports and exports, unemployment, savings, land and water use,
and so forth. Socio-economic scenarios also comprise technology, legislation, culture,
processes of decision-making, etcetera. In short, socio-economic scenarios comprise
everything that shapes a society. Arguably, they also comprise environmental changes
associated with socio-economic changes. Examples are land use change, land
degradation, eutrophication, and nature preservation.
Of course, it is impossible to make a scenario of everything, particularly within the
framework of a country study. Socio-economic scenarios can comprise almost
everything, but for practical reasons they should comprise only the elements that are
crucial for a climate change impact analysis; not more and not less. Table 2.1 lists the
impact categories as used in this Handbook and gives a selection of the socio-economic
parameters that influence impacts. Note that Table 2.1 is only for illustration. Countries
may well differ from the broad picture described here. The decision of which socio-
economic variables are needed can be made only after an understanding has been
acquired of how sensitive the system or sector under study is to changes in these
variables, and how fast these variables are likely to change. Besides gaining general
knowledge and insights from the first steps in an impacts and adaptation study,
brainstorming with appropriate experts and surveying the literature may help identify
the crucial socio-economic variables that are liable to change significantly over the
coming decades, and that have a profound influence on the sensitivity and adaptability
of the system or sector under consideration.
2.3 Scenario development
2.3.1 Background
Developing scenarios of socio-economic conditions is both easy and difficult. It is easy
in that a scenario is a description of a plausible future, a quantified description of a yet-
to-become reality in which assertions cannot be checked against data. No scenario has
ever come true. This is not to say that any scenario is as good as any other. Scenarios
need to be possible (i.e., not violate known constraints such as land acreage); plausible
(i.e., in line with current expectations); and interesting (e.g., a scenario that projects a
bright future without problems is appealing but not necessarily

interesting for policy analysis).2 Therefore, scenario development is also difficult. A
scenario is a single realisation of an infinite number of equally plausible developments.
A good scenario is consistent with current understanding of reality without assuming
that the future will resemble the past and the present. A good scenario does not say that
the future will be “more of the same”. The future will differ both quantitatively and
qualitatively from the present, just as the present differs both quantitatively and
qualitatively from the past. Scenario development thus requires a combination of a
thorough understanding with an eye for crucial details, a broad overview of and insight
about historical trends and international comparisons, creativity, and boldness.
Such a combination of talents is rare. Fortunately, in most cases, scenarios do not have
to be developed from scratch. Scenarios can be borrowed or adapted from the literature.
A variety of research institutes create scenarios on a variety of issues, with regional or
even global coverage. Table 2.2 provides an overview of common sources for scenarios
of socio-economic conditions. It is strongly advised to rely on existing scenarios, for
convenience, to save time, and to be comparable to and consistent with related studies.
New scenarios should be developed only if it is truly necessary, for instance, for
variables that are not projected in existing scenarios.
Many countries have developed country-specific scenarios to assist national policy-
makers in developing long-term strategies. Specificity to the circumstances of the
country may well be very important. If one goal of the study is to inform domestic
stakeholders about the impacts of climate change and possible adaptation options to it,
the use of existing scenarios has as additional advantages that the study’s audience is
already familiar with the scenarios and that adaptation policies can readily be placed in
the context of other policies. It is therefore recommended that national scenarios be used
where possible. National scenarios are likely to have been developed in the context of
development plans, agricultural plans, infrastructure plans, and so on. The likely
sources or contacts are the appropriate ministries or perhaps a specialised planning
office.
Note, however, that national scenarios (which have been developed for different
purposes) seldom reach the second half of the 21st century, which is the relevant time
for climate impact research. However, a long-term scenario for the country can, with a
modest effort, be based upon an existing national scenario for the medium term, and an
existing regional scenario for the long term.
It is also recommended that the scenarios used for impact and adaptation assessment be
consistent with the scenarios used for greenhouse gas emission studies. The main
overlaps are the assumed population and economic growth rates. Mitigation scenarios
may also project agricultural production and deforestation. Scenarios used for the

Unless there are identified interventions of how to reach such a future. A possible
application to a climate change impact study would be a scenario with strategic adaptation
(e.g., land tenure reform) which would nullify the impact of climate change.

impact of climate change on energy production and consumption show considerably
more overlap with the scenarios for emissions reduction.
It is important that scenarios are consistent across sector studies. Indeed, this is the first
step toward integration (Chapter 4). In this case, ensuring consistency actually saves
work. First, scenarios that apply to most of the sectors in the country should be
developed. Such scenarios are likely to include population growth, economic growth,
and other generic variables. Population growth rates may need to be region-specific.
Economic growth rates may need to be sector-specific. Sector-specific scenarios could
include age distribution of the general population and number of doctors for health, and
international wheat prices and land tenure reforms for agriculture. Note that some
elements of a scenario may be applicable to more than one sector. Examples are acid
deposition (managed and unmanaged terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems); water demand
by households (water resources, agriculture); and diet (agriculture, health). It is
therefore recommended that all scenarios (including the sector-specific ones) be
developed by one team, or that the development of sector-specific scenarios be strictly
co-ordinated.
2.3.2 Building scenarios
Scenarios are often based on a combination of expert judgement, extrapolation of
trends, international comparisons, and model runs. Historical developments are a good
guide for future developments. However, simple extrapolation should be avoided.
Understanding the phenomena underlying the observed trends and the forces that shape
the past developments is necessary for adequate extrapolation.
The situation in countries in a later stage of a transition may inspire an estimate of
future developments in a country currently in earlier stages. An obvious example is the
demographic transition, which describes how human mortality and fertility rates fall
with improved health care and growing prosperity. Another transition is that of
economic structure, with agriculture as the dominant economic sector in the early stages
of development, succeeded by industry, and then by services. People tend to consume
more meat when lifted from poverty, but tend to reduce their meat intake when more
affluent. Such transitions describe broad tendencies of average behaviour. It may well
be that countries are different. For instance, religion may interfere with fertility rates or
dietary preferences, although secularisation may counteract this. Or governments may
choose to steer economic structure toward, for instance, the tourist sector.
Models play an important role in scenario development for well-established
relationships, for example, demographic structure and population growth, or price-
induced changes and economic structure. Models cannot be used to generate a complete
scenario. Instead, models help to fill in details of scenarios. For instance, a demographic
model could help translate a projection of mortality and fertility rates into age
distribution. The projection of mortality and fertility rates would need to come from
Socio-Economic Scenarios
2-9
another source, which may be another model. Similarly, the resulting age distribution
could feed into a model which projects the prevalence of diseases.
Expert judgement is needed for the gaps that cannot otherwise be filled, to blend the
pieces into a coherent and plausible scenario, and to generate a plausible and interesting
range of scenarios. Expert judgement plays a crucial role in interpreting the results of
historical, international, and model studies. If time is short, or the budget limited, expert
judgement may even replace such studies, or fill in gaps. Models, historical trends, and
international comparisons may yield inconsistent, sometimes even conflicting results.
Experts would be needed to restore consistency, and to choose between results. Further,
expert judgement is essential for picking a set of scenarios, each of which is plausible
and interesting, that span the range of possible futures.
Expert judgement may be the only reliable source where the situation is very uncertain,
for instance, because of drastic break in the economic system (as, for example, in the
countries of the former Soviet Union) or in the political situation (as in certain parts of
Africa).
2.3.3 Multiple scenarios
The future is uncertain. A single scenario for future developments may transmit a false
sense of certainty to the study’s audience. The audience may accept a single scenario
either because it places too much trust in the abilities of scientific research, or because
it does not want to accept the additional complexities and responsibilities that come
with uncertainty. Therefore, multiple scenarios, at least three, should always be used.
Multiple scenarios have the additional advantage that a better understanding of the
system under consideration is obtained. Using multiple scenarios is in fact a
sophisticated sensitivity analysis. Multiple scenarios can show how different
development paths may affect vulnerability differently.
Multiple scenarios arise if crucial parameter values (e.g., fertility rate) are varied
between middle, high, and low values. A range of parameter values can be obtained
from the literature, from empirical studies, or from expert judgement. A rich scenario is
based on many parameters. Even with substantial resources, it may be impossible to
investigate all combinations of middle, high, and low values. Ideally, one should
generate many scenarios, based on random parameter values, and select those that span
the range of outcomes for further study and application. This may be too elaborate. If
time or budget is limited, attention should be given to the most important parameters,
that is, those that have the highest uncertainty and the largest influence on the
outcomes. These should all be varied such that the outcome — population, income — is
increased, or decreased, in all cases. To get a high population scenario, for example,
mortality would be set at its low value, and fertility at its high value. This will generate
three scenarios, a low, a middle, and a high one. If time permits, intermediate scenarios
could also be generated. In generating multiple scenarios, it is essential to keep an eye
UNEP/IVM Handbook
2-10
on plausibility and internal consistency. For instance, high per capita income growth
often leads to low fertility and mortality rates.
Besides varying parameters, different, yet plausible assumptions on certain processes
can be made. This is at a more advanced stage of scenario development. It is
particularly relevant for the more qualitative aspects of scenario building. For example,
it may be desirable to contrast a scenario with a well-protected domestic market to a
scenario in which the economy is open and all sectors compete at the world market. A
scenario with strictly regulated water resources could be compared to a scenario with a
market for water rights. Such scenarios are structurally different, so it is impossible to
classify these as high or low.
2.4  Use of scenarios
Socio-economic scenarios are used to provide the context in which climate change will
have its impact. An impact analysis usually starts with an analysis of a sector or system
(e.g., agriculture, health) in the current situation. Next, climate is perturbed and the
impact on the sector or system (e.g., higher yields, more malaria) is analysed. Socio-
economic scenarios are used to perturb other-than-climatic influences on the sector or
system; see Figure 2.1.

Figure 2.1 displays four combinations of current or future climate and current or future
society.3 The upper left corner is the current situation: climate is as it is at present, and
society is as it is at present. Consider a climate-sensitive activity such as water
resources management or agriculture. Suppose we are interested in flood damage, or
                                                  
3
In reality, climate and society do not develop independently of each other. Viewing
climate as a resource or a constraint, human decisions are constantly affected, including
those concerning long-term development. Human land use affects regional climate, and
greenhouse gas emissions after global climate.
Socio-Economic Scenarios
2-11
crop yield. Now, if only climate changes, we move from the upper left corner to the
upper right corner. Flood damage or crop yield changes because of climate change. This
change is the impact that climate change would have on the current situation. However,
society also changes. If climate were to remain as it is today, we move to the lower left
corner. Flood damage or crop yield would change, for instance because of new
investments, new regulations, or new technologies. This is the impact of socio-economic
change. If both climate and society change, we move to the lower right corner. Flood
damage or crop yield would change further. This is the change that will be observed. It
is the combined effect of climate and other changes. The situations with current climate
and future society, or future climate and current society are counterfactual: they exist in
only theoretical exercises, not in reality.
Obviously, one should not go to the trouble of using, let alone developing, socio-
economic scenarios if the impact of climate change on a future society is expected to be
similar to the impact of climate change on the current society. That is seldom the case,
however. It is true that a particular cultivar of maize reacts similarly to a certain change
in climate, whether it is 1997 or 2057. In the intervening years, however, that particular
cultivar is likely to be replaced by another cultivar, or maize by wheat, or cropland by
industrial development for reasons other than climate change.4 Similarly, the farmer that
currently lacks the ability to adapt may have been succeeded by one that has the capital
to buy different seeds or machinery, or irrigate the land (although the currently
abundant water may have been taken or polluted by novel industrial development). A
population currently vulnerable to malaria may have benefited from a successful health
care programme. The trend may also be in the opposite direction. Regions which
nowadays control malaria may lose the race in the future because of ever more resistant
strains of the malaria parasite. In general, it is better to assume that socio-economic
developments have a substantial effect on sensitivity to climate change than to assume
that the effect is trivial.
For instance, Mekonnen and Hailemariam (1998) describe a socio-economic baseline
scenario for climate change impact assessment in Ethiopia. In addition to the obligatory
population and economic growth, the scenario also considers urbanisation, agriculture
encroaching on grasslands, and expanding mining and industrial activities. Furthermore,
the scenario considers further strengthening of institutions and environmental
legislation, which would result in, for example, improved soil management and forest
preservation.
So, such factors have to be included in a climate change impact study.5 The question is
how. The previous section describes how to develop scenarios of socio-economic
parameters. The scenarios have to then be linked to the impact analysis. Below, a
number of examples by sector are given of how this has been handled in the impacts

If it is because of climate change, that is adaptation, the subject of Chapter 5.

Recall that first the crucial socio-economic variables need to be identified. A study of the
impacts of climate change on the present situation may be very informative for that.
UNEP/IVM Handbook

and adaptation literature. Of course, these examples are not perfect solutions. Nor are
they prescriptions of how it should be done. Rather, they are illustrations of how socio-
economic scenarios can be incorporated, meant to illuminate and inspire the user on
how the issue can be tackled.
2.4.1 Water resources
More people will use more water. Perhaps not per capita, but the population in total
will likely use more water. At the same time, water resources are under pressure all
over the world, with reserves falling and conflicts between competing users looming.
This implies that, in many places in the world, water resources management will look
drastically different in fifty years’ time, as current practices cannot be sustained.
A drastic change to a river is building a dam. If there is good reason to assume that one
or more dams will be built in the river that is the subject of the study, this should be
incorporated into the analysis. Another likely change is that the demand for river water
(for irrigation, cooling, or household consumption) will be different, so that downstream
discharges change as well. A part of the consumed water is put back into the river, it is
perhaps enriched by other substances. Further, peak floods may increase because part
of the catchment is deforested or paved. In that case, the nature of floods changes, with
higher, more rapid, and shorter peak flows.
Investigating the impact of such changes requires rather detailed scenarios of land and
water use in the catchment of study. Time may be too short to develop these, while the
detail required may not be found in existing scenarios. Besides, scenarios are good for
broad pictures. The details of scenarios are not very reliable, and sometimes the details
can have very important consequences. For instance, there may be a good reason to
expect that the river will be dammed, but where the dam will be placed and how big it
will be is hard to foresee, yet very important for the hydrological regime. It may
therefore be better to use “analogue parameterisations”.
The models described in Chapter 6 have been used for many studies. After calibrating
the chosen model to the river catchment, consider looking at other calibrations. If the
river is about the same as a river 200 miles north, the main difference being that
deforestation has progressed much further there, then the runoff parameters of that
catchment give an idea of what runoff will look like in this river catchment after
deforestation. This should be done with great care, as no river is the same.
2.4.2 Coastal zones
Sea level rise affects coastal zones, which tend to be highly dynamic both ecologically
and economically. This has important consequences for the impacts of sea level rise. An
obvious change is the size of coastal systems at risk. The Global Vulnerability
Assessment (Hoozemans et al., 1993), for instance, finds 61 million people at risk of a
1-meter sea level rise world-wide if populations are held constant at their 1990 values.
Socio-Economic Scenarios
2-13
This number grows to 100 million as a result of 30 years of population growth and
migration to the coast. Conversely, 169,000 square kilometres of coastal wetlands are
potentially at loss if the current situation is maintained. This number is projected falls
to 154,000 square kilometres in 30 years’ time, because other pressures on coastal
systems reduce the acreage of wetlands.
Hoozemans et al. (1993) also point out that richer countries have more financial
resources to invest in coastal protection (cf. also Fankhauser, 1995; Nicholls et al.,
1995).
Being a global study, Hoozemans et al. (1993) is understandably scarce on details. The
study by the Comision Nacional Sobre el Cambio Global (1998) describes a scenario
for coastal development in Uruguay. In addition to the obligatory population and
economic growth, they also considered the impact of currently planned infrastructure. It
is planned to connect Buenos Aires in Argentina and Colonia in Uruguay by a bridge.
This is likely to spur considerable growth in Colonia and neighbouring San Jose.
Similarly, a road is planned along the north coast, bridging the lagoons. Opening this
area is likely to lead to additional coastal development.
2.4.3 Agriculture
Future agriculture will be as different from current agriculture as that is of past
agriculture. Since World War II, the world has witnessed a tremendous growth in
population and income, decolonisation, the “Green Revolution”, the Common
Agricultural Policy in Europe, and, most recently, the freeing of international trade. All
of these have had a significant impact on agriculture, not only on its output but also on
the way it is practised and organised.
The most obvious change is population growth. Demand for food will be greater and
more varied, and therefore production needs to be greater, and also more diverse and
specialised. There are three basic options for increasing food supply, namely expansion
of agricultural lands, increased productivity per acre, and increased net food imports.
Expansion invariably means expansion into lands less suitable for agriculture. Crops on
marginal lands tend to be more sensitive to climate change (or any other stress) than
crops on richer lands. An impact study needs to take this into account. More varied
agricultural production would reduce sensitivity to climate change (through
diversification), but at the same time would increase the information needed for
successful adaptation (assuming that each crop needs to be investigated individually).
Increasing productivity per acre can be done in a variety of ways, by improving soils,
water and nutrient availability, cultivars, and management practices. High-yield strains
are often more susceptible to disturbance and disease than their lower-yield
predecessors. If rain-fed crops are converted to irrigated crops, producers’ vulnerability
to drought shifts from local (the field) to regional (the watershed), bringing in
competitive users for the irrigation water. At the same time, increasing productivity per
acre is often accompanied by  an expansion of resources, notably capital, information,
UNEP/IVM Handbook
2-14
and alternative sources of income. As a result, the farmer (not the crop) could become
less vulnerable to climate change.
Increasing food imports would imply that agriculture becomes less sensitive to climate
change in the country itself, but more sensitive to climate-change-induced price shocks
at the world food market. Increasing food imports or reducing exports of food and non-
food agricultural products would have ramifications for the balance of payments and
the exchange rate.
At the national level, the impacts of climate change on the agricultural sector also
depend on the assumed economic and population growth rates. Countries with low
population growth will have fewer mouths to feed. Countries with high economic
growth will have more resources to support a smaller agricultural sector.
Vulnerabilities will be very different if a country seeks rapid industrialisation, takes
food imports for granted, seeks self-reliance in food production, or chooses a path of
agricultural export-led growth. Vulnerabilities will also be different if a country chooses
to protect and support its farmers, or let them face the whims of the market and the
weather on their own strength.
2.4.4 Rangelands and livestock
The issues raised with regard to arable agriculture also pertain more or less to
rangelands and livestock. Rangelands and the livestock living on them are affected by
changes in water and land use, deposition of eutrophying and acidifying substances, soil
erosion and land degradation, and management practices. The demand for meat and
dairy products, which depends on the number of people and their dietary preferences, is
also important. The intensity of farm management is another factor that may influence
the response of rangelands and livestock to climate change. Extensive farms may be
most sensitive to changing weather conditions. This sensitivity may decline if land is
improved, feed is supplemented, and animal health care is improved. Bio-industry is
largely insensitive to climate change, but may conflict with consumer preferences.
2.4.5 Human health
Human health is another area where large changes can be expected. Medical research
concentrates on “diseases of affluence” (e.g., cardiovascular disorders), which may be
less sensitive to climate change than “diseases of poverty” (e.g., infectious diseases).
Breakthroughs in treatments for climate-sensitive diseases may not occur, and if they
do, their timing is highly uncertain. Further, the effect these have on vulnerability is
trivial. For instance, in the unlikely event of the development of an effective and cheap
malaria vaccine, the effect of climate change on the disease will be negligible.
Access to basic health care is often important to vulnerability to climate-sensitive
diseases. With some effort, this can be derived from scenarios on per capita incomes.
Other variables such as income distribution and national or international health care
Socio-Economic Scenarios
2-15
programmes are also important. These could be derived by extrapolation or be the
subject of a sensitivity analysis. In any case, people tend to care about their health, and
if they are able, they will take care of their health. So, increasing incomes implies better
health care and reduced vulnerability to diseases, including those sensitive to climate
change.
Although a rise in income may improve human health, economic growth and
urbanisation will continue so that “rich” and “urban” diseases will gain in importance
relative to “poor” and “rural” diseases. Two prominent categories are cardiovascular
diseases (related to heat and cold) and respiratory disorders (related to heat, cold, and
air quality). The urban heat island effect makes heat waves in cities much worse than at
the countryside. Air conditioning helps only those who have it. And air conditioning
actually contributes to the heat outside. Urban air quality also tends to be worse than
rural air quality, and particularly so during hot weather.
The impact of heat waves depends on adaptation. Once air conditioning is wide-spread
(including in shopping malls) and cooling water bodies or forests are nearby,
vulnerability will decrease. A similar thing may happen to urban air quality. Once the
dirtiest traffic is banned, and the dirtiest industries moved to the outskirts of the city, air
quality will improve and vulnerability decline.
Scenarios for population, per capita income, and urbanisation are readily available for
most countries (see Table 2.2). Scenarios for other variables are not so readily
available.
2.4.6 Energy
Energy production and consumption are likely to change in ways that affect their
sensitivity to climate change. On the production side, biomass, solar energy, and,
particularly, hydropower are directly influenced by climate. These sources of energy
may well gain in importance in the future, so that the number of potentially affected
units (biomass plantations, hydropower plants, wind turbines) grows. Energy
production and the composition of energy supply are subject to substantial study,
largely in the context of mitigation studies of climate change. It is recommended that the
scenarios used for mitigation studies also be used to study the impact of climate change
on energy production and consumption.
Climate effects on energy consumption are largely confined to heating and cooling.
Demands for heating and cooling depend on the number of people and their housing
situation. Particularly important is the spread of air-conditioning. Note that climate
change may speed up the introduction of air-conditioning. Building design, urban
planning, family size, age distribution, and working hours may also significantly affect
energy demand for heating and cooling.
Besides energy supply and demand, technologies are also bound to change. New power
generating techniques may be more or less sensitivity to weather conditions, or sensitive
UNEP/IVM Handbook
2-16
to other weather circumstances than current techniques. For instance, new power plants
may use less cooling water, or new photovoltaic cells may be less sensitive to overcast
skies. Technological change may also influence the energy demand side. For instance,
the energy demand of more efficient air conditioners is less sensitive to climate than is
the demand of less efficient air conditioners.
2.4.7 Forests
Besides by climate change, forests are affected by changes in water and land use,
deposition of eutrophying and acidifying substances, timber demand, and management
practices. These factors affect both the size of the forest sector and the species
composition in the stands. The latter would imply a qualitative shift in the impact of
climate change, since different species react differently. Trees stressed by, say, an acid
environment also react differently to climate change than trees in a healthy environment,
as do trees in an environment artificially enriched by nutrients. Foresters would behave
differently if the land tenure system were to change, or if the demand for “sustainably
grown” timber were to increase. Forest acreage would decrease if other types of land
use became relatively more attractive, for instance because of extensions of nature
reserves, increased demand for agricultural produce, or greater timber supply on the
international market.
2.4.8 Biodiversity
Biodiversity is affected by changes in water and land use, deposition of eutrophying and
acidifying substances, soil erosion and land degradation, and recreation. In some cases,
management practices are also influential. All of these factors influence the way in
which biodiversity reacts to changes in the climate. Perhaps the most influential factor
is the area of human disturbance. The area that is left untouched by humans, whether
this is scattered or well-connected, confined to marginal grounds and so on, is a
significant driver of vulnerability to climate change. Also, whether adjacent lands are
used for eco-tourism, extensive farming, or industrial development is influential.
Further, access of indigenous people or poachers may be important. Inflow of
contaminating or fertilising substances via air or water may also affect an ecosystem
and its reaction to climate change.
2.4.9 Fisheries
The most crucial factor determining the impact of climate change on fisheries is the
harvesting of the world’s fish stocks for human consumption. A further increase in the
reach and accuracy of fishing fleets would lead to more stress on more fish populations,
leaving them more vulnerable to climate change. Technologies enabling fishermen to
catch only desirable species, and regulations restricting access to certain waters, times,
or species, would reduce stress and increase resilience to climate change.
Socio-Economic Scenarios
2-17
Another important factor is human influence on hatcheries, nurseries, and food
resources such as coastal wetlands and coral reefs. A further increase in the stress on
these systems would leave fish stocks more vulnerable to climate change, and
decreasing stress would have the reverse effect.
A third factor that may be worth looking at is the spread of aquaculture. If fish supply
were to rely more heavily on “farmed” fish than on wild stocks (because of market
forces or government intervention), stress on the latter would decrease and the influence
of climate change on the former would be greater. A change in dietary preferences for
fish would change demand, and thus would affect the supply and stress of fish
populations.
2.5  Concluding remarks
The socio-economic circumstances of the world on which climate change will have its
impact will be very different from today’s circumstances. The future system or sector of
the study is likely to differ not only in size but also in structure. Therefore, the impacts
on and adaptation of the future system or sector may well differ quantitatively and
qualitatively from the impacts and adaptation of the current system. In one way or
another, the analysis needs to take this into account.
As a first step, the crucial elements that are likely to change should be identified. Is it
the size of the population, water use upstream, or agricultural policy? As a second step,
a scenario of how these crucial elements might change over the next decades needs to be
developed or, preferably, obtained. As a third step, the impact and adaptation analysis
must be combined with the socio-economic scenario.
The second step is probably the easiest. Do not develop scenarios; instead borrow them
from the literature. If no scenarios are available, use historical trends and geographical
analogues to inspire scenario development. If time permits, use more than one scenario.
The first and third step are specific to the situation of a country study. General
guidelines are either too vague to be helpful or too specific to be applicable to each
case. Using appropriate experts will probably help. The literature on climate change
impacts and adaptation is rapidly expanding, and full of examples how others have tried
to solve this problem. This chapter also provides a number of examples, but these are
only examples; different problems would need different solutions.

3.1  Introduction
This chapter addresses the important and often controversial topic of climate change
scenarios. The choice of climate change scenarios is important because it can determine
the outcome of a climate change impacts analysis. Extreme scenarios can produce
extreme results, and moderate scenarios can produce moderate results. The selection of
scenarios is controversial because scenarios are often criticised for being too extreme,
too moderate, too unreliable, or not considerate of important factors such as changes in
variability.
This chapter does not provide instructions on which types of climate change scenarios
to use or how to construct them. Rather, it discusses the options for selecting scenarios,
the issues that need to be considered in selecting scenarios, and the advantages and
disadvantages of different approaches. The design and application of specific scenarios
will require additional research and may require technical assistance.

Scenarios

This chapter begins by addressing why climate change scenarios should be used and
postulating criteria for selecting types of scenarios. Generic options for selecting
scenarios are described, followed by a discussion of issues to be considered when
selecting scenarios. The chapter then discusses issues in the use of general circulation
models (GCMs3) in climate change scenarios and gives examples of scenario selection.
(Chapter 2 discusses why it is important to use scenarios to examine the potential
implications of uncertain future conditions such as climate change.)
More than one scenario should be used to show that there is uncertainty about regional
climate change. Using one scenario can be misinterpreted as a prediction. Using
multiple scenarios, particularly if they reflect a wide range of conditions (e.g., wet and
dry) indicates some of the uncertainty about regional climate change.
Climate change scenarios have been typically developed for a particular point in the
future. Many climate change scenarios examine the climate associated with a doubling
of carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere over pre-industrial levels (2xCO2).4 This will
most likely happen in the last half of the twenty-first century. These could be considered
static scenarios because they are based on the (false) presumption that a stable climate
will be reached in the future. This assumption is made to simplify analysis, not because
it is widely believed that climate will reach a static condition. In contrast, transient
scenarios examine how climate may change over time. They typically start in the
present day and cover a number of decades into the future.
A range of scenarios can be used to identify the sensitivity of systems to climate change
and to help policy makers decide on appropriate policy responses. It must be explained
to policy makers, journalists, and the public that climate change scenarios are not
predictions of the future in the way that weather forecasts are. Rather, they are
plausible indications of what the climatic future could be like, given a specific set of
assumptions. The range of plausible climate change scenarios is much greater than that
determined by uncertainties in climate models alone, and depends to a considerable
extent on future global demographic and technological change, land utilisation, and
ecological adaptation. Thus, prediction is too ambitious a term for such a tentative and
provisional exercise of looking into the future (Henderson-Sellers, 1996).

GCM can also stand for “global climate models.” However, one-dimensional and two-
dimensional models of global climate can be considered to be global climate models.
Models of the general circulation of the atmosphere or atmosphere and oceans need to be
three-dimensional. Thus here GCM only refers to these three-dimensional models.

These CO2 doubling scenarios usually mean the “effective doubling” of CO2, that is,
when the warming potential of all greenhouse gases, such as methane, nitrous oxide,
and the halocarbons as well as carbon dioxide, equals the doubling of CO2 alone.

3.2  Climatological baseline
It is typical in impacts assessment to use a period of years of observed meteorological
data to define a “current climate baseline”. This set of years can be used to calibrate
impacts models and to quantify baseline climate impacts, e.g., crop yields under current
climate. A 30-year continuous record of recent climate data is widely used for creating
a baseline climate (e.g., Rosenzweig and Parry, 1994). A 30-year period is likely to
contain wet, dry, warm, and cool periods and is therefore considered to be sufficiently
long to define a region’s climate. The 30-year “normal” period as defined by the World
Meteorological Organisation (WMO) is recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC) for use as a baseline period (Carter et al., 1994).
The current WMO normal period is 1961-1990. This period best defines current
climate because it is recent. Since the quality and quantity of weather observations tend
to improve over time, this period is likely to contain a more extensive network of
observing stations and to record more variables than earlier periods. One problem with
use of the 1961-1990 period, however, is that the 1980s were, globally, the warmest
decade this century (Jones et al., 1994), although in some regions the 1980s were not
warmer than prior decades. On average, therefore, using 1961-1990 as a base period
could introduce a warming trend into the baseline, which could bias the results of some
impact assessments, particularly transient assessments that combine observed baseline
climate with an underlying trend in climate variables. The trend is not a problem if one
is reporting only averages and variances. Another recent 30-year period such as 1951-
1980, which has no trends or less distinct trends, could perhaps be used. But earlier
periods are more likely to have less comprehensive and poorer quality data. On balance,
it is preferable to use the most recent period.
In many cases, the baseline data set may contain insufficient variables or periods of
missing data. In addition, there may be a need to create a baseline period that is much
longer than 30 years to create more reliable statistical results (e.g., Lin, 1996). One way
to remedy these situations is to use stochastic weather generators (see Table 3.3) (e.g.,
Richardson and Wright, 1984). These simulate daily weather at a site based on
historical statistical relationships between variables. Using a weather generator to
generate longer and more complete baseline data sets may require substantial amounts
of observed weather data, which can be costly, or the data may be difficult to obtain.
3.3 Conditions for selecting climate change
scenarios
Climate change scenarios selected for impact assessment should meet the following four
conditions:
Condition 1.
The scenarios should be consistent with the broad range of global
warming projections based on increased atmospheric concentrations of
greenhouse gases, e.g., 1EC to 3.5EC by 2100 (Houghton et al., 1996),
UNEP/IVM Handbook
3-4
or 1.5EC to 4.5EC for a doubling of CO2 concentrations (IPCC, 1990).
Regional changes in climate variables may be outside the range of
global average changes, but should be consistent with what climate
change theory and models conclude may happen.
Condition 2.
The scenarios should be physically plausible; that is, they should not
violate the basic laws of physics. It is not plausible, for example, to
assume that a country with as large an area as Russia or Brazil would
have a uniform increase or decrease in precipitation. However, such a
scenario could be plausible for smaller areas. In addition, changes in
variables need to be physically consistent with each other. For exam-
ple, days with increased precipitation will most likely have increased
cloudiness.
Condition 3.
The scenarios should estimate a sufficient number of variables on a
spatial and temporal scale that allows for impacts assessment (Smith
and Tirpak, 1989; Viner and Hulme, 1992). Many impacts models
need scenario data for a number of meteorological variables such as
temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, humidity, and winds. In
addition, daily or more frequent information may be needed for some
studies.5
Condition 4.
The scenarios should, to a reasonable extent, reflect the potential range
of future regional climate change. For example, a set of scenarios that
examines only a relatively large or small amount of warming, or only
wet or dry conditions, will not help identify the full range of
sensitivities to climate change
In assessing options for creating climate change scenarios, it is important to meet as
many of these conditions as possible. Where conditions are not met, the shortcoming
should be acknowledged in reporting the results of analyses that use the scenarios.
3.4  Generic types of climate change scenarios
There are three generic types of climate change scenarios: scenarios based on outputs
from GCMs, synthetic scenarios, and analogue scenarios. All three types have been
used in climate change impacts research, although probably a majority of impacts
studies have used scenarios based on GCMs. This section briefly describes each type
                                                  
5
Those creating climate change scenarios need to discuss data needs with the groups
assessing impacts on each sector. The sectoral groups need to identify the variables they
need and the necessary spatial and temporal resolution (e.g., 100 square kilometres at a
daily time step). The climate change scenarios group needs to determine what can
reasonably be provided.
Climate Change Scenarios
3-5
of scenario and its relative advantages and disadvantages.6 The section closes with a
discussion of a fourth possibility of using a combination of two or more options. These
different approaches, among others, have been summarised in Table 3.3.
3.4.1 General circulation models
GCMs are mathematical representations of atmosphere, ocean, ice cap, and land
surface processes based on physical laws and physically-based empirical relationships.
Such models have been used to examine the impact of increased greenhouse gas
concentrations on future climate. GCMs estimate changes for dozens of meteorological
variables for grid boxes that are typically 250 kilometres in width and 600 kilometres in
length. Their resolution is therefore quite coarse. The most advanced GCMs couple
atmosphere and ocean models and are referred to as coupled ocean- atmosphere GCMs;
see Gates et al. (1996) for an evaluation of coupled GCMs.
Two types of GCM runs can be useful for impact assessments. Almost all GCMs have
been used to simulate both current (1HCO2) and future (2HCO2 or occasionally 4HCO2)
climates. The difference between these simulated climates is a scenario of how climate
may change with an effective doubling (or quadrupling) of atmospheric CO2
concentrations. These are referred to as equilibrium experiments since both the current
and future climates are assumed by modellers to be in equilibrium (i.e., stationary).
GCMs used for equilibrium experiments generally have only a very simple
representation of the oceans.
To be sure, climate is never in equilibrium. Greenhouse gas concentrations are not held
constant, because of human activities or other reasons. The assumption of a stable
climate makes it easier, however, for climate modellers to estimate the effect of
increased greenhouse gases on climate and for impact assessors to examine potential
impacts.
The second type of experiment is called a transient experiment. Here, a coupled GCM
is used to simulate current (1HCO2) climate and then future climate as it responds to a
steady increase in greenhouse gas concentrations beyond 1HCO2 concentrations (e.g.,
Manabe and Stouffer, 1995; Mitchell et al., 1995). A typical forcing scenario in a
transient experiment is a 1 percent per year increase in CO2 concentration, but many
different forcing scenarios could in principle be used. The model is typically run for 100
years or more into the future. Tables 3.1 and 3.2 display attributes of some transient
coupled atmosphere-ocean GCMs. An important limitation of many transient scenarios
from GCMs is the so-called “cold start” problem (Hasselmann et al., 1993). This
occurs when a transient GCM simulation fails to reflect the climate change that arises
because of historical greenhouse gas emissions (i.e., those before the baseline period;
Kattenberg et al., 1996). When this occurs, GCMs usually underestimate the change in

climate in the first few decades beyond the present. More recently, a few “warm start”
transient experiments have been successfully completed in which historical emissions of
greenhouse gases back to the nineteenth century have been used to force the model (e.g.,
Mitchell et al., 1995; Mitchell and Johns, 1997). Many impact assessment studies have
used GCMs as the basis for creating scenarios (e.g., Parry et al., 1988; Smith and
Tirpak, 1989; Rotmans et al., 1994; Strzepek and Smith, 1995). These studies
combined average monthly changes between 2HCO2 and 1HCO2 climates from
equilibrium GCM experiments with 30 years of observed climate data. The use of the
observed climate data provides greater spatial, and sometimes temporal, variability than
can be provided by the GCM (thus helping meet Condition 3), although it assumes that
these aspects of climate do not change from current conditions.

Until the last few years, equilibrium GCM experiments were more readily available.
This is because it takes less computing time to run a static experiment than a transient
experiment. Many impacts studies have relied on static experiments and typically
estimate the effects of CO2 doubling on a sector. Thus, they estimated the potential
effects of climate change in the latter half of the twenty-first century. With increased
computing power it has become less expensive to run transient experiments. In recent
years, the output from transient experiments has been used more frequently in climate
change impacts studies. Thus, potential impacts over successive decades can also now
be estimated.
Climate Change Scenarios
3-7
The major advantage of using GCMs as the basis for creating climate change scenarios
is that they are the only tool that estimates changes in climate due to increased
greenhouse gases for a large number of climate variables in a physically consistent
manner.7 The GCMs estimate changes in a host of meteorological variables, e.g.,
temperature, precipitation, pressure, wind, humidity, solar radiation (Schlesinger et al.,
1997), that are consistent with each other within a region and around the world, and
thus they fully meet Conditions 1 and 2, and partially satisfy Condition 3.

Although the variables within a GCM are all determined using physical laws, or empirical
relationships based on physical laws, validation studies show that the internal
relationships between these model variables may not necessarily be the same as the
relationships observed in the real world. This is because of deficiencies in the GCM.

A major disadvantage of using GCMs is that, although they accurately represent global
climate, their simulations of current regional climate are often inaccurate (Houghton et
al., 1996). In many regions, GCMs may significantly underestimate or overestimate
current temperatures and precipitation (see Table 3.3). Another disadvantage of GCMs
is that they do not produce output on a geographic and temporal scale fine enough for
many impact assessments (Condition 3). GCMs estimate uniform climate changes in
grid boxes several hundred kilometres across, and although they estimate climate on a
daily or even twice daily basis, results are generally archived and reported only as
monthly averages or monthly time series. An additional disadvantage of GCM-based
scenarios is that a single GCM, or even several GCMs, may not represent the full range
of potential climate changes in a region (Condition 4).
Climate Change Scenarios
3-9
Although GCMs have clear limitations for scenario construction, they do provide the
best information on how global and regional climate may change as a result of in-
creasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. Some of the ways of creating
climate change scenarios using GCM output are described in Section 3.5.
3.4.2 Synthetic scenarios
Synthetic scenarios, sometimes referred to as arbitrary scenarios, are based on incre-
mental changes in such meteorological variables as temperature and precipitation. For
example, temperature changes of +2EC and +4EC can be combined with precipitation
changes of "10 percent or 20 percent or no change in precipitation to create a synthetic
scenario (e.g., Poiani and Johnson, 1993; Mendelsohn and Neumann, in press). These
incremental changes are usually combined with a baseline daily climate database to
yield an altered 30-year record of daily climate.
Synthetic scenarios usually assume a uniform annual change in temperature and other
variables over a study area, although some studies have introduced temporal and spatial
variability into synthetic scenarios. Robock et al. (1993) developed different synthetic
scenarios for annual average change in temperature and precipitation in wet and dry
years in the Sahel and Venezuela. Kalvov< and NemeÓov< (1995) developed different
seasonal changes in temperature and precipitation patterns for the Czech Republic, but
again applied them uniformly across the region. Rosenthal et al. (1995) used different
uniform changes in winter and summer temperature across climate zones of the United
States. Thus, they included some temporal and spatial variability. All three studies
based the selection of synthetic scenarios on outputs from GCMs.
The main advantages of synthetic scenarios are their ease of use and transparency to
policy makers and other readers of impacts studies. In addition, synthetic scenarios can
capture a wide range of potential climate changes (Condition 4). One can examine small
changes in climate (e.g., 1EC) up to large changes in climate (e.g., 5EC to 6EC), and
one can examine increased and decreased precipitation scenarios. In addition, because
individual variables can be changed independently of each other, synthetic scenarios
also help identify the relative sensitivities of sectors to changes in specific
meteorological variables. A further advantage of synthetic scenarios is that different
studies can use the same synthetic scenarios to compare sensitivities (although assum-
ing the same synthetic scenario across different sites may well violate Condition 2,
internal consistency). Synthetic scenarios are inexpensive, are quick and easy to
construct, and generally require few computing resources.
A major disadvantage of synthetic scenarios is that they may not be physically plausible
(Condition 2), particularly if uniform changes are applied over a very large area or if
assumed changes in variables are not physically consistent with each other. As noted
above, uniform changes in temperature, and particularly precipitation, are not plausible
over large areas. It is important to not arbitrarily select changes in variables such as
temperature, precipitation, wind, clouds, and humidity that are not internally consistent
with each other. For example, increased precipitation would normally be associated
UNEP/IVM Handbook
3-10
with increased clouds and humidity.8 Synthetic scenarios may not be consistent with
estimates of changes in average global climate (Condition 1). This last limitation can be
overcome by using the outputs of GCMs to guide the development of synthetic
scenarios, as was done in each of the three studies cited above.
3.4.3 Analogue scenarios
Analogue scenarios involve the use of past warm climates as a scenario of future
climate (temporal analogue scenario), or the use of current climate in another (usually
warmer) location as a scenario of future climate in the study area (spatial analogue
scenario).
3.4.3.1 Temporal analogue scenarios
Temporal analogue scenarios come from one of two sources: the instrumental record
(weather observations) or the paleoclimatic record. A major study of climate change
impacts in the United States, the Missouri-Iowa-Kansas-Nebraska (MINK) study
(Rosenberg, 1993), used the instrumental record from the 1930s, a very dry and hot
period in the upper Midwest (approximately 1EC warmer than 1951-1980), as an
analogue for climate change. An advantage of using the instrumental record as the basis
for a climate change scenario is that climate change data are available on a daily and
local scale (Condition 3), which is a finer temporal and spatial resolution than that
usually provided or archived by GCMs.
Some researchers have suggested using warm periods from the paleoclimate record to
create scenarios of climate change (e.g., Shabalova and K`nnen, 1995). The advantage
of using paleoclimate data over instrumental data for climate change scenario
construction is that temperature differences in the distant past compared to current
climate tend to be greater than those within the instrumental record, and may therefore
be more consistent with potential changes in average global temperature over the next
century (Condition 1). However, collecting or collating the relevant paleoclimate data
for the required region may be a costly and time-consuming exercise.
The major disadvantage of using temporal analogue climates for climate change sce-
narios is that the changes in past climates were unlikely to have been caused by
increased greenhouse gas concentrations. It is more likely that these changes were
caused, for example, by changes in the Earth’s rotation around the sun. The reasons for
the warming in the 1930s are uncertain. Thus, these scenarios are not based on
human-induced increases in greenhouse gas concentrations (Condition 1). A potential

The more meteorological variables being used in a scenario, the more care is needed when
relying on synthetic scenarios. Arbitrarily assigning values to many variables risks
selecting a set of outcomes that is not physically plausible. Climate models may be more
attractive to examine larger sets of climate variables.
Climate Change Scenarios
3-11
disadvantage of analogue scenarios based on instrumental records is that complete
instrumental records for the period in question may not exist in many countries. A
further disadvantage of paleoclimate scenarios is that data are generally available only
for seasonal changes in temperature and precipitation. In addition, paleoclimate data are
not available in many locations, particularly in tropical areas. Furthermore, temporal
analogue scenarios (except those from millions of years ago, which have very low
resolution of data) tend to be at the low end or even below the range of potential future
climate warming, thus violating Condition 4.9
3.4.3.2 Spatial analogue scenarios
Some studies used other regions with warmer climates than the area of study as a
spatial analogue of climate change. For example, Parry et al. (1988) used Scotland as a
spatial analogue for the potential future climate in Iceland and Kunkel et al (1998)
transposed warmer climates from south and south-west of the Great Lakes over the
Great Lakes to investigate changes in runoff and lake thermal structure. An advantage
of spatial analogues is that they can be used to examine how social and natural systems
have adapted to different climates (Parry et al., 1988; Mendelsohn et al., 1994). Such
scenarios can be particularly helpful in examining the potential for adaptation to
minimise adverse effects of climate change. They also provide an often graphic means
of communicating the broad significance of climate change to the public. Spatial
analogues can also introduce changes in spatial and temporal variability (Kunkel et al.,
1998). The disadvantage of spatial analogue scenarios is that, because of geographical
and other differences, the future climate in the study area is unlikely to be the same as
the current climate in another location (Carter et al., 1994), even if the average annual
temperature may be similar. Thus, the level of detail available from an analogue site
may give a false sense of precision and may violate Conditions 1, 2, and 4.
Furthermore, extensive continental or global climate data sets are necessary to search
for an analogue region, and such data sets may not be easy to obtain.
3.4.3.3 Final thoughts on analogue scenarios
Since temporal analogues of global warming were not caused by anthropogenic emis-
sions of greenhouse gases and because spatial analogues are unlikely to be plausible
scenarios of future climate change, the climate change impacts assessment literature has
generally recommended that these types of scenarios not be used (IPCC, 1990; Carter et
al., 1994). If they are used, they should be used only under two conditions. The first is
that the limitations of this approach should be clearly explained, pointing out that
analogue scenarios may not be accurate representations of greenhouse gas induced
climate change. The second is that other approaches such as synthetic or GCM based

Scenarios with relatively low levels of temperature change can be useful in identifying
potential climate change impacts early in the next century.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
3-12
scenarios are also used in the same study. This will help ensure that a broader range of
climate changes is included in the scenarios.
3.4.4 Combinations of options
None of the above options fully satisfies all four scenario selection conditions. Sulzman
et al. (1995) therefore recommend using a combination of scenarios based on outputs
from GCMs and synthetic scenarios. They advocate using GCM-based scenarios
because they are the only ones explicitly based on changes in greenhouse gas con-
centrations. Synthetic scenarios complement GCM scenarios because they allow for a
wider range of potential climate change at the regional level and are easier to construct
and apply. Harrison et al. (1995) also use both GCM and synthetic scenarios in their
assessment of climate change and agriculture in Europe, arguing that synthetic
scenarios allow the sensitivity of the impact models (in their case crop models) to
climate change to be more clearly established than do GCM scenarios. GCM scenarios
were subsequently used in their study to determine a more plausible range of climate
change impacts.

3.5 Issues in selecting and designing climate
change scenarios
A number of issues beyond the four conditions introduced in Section 3.3 should be
considered when selecting or designing climate change scenarios. Consideration of these
issues may affect the selection of a generic option from the alternatives described in the
previous section. Table 3.3 summarises some of the advantages and disadvantages of
these and other approaches.
3.5.1 Using GCMs for scenario construction
3.5.1.1 Equilibrium experiments
Climate change scenarios obtained from equilibrium GCM experiments describe an
average climate of the future. These scenarios assume an abrupt change in climate
conditions between “now” and many decades in the future, often when 2HCO2 con-
centrations are reached. In many cases, observations in the baseline climate data set are
perturbed by adding to them, or multiplying them by, changes in monthly or annual
temperature and precipitation derived from the equilibrium GCM experiment (an
equilibrium scenario can also include a change in interannual climate variability; see
Section 3.5.3). An example of where equilibrium climate change scenarios have been
used is provided in Section 3.6.1.
There are two distinct disadvantages of equilibrium scenarios, particularly those derived
from 2HCO2 experiments using GCMs. The first is that the equilibrium climate change
caused by CO2 doubling will probably not be realised for many decades (Kattenberg et
al., 1996). Indeed, under some emissions scenarios such doubling may be delayed until
the twenty-second century, or may never occur (Wigley et al., 1996). These scenarios
would only be realised well beyond the time horizon of most policy makers. The second
disadvantage is that it is unlikely that atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations will
ever remain at a level constant enough to enable an equilibrium climate to be reached.
Climate will always be adjusting to different forcing factors, and an equilibrium climate
will be the exception, not the norm. Indeed, if greenhouse gas emissions go unabated, it
is probable that atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases will eventually
substantially exceed 2HCO2 levels (Wigley et al., 1996).
3.5.1.2 Transient experiments
These two problems with equilibrium scenarios may be addressed by using results from
transient climate model experiments. Climate change scenarios derived from transient
experiments describe how climate may change over time. A transient scenario would
typically start with current (baseline) climate and estimate year-by-year changes in
climate for up to 100 years into the future. Again, observations in the baseline climate
Climate Change Scenarios
3-17
data set are perturbed by adding to them, or multiplying them by, changes in monthly or
annual temperature and precipitation derived from the transient GCM experiment.
Under transient scenarios, the climate is never assumed to be in equilibrium with
greenhouse gas concentrations, and the possible climate for each year through the
twenty-first century is described. Transient scenarios can therefore be used to examine
the potential effects of climate change over time and potential impacts within shorter
planning horizons.
Transient scenarios also have some disadvantages, however. If results are taken from a
“cold start” transient experiment (see Section 3.4.1), then it is not realistic to attach
specific calendar years to the model years because such experiments underestimate
climate change in the first decades of the experiment. Some adjustment technique is
necessary to make this conversion (see Section 3.5.1.3 for an example of such a tech-
nique). Also, it is harder to define the “true” greenhouse gas signal from a transient
climate change experiment than from an equilibrium experiment. This is because the
natural variability of climate is better simulated in a transient GCM, and this can
obscure the greenhouse gas signal for many decades (Santer et al., 1996; Mitchell et al.,
in press). Whether or not this is important for climate change scenario purposes
depends on whether it is desired that the scenario contain both natural variability and
greenhouse signal.
3.5.1.3 Attaching calendar years to GCM scenarios
An alternative approach to using the output from equilibrium or transient GCM expe-
riments directly in a climate change scenario involves using the results from experi-
ments performed with simple one-dimensional models, often called upwelling- diffusion
(UD) or simple climate models (SCMs). This approach involves three stages (Hulme et
al., 1995): defining the standardised pattern of change using a GCM experiment (i.e.,
regional changes in meteorological variables such as temperature and precipitation are
divided by the global warming of that model experiment yielding a ratio); defining the
magnitude of global warming from an SCM; and then scaling the pattern by this global
warming value. An example of this approach to scenario construction is described in
Section 3.6.3 and Box 3.1. The example shows how the scenario tool SCENGEN can
be used to create scenarios for the middle of the twenty-first century.
The advantage of this linked-model approach to scenario construction is its versatility.
Any range of emissions scenarios can be entered into the SCM to yield a range of
global warming projections over the next 100 years or so, thus satisfying Conditions 1
and 4. By selecting the required time horizon (e.g., 2050, or the average of the period
from 2030 to 2060), the transient global warming estimate or range of estimates can be
extracted. This global warming value is then used to scale the standardised pattern of
regional climate change that has been extracted from a GCM experiment (or number of
GCM experiments to satisfy Condition 4) to yield a derived transient scenario of
climate change for a given year or period. This scenario can then be added to the
UNEP/IVM Handbook
3-18
baseline climatology, ensuring that the global warming value has been calculated from
the correct baseline (e.g., 1951-1980 or 1961-1990).
Box 3.1
Using SCENGEN to construct climate change scenarios for
Estonia.
 SCENGEN was used to construct climate scenarios for Estonia for the UNEP country
vulnerability study. The SCENGEN CD-ROM was prepared by the Climatic Research Unit at
the University of East Anglia, United Kingdom, and requires a Pentium PC running Windows
95. The version of SCENGEN used contained results from a set of 14 GCMs and the one-
dimensional integrated simple climate model MAGICC, which consists of a carbon cycle and
other greenhouse gas modules, an UD climate module, and ice melt modules.
 Estonia is situated between 57030’N and 59040’N and between 21046’E and 28013’E. The 250
meridian divides the country into two nearly equal parts that fall into different 50 × 50 grid
boxes. Since the area of Estonia is only 45,215 square kilometres, climate change scenarios
were considered to be uniform over the whole country. They were obtained by averaging the
SCENGEN estimates of the two grid boxes. When necessary, linear interpolation was used for
spatial downscaling.
 For hydrological and agricultural modelling, knowledge of the annual cycle of meteorological
elements is essential, so all climate scenarios were constructed with a monthly resolution.
From the eight meteorological elements offered by SCENGEN, mean temperature and
precipitation changes were chosen. All changes were given for 2085-2115 (i.e., 2100) with
respect to 1961-1990. For some scenario users, shorter time horizons (e.g., with a resolution
of 10 years) were also made available.
 Once time horizons and spatial-temporal resolution are decided, SCENGEN offers the user
three choices: Which emissions scenario? Which MAGICC model parameters? Which GCMs?
The first two choices together determine the global warming projections. Although a variety of
emissions scenarios with some measures of environmental regulation are available, only three
IPCC scenarios were used: IS92c as a low emissions scenario, IS92a as a central scenario,
and IS92e as a high emissions scenario. MAGICC presents an uncertainty range for the
following parameters: CO2 emissions from land-use changes, indirect aerosol radiative
forcing, ocean upwelling rate, and climate sensitivity. By combining these ranges of input
parameters and the three emissions scenarios, a central estimate (2.1 K) and two extremes
(0.8 and 5.5 K) of global mean annual warming by 2100 with respect to 1961-1990 are
obtained. The extremes were rejected, however, and instead a minimum warming was
determined from a combination of low emissions (IS92c) and low climate sensitivity (1.5 K),
and maximum warming was determined using the high emissions scenario (IS92e) and the
high climate sensitivity (4.5 K). Other MAGICC parameters were kept at their default values,
although only constant aerosol forcing was allowed. These emissions and parameter choices
gave a range of global warming of 0.9 to 4.7 K by 2100, a range that meets Condition 1. This
range differs from the 1.5 to 4.5 K range for the climate sensitivity because CO2 doubling
occurs at different times for different emissions scenarios. MAGICC also gives a range of CO2
concentrations and sea-level rise estimates for these emissions and parameter choices and
these values were used directly in the regional climate change assessments.
The selection of the GCMs was made with the help of the histogram shown here and
considering the criteria for GCM selection discussed in Section 3.4.1. To construct the
histogram, the central global warming projection for 2050 was used (IS92a emissions and a
climate sensitivity of 2.5 K). As a result, two GCMs were selected: HADCM2, representing a
less warm and less wet scenario, and ECHAM3TR, representing a warmer and wetter scenario
for Estonia (Condition 4). The seasonal changes of mean temperature and precipitation in
Estonia by 2100 with respect to 1961-1990 are shown in the table.

 These scenarios show the climate of Estonia getting warmer and wetter. The warming is
greater than the global mean and strongest in winter and autumn. Little can be said about the
annual cycle of precipitation change, since there is little agreement between the seasonal
results of the two GCMs.
 It should be noted that this version of SCENGEN does not take into account the cooling effect
of aerosols on regional climate. The projections in the table are therefore probably
overestimated, since Estonia is situated in a region where anthropogenic aerosol emissions,
and hence climatic effects, are likely to be significant.
This approach makes one or two assumptions about the nature of greenhouse-gas-
induced climate signals. It assumes that the pattern of anthropogenic climate change can
be adequately defined from a 10- or 30-year period of a GCM experiment, whether
UNEP/IVM Handbook
3-20
equilibrium or transient; and it then assumes that this pattern remains constant over
time (i.e., the magnitude is scaled by the global warming but the pattern is constant).
This is an assumption that is difficult to test and may violate Condition 2. Furthermore,
many transient experiments have not displayed a consistent pattern in change variables
such as precipitation. The pattern of precipitation and temperature often changes over
the transient simulation. In some cases the sign of precipitation change may change over
the simulation. On the other hand, the assumption has formed the basis for recent
climate change fingerprint detection studies, which have yielded evidence that
anthropogenic forcing of climate can be detected in the observations (Santer et al.,
1996). These issues of changing patterns over time have been explored by Mitchell et
al. (in press).
3.5.2 Which GCMs to select?
Many climate change experiments have been performed using GCMs: between 25 and
35 equilibrium experiments and about 10 transient experiments (see Gates et al., 1992;
Kattenberg et al., 1996). If a GCM-based scenario is to be constructed, selecting which
GCMs to use from this population of experiments may be difficult. In some cases the
choice may be limited by which GCMs have archived their results in an accessible and
public form and whether the required climate variables are included. But, assuming that
the user is in a position to choose from this population, which GCMs should be chosen?
A number of criteria can be used to make this decision.
3.5.2.1 Vintage
Results from GCM climate change experiments performed as long ago as 1983 are still
in circulation. It may be argued that owing to developments in the science and
modelling of climate change, only the most recent experiments should be used. But this
is an arbitrary criterion to apply, and does not adequately reflect the nature and
development history of different climate models.
3.5.2.2 Resolution
As climate models have developed, there has been a general tendency toward increased
spatial resolution. Some of the early GCMs operated at a resolution of 800 kilometres,
whereas some of the more recent GCMs are now operating at about 300 kilometres.
Although higher resolution GCMs yield results that contain more spatial detail, they are
not necessarily always superior to the lower resolution versions. For example, in areas
of complex topography, such as mountainous areas like the Himalayas or the Andes, or
areas with large lakes, such as equatorial East Africa, even high resolution GCMs do
not adequately simulate regional climate patterns.
Climate Change Scenarios
3-21
3.5.2.3 Validity
A stronger argument than either vintage or resolution may be to select the GCM that
simulates the present climate of the study region most accurately, on the assumption
that this GCM would also yield a more accurate representation of future regional
climate. This approach has been used in a number of scenario construction exercises,
e.g., Benioff et al. (1996); Box 3.2 describes how the Ethiopian country studies team
selected GCMs for their assessment of climate change impacts based on how well the
models simulate current climate patterns over Ethiopia. Note that the Ethiopians also
used model resolution as a factor in their selection. The control climate of a number of
GCMs is compared with the observed baseline climate — means, climatic spatial
patterns, monthly variability — and the GCMs that are closest to reality are then used
to generate the scenario. One convenient measure of similarity between two climates
(e.g., a model and an observed climate) is the spatial pattern correlation coefficient.
This provides an objective measure of how well a GCM can reproduce the regional or
global observed pattern of climate (e.g., Smith and Pitts, 1997). Note, however, that
this criterion does not guarantee that the GCMs selected will yield the most reliable
results.
3.5.2.4 Representativeness of results
A further criterion that can be used when selecting GCMs is to consider the represen-
tativeness of each GCM’s results. Thus, for example, if three GCMs are to be selected
for a scenario construction exercise, one might choose a GCM that gives a magnitude
of change fairly typical of the population of GCM experiments, together with GCMs
that give results at the low and high end of the range of results (Box 3.1 describes how
the Estonian country studies team used SCENGEN to develop a range of climate
change scenarios). This may be particularly relevant when examining precipitation
changes, since the climate change patterns of this variable show the greatest differences
from model to model. Thus, a GCM that shows a drying pattern over the region,
together with ones that show little change and a wetting pattern, may be chosen delib-
erately to meet Condition 4. This combination of GCMs can be used even though the
selected GCMs may not necessarily be the “best” models. This approach to choosing
GCMs was adopted in the regional impacts assessment for southern Africa (Hulme et
al., 1996). Here, the “core” scenario was based on the GCM that, out of the sample of
11 GCMs examined, correlated best with the observed climate (i.e., using the validity
criterion), and two other GCMs were chosen to capture the extreme range of regional
precipitation changes simulated by the 11 experiments (i.e., using the representativeness
criterion).

Box 3.2  Climate change scenarios for Ethiopia.
 Ethiopia participated in the U.S. Country Studies Program (Dixon et al., 1996) and conducted
a study on vulnerability and adaptation of agriculture, water resources, and forests. Five GCM
models were examined for use in the study: Canadian Climate Centre Model (CCCM; Boer et al.,
1992); Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory R-30 model (GFDL-R30; Wetherald and Manabe,
1988); Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory’s transient model (GFDL-transient; Stouffer et al.,
1989); United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UK89; Mitchell et al., 1989); and Goddard
Institute for Space Since (GISS; Hansen et al., 1983). The baseline climate was developed
using 1961-1990 climate data. The climate variability study used computing averages,
standard deviation, moving averages and identification of dry and wet years for rainfall, and
averages and moving averages for temperature.
 Evaluating and Creating the GCM Scenarios
 GCM output was evaluated on a seasonal basis. The 1961-1990 climatological data from
selected stations were organised to develop climatological maps in compatible units of
measurement. For example, a rainfall baseline map was prepared in mm/day. The evaluation
involved comparison of the current model simulation with the observations to test performances.
GCM outputs provided by the NCAR were analysed in a 0-20EN and 30-50EE window. Models that
better reflect the observed climate were then selected by adopting the following criteria.
 Comparison of results of current simulation with average climate (temperature and rainfall). Grads
software (Doty, 1992) was used to produce 1xCO2 GCM output maps for the region being
studied. Observed data and 1xCO2 outputs from the GCMs were compared based on the
location, the magnitude (how significantly the GCM under or overestimates climate), and the
numbers of maxima and minima. The gradient and how accurately the model simulates the
marginal areas (the boundary between the lowlands and the highlands) were also examined.
 Model resolution. Most models have low resolution, do not parameterise the physiographic nature of
different places well, and use a generalised topography. Since Ethiopia has different types of terrain,
the low resolution models give exaggerated estimates.
 Trend match. In addition, validation was done on a station-by-station basis. Interpolated GCM
outputs were used for selected stations. GCM outputs were compared to actual climate data.
Trends and the trend match between the two results were studied (see figure).
 Validation assessment was done for Kiremt (June-September), Belg (February-May), and Bega
(October-January) on a seasonal basis.
 General Observations:
• 
All models simulated only one rainfall maximum for the country whereas the actual shows three
to four high rainfall pocket area.
• 
None of the models could discriminate between the lowlands and the adjoining highlands. This
may be because of the inherent problem of the models using smoothed topography.
• 
All models were weak in identifying the high rainfall zone in the eastern highlands and
overestimated the rainfall of the northern Rift Valley.
• 
All models overestimated the rainfall over the north-western and south-eastern lowlands,
particularly for the Belg season.
• 
Most models could not discriminate the temperature gradient between the lowlands and the
adjoining highlands.

Conclusions
One transient and two equilibrium GCM models that best simulate the mean climate were selected:
CCCM, GFDL-1989, and GFDL-transient. UK89 and GISS were not used.
In developing scenarios, the Gridpti program (developed by NCAR; interpolates between the
four nearest grid points in a GCM to develop an estimate for a specific location, and grid
points are weighted based on the inverse of distance) was used to extract temperature
differences and rainfall ratios from the GCMs selected for all stations. Equilibrium GCM
scenarios were then prepared by combining the difference between 2xCO2 and 1xCO2 and
observed data for temperature, and by combining the ratios of 2xCO2 to 1xCO2 and observed
data for rainfall. Transient GCM scenarios were also developed by combining the decadal
differences with the observed data for both rainfall and temperature. Synthetic (incremental)

scenarios were developed by assuming 2EC and 4EC increases to the observed mean for
temperature and by adding -20, -10, 0, +10, and +20 percent changes to the observed mean
for rainfall.
3.5.3 Changes in mean versus changes in variability
Most studies of potential climate change impacts have assumed changes in average
climate conditions, but not in climate variability. These scenarios assume that only
average annual or average monthly variables, such as temperature and precipitation,
change. Each day within a month or year is assumed to have the same absolute change
in temperature and the same percentage change in precipitation. Thus, the pattern of
daily climate and the interannual variability of climate stays approximately the same.
These scenarios are commonly used for two main reasons. First, there is uncertainty
about how climate change will affect the temporal variability of climate. Perhaps the
biggest source of interannual climate variability in the tropics and elsewhere is the El
NiZo/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. It is still unclear whether ENSO
events will change character in response to climate change (e.g., see Trenberth and
Hoar, 1996). Elsewhere, there are some advances in the scientific understanding about
changes in climate variability (see Kattenberg et al., 1996). Second, changes in average
climate only are used in a scenario since they are relatively easy to apply (e.g., Benioff
et al., 1996). The average temperature change for a particular month is added to all the
observed temperatures in that month in the climate baseline, and the change in
precipitation (e.g., 1.1 for a 10 percent increase) is multiplied by the days with observed
precipitation.
Although hard to specify, it is most likely that climate variability will change as a
response to greenhouse gas forcing. For example, Whetton et al. (1993) examined a
number of GCM experiments and found that precipitation intensity and flooding
increased over most of Australia; Hulme et al. (1996), in their scenario for southern
Africa, included changes in interannual rainfall variability. Changes in climate varia-
bility can have a more dramatic effect on many agriculture and water resource systems
than changes in the mean alone. Mearns et al. (1996), for example, found that wheat
yields in the Great Plains of the United States are very sensitive to changes in interdaily
temperature and precipitation variability. Ideally, therefore, climate change impacts
studies should consider changes in both interannual and interdaily variability.
One way in which changes in daily climate variability can be incorporated into a
scenario is through the use of a weather generator (e.g., Wilks, 1992). A weather
generator is calibrated on the baseline climate data. The parameters of the generator,
including the variability parameter, are then altered in a way that is consistent with the
climate scenario, whether it is derived from GCMs or from analogue or synthetic
sources. Using the new, altered, parameters, a new sequence of daily scenario weather
is created in which the daily variability of climate is now changed. This approach has
been followed in a number of studies, including Semenov and Barrow (1997) in their
assessment of climate change impacts on European agriculture. Weather generators
Climate Change Scenarios
3-25
require large historical daily weather data sets, which may be difficult to acquire, and
constructing scenarios using them can be quite time consuming.
One aspect of climate variability that weather generators cannot yet capture is changes
in the interannual or interdecadal variability of climate. These low frequency aspects of
climate are not well simulated by stochastic generators, and therefore changes in these
frequencies are difficult to incorporate into climate scenarios. Mearns et al. (1992)
examined the effect of changes in monthly variability on crop yields in Kansas. They
modified interannual variability of a historical record (1951- 1980) of monthly
temperature and precipitation and developed a monthly time series with double,
quadruple, one-half, and one-quarter the observed interannual variance. Daily changes
in precipitation were adjusted to be consistent with the monthly changes.
3.5.4 Spatial variability
There are a number of options for manipulating the spatial variability of a climate
change scenario. Some scenarios contain only a uniform change in climate over an area.
For example, Mendelsohn and Neumann (in press) used a synthetic scenario and
assumed a uniform change in temperature and precipitation over the United States.
Other studies use the regional changes in climate defined by GCM grid boxes, each of
which may be between 250 and 600 kilometres. Because of the lack of precision about
regional climates in a GCM, Von Storch et al. (1993) advocate that in general the
minimum effective spatial resolution should be defined by at least four GCM grid
boxes. The skill of GCM simulations for an individual grid box will depend, however,
on the spatial autocorrelation of the particular weather variable. Smith and Tirpak
(1989) assumed uniform changes within each GCM grid box, whereas Smith et al.
(1992) interpolated between the four nearest GCM grid points down to 0.5E latitude/
longitude (about 50 kilometres) pixels. This latter technique is the simplest form of
downscaling from a GCM resolution to the sort of spatial resolution more commonly
used in impacts studies.10

More sophisticated downscaling techniques calculate subgrid box scale changes in
climate as a function of larger-scale climate or circulation statistics. The two main
approaches to downscaling have used either regression relationships between large- area
and site-specific climates (e.g., Wigley et al., 1990) or relationships between
atmospheric circulation types and local weather (e.g., Von Storch et al., 1993). When
applied to daily GCM data, these techniques offer the prospect of generating daily
climate change scenarios for specific sites or catchments and therefore meet Condition 3
for a climate change scenario. The disadvantage of downscaling approaches is that they
require large amounts of observed data to calibrate the statistical relationships and can
be computationally very intensive. Such methods are also very time consuming since
unique relationships need to be derived for each site or region. Downscaling methods
are also based on the fundamental assumption that the observed statistical relationships
will continue to be valid in the future under conditions of climate change. This
assumption may violate Condition 2 for a climate change scenario.
3.5.4.2 Regional models
Downscaling techniques are statistical methods for generating greater spatial variability
in a climate change scenario. An alternative approach involves the use of high
resolution regional climate models (RCMs; also called limited area models, LAMs).
Regional climate models are typically constructed at a much finer resolution than
GCMs (often 50 kilometres), but their domain is limited to continents or subcontinents.
Although RCMs yield greater spatial detail about climate, they are still constrained at
their boundaries by the coarse-scale output from GCMs. To an extent, therefore, the
performance of an RCM can only be as good as that of the driving GCM. A number of
RCM climate change experiments have now been performed over North America (e.g.,
Giorgi et al., 1994; Mearns et al., 1997), Europe (e.g., Jones et al., 1995), Australia
(Walsh and McGregor, 1997), and parts of Asia (e.g., India; Bhaskaran et al., 1996),
but their performance in relation to downscaling techniques has not yet been fully
evaluated. The costs of establishing a regional climate model for a new region and
running a climate change experiment are extremely high, both computationally and in
terms of human resources. For the moment, it remains premature for regional model
output to be used extensively in climate impacts assessments, at least for most regions.
3.5.5 Simulations of greenhouse gas forcing alone and in
combination with other factors
Until the last few years, GCMs did not consider the regional effects of sulphate aerosols
in their simulations of future climate. They modelled only the effect of increased
greenhouse gas concentrations on global and regional climate. It has now become
evident that aerosols from fossil fuel consumption and from biomass burning can have a

significant cooling effect in some regions of the world (Charlson et al., 1992; Taylor
and Penner, 1994).
A small number of climate change experiments have attempted to simulate the com-
bined effect of greenhouse gas increases and aerosol changes on global climate. For
example, Mitchell and Johns (1997) found that some regional climate changes, both
temperature and precipitation, are considerably different when aerosol effects are
included. This is an important new development in our understanding of climate change,
but the full implications of this for climate change scenario construction have not yet
been worked through.
Model experiments that incorporate other significant forcing factors such as aerosols
are likely to yield more plausible scenarios of climate change. Model development is
likely to lead to further refinements in the simulation of future climate change, such as
including the effects on climate of stratospheric ozone depletion or by treating each
greenhouse gas separately rather than as CO2 equivalents, which has been the case until
now. The first such GCM experiments will be completed during 1998.
3.5.6 Consistency in scenarios of CO2 concentrations,
change in climate, and sea level rise
One of the conditions for selecting a climate change scenario is that it be internally
consistent. This concerns not only the relationships between climate variables, but also
the relationships between other important scenario variables such as sea level rise and
atmospheric CO2 concentration. Ideally, a climate change scenario should also include
estimates of changes in these two variables since they are likely to have important
environmental impacts (e.g., on coastal regions and on vegetation).
Atmospheric CO2 concentration is one of the drivers of climate change. A climate
change scenario will therefore have assumed, either implicitly or explicitly, a CO2
concentration. Synthetic scenarios of CO2 concentration can be created (e.g., 600
ppmv), but it can be difficult to make the CO2 concentration consistent with the syn-
thetic climate and sea level changes. If a GCM-based scenario is being used, there is
usually an explicit assumption of the CO2 concentration. For example, in an equilibrium
experiment, the CO2 concentration usually doubles from, say, 300 ppmv to 600 ppmv,
or in a transient experiment, the concentration may increase by 1 percent per year. In
GCM experiments, however, these are strictly speaking equivalent-CO2 concentrations
(i.e., the combined forcing effect of all greenhouse gases); the actual CO2 concentration
will be less than that stated. Many studies make the mistake of assuming that actual
doubling of CO2 concentrations and (equivalent) doubled CO2 climate are the same.
Since sea level rise is predominantly a result of global warming, the scenario of sea
level rise should be consistent with the scenario of global climate change. Warrick et al.
(1996) predicts that eustatic sea level (i.e., without considering subsidence or uplift of
regional shorelines) will rise by between 15 and 95 cm by 2100. This range of values is
based on the same greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions scenarios used by the IPCC to
UNEP/IVM Handbook
3-28
estimate changes in global average temperatures (Warrick et al., 1996). Impacts
researchers should be careful to ensure that scenarios of sea level rise are consistent
with their scenarios of climate change.
One way of ensuring such consistency between CO2 concentration, climate change, and
sea level rise in a scenario is to use a simple integrated climate model (Hulme et al.,
1995). This type of model, widely used by the IPCC (IPCC, 1997), typically comprises
a UD climate model (see Section 3.5.1.3) together with a carbon cycle model and ice
melt models. Such a model allows an emissions scenario to be defined by the user and
then calculates, using reduced-form physical models of the climate system, the resulting
CO2 concentration, global warming, and global sea level rise for each year from 1990
to 2100. These estimates are fully consistent with each other and can subsequently form
the basis for a GCM-based scenario. An example of this approach to scenario
construction is described in Section 3.6.3 and Box 3.1. Alternatively, one could base the
CO2 concentrations, climate change, and sea level rise scenarios on a single integrated
source such as Houghton et al. (1996).
3.6 Example approaches to scenario construction
In this section we summarise the approach taken to climate change scenario construc-
tion by three high profile impacts research activities, the U.S. Country Studies Pro-
gram, Working Group II of the IPCC, and the various international impacts studies in
which the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia have been involved.
3.6.1 US Country Studies Program
The US Country Studies Program (USCSP) provided financial and technical assistance
to 55 countries studying greenhouse gas emissions, mitigation of greenhouse gases, and
impacts and adaptation to climate change (Benioff et al., 1996). The USCSP suggested
specific approaches for assessing impacts and adaptation. For the use of GCMs in
constructing climate change scenarios, the following steps were suggested (Box 3.2;
Smith and Pitts, 1997):
• 
obtain the 1HCO2 results from the sample of GCM experiments held at the National
Center for Atmospheric Research (e-mail address: datahelp@ucar.edu; home page
address: http://www.scd.ucar.edu/dss/);
• 
compare the GCM results with the observed regional climate;
• 
select the three (or more) GCMs that best reproduce observed climate;
• 
define the regional patterns of change from these GCM experiments as the
difference or ratio between the 2HCO2 and 1HCO2 simulations;
Climate Change Scenarios
3-29
• 
combine these changes with a 30-year baseline climate data set (1951-1980 or
1961-1990);
• 
follow a simple interpolation procedure (based on the inverse of distance) to
downscale the GCM results to individual sites using results from up to four GCM
grid boxes.
 Synthetic scenarios were also recommended to complement the GCM scenarios. The
suggested synthetic scenarios combined changes in mean temperature of 2EC, 4EC, and
6EC with changes in precipitation of "10 percent, "20 percent, and no change. Thus,
up to 15 synthetic scenarios could be applied to the baseline climate data set.
 These USCSP scenario recommendations adequately addressed Condition 2 (the GCM
scenarios were physically consistent); Condition 3 (GCM outputs for temperature,
precipitation, and solar radiation were provided, and combining the outputs with the
baseline climate data provided high spatial and temporal resolution sufficient for
impacts models); and Condition 4 (three GCMs captured part of the range of potential
changes and the synthetic scenarios captured the rest). The recommendations also
suggested that particular applications might require the use of weather generators or
more sophisticated downscaling methods. Most of the GCM scenarios were equilibrium
(2HCO2) scenarios, and under some emissions scenarios would not be realised during
the twenty-first century. Some of the GCMs provided information that is consistent
with Condition 1. In some regions (e.g., low latitude), some of the synthetic scenarios
(e.g., high temperature changes) may violate Condition 1.
3.6.2 IPCC Working Group II
 As part of the IPCC Second Scientific Assessment in 1995, the Technical Services Unit
of IPCC Working Group II commissioned a set of climate change scenarios for use by
the 31 Working Group II writing teams. The purpose of these scenarios was to provide
a common set of climate data to be used by these authors in their assessment of climate
change impacts (Greco et al., 1994).11
 The scenarios were GCM-based and made use of results from three transient GCM
experiments: those performed at Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) in
Princeton, New Jersey, USA; the Max Plank Institute (MPI) in Hamburg, Germany;
and the Hadley Centre at the UK Meteorological Office (UKMO). The baseline period
chosen was 1961-1990, and global maps of mean temperature and precipitation for this
period were generated. Two time horizons were chosen for the scenarios: 2020 and
                                                  
11 For the Third Assessment Report of the IPCC, due in 2001, a climate scenario and related
information data centre has been established to provide a common set of scenario
information for impacts assessors. This Data Distribution Centre (DDC) is based jointly at
UEA, Norwich, UK and at DKRZ, Hamburg, Germany. A web site with full information
can be found at http://ipcc-ddc.cru.uea.ac.uk/.

2050. To overcome the “cold-start” problem of the GCM experiments and because the
transient GCM experiments used different forcing scenarios, the GCM results were
related to 2020 and 2050 in the following way. A simple UD climate model was used to
simulate global warming from 1990 to 2100 assuming the IS92a emissions scenario
(Leggett et al., 1992). This yielded global warmings of 0.53EC and 1.16EC by 2020
and 2050, respectively. The GCM results were then searched to find the decades in
which these increments of global warming occurred in each experiment, and the three
GCM patterns of climate change for these respective decades were extracted.
 The WG II scenarios were consistent with the broad range of IPCC global warming
projections and the patterns of change were physically consistent, being derived from
GCMs (Conditions 1 and 2 were met). No downscaling techniques or weather genera-
tors were applied to the scenarios; the results were presented at the original GCM
resolution. Only changes in mean temperature and precipitation were extracted, and no
variability changes were defined, only changes in mean climate. Condition 3 was not
therefore satisfactorily addressed. For this reason the scenario may be regarded as only
an “entry-level” scenario. By selecting patterns from three different GCM experiments,
some attention was paid to Condition 4, but the range of the WG II scenario changes
probably did not reflect the full potential range of regional changes.
3.6.3 Scaling: A scenario generator from the Climatic
Research Unit and COSMIC
 The Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia has developed a climate
change scenario generator that runs on a desktop PC. This approach to scenario con-
struction has been used in a large number of impacts assessments around the world.
The software tool is called SCENGEN and is briefly summarised here (see also Hulme
et al., 1995; SCENGEN).
 SCENGEN allows users to generate global and regional scenarios of climate change
based on GCM results of their own choosing. Options exist to select scenarios based
either on single GCMs or on groups of GCMs,12 and the scenarios may be presented
simply as change fields for a given global warming or given period, or added to a
baseline climatology. As a stand-alone module, SCENGEN is driven by built-in global
warming projections derived from two greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. SCENGEN
has been designed, however, to be used in conjunction with a UD climate model that
contains a full set of climate and sea level models. SCENGEN therefore also generates
estimates of future CO2 concentration and sea level rise. When linked in this way,
SCENGEN offers the user complete flexibility about the choice of emissions scenario, a
                                                  
12 Combining GCMs averages the regional results of more than one model. It is not
necessarily clear that an average of several GCMs is more reliable than a single GCM. An
argument can be made that averaging GCMs voids the internal consistency within
individual models (Condition 2). Note that SCENGEN does not advocate averaging of
GCMs.
Climate Change Scenarios
3-31
range of global warming projections, and a choice about the origin of the global or
regional climate change scenario generated. See Box 3.1 for an example of such a
scenario developed for Estonia.
 SCENGEN displays scenarios at two spatial scales: a global resolution of 5E latitude/
longitude and, for a series of predefined regional windows, 0.5E latitude/longitude
resolution. At the global scale, change fields of mean monthly, seasonal, and annual
precipitation, mean surface air temperature, and mean cloudiness can be displayed at a
5E latitude/longitude resolution. These change fields can be superimposed onto a global
baseline climatology to generate “actual” climatologies for future periods. Scenarios for
the four regional windows are generated at a 0.5E latitude/longitude resolution using
new 1961-1990 baseline climatologies constructed specifically for SCENGEN. Options
are identical to those for the global scenarios above, except that a wider range of
climate variables can be selected.
 SCENGEN meets Conditions 1, 2, and 4 of the climate change scenario construction
conditions, but only partially meets Condition 3. It is not clear, however, whether
regional climate variables will change in constant proportion with average global
changes in temperature. This approach can also be described as providing only
entry-level scenarios. The use of downscaling techniques and weather generators would
make SCENGEN more useful for many impact analyses.
 In addition, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the Electric Power
Research Institute developed a scenario generator that runs on a desk top PC, called the
Country Specific Model for Intertemporal Climate (COSMIC). It allows the user to
choose between 7 sulphate emissions scenarios, 10 greenhouse gas stabilisation
scenarios (based on the IPCC (Schimel et al., 1996) and the “WRE” stabilisation
scenarios (Wigley et al., 1996), outputs from 14 GCM models. The model uses a
energy-balance-climate/upwelling-diffusion-ocean model to calculate changes in mean
global temperature and sea level on an annual basis out to 2200. COSMIC scales the
GCM outputs to 0.5o cells and averages the changes in each 0.5° cell for each of 158
countries (Williams et al., in press). The scaling of the GCMs is done in the same
fashion as SCENGEN, although COSMIC scales the difference in precipitation rather
than the ratio (Larry Williams, EPRI, personal communication, 1998). Results for
changes in temperature and precipitation are given for each month in up to the year
requested by the user.
3.7  Conclusions
 Table 3.3 summarises the options for creating climate change scenarios, and sources of
GCM data, observed data, and climate models are given in Table 3.4. The options
range from the rather simple one of using synthetic scenarios to more complicated ones
of using analogue data or climate models. The choice should depend not only on the
resources that are available, but also on how quickly impacts researchers need the
scenarios. Whatever is done, the researchers selecting the scenarios should be sure to
UNEP/IVM Handbook
3-32
choose a set of plausible scenarios that reflect the range of potential climate change
consistent with increased greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere and give the
climate data necessary to carry out the impacts assessments.
 The art of creating climate change scenarios is an evolving one. With improvements in
GCMs and new techniques such as downscaling, RCMs, COSMIC, and SCENGEN,
more sophisticated scenarios can be created. Nonetheless, there is fundamental
uncertainty about regional climate change. The magnitudes and even direction of
change of many important meteorological variables are uncertain. And there is even
greater uncertainty about changes in variability and extreme events — changes that
may be critical for climate impacts assessment. Users of this handbook should always
remember that climate change scenarios do not yield predictions of the future, they only
help us to understand the potential implications of climate change and the vulnerability
of human and natural systems to this change.

4.1 What is integrated assessment of climate
change impacts?
Existing studies of the impact of climate change typically look at a certain system in a
certain place in isolation from other systems and other places. This handbook addresses
a different approach. It tries to include the interactions between the diversity of impacts
of climate change, and to place these impacts in the context of other changes. This
approach is known as integrated assessment (IA), and the associated models are known
as integrated assessment models (IAMs). This chapter provides guidance on conducting
an integrated assessment of the impacts of climate change and adaptation to climate
change.
Unlinked parallel studies may generate important information on the impacts of climate
change. However, such studies may well lead to inconsistencies. For example, water is
used by nature, agriculture, industry, and households. A study of the impact of climate
change on agriculture alone, keeping the water usage of other sectors constant, may
thus overestimate the supply of irrigation water. Land is another resource shared by

many sectors and systems. Further interactions can take place through national and
international markets for commodities and capital. Changes in crop yields can be
mitigated or exacerbated, depending on changes in market prices determined by yields
elsewhere and yields of competing crops. An integrated impact study analyses the key
interactions within and between sectors of a particular exposure unit, and between this
unit and the outside world. One aim of an integrated impact study is to generate a
comprehensive assessment of the totality of impacts, which is greater than the sum of
the separate sectoral impacts.
A second purpose of integrated impact research is to enable researchers to place climate
change impacts in a broader context such as natural resource management,
sustainability of ecosystems, or economic development, and to consider the associated
broader questions. Chapter 2, on socio-economic scenarios, provides a broad palette of
examples of how changes in population, economy, technology, et cetera, would affect
vulnerability to climate change. Similarly, Chapter 5 provides ample cases in which
adaptation to climate change interacts with other aims and strategies of decision makers
at all levels, from local farmers to national governments.
IA is more ambitious than separate sectoral studies, and consequently is more difficult
to achieve. One reason is that additional demands are placed on component studies.
Another reason is insufficient knowledge of interactions. A third reason is that IA is at
least multi-disciplinary but in most cases interdisciplinary. Furthermore, IA almost
always requires co-operation, and often between types of people who are not used to co-
operating with one another. These difficulties grow faster than the ambitions of the IA.
Whilst ensuring consistency in water use between agricultural and industrial impact
studies is relatively easy (although seldom done in practice), a study of the impact of
climate change on an entire river basin in the context of overall development is a major
task.
The next section briefly reviews current practices in integrated assessment, highlighting
crucial elements of IA. Possible approaches to IA for climate change impact and
adaptation research are presented, and past applications of IA to climate change impact
research are discussed.
4.2  Current practice in integrated assessment
Many researchers practice forms of integrated assessment of climate change, using
various modelling and non-modelling approaches (see Weyant et al., 1996; Rotmans
and Dowlatabadi, 1998; Tol and Vellinga, forthcoming). Some researchers study the
practice of IA (Parson, 1995, 1996, 1997; Shackley and Wynne, 1995; Toth, 1995). So
far, no single best method has been found, if there is any. Pragmatic approaches based
on common sense dominate the field. This chapter is therefore not a cookbook with
proven recipes, but a guide with ingredients and considerations to conduct an integrated
assessment of the impacts of climate change and the possibilities of adaptation.
Integration
4-3
Linkages between climate-sensitive issues (e.g., water management, agriculture, for-
estry, fish and wildlife, infrastructure planning, and economic development) are com-
plex, so there is a need for multi-disciplinary collaboration in a holistic and pragmatic
manner that focuses on issues, not analytical tools. It is not an easy task, however,
because of scientific uncertainties and the inherent difficulty of accurately describing
the various complexities behind any decision made by governments and other actors.
There is an opportunity, however, to develop and communicate a broader appreciation
of how climate change could affect a place or a sector.
Most of what is known as integrated assessment (modelling) is about trying to find a
proper trade-off between the impacts of climate change and the impacts of greenhouse
gas emission abatement. This is a different subject than what this chapter and this
handbook are about.
Some integrated assessments pay considerable attention to the impacts of climate
change (Edmonds et al., 1993, 1994; Alcamo, 1994; Jacoby and Zang, 1994; Rotmans
et al., 1994; Downing et al., 1995, 1996; Tol, 1996, 1997; Jacoby et al., 1997; Morita
et al., 1997; see Tol and Fankhauser, forthcoming, for an overview). These studies are
typically global. They often lack detail at regional and country levels. Models are not
validated against national data.3 For application to country studies, results of these
models should therefore be interpreted with great care. Methodologies are not readily
applied either. Each of the above studies required a continuous effort measured in
years, with funding that is a multiple of a typical budget for an entire country study.
More use for national studies can be found in the results of existing sectoral IAMs --
again, trying to “replicate” this for other sectors would require a major investment in
time and money. In sectoral IAMs, all interactions within a particular sector are
represented in a model. This method has been applied to agriculture (Kane et al., 1992;
Reilly et al., 1994; Rosenzweig and Parry, 1994; Darwin et al., 1995) and timber
(Perez-Garcia et al., 1995), while an effort at the University of Kassel, Germany, is
under way for water resources (J. Alcamo, Center for Environmental Systems Re-
search, University of Kassel, personal communication, 1997). For agriculture and
timber, models of agricultural productivity were coupled to models of national and
international trade, together driven by scenarios for climate, population, technology,
and economy. These studies provide some insights into national impacts. However, the
outcomes of these models can be used to provide an international context to a national
study. For instance, results of the Basic Linked System (BLS), the model used by
Rosenzweig and Parry (1994), can be used as “boundary conditions” to a model of the
national food market (e.g., world market prices, demand and supply on import and
export markets). This was done for England and Wales by Parry et al. (1996), for
Egypt by Strzepek et al. (1994, 1995, 1996; Yates and Strzepek, 1996), and for India
by Kumar and Parikh (1997).

The one exception is the Asian-Pacific Integrated Model, or AIM (Morita et al., 1997),
which is described in Section 4.4.5.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
4-4
IAMs can also be developed for a particular region. An example is the work by Parry et
al. (1996). It looks at changes in land use patterns in England and Wales. Alternative
applications compete for land. Each is differently affected by climatic change. Parry et
al. use simple rules to determine the trade-offs. Changing land use patterns emerge.
Another example is the work by Strzepek et al. (1994, 1996; Yates and Strzepek,
1996). The flow of the Nile is used as the all-important integrator of natural and human
systems in Egypt (see Section 4.4.2).
Integrated approaches are not restricted to building and applying integrated models. IA
represents an attempt to evaluate impacts, costs, benefits, and response options for a
sector or place. The latter context should be of particular importance for country
studies. An IA of a place (e.g., a country) could consistently bring together information
on all climate sensitive activities, enabling the analysts to examine possible indirect
effects of climate change. This would indicate the total effect of a scenario on the
country.
For example, the MINK study (Crosson and Rosenberg, 1993; Rosenberg, 1993) looks
at the implications of the drought in the 1930s in the US Corn Belt as a historical
analogue to climate change. This study combines models with historical reviews, adding
ambiguities and depth to a model-only study (see Section 4.4.1). The Mackenzie Basin
Impact Study (MBIS) from Northwest Canada (Cohen, 1997a,b,c) similarly combines
common analogue and GCM-based scenarios with sectoral and integrated models,
interviews, and workshops, the latter to capture in particular human adaptation and
characteristics of subsistence hunting and gathering (see Section 4.4.3).
4.3 Possible approaches to integrated impact
assessment
Integrated assessment can be done at different levels of ambition. At the very least, IA
should be based on consistent data bases and scenarios (Section 4.3.2). A slightly more
ambitious IA would seek to avoid overlap and would try to establish consistency
between the analyses of the various sectors, systems, and regions affected by climate
change (Section 4.3.3). At the third level of ambition, models are linked so that im-
portant feedbacks are taken into consideration (Section 4.3.4). Before starting an IA at
whichever level of ambition, a considerable amount of preparatory work needs to be
done (Section 4.3.1). Integrated assessment is more than consistency between impact
studies, at whichever level of ambition. It also involves outreach to and inputs from
people affected by climate change. The role stakeholders can and need to play is dis-
cussed in Section 4.3.5. Figure 4.1 illustrates the various elements of and options for an
integrated assessment of the impacts of climate change.

4.3.1 Preparatory stages
A number of preparatory steps need to be taken before the actual integrated study can
commence: define the study area, issues, and aims; establish the integration core team
and the integrators; and find out what has been done to date. The steps need not be
taken in this order. The best way perhaps is to iterate two or three times, letting the
literature review refine the issues and aims.

4.3.1.1 Literature review
Integration exercises require information from the sectoral assessments, and are
intended to address the indirect implications of climate change. These data requirements
are best articulated early in the research design phase of the country study. Therefore, it
is important to find out what has been done so far in climate impact research in the
country. An integrated assessment would best try to build on the findings of earlier
impact research, and attempt to draw on the acquired expertise. If little impact research
has been conducted, it would be advisable to conduct sectoral studies, and place these in
an integrative framework right from the start.
UNEP/IVM Handbook

4.3.1.2 Issue focus
In a climate impact assessment, the problems of interest are climate-sensitive aspects of
ecosystems, resource management, resource extraction operations, or infrastructure
maintenance. It is helpful to make the issues clear to the IA’s participants, so that they
know what questions they are trying to address. One aim of an IA may be to ensure that
climate change is taken into consideration in areas in which policy is normally made or
has been made for some time without considering climate change as a factor. These
could include the implications of climate change for interjurisdictional water
management; sustainability of lifestyles; sustainability of ecosystems; economic
development (primarily resource-based sectors such as energy, agriculture, forestry,
tourism, fisheries); land use allocation/zoning; and maintenance of transportation
facilities and networks. If specific regional or national targets are identified for the IA,
then it is better done as early as possible, so that more time is available to tailor the
study to this aim. An IA may also more modestly aim at acquiring a coherent
understanding of the impact of climate change, including the interactions between the
various sectors and systems.
4.3.1.3 Study area
The choice of boundaries may depend on the choice of policy targets. For a country
study, the choice of boundary is already defined (although, say, international com-
modity markets or internationally shared water resources may also be of interest).
Defining units within the country (e.g., grids, cells) is another matter, and there are
several options. It is usually easier to divide a country by administrative units or
collections of units because of availability of economic data (e.g., counties, states/
provinces, planning regions), and because decision making power is vested in such
units. There are also advantages to selecting ecological zones (e.g., forest, grassland,
coastal zone) or watersheds. The latter are particularly well suited as integrators of
various environmental and resource issues (e.g., navigation, water supply, hydroelectric
power production, freshwater habitat, tourism), and often include interjurisdictional
concerns which may be a source of conflict between neighbouring jurisdictions. It may
be more appropriate to select watersheds rather than administrative units if water
management is identified as a policy target for the IA. Of course, the roles of different
administrative units in the watershed should then be part of the study. The design of the
study would have to be adapted to these non-administrative boundaries (e.g., using data
for census divisions instead of states/provinces to construct an economic model).
4.3.1.4 Integration targets
Three levels of ambition are mentioned above: consistent scenarios and data bases,
consistent sectoral studies, and integration, including feedbacks. In addition, an IA may
want to place the impacts of climate change in a broader context, for instance, by
involving the relevant stakeholders in the analysis. Obviously, the goal determines the
Integration
4-7
approach and the resources required for success, although available resources may
constrain both goal and approach.
It is advisable to work from the more modest goals to the more ambitious ones. First,
this allows for experience and capacity to be built up before addressing the more
difficult task of integrated assessment. Second, should things develop less well than
planned (e.g., available funds are less than anticipated, or difficulties arise in the
conduct of the analysis), at least some goals will have been achieved. However, when
starting modestly, the ambitious end-goal should always be borne in mind, so that
pragmatic choices in the short term do not preclude the achievement of larger, long-term
goals.
4.3.1.5 Integration core team
A project leader should be able to maintain a sufficiently long-term commitment to the
IA. The project leader will be able to manage better if he or she has experience in
climate impacts or environmental impacts research, or is familiar with regional issues
which may be sensitive to climate. Alternatively, a team of leaders can be established.
Leadership is important, because co-ordination is needed between people who are not
used to working together, and do not necessarily want to work together. The integration
core team will need to do more than just keeping people together. Much common
groundwork is needed, with regard to data, scenarios, software, and so on.
4.3.1.6 Integrators
It is often useful to define one or more integrators. An integrator is a system or resource
that acts as an organising or binding principle in an integrated analysis. Good
integrators connect to a substantial number of other sectors and systems, and are of
prominent interest in their own right. Examples are the tourist sector on a tropical
island, or a river in a watershed. The tourist sector is often a major income earner, and
changes in sea level, hurricane incidence or intensity, water resources, and local agri-
culture would each affect the profitability of the sector. A river connects natural and
managed ecosystems, industry, and households in their use of water and their use of the
river as a discharge channel of various substances. The idea is to establish a “family” of
integrators in which various approaches become research targets (Section 4.3.1.4) for
the sectoral activities within the program. It should be possible, for example, to set up a
regional or country study in which a cost-benefit model, settlement development survey,
and land assessment framework are all used, since each addresses different questions
and can actually complement one another. Regional or national development plans can
also serve as integrators, since they are expressions of the various trade-offs made by
governments and other stakeholders, accounting for the domestic natural resource base
and external economic forces.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
4-8
An alternative type of integrator is a common unit of measuring impacts. Advantages of
common units are that impacts across sectors and systems can be aggregated, and
perhaps compared to other issues (e.g., air pollution, greenhouse gas mitigation). Dis-
advantages are that crucial information may get lost, and that sometimes crude and
debatable assumptions need to made to express impacts in the chosen unit. The most
usual metric for common units is money. Money is used to express trade-offs between
valuable goods and services that are traded on markets. There are techniques to esti-
mate the monetary values of goods that are not traded, or are implicitly traded. These
have been applied to climate change impacts (Pearce et al., 1996). Because of the great
uncertainties and many assumptions, the results of such exercises should be interpreted
with great care, particularly in economies which are not full commercialised.
4.3.2 Consistency in scenarios and data
It is important to try to establish coherence and consistency between sectoral impact
studies. Comparability of results will be greater if studies investigate the same scenarios
(for climate, population, economics, and so on) and use the same reference year, the
same units, and consistent data bases.
A set of climate and socio-economic scenarios should be identified as early as possible.
The climate scenarios can be derived from climate model simulations, analogues, or
hypothetical cases (see Chapter 3). The socio-economic scenarios should include
population growth, technological changes, and potential economic and political changes
that would be important to the region or country of interest over the time period of the
climate scenario (see Chapter 2). Scenario characteristics will be regionally unique (due
to landscape, history, cultural factors, etc.), providing the context that enables the IA to
determine whether or not the impacts of climate change could be significant.
Scenario data are usually needed in a quantitative form, particularly if they are used as
inputs to models employed within sectoral and integration activities. In some study
components, scenario data will not be needed as direct input because the investigators
will be interested in the estimated sectoral impact from a qualitative perspective (e.g.,
community responses, legal dimensions). Qualitative scenarios would also suffice for
impact studies based on expert judgement.
Recall that consistent scenarios and data bases are the minimum requirements for inte-
gration. In most country studies, this type of coherence was part of the overall study
design. When starting a new study, it is readily enforced because this type of integration
also saves work.
4.3.3 Consistency between sectors, systems, and regions
Sectoral impact studies would be somewhat consistent if the same resource is not as-
sumed to be used by two sectors at the same time, and if climate-induced changes in one
sector are included in the study of another sector. For example, water consumed or land
Integration
4-9
occupied by a forest cannot also be consumed or occupied by agriculture. Climate-
induced changes in vegetation upstream of a river would affect run-off downstream.
Establishing such consistency requires that sector studies be conducted in a co-
ordinated fashion. It is may be possible that a qualitative, expert amendment to less
strictly co-ordinated results would suffice. It is advisable that this be accompanied by
in-depth discussions between the sectoral experts. The reasons are that all the subtleties
of the interactions between the sectors should be brought to the fore, and that mutual
understanding and appreciation need to be developed to make further steps a success.
Severe overlaps and inconsistencies between sector studies need to be prevented. Stand-
alone sector studies would do too much or too little, or would deviate too much from
each other. Examples of overlaps are agricultural/ecological and hydrological models
both calculating run-off; models of managed and unmanaged ecosystems including the
same biomes (e.g., semi-managed forests, extensively grazed grasslands); or studies
focusing on different aspects of the same thing (e.g., wildlife versus game for sport
hunting/tourism). Examples of possible inconsistencies between sector studies are
variables incorrectly held constant (e.g., quality of irrigation water, health status of
labour force) and resources that are an inherent part of the sectors (other than mere
input or outputs; examples are, again, land and water but also prices). As stated,
overcoming such overlaps and inconsistencies requires co-ordination. The nature of
such co-ordination is that agricultural scientists and hydrologists do their analysis
together. Interdisciplinary co-operation implies that a mutual understanding is devel-
oped, including long discussions about semantics and paradigms. It also implies that
adjustments, perhaps even concessions, need to be made. Therefore, integration requires
good leadership.
Integration also implies considerable learning about other disciplines and novel chal-
lenges for the own discipline. The latter arise from the fact that certain elements can no
longer be taken for granted, such as exogeneity of agricultural land use in water
management, or the seniority of agriculture’s water rights. In practice, avoiding overlap
means that one sector needs to yield part of the analysis to another sector. In return,
boundary conditions on that part are delivered by the other sector. For instance, when
coupling an ecosystem model with a hydrological model, only one of the two can
calculate run-off. Preference should be given to the sector that best represents the
overlapping part. “Best” could be interpreted as in closest accordance with obser-
vations, the disciplinary state of the art, or the targets set for the IA. If, for instance,
there is a strong interest in floods, and only one of the two models addresses floods,
then the choice should be for that model. If, on the other hand, the two alternative
models have similar output variables, but one has known deficiencies, then the choice
should be for the other model. Avoiding inconsistencies may also require that part of the
sectoral analysis be left to other disciplines, using other methods, models, or data.
Ensuring consistency may also require that part of the original analyses be extended to
include typically overlooked issues. Returning to the run-off example, a hydrological
model may well have a better representation of water flows, but an ecosystem model
may well have a better representation of water use by plants and how that reacts to
changing ambient concentrations of carbon dioxide. The extended hydrological model
UNEP/IVM Handbook
4-10
would then have the water supply and demand of a responsive ecosystem, in contrast to
the static representation in standard hydrological models.
4.3.4 Integrated impact assessment
The difference between integration of sectors and consistency between sectors is that, in
the former case, sectoral analyses are purportedly designed to feed into the integration,
rather than adjusted. The aim is to establish a consistent and comprehensive overview
of the impact of climate change on a particular region (e.g., an island, the coastal zone,
a watershed, or the whole country) or a particular system or sector (e.g., land use or
tourism), inclusive of the most important feedbacks between sectors. This is a major
exercise. It can fail if a clear need or a firm commitment is lacking. It is best to start
with an analysis of the system. What are the components? What are the links? What are
the issues? With such ambitious goals, it is essential to have clearly and firmly
established a family of integrators. The purpose of integrators is to provide structure to
the analysis. A clear structure is important because, to most of those involved,
integrated analysis is something new.
After the structure of the integrated analysis has been determined, a description is
needed of the components, of the interactions between the components, particularly the
inputs and outputs of each components, and of the type of analysis or model that would
get one from the given inputs to the required outputs. Such analyses or models may be
available. If so, these can be applied. Otherwise, these will have to be developed as part
of the integration. Note that only at this stage does the full scope of the integrated
analysis and the required resources become clear, so that only at this stage can the final
work programme and budget be made.
Physical, biological, and socio-economic studies, focusing on one sector or discipline,
provide important information in their own right. In an IA, however, these activities
also provide input to a new set of “clients”—the integrators. The information needs of
the resource accounting model, land assessment framework, community development
component, or legal dimensions component are quite different from those of a colleague
within a discipline related to that of the investigator.
The integrated analysis can be done in several ways, ranging between two extremes. At
the one extreme is soft-linking. At the other extreme is integrated modelling. Soft-
linking means that all component analyses are stand-alone, linked through input and
output variables, joint scenarios, and combined results. Note that soft-linking does not
imply lack of structure or co-ordination. Rather, each component analysis performs its
task (whether modelling or stakeholder analysis) within strictly described (and enforced)
boundary conditions. At the other extreme, integrated modelling combines all
components into a single computer code, describing the entire system. Hard-linking of
models lies between soft-linking and integration. Hard-linked models are part of a single
computer code, but are recognisable as separate models and could in principle run in a
stand-alone version. Integrated models, on the other hand, are no longer recognisable as
separate entities and cannot run without the whole model. Note that soft-linking is the
Integration
4-11
only way to include methods other than computer models. Soft-linking may, for
instance, be done by linking expert judgements in an expert panel.
4.3.5 The role of stakeholders
The crucial difference between an integrated analysis and an integrated assessment is
that an assessment has a clear policy dimension. This difference comes to the fore in the
design of the assessment, which should be done in a collaborative effort of scientists,
policy-makers, and stakeholders. It also comes to the fore in the presentation of the
result, which should be to a scientific audience, a lay audience, and a policy audience. It
may also come to the fore in the construction of scenarios, particularly those elements
which involve decisions. An essential element of an integrated assessment is that light is
shed on real-life questions (rather than academic problems) in a way that is
comprehensible and acceptable to those that have a stake in the issue to be addressed.
A key element to IA in its role to provide a broader context and perspective is that
scientists and stakeholders work together on a common set of issues. Complexities
increase as more questions are answered. A first goal of IA is to study the potential
impacts of climate change on resources and resource uses, the “what-if” question: e.g.,
How does climate change affect agriculture? This is primarily an activity of
researchers, although lay people may also hold considerable knowledge about particular
parts, e.g., water and land use management practices. A second goal of IA is to study
the policy implications of the estimated impacts, the “so-what” question: e.g., How do
changes in agriculture affect food security? This means evaluation; that is, the projected
outcomes are compared with the aspirations of citizens, government, etc. Here,
stakeholders (government agencies, non-government organisations, businesses) may
play a dominant role: researchers should act only as informants and citizens.
Alternatively, a specialist may try to measure human preferences, which are implicitly
revealed in everyday decisions, and evaluate the implications based on that. A third goal
of IA is to study policy responses, the “what should be done” question. Again, this can
be done through discussion among stakeholders or through an optimisation model. In
the latter case, it is important to select the proper objective function, reflecting the real
aims of the decision makers the model seeks to advise.
4.4  Case studies
IAs have followed different paths, but all have attempted to combine information from
various sources to address both direct and indirect implications of scenarios of climate
change for places, rather than just individual sectors.
4.4.1 The MINK study
This study focused on the states of Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas (MINK)
within the US Corn Belt region. The main objective was to assess the regional economic
UNEP/IVM Handbook
4-12
implications of climate change impacts on agriculture, water resources, forestry, and
energy use for both current and projected population and adaptation technologies. The
integration tool was a regional input-output model, IMPLAN.
This project was initiated in 1988 by the US Department of Energy to develop a
methodology for regional-scale climate impact assessment. Participants included
scientists from national laboratories (co-sponsored by government and the private
sector), a non-government research organisation (Resources for the Future, RFF), and a
scientific research society (Sigma Xi). The research program was done primarily by a
team of scientists from RFF over a three-year period.
The research team began by choosing a study area, and describing its climate-sensitive
attributes and vulnerabilities. It then selected the integration tool, IMPLAN, which had
just been developed by the US Forest Service for other purposes. A climate change
scenario was constructed from the 1930s Dust Bowl. A series of sectoral studies were
performed using this historical analogue, along with estimates of CO2 enrichment.
The results of the sectoral studies were used as input to the IMPLAN model. Economic
impacts were projected to be negative. Adaptation would offset much of these losses,
but some locations within the study area would still experience harsh impacts. The key
here is the assumption of proactive adaptation by agricultural producers combined with
assumed CO2 enrichment effects.
This case study was the first attempt at integrated regional assessment of a climate
change scenario. It did not include extensive stakeholder consultation but it did point the
way toward a process that would enable parallel assessments of key sectors to be used
as input to an integrating tool. The result of this process was an estimate, in economic
terms, of direct and indirect impacts of climate change on an agricultural region of a
developed country. There was acknowledgement, however, of the need to consider some
synergism among the various sectoral impacts, and to extend the water resources
assessment so that it would include the entire watershed rather than just the MINK
portion. It was also suggested that environmental implications should have been
included (Crosson and Rosenberg, 1993; Rosenberg, 1993).
4.4.2 Egypt
In 1989-1990, the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) initiated a series of
studies to assess the potential global implications of climate change. These were gen-
erally sectoral assessments of 18 developing countries. Particular attention was directed
to Egypt because of the potential for serious implications for agricultural production
resulting from a combination of several climate related stresses: reduced streamflow in
the Nile River, sea level rise along the coast of the Nile Delta, and changes in
availability of arable land.
The integrated assessment of impacts on Egypt was able to use outputs from sectoral
assessments that were already completed. Within the USEPA programme, there had
Integration
4-13
been assessments of crop yield, Nile River Basin water resources, sea level rise, human
health, and forests. All but the last were relevant to the case study of Egypt. These
sectoral studies had been under way for three years before the integrated assessment
exercise was initiated. The model chosen for the integrated assessment was adapted to
accept available inputs. This particular exercise took place over a two-year period that
partially overlapped the initial activities.
Participants in the sectoral assessments included academics from the United States and
Egypt, government scientists from Egypt, and researchers at the International Institute
for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Austria. These same individuals were brought
into the integrated assessment team. After the analysis was completed, a meeting was
held in Cairo with stakeholders to review and discuss the results.
The study area and impacts issues were identified near the end of the sectoral assess-
ments. The choice of integration tool was a model of Egyptian agriculture, the Egyptian
Agricultural Sector Model (EASM). It was modified to accept as inputs the results
from the sectoral studies. This approach is different from MINK in that the sectoral
studies were essentially completed before the integrated assessment began.
In this case, there were four climate change scenarios, all based on outputs from climate
models. The studies of Nile flow and crop yields were based on these same scenarios.
The sea level rise projection was based on an arbitrary selection using information from
the IPCC.
Proactive adaptations in water resources, irrigation and agricultural technology, and
coastal defences were assessed. The findings were that these would only partially offset
the negative impacts of climate change, and at a very high cost. This analysis
demonstrated that the interactions of these various sectoral impacts led to a different
picture of agricultural losses than the analysis of direct impacts on crop yields alone.
Climate-induced changes on the world market for agricultural products proved parti-
cularly important (Strzepek et al., 1994, 1995, 1996; Yates and Strzepek, 1996).
4.4.3 Mackenzie Basin Impact Study
MBIS was a case study that assessed several climate change scenarios for north-west
Canada. This was a six-year effort (one year for organisation, five years for research)
supported by Environment Canada and other sponsors. This was probably the most
ambitious attempt to date to perform an IA using a scientist-stakeholder collaborative
approach. In addition, several integration exercises were attempted, rather than relying
on one integration model.
Two integration workshops were held. The first focused on the “vertical” dimensions.
What were the important policy issues that might be relevant to a climate change im-
pact study of this region? The second concerned “horizontal” integration, or the chal-
lenge of linking scientists from different disciplines in a common framework.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
4-14
The vertical integration workshop identified policy concerns related to global warming,
in effect establishing targets for study participants. The workshop resulted in the
identification of six main policy issues: inter-jurisdictional water management, sus-
tainability of ecosystems, economic development, maintenance of infrastructure,
limitation (mitigation) strategies, and sustainability of aboriginal lifestyles. MBIS
participants felt that assessing limitation strategies would be beyond the scope of the
study, so it was agreed to place the various MBIS activities only within the context of
the five remaining policy issues, which represented concerns about adaptation. It is
important to note, however, that more than half the MBIS projects had been selected
before this workshop took place.
The second integration workshop identified data requirements of study participants and
linkages between the various study activities. Each investigator was asked to indicate
his or her information needs, and this was displayed in a large matrix. MBIS
participants could also use this matrix to identify potential “clients” for their work.
Despite the workshops and other activities held during this exercise, several obstacles to
interdisciplinary research became significant challenges. This affected both the transfer
of data between investigators and the integration process. The problems related to
mismatches in software, and availability and compatibility of data. The latter problem
was made worse because data assembling started well before data requirements were
established.
Communicating with stakeholders was a complex challenge. There were successes with
provincial and territorial government agencies and some aboriginal organisations, but
some potential partners did not join in. Climate change is an issue embraced by some
and avoided by others, depending on their mandate, jurisdiction, and perception of the
importance (or lack of importance) of the climate change issue to their concerns.
Results of the IA showed that impacts would generally be negative, particularly for
ecosystems, forestry, and activities dependent on stable conditions for ice and perma-
frost. However, agriculture could expand. This raised new questions regarding potential
land use and economic development conflicts, and the future of aboriginal communities
as they attempt to maintain traditional non-wage lifestyles while increasing their
participation in the wage economy (Cohen, 1997a,b,c).
4.4.4 Aridas
The Aridas study was conducted by an alliance between the Brazilian federal govern-
ment, the state governments of Northeast Brazil, universities and non-governmental
organisations, and the World Bank. The area of the project was the semi-arid Northeast
Brazil (NEB), in particular, the country-side.
Two features were emphasised: first, how to organise an integrated process of planning
for the sustainable development of a marginal region like the NEB; and second, how to
Integration
4-15
deal with the issues of climate variability and climate change from within the planning
process.
The NEB is a large, underdeveloped region. The high vulnerability of the population
results from their poverty and from the recurrent droughts that cause dramatic crop
losses and unemployment crises. In regions like the NEB, decision makers are con-
stantly facing pressing problems such as the need for poverty alleviation, economic
growth, employment creation, and drought relief actions. It is difficult to call their
attention to possible future problems of climate change.
Therefore, Aridas placed climate change impacts in the context of overall development
and present climate variability—the problem of droughts and their social, economic,
and environmental impacts.
The general methodological framework was then devised in seven steps:
1. An assessment of the present state of sustainability of the region, in its social,
economic, environmental, and political dimensions.
2. An assessment of present vulnerability of the region to climate variability, through
an integrated assessment of climate impact and possible societal responses.
3. A business-as-usual scenario of the sustainability of the region in the future; if the
development process continues as is, the NEB will be more unsustainable in the
future, though per capita incomes will be higher.
4. A scenario of regional climate change; the NEB will probably get more frequent
and more severe droughts.
5. An assessment of vulnerability to climate variation in the future.
6. A desired scenario of sustainability in the future, based on comprehensive parti-
cipation processes; the Northeasterners are looking for the establishment of a future
society that will be more just, equitable, and sustainable.
7. A strategy for the sustainable development of the region, including adaptation and
mitigation strategies to address climate variability and change, to serve as a guide-
line to future regional plans.
The Aridas recommendations have been used by several state governments in the NEB,
and now in the Amazon region, to orient the preparation of sustainable development
plans (Magalhães and Neto, 1989; Magalhães, 1992; Magalhães et al., 1994; Nobre,
1994; Projeto Aridas, 1995).

4.4.5 The Asian-Pacific Integrated Model
The Asian-Pacific Integrated Model (AIM) has been developed in a collaborative effort
of nine institutes in five countries in east Asia (China, India, Indonesia, Japan, South
Korea), and the leading institute is the National Institute for Environmental Studies of
Japan. The Japanese government is the main financier in the form of research contracts
and visiting fellowships to the non-Japanese institutes. The seven institutes outside
Japan have been responsible for national data collection, and jointly responsible for
national model development. In addition, all developed models and data bases have been
transferred to these institutes.
AIM integrates population, economy, emissions, concentrations, climate, and impacts.
On the impact side, GCM-based climate scenarios serve as inputs to models of water
resources (Southeast Asia and Australia only), unmanaged ecosystems (whole world),
malaria (whole world), and agriculture (Southeast Asia and Australia only). AIM
focuses on water supply and vegetation, malaria transmission, and crop yield potentials.
The impact models are process-oriented and geographically explicit, often with great
detail.
For example, model results for Indonesia indicate an increase from 75 to 108 million
people at high risk of malaria, a decrease in rice yields of 2%, and a worsening of
drought conditions in 75% of the country. As another example, Thailand’s population
at risk of malaria is projected to remain unchanged, but rice and cassava yields could
fall by 2% and 24%, respectively, and 83% of the country may face more severe
droughts (Morita et al., 1997).
The development of the AIM model has been a major research effort. It cannot be
repeated with the limited funds available in a typical country study. Nevertheless, Asian
institutes in particular should draw on the knowledge accumulated in the AIM project.
4.5 Advantages and constraints of integrated
assessment
Organising and developing an integrated assessment of climate change impacts for a
region or country is a new process which has not been widely tested.
Integrated impact and adaptation assessments of long-term climate change involve
multi-sectoral, multi-disciplinary, multi-cultural, and multi-jurisdictional collaboration
and partnerships. A successful IA could lead to the establishment of new data bases and
a broader network of informed scientists and stakeholders. These will have value long
after the completion of the regional or country studies. If the vertical (science-policy)
and horizontal (science-science) integration components develop successfully, all parties
should feel a sense of ownership in the results of this exercise. This would hopefully
lead to a well-informed, regional- or country-scale research and policy response.
Integration
4-17
Integrated assessments, with stakeholder collaboration, can be difficult to pursue, par-
ticularly given the complex and uncertain nature of the climate change issue, the large
size of most study areas, and the lack of immediacy of climate change compared with
other regional issues (e.g., deficient health care, poverty, soil degradation). It is also
important to recognise that each region is unique because of its history and geography.
Specific experience with that region is an important asset, and the success of this and
other regional and country studies will be quite limited without collaboration outside of
international and federal government agencies.
Given the time and budgetary constraints which are often imposed on impacts research,
researchers rarely have sufficient time to collect new data or develop new models.
Research will depend on existing data bases and models for much of its work, and it
will be difficult to overcome gaps in basic information (e.g., climate, soils, vegetation,
population, economic transactions). A second limitation is the difficulty in maintaining
internal consistency in a large, multi-disciplinary group (scales, assumptions, units of
measure) and in ensuring the compatibility of various sub-components. It may be
difficult to reach consensus on the choices of integrators, but there is no reason why a
country study should restrict itself to one particular integration exercise. Each one
would provide its own unique insights.
The following is a list of “lessons” which may be useful for those who are planning a
regional or country IA of climate change impacts:
• 
The effort required to attract stakeholders and maintain scientist-stakeholder col-
laboration cannot be underestimated. Time and resources will need to be allocated
specifically for this purpose, but the IA will be richer for it. This will also increase
the probability of stakeholders becoming shareholders in the climate change
impacts issue.
• 
The choice of study area will be influenced by political boundaries, but it is ad-
vantageous to consider watersheds and other ecological boundaries as well.
• 
It is essential that all scenarios and assumptions are consistent across the sectoral
analyses, or integration will be hampered.
• 
A common data platform (e.g., for geographic information systems) should be
identified as early as possible. This may not be easy, because of previous invest-
ments by participating agencies, institutions, etc., but incompatibility of data
formats may become an important obstacle to integration. A home page on World
Wide Web could be set up, but this would require additional resources, and there
would be questions of access, confidentiality, and security.
• 
There is no substitute for personal contact. Communication through newsletters and
reports, etc., is not enough. Electronic mail will be an important asset in co-
ordination and communication between personal meetings and visits, but direct
contact is important, especially with stakeholders.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
4-18
• 
The choice of impact indicators (economic, environmental, social) should not be
made in isolation from the particular situation faced in the study region or country.
The specific conditions of the study area should be taken into account when
choosing such measures.
• 
There is no single best way to integrate knowledge from different disciplines.
Modelling exercises should be complemented by non-model approaches, including
direct interaction between scientists and stakeholders during all phases of the
assessment. This interaction enables the study to draw on local knowledge as well
as on scientific research projects. A process that is determined by goals, not ana-
lytical tools, will result in a more successful integrated assessment.

5.1  Introduction
Adaptation refers to all those responses to climate change that may be used to reduce
vulnerability. (Vulnerability is susceptibility to harm or damage potential. It considers
such factors as the ability of a system to cope or absorb stress or impacts and to
“bounce back” or recover.) Adaptation can also refer to actions designed to take
advantage of new opportunities that may arise as a result of climate change.
In assessing climate change impacts, it is imperative to take adaptation into account.
Plants, animals, and humans will not simply continue on as they have without climate
change but are quite likely to modify their behaviour. Plants, animals, and ecosystems
may migrate to new locations. Humans may change their behaviour to cope with a
different climate (e.g., more heating/cooling, switch crops) or if necessary may migrate.
To fully account for vulnerability to climate change, an assessment of impacts needs to
account for those adaptations that are likely or even reasonable to assume to happen.
Without assessment of such adaptations, the impacts researchers could well overstate
the potential negative effects of climate change. An additional reason for assessing
adaptation is to inform policy makers about what they can do to reduce the risks of
climate change.

Adaptation to Climate
Change: Theory and
Assessment
UNEP/IVM Handbook
5-2
Adaptation is treated in three ways in this handbook. Section 5.2 of this chapter is a
theoretical section, in which the concept of adaptation is explained in relation to both
“normal” climate variability and climate change. A typology of adaptations is devel-
oped at a broad generic level as an aid to the identification of adaptation measures, and
the idea of maladaptation is also introduced.
Section 5.3 provides some suggestions for the generic design of adaptation studies. This
includes reference to some specific techniques that have been developed and indication
where further information may be obtained. This is not comprehensive and will
undoubtedly benefit from the practical experiences of those who seek to put these
methods to the test, in country studies and elsewhere.
Specific adaptation measures relevant to particular economic sectors or areas of impact
are discussed in each of the sectoral chapters in Part II. An attempt has been made to
keep the terminology of adaptation consistent between sectors, but the field of
adaptation to climate change is relatively new and there is at the moment no generally
accepted consensus about the definition of terms. No doubt this will emerge as the
research and policy debates continue.
5.2  Theoretical aspects of adaptation
The first part of this section describes the importance of adaptation as part of the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and suggests
some definitions of key concepts regarding adaptation . The remaining theoretical
discussion of adaptation to climate change is organised around a set of simple questions
designed to show what it is that is being adapted to; who or what is doing the adapting;
and in what way, when, and how the adapting is being done. The section concludes with
a discussion of the capacity to adapt.
5.2.1 Adaptation and maladaptation to climate change and
variability
The UNFCCC includes five clauses that specifically address adaptation as follows:
All Parties . . . shall . . . formulate, implement, publish and regularly
update national and . . . regional programmes containing measures to
mitigate climate change . . . and measures to facilitate adequate adapt-
ation to climate change (Article 4, Section 1 (b)).
The Parties should take precautionary measures to anticipate, prevent
or minimise the causes of climate change and mitigate its adverse
effects . . . To achieve this, such policies and measures should take into
account different socio-economic contexts, to be comprehensive, cover
all relevant sources, sinks, and reservoirs of greenhouse gases, and
adaptation (Article 4, Section 3).
Adaptation to Climate Change
5-3
All Parties . . . shall co-operate in preparing for adaptation to the im-
pacts of climate change (Article 4, Section (e)).
All Parties . . . shall . . . take climate change considerations into
account, to the extent feasible, their relevant social, economic and
environmental policies and actions, and employ appropriate methods,
for example impact assessment, formulated and determined nationally,
with a view to minimising adverse effects on the economy on public
health, and on quality of the environment, of projects or measures
undertaken by them to mitigate or adapt to climate change (Article 4,
Section 1 (f)).
The developed country Parties and other developed Parties…shall also
assist the developing country Parties that are particularly vulnerable to
the adverse effects of climate change in meeting the costs of those
adverse effects (Article 4, Section 4)
These references to adaptation constitute only a small part of the Framework Con-
vention, which is primarily devoted to “stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in
the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with
the climate system” (Article 2). It is now clear that the climate is already changing and
that the world is committed to more change before stabilisation can be reached.
Adaptation is therefore of growing importance, and is likely to receive more attention
both in the research community and in the ongoing negotiations under the Convention.
Under the Kyoto Protocol to the Framework Convention (negotiated at Kyoto,
December 1997) a “clean development mechanism” is defined in Article 12 of the
Protocol. The clean development mechanism is mainly concerned with international co-
operation in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the so-called “certified project
activities”, but the Article also provides in Clause 8 that:
The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to
this Protocol shall ensure that a share of the proceeds from certified
project activities is used to . . . assist developing country Parties that
are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change to
meet the costs of adaptation.
Thus the financing of adaptation in some countries has been specifically linked to the
measures for reducing emissions.
Adaptation is a very broad concept, and as applied to climate change it can be used in a
variety of ways. An impression of this variety can be sensed by reference to three
definitions found in the recent literature. The following definitions are taken from the
recent literature:
Adaptation to climate is the process through which people reduce the
adverse effects of climate on their health and well-being, and take
advantage of the opportunities that their climatic environment provides
(Burton, 1992).
UNEP/IVM Handbook
5-4
 . . . the term adaptation means any adjustment, whether passive, reac-
tive or anticipatory, that is proposed as a means for ameliorating the
anticipated adverse consequences associated with climate change
(Stakhiv, 1993).
Adaptability refers to the degree to which adjustments are possible in
practices, processes, or structures of systems to projected or actual
changes of climate. Adaptation can be spontaneous or planned, and can
be carried out in response to or in anticipation of changes in conditions
(IPCC, 1996).
These three definitions give a flavour of the range of ideas included under the term
adaptation. It is also helpful sometimes to view complex concepts like adaptation
through their opposites. For adaptation, this can mean its absence or something that is
contrary to it. The absence of adaptation means doing nothing to offset adverse impacts.
It can mean, for example, that a particular threat has been considered together with the
costs of potential adaptive response, and that it has been considered better to do nothing
and take the risk, rather than bear the costs of adaptation (cost-benefit analyses).
The notion of maladaptation refers to those actions which tend to increase vulnerability
to climate change. It is possible to make development or investment decisions while
neglecting the actual or potential impacts of climate or climate change. Such decisions
are termed maladaptive. The concept of maladaptation applies not only to climate
change, but also to present or “normal” climate. Hence a first step in adapting to
climate change can be to stop or alter existing maladaptive processes or practices. For
example, increased vulnerability to future climate change is being created where
properties are being built in hazard zones such as flood plains or coastal areas that are
now subject to floods and storms.
5.2.2 What are adaptation measures?
There are potentially many adaptation measures that may be adopted in response to
climate change. The Second Assessment Report of IPCC Working Group II mentioned
or described 228 different adaptation measures (IPCC, 1995).
It is useful therefore to classify adaptation measures using an overall framework. A
commonly used classification groups adaptation measures into eight categories (Burton
et al., 1993):
1. Bear losses. All other adaptation measures may be compared with the baseline
response of “doing nothing” except bearing or accepting the losses. In theory,
bearing loss occurs when those affected have no capacity to respond in any other
ways (for example, in extremely poor communities) or where the costs of adapt-
ation measures are considered to be high in relation to the risk or the expected
damages.
2. Share losses. This type of adaptation response involves sharing the losses among a
wider community. Such actions take place in traditional societies and in the most
Adaptation to Climate Change
5-5
complex, high-tech societies. In traditional societies, many mechanisms exist to
share losses among a wider community, such as extended families and village-level
or similar small-scale communities. At the other end of the spectrum, large-scale
societies share losses through public relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction paid
for from public funds. Sharing losses can also be achieved through private
insurance.
3. Modify the threat. For some risks, it is possible to exercise a degree of control over
the environmental threat itself. When this is a “natural” event such as a flood or a
drought, possible measures include flood control works (dams, dikes, levees). For
climate change, the major modification possibility is to slow the rate of climate
change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and eventually stabilising greenhouse
concentrations in the atmosphere. In the language of the UNFCCC, such measures
are referred to as mitigation of climate change and are considered to be in a
different category of response from adaptation measures.
4. Prevent effects. A frequently used set of adaptation measures involves steps to
prevent the effects of climate change and variability. An example would be for
agriculture: changes in crop management practices such as increased irrigation
water, additional fertiliser, and pest and disease control.
5. Change use. Where the threat of climate change makes the continuation of an
economic activity impossible or extremely risky, consideration can be given to
changing the use. For example, a farmer may choose to substitute a more drought-
tolerant crop or switch to varieties with lower moisture. Similarly, crop land may
be returned to pasture or forest, or other uses may be found such as recreation,
wildlife refuges, or national parks.
6. Change location. A more extreme response is to change the location of economic
activities. There is considerable speculation, for example, about relocating major
crops and farming regions away from areas of increased aridity and heat to areas
that are currently cooler and which may become more attractive for some crops in
the future (Rosenzweig and Parry, 1994).
7. Research. The process of adaptation can also be advanced by research into new
technologies and new methods of adaptation.
8. Educate, inform, and encourage behavioural change. Another type of adaptation
is the dissemination of knowledge through education and public information cam-
paigns, leading to behavioural change. Such activities have been little recognised
and given little priority in the past, but are likely to assume increased importance as
the need to involve more communities, sectors, and regions in adaptation becomes
apparent.
The IPCC Technical Guidelines (Carter et al., 1994) include another category of
adaptation called restoration. This is described as follows: “Restoration, which aims to
restore a system to its original condition following damage or modification due to
climate”. From the perspective of adaptation as a continuous process, and as a learning
process, the notion of restoration might even be considered as maladaptive, if by
UNEP/IVM Handbook
5-6
restoration is meant a return to a pre-existing state. Successful adaptation is more likely
to involve making changes after an event to reduce future vulnerability.
5.2.3 Adapt to what?
Knowledge of present and future climate is not by itself sufficient basis for the devel-
opment of an adaptive response. Further information is needed on the likely or possible
impacts of these changes. This in turn requires an understanding of the relationship
between climate (including many specific climate parameters) and socio-economic
activities, as described in Chapter 1, Getting Started.
The understanding of adaptation to climate change can be increased by investigating
adaptation to present climate as well as future climate. Adapting to present climate is
not the same as adapting to future climate change, but provided that allowances are
made for the differences, much can be learned about adaptation options and the process
of their adoption. Studies of adaptation to current climate also make it clear that human
activities are not now always as well adapted to climate as they might be. The mounting
losses from great natural disasters for example (Figure 5.1 and Table 5.1) are in
substantial part associated with extreme atmospheric events. It has been shown (Burton
et al., 1993) that these losses cannot be ascribed to the events alone but are also due to
lack of appropriate human adaptation (also called human adjustment) and that losses
are in some cases being increased by maladaptation.
In the development context, therefore, a prudent adaptive response to the threat of
climate change may be to improve adaptation to existing climate and its variability,
including extreme events. Improving adaptation to current climate variability is not an
alternative to preparing for adaptation to longer term changes in climate. It is an ad-
junct, a useful first and preparatory step that strengthens capacity now to deal with
future circumstances.

5.2.4 Who and what is it that adapts?
Adaptation occurs in both natural and socio-economic systems. All species of plant and
animal life are adapted and adapting to climate, and may be expected to respond
adaptively to future climate change to the extent that time allows. The more mobile
species may be able to migrate fast enough, whereas the less mobile may be in danger
of severe impact, up to and including extinction. In some instances migration may be
impossible, as in island ecosystems or high mountain ecosystems, where the limits of
migration are set by the height of the mountains. The adaptation of natural unmanaged
ecosystems does not have to be left entirely to chance. It is possible to adopt policies
and practices which assist species in adapting, for example, by designating and pro-
tecting migration corridors.
By analogy, similar relationships exist in socio-economic systems. All socio-economic
sectors (e.g., agriculture, forestry, water resources) are now adapted to some extent to
climate, and these adaptations have to be changed to fit the new conditions of a
changing climate. This includes, for example, adaptation by farmers, by farm suppliers,
by consumers of farm products, by agricultural policy makers, in short, by all the
stakeholders in the agricultural system. Much the same can be said for all other socio-
economic sectors. Each adapts as a whole and in its component or constituent parts.
Each of these socio-economic sectors also adapt in association with other sectors.
Adaptation in socio-economic sectors is generally considered to be easier to implement
when the investment of activity has a shorter product cycle. For example, a different
grain crop can be planted every year, whereas tree crops require longer to replace, and
forests have a life-cycle of decades to hundreds of years. Large-scale and long-term
indivisible investments (such as dams, irrigation projects, coastal defences, bridges, and
storm drainage systems) can be costly to retrofit to meet new climate conditions, and so
adaptation measures need to be considered in such investment decisions at an earlier
stage. Long-term adaptation is therefore an ongoing process that involves ecosystems
UNEP/IVM Handbook
5-8
and socio-economic systems in their entirety. Adaptation is in effect the process of
successful change or evolution. Studies of adaptation to future climate therefore need to
consider other changes as well. This is why scenarios of future climate should be
complemented with socio-economic scenarios, even though it is recognised that this
significantly increases the uncertainty of projections (see Chapters 2 and 3).
Everything and everyone can in theory adapt. There are two purposes for impact and
adaptation research. One is to provide possibilities, options, information, and under-
standing that will facilitate successful adaptation; the other is to gain a better under-
standing of vulnerability, i.e. the residual impacts after adaptation has been considered
and adopted where appropriate.
5.2.5 How does adaptation occur?
An important distinction is made between adaptation that may be expected to occur by
itself — often called autonomous or spontaneous adaptation — and adaptation which
requires conscious intervention or preparation, which is referred to as planned
adaptation, or adaptation strategy or policy. This distinction may be applied at different
levels of decision making. For example, from the perspective of a Ministry of
Agriculture, autonomous adaptation may refer to those actions that farmers undertake
themselves without government intervention, such as a decision to plant a different crop
or variety or to change the time of planting. From a farmer’s perspective, however, such
an action is not spontaneous but is likely to have involved some serious consideration
and advance planning. Although considerable analysis can go into farm-level decisions,
the main concern of this handbook is the identification and assessment of adaptation
options at the governmental or sectoral level.
5.2.6 When does adaptation take place?
Adaptation can occur before, during, or after any external stimulus or threat. Thus it is
quite possible to take adaptive measures in anticipation of climate change. Such
adaptation measures are called anticipatory or preventive adaptation (Smith, 1997).
Climate change may actually be experienced as a change in frequency or intensity of
extreme events. For example, a severe drought, flood, or windstorm may be associated
with climate change. Measures can be taken in advance to reduce impacts or damage,
including provision of additional water supplies or more economical use of remaining
supplies (in the case of drought), and steps to protect or remove vulnerable property
from floods or windstorms. Hence disaster preparedness is an important component of
climate change action plans.
Adaptation measures taken in anticipation of climate change can and usually should be
harmonised with responses to current extreme events. Adaptation to extreme climatic
events in the present may or may not take account of future climate change. However,
since such extreme events will be a feature of climate change in the future, it makes
sense to improve responses to similar events now occurring. In effect, improving
response to extreme climatic events in the present (reduce vulnerability, increase
Adaptation to Climate Change
5-9
resilience, and strengthen adaptation capacity) provides a sort of training opportunity
for learning how to improve response to future climate change. The fact that many
regions now report increasing damage from climate events (extreme and not so extreme)
demonstrates that current adaptation is not always as effective as it might be, and that
maladaptive choices are being made.
Adaptation during climate change has been described as gradual, step-wise, and short-
term.
Adaptation also takes place after the event. Provision of relief to the victims and
measures to rehabilitate and reconstruct damaged property and communities are part of
the adaptation process, not least because actions after one event may serve also as
preparation for the next occurrence. In bringing relief and rehabilitation to affected
people and settlements, it is important to take advantage of the opportunity to make
them less vulnerable, and to take care not to increase future vulnerability. A sound
policy of reconstruction after extreme climatic events can thus be part of a progressive
adaptation strategy. Where the reverse occurs and greater vulnerability is created over
time, it is again appropriate to speak of maladaptation.
Adaptation after climate change impacts can be describe as reactive or corrective. All
these terms are used at some point in the following chapters. The terminology is still
evolving and has not reached a steady state. As research proceeds and as the policy
debates continue, it is possible that a more standardised terminology will emerge.
5.2.7 What capacity to adapt?
Adaptation capacity remains a large question in all discussions about the impact of
climate change. At one end of the scale are confident assertions that human adaptive
capacity is very large and that a great deal can and will be done to reduce the impact of
climate change by the adoption of adaptation measures (NAS, 1992; Goklany, 1995).
In different climatic regions of the world, people have adapted to much greater extremes
of climate, it is argued, than the scale of changes now anticipated. Since human beings
have managed to survive and prosper in such a wide range of climatic environments, it
is sometimes claimed that coping with climate change will not present a difficult
problem, although it is recognised that adaptation could be costly and that the costs
remain in large part unknown and unestimated.
At the other end of the scale it is argued that adaptation in socio-economic systems
takes time and might be extremely costly. Considerable expenditure could be involved
in making the necessary changes to reduce vulnerability to climate change, although
these costs have not been the subject of much research to date. Further, the fact that
human communities are adapted to life across a wide range of climate conditions does
not mean that such adaptations and the measures they involve can readily be transferred
from region to region rapidly. The harmony of agriculture, forestry, water management,
and so forth with climate conditions has been developed over decades, even centuries, in
a slow, evolutionary process often involving much trial and error. Unless the projected
UNEP/IVM Handbook
5-10
pace of climate change can be slowed, there may not be enough time for many of the
proposed adaptation measures to be implemented.
5.2.8 Increasing adaptive capacity
If adaptation of various kinds is to be used as an effective way of responding to climate
change, measures to increase adaptive capacity will be needed. What determines
adaptive capacity? Probably the strongest explanatory variable for adaptive capacity is
wealth. The wealthier nations, as well as wealthier communities and individuals within
nations, have the resources at their disposal to seek out and pay for adaptation options
to reduce vulnerability and to recover from adverse impacts.
Wealth by itself is not sufficient. Indeed there are circumstances when wealth can
encourage decisions which are maladaptive in the long run, but can be profitable at the
short term. For example, the development of recreational amenities in high hazard zones
such as exposed coastal areas or on sites subject to the risk of avalanche may increase
exposure, vulnerability, and damages. The added adaptive capacity that is theoretically
possible with greater wealth must also be blended with scientific understanding and
public knowledge and awareness. Scientific understanding is needed especially of the
potential impacts of climate change. Thus the answers to the question “adapt to what?”
are important.
Other factors that can enhance adaptive capacity include access to information and
especially to technology and technological skills. The strengths of the institutions of
government and of the private sector are also important. Another factor is the relative
distribution of health, education, and wealth. Where a society or community includes a
larger number of poor, handicapped, elderly, very young, poorly educated, and diseased
or otherwise unhealthy people, then the more vulnerable it is likely to be to climate
change and the lower the adaptive capacity. Countries also differ widely in the extent to
which their economy is reliant upon climate-susceptible activities such as agriculture,
forestry, or fisheries, or is poorly endowed with water resources. In general, the greater
the degree of reliance on climate sensitive activities the greater the vulnerability to
climate change; conversely, the greater the portion of the economy in manufacturing
and the service sector the lower the vulnerability.
A final, somewhat intangible, factor is the degree of flexibility in a society. Adaptation
to climate change requires changes in how and where natural resources are managed.
The ease with which changes can be made in management of natural resources is an
important factor in the ability of a society to adapt to climate change.
5.3  Assessment of adaptation measures
Assessment of adaptation options requires an understanding of what is meant by
adaptation; what we mean by the term adaptation is described above. Assessment of
adaptation also requires evaluating how well different practices and technologies will
avoid adverse climate change impacts by preventing or minimising them, by enabling a
Adaptation to Climate Change
5-11
speedy and efficient recovery from their effects, or by taking advantage of positive
impacts. This section addresses the evaluation of adaptation measures.
The methods described here provide a range of options that have been applied to the
evaluation of climate change adaptation measures. Some options rely heavily on expert
judgement and have limited data needs, whereas others involve quantitative analysis and
require more resources.
In general, an approach to estimate (in either qualitative or quantitative terms) both the
costs of implementing a measure and the potential benefits from doing so is needed.
Benefits can be thought of as climate change impacts (or damages) avoided or positive
effects taken advantage of. Thus, such an assessment relies heavily on the techniques
described in the sectoral chapters of this handbook for assessing the impacts of climate
change. The impact assessment methods need to be applied in an iterative manner in
which total potential impacts are estimated first and then, as adaptation options are
identified, the potential impacts under adaptation are estimated. This information can
then be used to estimate the damages avoided because of adaptation. For example,
climate-crop models are commonly used to identify changes in crop yields under
different conditions of temperature, moisture availability, and so forth. Where
significant declines in yield are suggested by the models, it is possible to run the same
climate scenario with different management options or substitute crops. It has been
found in many such studies that farm-level adaptation (changing cultivars or varieties of
crop) can significantly reduce the impact of projected climate change on crop yields,
and in some cases can lead to an increase in yields over present values (e.g.,
Rosenzweig and Iglesias, 1994). Such modelling exercises are useful in identifying the
technical possibilities for adaptation and the potential damages avoided. They do not by
themselves give any information on the likelihood of such adaptation options being used
or adopted or on the relative benefits of various adaptation options. Nor do they tell
what obstacles to their adoption may exist. Thus, for most purposes, these results need
to be further evaluated using the techniques described in this section.
The costs of implementing adaptation measures and attempts to rank or monetise
benefits involve a number of important considerations, but the applicable tools are
generally those that are used to evaluate other projects or policy questions. In addition,
many sources provide guidance for conducting benefit-cost analysis in the context of
project analysis (see, e.g., Ward and Derren, 1991; Winpenny, 1991; Pearce et al.,
1994; Squire and van der Tak, 1995). Other sources provide detailed guidance on how
to assess environmental impacts and incorporate them in benefit-cost analysis (World
Bank, 1991; Hassan and Hutchinson, 1992; Lutz, 1993; Munasinghe, 1993; Dixon
et al., 1994; Weiss, 1994; ADB, 1996). To select the appropriate assessment methods,
a country needs to consider the following criteria:
1. How well the method addresses the goals and objectives of the assessment (e.g., the
level of precision needed for decision making, the usefulness of the tool for building
consensus).
UNEP/IVM Handbook
5-12
2. The ability of the method to address uncertainties (e.g., related to the magnitude of
impacts, the timing and spatial pattern of impacts, the effectiveness of adaptation
measures, and future socio-economic conditions).
3. The availability of inputs (e.g., data from impact assessments, socio-economic data,
cost estimates).
4. The availability of resources (e.g., time, expertise, money).
This section reviews a range of qualitative and quantitative approaches for weighing the
trade-offs among adaptation measures. Many of these options can be used in com-
bination. Each method is described and evaluated here against the four criteria listed
above, and the results of this evaluation are summarised in a matrix at the end of this
section.
5.3.1 Forecasting by analogy
Empirical investigations of adaptation to present-day climate variability or to climate
events in the past provide insights into the process of adaptation and the conditions
needed for its successful promotion. Forecasting by analogy looks at events that have
had a similar effect in the recent past to the likely impact of future events associated
with climate change. The assumption is that lessons can be learned from such past
experience and applied to future situations (Glantz, 1988).The following is a broad
outline for the design of studies of current adaptation to climate variability or of past
analogues for future climate changes.
• 
Identify from climate scenarios the climate changes which are likely to have a sig-
nificant impact on the country or region. For example, this may be sea level rise (
associated with coastal flooding, strong winds, and salt-water intrusion), or a
change in the temperature/ precipitation regime (associated with an increase in the
frequency and intensity of droughts or storms).
• 
Review recent experience in managing responses to climatic/hydrometeorological
events that correspond to the changes under climate change scenarios. Where there
is no local experience of response to such changes or events, examples may be
sought in other, similar places.
• 
For the chosen events, examine the instrumental record to obtain an up-to-date
picture of the trends in occurrence, including any changes in magnitude, frequency,
duration, or location. It is important to evaluate how the selected events compare to
expected events under climate change.
• 
For the chosen events, conduct a survey and analysis of the actions taken, drawing
as appropriate upon the discussion of types of adaptation in this chapter. The ob-
jective of assembling information on adaptation actions is to permit an analysis of
their effectiveness in reducing impacts. Such an analysis could be directed to actual
adaptation responses that have been tried, and also to other possible action which
Adaptation to Climate Change

have been proposed but not used. The detailed design of any such study depends
upon local circumstances.
Level of Precision. This approach does not provide a method to weigh the trade-offs
among different adaptation options, rather it provides insights into how the adaptation
process may work. The advantage of this approach is that it relies on actual human
responses to past events. However, there are many uncertainties related to how econo-
mic and social events may differ in the future, thus leading to potentially different
outcomes.
Ability to Address Uncertainties. This approach requires the use of expert judgement to
carefully select analogue scenarios, assess how uncertainties may affect the findings,
and interpret the results in a manner that will be useful to decision makers.
Input Needed. To apply this approach, the experts will need to access a wide range of
data and expertise related to past events. Preparing this type of study usually involves
the relevant research community of climatologists, meteorologists, hydrologists, ento-
mologists, epidemiologists, and the like. The organisation of such a study often requires
the co-operation of an interdisciplinary and multi-agency group or task force. Steps
may be needed to bring such a group together and to involve them in the design of the
study.
Resource Requirements. The resources needed to apply this approach will vary de-
pending on the effort devoted to developing a sufficiently detailed understanding of past
events to guide future planning and decision making. This effort is likely to be more
resource intensive than some of the other available methods, and usually would be
conducted in conjunction with one or more of the methods that allow for a direct
comparison of potential adaptation options.
5.3.2 Screening to identify anticipatory adaptation measures
A formal approach for applying expert judgement to screen adaptation measures is
included in the US Country Studies Program’s Steps in Preparing Climate Change
Action Plans: A Handbook (Benioff and Warren, 1996). The approach focuses on
anticipatory adaptation measures (i.e., options that can be implemented now to address
climate change). In this approach, each measure is evaluated against six suggested
criteria; however, other criteria may be used.
This approach relies heavily on expert judgement. Expert judgement can be used to
develop a preliminary evaluation of various adaptation measures or to identify measures
for further research. In addition, approaches that rely on expert judgement are often
useful for involving decision makers and key stakeholders and can be used to build
consensus. However, it is important to recognise that in applying these approaches it is
possible to tailor a case to make a certain strategy appear to be better than others.
Therefore, justification of each decision that relies on expert judgement should be
provided.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
5-14
Level of Precision. Given an adequate understanding of potential vulnerability, plan-
ning and policy objectives, and the relative level of effort associated with various
adaptation options, experts can conduct a screening that will be useful for general
planning or for establishing research priorities. However, it is likely that in many cases
this approach will not provide the level of detail needed to support the implementation
of adaptation measures that involve investments in resources or political capital.
Ability to Address Uncertainties. This method does not include any formal provisions
to explicitly consider uncertainties in the assessment. It is left to the experts to weigh
uncertainties.
Input Needed. The experts will need to be familiar with the results of the impact as-
sessment, potential changes in socio-economic conditions in the absence of climate
change, current planning or investment initiatives, relative costs and benefits of meas-
ures, implementation barriers, and other adaptation or mitigation policies.
Resource Requirements. The resources need for this method are relatively modest. This
is the simplest approach, the least time consuming, and the least costly. Depending on
the level of expertise available and the effort made to build consensus, this approach
could require an investment of as little as a few hours to a few days for one to several
individuals.
5.3.3 Tool for environmental assessment and management
The Tool for Environmental Assessment and Management (TEAM) was developed by
Decision Focus, Inc. (DFI, 1996) for the US Environmental Protection Agency
(USEPA) as a user-friendly software package to assist decision makers in evaluating
strategies for adapting to climate change. TEAM uses a multi-criteria approach to help
planners recognise a wide range of decision criteria and set priorities among objectives.
This approach does not necessarily identify an “optimal” adaptation option, but rather
requires the analyst to draw a conclusion by looking at the Awhole picture”. The
advantage of TEAM is that it provides an interactive format to help structure and define
the decisions under consideration.
The TEAM software includes components on coastal resources, water resources, and
agriculture, as well as a generic assessment component. The software asks the user to
enter information through a guided question-and-answer sequence and then uses a
menu-driven graphic presentation of results for the evaluation of adaptation options.
The user selects specific “strategies” or adaptation options and criteria and then assigns
a relative score (excellent, good, fair, and poor) for how each strategy meets each
criterion. In addition to qualitative rankings, the user has the option to enter absolute
data for each strategy (e.g., dollar amounts).
The TEAM software requires an IBM-compatible 386 PC with a 3.5" disk drive and a
mouse. To run TEAM, the user also needs Microsoft Windows (Version 3.1 or higher)
and Microsoft Excel (Version 5.0c).
Adaptation to Climate Change
5-15
Level of Precision. The results provided by this method are relative and do not neces-
sarily identify a single preferred option, but allow the user to consider multiple criteria.
This method is very flexible in the level of effort required and, consequently, the level of
precision provided by results. For example, this method can be used to quickly generate
results based on expert judgement or can be used in conjunction with detailed benefit-
cost analyses to incorporate multiple criteria. In presenting results, it is important to
highlight the subjective nature of relative rankings to ensure that quantitative scoring
does not imply a level of precision that is unwarranted.
Ability to Address Uncertainties. This method allows the analyst to quickly and easily
adjust relative scoring or to weight various criteria to test the sensitivity of the analysis
to uncertainties, and thus to develop a range of potential results.
Input Needed. The experts will need to be able to develop relative rankings of how
selected measures compare to selected criteria. This will require familiarity with the
results of the impact assessment, potential changes in socio-economic conditions in the
absence of climate change, current planning or investment initiatives, and relative costs
and benefits of measures, implementation barriers, and other adaptation or mitigation
policies.
Resource Requirements. The resources needed for this method can be relatively modest,
but depend on the level of effort that goes into developing the relative rankings of
different measures. The more effort that goes into evaluating how the options perform
against specific criteria the more precise the results will be. It may only take a few
hours to complete an initial analysis using the TEAM software. However, the effort to
provide necessary information to the experts involved, build consensus among
stakeholders, and develop a format for presenting the results of this analysis could
require an investment of a few days to several months.
5.3.4 Adaptation decision matrix
The Adaptation Decision Matrix (ADM) is presented in the US Country Studies
Program’s Steps in Preparing Climate Change Action Plans: A Handbook (Benioff
and Warren, 1996). This approach uses a decision matrix to analyse the cost-effec-
tiveness of adaptation options by comparing costs measured in dollars with benefits
measured in a common metric, but not necessarily monetary units.3  This approach is
useful when many important aspects of a decision cannot be easily monetised.
Level of Precision. The advantage of this approach is that it provides a way to identify
the most preferred measure for reaching a goal and incorporates multiple criteria or
objectives. However, it does not obviate the need for detailed research and analysis to
                                                  
3 
This approach differs somewhat from the description of cost-effectiveness analysis in
Section 5.3.6 because in the ADM method the estimate of benefits is usually subjective and
combines several different types of benefit attributes, whereas in cost-effectiveness analysis
either the benefits or the costs are fixed and a measure of effectiveness is developed ( such
as monetary units per lives saved).
UNEP/IVM Handbook
5-16
provide a basis for evaluating the adaptation measures against the criteria of interest.
Without such detailed analysis, the scoring may be mainly subjective and thus not
necessarily reliable for policy making.
Ability to Address Uncertainties. Similar to the TEAM software, this method allows
the analyst to quickly and easily adjust relative scoring or to weight various criteria to
conduct sensitivity tests and develop a range of potential results.
Input Needed. The experts will need to be able to (1) develop either qualitative or
quantitative estimates of how measures compare to selected criteria and (2) estimate the
cost of implementing such measures. It is important to note that to evaluate relative
cost-effectiveness the metric used to estimate benefits must be the same across all
criteria. Developing such estimates will require familiarity with the results of the impact
assessment, potential changes in socio-economic conditions in the absence of climate
change, current planning or investment initiatives, and relative costs and benefits of
measures, implementation barriers, and other adaptation or mitigation policies.
Resource Requirements. Similar to the TEAM software, the resources needed for this
method depend on the level of effort that goes into developing the benefit and cost
estimates for different measures. Depending on the level of expertise, information
available, and desire to build consensus, this approach could require an investment of
only a few days to several months.
5.3.5 Benefit-cost analysis
Unlike cost-effectiveness analysis and multi-criteria assessment, benefit-cost analysis
can be used to determine whether an individual adaptation response is economically
justified (i.e., are its benefits greater than its costs?) The other evaluations can be used
to rank responses but not to determine whether they should be undertaken at all.
A benefit-cost analysis involves essentially two steps: identifying and screening benefits
and costs to be included in the analysis, and converting them to monetary units when
possible. No economic analysis is able to account for every benefit and cost, but
including all important benefits and costs is key to a valid analysis. The following
description of benefit-cost analysis is adapted from Smith et al. (1997).
A methodical identification and screening analysis is useful for ensuring that all po-
tentially important types of benefits and costs have been considered. Using lists of
potential climate change impacts and possible adaptation measures, applicable benefit
or cost categories can be identified. The identification and screening process provides
the foundation for an economic evaluation of adaptation measures. Economic evalua-
tion consists of quantifying and valuing the benefits and costs. Quantification entails
measuring the benefits and costs in terms of their physical effects on market systems
and non-market systems. Valuation entails converting the magnitude of each benefit or
cost from physical units to monetary units.
Level of Precision. This method can be used to develop detailed and robust analyses of
adaptation measures. However, this approach can be highly resource intensive,
Adaptation to Climate Change
5-17
particularly when primary research is undertaken. As an alternative, expedited evalua-
tion methods when carefully applied are very useful, particularly within the context of
project evaluation. However, expedited methods are not generally as precise or tech-
nically defensible as primary research. In some cases, expedited evaluations will not be
of sufficient technical quality or comprehensiveness to provide an accurate perspective
of a measure’s overall merits and faults.
Ability to Address Uncertainties. This method is amenable to a variety of techniques to
address uncertainties (see Section 5.3.7).
Input Needed. The analysts will need to be able to develop qualitative and quantitative
estimates of the costs and benefits associated with an adaptation measure. Developing
such estimates involves having the right types of data, technical expertise, and profes-
sional judgement about the use of prices or the development of more appropriate
measures of welfare. It also will require familiarity with impact assessments, future
socio-economic baselines, and similar measures that have already been implemented
either in the current areas of interest or in a comparable geographic region. Limitations
in available data can prevent the useful application of this method.
Resource Requirements. This method is relatively resource intensive and depends on
the availability of sufficient time, budget, and expertise to undertake a detailed analysis.
Expedited evaluation methods include a range of techniques and practices that require
fewer resources; however, even these expedited techniques are generally more resource
intensive than methods that rely on expert judgement. Depending on the level of
expertise and information available, this approach could require an investment of
several months to several years.
5.3.6 Cost-effectiveness analysis
Cost-effectiveness analysis is a variation of cost-benefit analysis in which either
benefits or costs are fixed. This method is applicable when it is difficult to quantify and
monetise benefits. In such cases, it may be possible to compare adaptation measures by
determining their cost differences for achieving a fixed level of effectiveness.
Level of Precision. If the goals of the assessment are amenable to this type of analysis,
this method can be used to develop results with sufficient precision for decision making.
However, because benefits and costs are measured in different units, cost-effectiveness
analysis provides no direct guidance when it is unclear whether the total benefit from an
adaptation measure justifies the total cost, or when the optimal budget level for an
adaptation measure is unclear.
Ability to Address Uncertainties. The sensitivity of results generated using this method
can be tested by varying the fixed value (benefits or costs). In addition, a variety of
techniques may be used to address uncertainties (see Section 5.3.7).
Input Needed. Because benefits will need to be quantified only in a common metric
(rather than monetised), the input needs for this method are somewhat less burdensome
than those for benefit-cost analysis. However, as in benefit-cost analysis, developing
UNEP/IVM Handbook
5-18
quantitative estimates of benefits will require familiarity with impact assessments,
future socio-economic baselines, and similar measures that have already been
completed either in the current area of interest or in a comparable geographic region.
Resource Requirements. Although this method is somewhat less resource intensive than
benefit-cost analysis, it still requires a considerable commitment of time and resources.
Depending on the level of expertise and information available, this approach could
require an investment of several months to several years.
5.3.7 Approaches for addressing uncertainty and risk
Analysis of climate change adaptation measures involves a number of analytical chal-
lenges, including scientific uncertainties, economic uncertainties, data limitations, and
the need to evaluate issues that may not readily be conceived of in monetary terms. The
following approaches can be used, in conjunction with quantitative analyses of
adaptation measures, to address uncertainty and risk (adapted from Hurd et al., 1997,
and Hobbs et al., 1997).
1. Sensitivity analysis. This is the process of determining whether varying input
values significantly alters the output value (net benefits). In other words, deter-
mining whether the decision has characteristics that suggest that climate change (or
other sources of uncertainty) could be relevant.
2. Use of scenarios. This approach is generally used for climate parameters, but it can
also be used for other areas of uncertainty. It involves generating a limited set of
plausible input values and their associated outcomes (net benefits). Evaluating a
measure under both “worst case” and “best case” scenarios can illustrate whether
uncertainty is important to the final decision.
3. Switch-point analysis. This approach is used to identify the conditions that would
be necessary to alter a decision regarding whether or not to implement an adapta-
tion measure. For example, how much would climate need to change to make an
adaptation measure the preferred alternative? Or, if a decision were made assuming
no climate change, but global warming occurred anyway, would the potential loss
of net benefits be significant enough to alter a choice of adaptation measures? A
decision maker can then evaluate this information against subjective probabilities
(e.g., how likely is it that such a climate change will occur?).
4. Decision analysis under uncertainty. This approach applies decision criteria such
as maximising the payoff by selecting the adaptation with the largest potential gain
(“maximax”) or minimising the maximum regret (“minimax”) by avoiding the most
damaging outcome to evaluate alternative measures when the probabilities
associated with various inputs or outcomes are unknown.
5. Decision analysis under risk. This approach use a decision criterion (e.g., maxi-
mise the expected payoff) in conjunction with subjective probabilities or probability
distributions for the inputs of the analysis (e.g., risks, values, costs) to evaluate the
payoffs from alternative measures. This approach can be presented in a payoff
Adaptation to Climate Change
5-19
matrix or a decision tree. If delaying implementation of adaptation measures is
feasible, the benefits of waiting a decade or longer for better information could be
evaluated using Bayesian analysis (for example, see Hobbs et al., 1997).
Each of these approaches provides insight into the relevance of uncertainty in a decision
about whether or not to implement a specific adaptation measure. The analyst can begin
with the least resource-intensive approaches (e.g., meta-analysis, sensitivity analysis)
and can use the results of these analyses to determine whether more sophisticated
approaches (e.g., probabilistic approaches) are warranted. Examples of these
approaches can be found in the literature on quantitative analysis (e.g., Stokey and
Zeckhauser, 1978; McKenna, 1980; Clemen, 1990; Finkle, 1990; Morgan and Henrion,
1990; Perrings, 1991; Ready, 1995; Dakins et al., 1996; Schimmelpfennig, 1996;
Hobbs et al., 1997).
5.3.8 Implementation analysis
Another method that relies on expert judgement and allows for consideration of multiple
criteria is implementation analysis. Rather than evaluating the relative benefits from
different adaptation measures, this method focuses on identifying the least costly
measure (in terms of money, time, political capital, etc.). This approach is useful when
it can be assumed that the benefits of different adaptation measures will be comparable.
In applying this method, the analyst identifies any implementation barriers and
evaluates how difficult or easy it will be to overcome these barriers. A matrix can be
used to identify barriers, actions to overcome the barriers, what time and financial
resources are required, and the degree of difficulty (i.e., a summary of the other criteria)
in overcoming the barriers. A three-point rating system can be used in which one X
represents the barrier easiest to overcome and three Xs represent those most difficult to
overcome. The results from the analysis of barriers can be used to adjust rankings of
measures developed from a benefit-cost analysis, an ADM analysis, or a TEAM multi-
attribute analysis. However, if the barriers are only a matter of cost, the estimated costs
of overcoming the barriers can be entered directly into the evaluation of adaptation
options. The IPCC’s (1990) Report of the Coastal Zone Management Subgroup:
Strategies for Adaptation to Sea Level Rise provides a description of potential
environmental, economic, social, legal, and institutional barriers to adapting to sea level
rise (this report also groups sea level rise adaptation options in three categories, retreat,
accommodate, and protect, and describes how the potential barriers differ between these
groups).
Level of Precision. This approach is useful when benefits can be assumed to be positive
and comparable among a set of adaptation measures. The level of precision provided
depends on the effort spent in estimating the requirements for overcoming barriers, and
this approach will not necessarily identify a single preferred measure.
Ability to Address Uncertainties. This method does not include any formal provisions
to explicitly consider uncertainties in the assessment. It is left to the experts to weigh
potential uncertainties.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
5-20
Input Needed. The experts will need to be able to develop qualitative or quantitative
estimates of what it would take to overcome identified barriers to implementation.
Developing such estimates will require familiarity with similar implementation efforts
that have already been completed either in the area of interest or in a comparable
geographic region.
Resource Requirements. The resources needed for this method depend on the level of
effort that goes into developing the estimates for overcoming implementation barriers
associated with different measures. Depending on the level of expertise, information
available, and desire to build consensus, this approach could require an investment of
only a few days to several months.

6.1  Nature of the problem
In the water resources sector, technology, economics, and institutions interact to make
water supply meet water demand. In managing water resource systems, water managers
ask, “Can we modify the management of current systems to adapt to climate change?”,
“How might climate change impact the design of new water resource infrastructure?”,
and “Should climate change be included in our current planning?”.
The water resources sector by its nature is very adaptive, on various time and spatial
scales. Also, water managers have a wealth of knowledge and experience managing
under changing hydrologic and socio-economic conditions. This experience places them
in a good situation to be able to adapt the operation of their systems to a change in
climate, if that change is not too great or too rapid.
This chapter takes a comprehensive view of climate change impacts on water resources;
it includes water demand and water resources management as well as water supply.
Water resources management (i.e., the water supply infrastructure and operating
procedures) is an important aspect of a climate change assessment because it is used to
redistribute water supply both spatially and temporally to meet water demand. Insights
can be gained and conclusions drawn from analysing only the physical impacts on water
supply and water demand, but the focus of the approach presented here is to provide

insights for decision and policy makers as to the potential impacts of climate change on
the water resources sector and the options for adaptation.
This chapter familiarises the user with the range of methods that are appropriate for (1)
estimating the biophysical impacts of climate change on hydrologic resources in terms
of water quantity (annual and seasonal distribution) and quality, and aquatic ecosystem
effects; and (2) estimating the socio-economic impacts of climate change on both water
demand (including direct impacts on hydrologic resources and indirect impacts via other
biophysical impacts) and water resources management parameters (including, but not
limited to, river runoff, reservoir yields, supply reliability, hydropower production,
water use, supply/demand balances, effects and costs of adaptation, and economic
impacts with and without adaptations). The potential climate change impacts to various
components of the water resources sector are summarised below.
Biophysical impacts
Hydrologic resources. The main components of the hydrologic cycle are precipitation,
evaporation, and transpiration. Changes in the climate parameters – solar radiation,
wind, temperature, humidity, and cloudiness – will affect evaporation and transpiration.
Changes in evapotranspiration and precipitation will affect the amount and the
distribution, spatially and temporally, of surface runoff. Changes in runoff in combi-
nation with sea level rise will affect streamflow and groundwater flow. Streamflow and
groundwater are considered natural water or hydrologic resources.
Water quality. All offstream water withdrawals change the chemical, biological, or
thermal quality of the water during use, and when that water is released back to the
stream, it can affect the water quality of the receiving water body. For water quality
and environmental protection needs, the water management system can be designed to
provide either dilution flows or wastewater treatment. Climate change can affect the
water quality aspect of the water management system in three ways. First, reduced
hydrologic resources may leave less dilution flow in the stream, leading to degraded
water quality or increased investments in wastewater treatment. Second, higher tem-
peratures reduce the dissolved oxygen content in water bodies. Third, in response to
climate change, water uses, especially those for agriculture, may increase the concen-
tration of pollution being released to the streams. Together, these pose a threat to the
water quality and the integrity of the aquatic ecosystem.
Aquatic ecosystem. {tc "Aquatic ecosystem (natural water demands) " \l 2.} There are
many complex interactions among the elements of the aquatic ecosystem, which
comprises natural water demands. Climate is a direct input to the energy source and
chemical variables of the system, and an indirect input to the flow regime, habitat
structure, and biotic factors. These elements are in a sensitive balance. Even a slight
change to just a few of the key elements can greatly affect the integrity of the eco-
system.
Water Resources
6-3
Socio-economic impacts
Water demand. Water use is generally divided into non-market and market uses. Non-
market water uses are aesthetic uses, certain recreational uses, and aquatic ecosystem
integrity.
Market water uses can be aggregated into five major water use sectors:
• 
Agriculture: Irrigation and livestock;
• 
Industry: Industrial, mining, navigation, recreation;
• 
Energy: Thermoelectric cooling and hydroelectric power;
• 
Municipal: Public supply, domestic, and commercial;
• 
Reservoir.
An additional market use is dilution water for pollution abatement. It is typically
considered a market use because it can be valued at the cost savings of additional waste
treatment to meet water quality standards.
Water management system. The water management system (i.e., water supply system)
is made of two parts: surface water and groundwater. Although they are linked at the
river basin water balance level, they are distinct in the water supply infrastructure.
Climate change can affect the surface water supply via reduced flows into the storage
reservoir or increased variability in inflow, which will affect firm yields from existing
storage facilities. An additional impact in arid and semi-arid regions could be increased
reservoir evaporative losses. The groundwater supply will be affected by increased or
decreased percolation of water due to changes in the amount and distribution of
precipitation and streamflow. This can lead to increased pumping costs if percolation
decreases because of decreased precipitation or losses of soil moisture from increased
evapotranspiration.
6.1.1  Components of a water resources assessment
With great uncertainties about the local and regional impacts of climate change on
hydrologic resources and uncertain future water demands driven by socio-economic
change, an assessment of climate change impacts on water resources is a complex
process. In addressing the sensitivity of water resources to changes in climate, the
biophysical and socio-economic conditions must be considered.
To help policy and decision makers focus on the issues of climate change and water
resources, it is recommended to divide the assessment process into five main com-
ponents:
• 
Assessment of biophysical impacts on:
− 
hydrologic resources,
UNEP/IVM Handbook
6-4
− 
water quality, and
− 
aquatic ecosystem integrity.
• 
Assessment of socio-economic impacts on:
− 
demand from market water use sectors, and
− 
water resources management systems.
The assessment of climate change impacts on the hydrologic resources of a country is
the first and most important assessment to be carried out because a wide range of
modelling tools allows for a quantitative analysis of climate change impacts, and
hydrologic resources are the key component of the entire water resources sector (i.e.,
aquatic ecosystems, water quality, water use, and water management are all based on
the hydrologic resources of a country).
For national assessments with limited budgets, it may be possible to analyse only a
single component of the water resources sector. If so, it is recommended that the im-
pacts on the hydrologic resources be assessed. Expert judgement could then be used to
assess impacts on the other sector components. For example, under increased tempe-
ratures, wetlands will experience increased potential evapotranspiration, as well as
reduced streamflows to the wetlands. Thus, the wetlands would experience both
increased demand for water and reduced supply of water, which would decrease
wetland area. This type of analysis can be attempted at a quantitative or qualitative
level, depending on data and expertise.
If there are sufficient resources to perform a quantitative assessment of additional
components, priority should be based on the relative social, ecological, and economic
importance of each component to the country. For example, a country highly dependent
upon irrigated agriculture should assess impacts on water use and the water man-
agement system. A country dependent upon wildlife, sport fishing, or eco-tourism
should analyse the impacts on aquatic ecosystems.
There are no formal guidelines for determining priorities. Local experts in consultation
with international impact assessment experts should be able to develop a country study
plan that fits within the given budget constraints. Alternatively, a reasonable budget
should be developed which allows for a comprehensive analysis of impacts at the
country level.
6.1.2 Key considerations in defining the scope
The steps below highlight key considerations in defining the scope of a water resources
assessment.
Select the exposure unit
The river basin would generally be the most appropriate primary exposure unit for
assessing impacts on hydrologic resources. The relationship between a river basin
impact assessment and a country level assessment can take four different forms:
Water Resources
6-5
1. The river basin assessed covers only a portion of the total watershed and the
country's hydroclimatic characteristics are homogeneous (e.g., the Nitra River in
Slovakia is part of the Danube Basin, but representative of most of Slovakia).
2. The river basin assessed covers only a portion of the total watershed and the
country has two or more distinct hydroclimatic zones (e.g., Kazakhstan’s eastern
river, the Ulba Ula).
3. The watershed is encompassed in a large regional or international river basin and is
in an upper basin location (e.g., Uganda and Sudan are completely within the upper
portion of the Nile Basin).
4. The watershed is encompassed in a large regional or international river basin and is
in a lower basin location (e.g., Bangladesh is in the lower part of the Ganges and
Brahmaputra systems; Vietnam is in the lower part of the Mekong Basin).
Define the study area
The study area should be selected according to the hydrology and the specific goals of
the assessment. Two general types of study areas, representative basin or sub-area, can
be used.
If the river basin assessed covers only a portion of the total watershed, then the river
basin can be used as a representative basin. A country located in a single hydroclimatic
zone can be represented by a single basin. A country made up of two or more distinct
hydroclimatic zones can be represented by a river basin from each zone.
If the watershed lies completely within a large regional or international river basin, then
two sub-area approaches can be used. Countries located in the headwaters of the basin
(upper basin location) can use a single upstream sub-area basin. Countries located in
the middle or downstream of the basin (lower basin location) should assess both the
upstream portion of the basin as well as the country’s portion.
Select a time horizon
The temporal and spatial scales of an assessment are linked in hydrologic modelling and
depend on the type of impact to be assessed. For floods, a small time step of hours or
days is needed, whereas for droughts, months to years are needed. Yates and Strzepek
(1994) have shown that, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions, an annual time step
does not capture climate change impacts well and a seasonal or monthly model is
needed.
For countries with limited streamflow data, an annual time step is recommended for the
hydrologic assessment. Only mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature
are used to predict basin runoff. Although not extremely accurate for modelling current
runoff, use of an annual time step is adequate to predict the change in the basin runoff
UNEP/IVM Handbook
6-6
associated with changes in temperature and precipitation. Thus, it provides an adequate
indication of a river basin's sensitivity to climate change.
For countries with sufficient streamflow and climate data, a monthly lumped integral
model or water balance approach is recommended for the hydrologic assessment.
However, monthly models might not capture the true response of the basin to precipit-
ation events distributed throughout the month, so it is important to understand what
kind of error is introduced when aggregating temporally. As an example, if data are
given daily and aggregated uniformly over the month, information that gives insight into
a basin's response to storm events can be lost. The total monthly precipitation could
occur during one storm, but when applied uniformly over the month, true soil moisture
dynamics might not be captured.
In hydrologic modelling, the temporal scale determines the spatial scale. For example,
flash floods that last 1 to 12 hours occur in basins on a scale of 1 to 200 square miles.
A larger lumped spatial scale will not capture the dynamics of this event. Thus, the
spatial scale should be sufficiently small so that the flood wave can travel one spatial
step in less than a single time step. Although the primary exposure unit for assessing
hydrologic climate impacts suggested in this chapter is a river basin, in some cases,
river basins will need to be divided into sub-basins to ensure that the spatial scale
matches the selected temporal scale.
The other components of a water resources assessment require longer time steps and
larger spatial scales. For these components, it is better to aggregate the hydrologic
assessment over time and space than to increase the temporal and spatial scales of the
hydrologic analyses to match the socio-economic and water management systems
analyses.
Identify a preliminary range of adaptations
Identifying preliminary adaptation measures allows the user to ensure that the selected
methods will be useful for evaluating adaptation and that assessments of related sectors
that may affect adaptation possibilities will be undertaken (e.g., if one of the adaptation
measures considered is implementation of more efficient irrigation practices, an
agriculture assessment should also be performed).
The first step in identifying preliminary adaptation options is to determine whether the
country (or river basin of interest) has a dominant water use such as thermoelectric
cooling or irrigation. If a dominant water use is identified, then this activity should be
examined for adaptation opportunities. For example, where irrigation is important, crop
water use and yield could be modelled as a function of temperature and precipitation.
Alternatively, areas of large municipal demand could be examined using a tool to model
possible water saving via various demand management schemes. Thus, identifying
preliminary adaptation options can help direct and focus the assessment process.
Water Resources
6-7
Determine general data availability
The data required for a water resources assessment are a mixture of hydrometeorolo-
gical and socio-economic data. In general, a water resources assessment requires
substantial amounts of reliable data to lend credence to the results being generated. The
key is to find a study site (i.e., a river basin) that has a sufficiently long runoff record,
no less than 10 years of data. Ideally, this basin will also have a corresponding climate
record of the same or longer period.
Much of the needed data can be found in published sources, whereas estimates such as
changes in technology and future water use require educated guesses of experts. Listed
in the tables in Section 6.2 are the data needs for each of the assessment components.
Section 6.3 provides sources for these data. The issues of providing spatially averaged
values and generating mean monthly values are discussed in detail in the references and
suggested readings are provided at the end of this chapter.
Determine the need for integration across sectors
The water resources sector does not function in isolation. Water resources are a com-
mon link to several sectors. The human health, fisheries, coastal zone, and agriculture
sectors typically will need specific information about water resources impacts for their
impact assessments. Water resources researchers should have strong linkages to other
sectors being assessed so that selected methods and approaches satisfy the needs of
other sectors and data are shared across sectors. Water resources needs to be con-
ceptualised as an integrated sector and not as an independent one.
6.2  An array of methods
The user should critically review the methods available to assess the biophysical and
socio-economic impacts of climate change before selecting and testing one or more that
will be used. This section provides an overview of available methods for the biophysical
components of a water resources assessment: hydrologic resources, water quality, and
aquatic ecosystem integrity; and the socio-economic components: demand from water
use sectors and the water management system. Each subsection presents a brief
theoretical background of techniques and methods and discusses the application of the
techniques in assessing climate change impacts. To assist the user, the strengths and
weaknesses of each method are also described. Countries with extensive hydrologic
modelling experience and existing distributed integral and distributed differential
models should continue to use these models.
As a general caution, when choosing a method for analysing climate change impacts on
water resources, it is important to keep in mind the difference between precision and
accuracy in analysis, particularly in quantitative modelling. Models with very detailed
spatial and temporal representations of biophysical processes require much data but can
predict, precisely, the impact of climate change on the state of the system at a particular
location and time. However, models that describe the potential change in the driving
climate variables provide very coarse and uncertain outputs both in space and time.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
6-8
These models are not very precise. If the results from the climate models are used to
drive precise process models, the results may be precise but will not be accurate,
because the exact changes in climate parameters at the level of detail of the process
model are not known.
An example would be trying to assess the impact of climate change on flash floods
using standard general circulation models (GCM) estimates of monthly precipitation.
Flash floods usually occur on catchments of less than 500 square kilometres with
rainfall events of less than 6 hours. Hydrologic methods to model this process are very
detailed and precise. Standard GCM precipitation output is often on a spatial scale of
50,000 square kilometres and a time scale of one month. The GCM results typically
provide very little information about the small-scale weather systems responsible for
flash floods. Using imprecise GCM output with a precise hydrologic model will provide
precise streamflows that are not very accurate. Three approaches that can be used to
address this problem are estimates of climate change that account for spatial variability,
techniques to account for uncertainty in estimates, and careful presentation of the
results to appropriately reflect their true accuracy.
6.2.1 Criteria for selecting methods to assess biophysical
impacts
The methodologies and modelling approaches presented here span a wide range of
spatial and temporal scales. The choices to be made in method selection depend on the
hydroclimatic conditions, water resource modelling expertise, data availability, and the
resources (time and funding) dedicated to the water resources assessment. If resources
are limited, the scope of the analysis can be limited and a detailed analysis can be
conducted on a few study sites or sector components, rather than a simple analysis with
a comprehensive scope. The relative performance of recommended models against these
criteria is shown in Tables 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4, which summarise available models.
6.2.1.1 Assessment of hydrologic resources impacts
Techniques to assess impacts on hydrologic resources are available for all spatial and
temporal scales of analysis and for all levels of local data availability. Four methods for
assessing impacts on hydrologic resources are described: expert judgement, analogue
methods, predictive models, and process-based models.
Expert judgement
In terms of assessing climate change impacts on hydrologic resources, expert judgement
has a very limited role. Given the data availability and expertise in water resources, it is
likely that for all but the smallest budgets some quantitative modelling of hydrologic
resources could be performed. However, if additional modelling is infeasible, expert
judgement is a valuable tool in assessing impacts on water quality, aquatic ecosystems,
water demand, and water management systems. In applying expert judgement, the user
Water Resources

should be aware that experts may have difficulty estimating the consequences of events
that have not been experienced and may not be able to provide estimates with sufficient
accuracy for decision making.

Analogue methods
Examination of past extreme events is useful for showing how systems actually were
affected by climate variation and how they responded. For example, Campos and
Sanchez (1995), used past El Niño events as an analogue climate change scenario for
Costa Rica and Panama. This study found important decreases in reservoir storage,
reduction of firm power generation, and an increase in fossil fuel burning for electricity
generation. The problem with analogue scenarios is that greenhouse gas induced climate
change is likely to differ from past events, and care should be taken in finding and using
appropriate analogues. Nonetheless, analogues can be useful for analysing the
vulnerability of the water resources sector to extreme events.
Predictive models
Predictive models which are based on empirical and statistical relationships can be used
for quick and low cost assessments. However, because these models do not account for
physical thresholds, the process-based models described below generally are most
appropriate for water resources impact assessments. Many of the predictive models are
based on a fundamental theorem in hydrologic theory that was first developed by Dooge
(1992). This theorem suggests that when looking at the long-term water balance of a
large catchment or region, an appropriate assumption is that the change in storage is
zero. Dooge (1992) points out that any estimate of the impact of climate change on
water resources depends on the ability to relate change in actual evapotranspiration to
estimated changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. Thus, annual
average statistical values of a watershed have been used to develop models that can
estimate impacts to water resources. Two annual models are a model developed by Turc
(1954), which relates precipitation and temperature to runoff, and a model developed by
Ol?dekop (as cited in Yates, 1996), which relates precipitation, evapotranspiration, and
potential evapotranspiration to runoff.
Process-based models
Process-based hydrologic models are a class of numerical models used to describe the
response of watersheds to climatic inputs. Although the available models vary in pre-
cision, they all fall within the acceptable level of accuracy for estimating climate change
impacts. Yates et al. (1997) compared hydrologic assessment techniques ranging from
simple to complex and found that they estimate the same magnitude and direction of
impacts.
Four classifications or methodologies for modelling hydrologic processes were identi-
fied by Todini (1988). In increasing order of data needs, these classifications are
stochastic, lumped integral, distributed integral, and distributed differential models.
Water Resources
6-13
The stochastic modelling approach centers on developing relationships that describe an
output variable like runoff in terms of input variables such as precipitation and
temperature, without prescribing the physical processes that occur.
Lumped integral models are physically based models that normally use the fewest
number of parameters that can describe a basin’s response to climatological events.
These models are designed to look at medium-to-large watershed areas (100 to 30,000
square kilometres; Z. Kaczmarek, Polish Institute of Geophysics, personal communi-
cation, 1997) and are often referred to as water balance models. These models are not
usually applicable to event-scale processes (daily or hourly precipitation events), but
are used after uniformly lumping a sequence of events (precipitation and runoff) to
monthly mean values. The catchment or sub-catchment is modelled as a single, homo-
genous unit subject to uniform events and parameters. Parameters for this model type
usually are not meant to represent physical catchment characteristics. These models can
incorporate interannual variability by accounting for changes in catchment storage. The
common link in most water balance approaches is the computation of a mass balance
within the soil moisture zone. There are many ways of representing the infiltration,
discharge, and storage behaviour of the soil moisture zone (Shaw, 1983; Chow et al.,
1988; Rawls et al., 1993). However, it has been shown that some basins are quite
sensitive to the estimation of potential evapotranspiration, so an accurate representation
of this variable is important (Dooge, 1992; Yates and Strzepek, 1994).
CLIRUN (Kaczmarek, 1991) is a water balance runoff model that has been applied in
many climate change assessments. The approach from this model was adapted and
integrated into WATBAL, a climate impact assessment tool for studying river basin
response to climate change (Yates, 1996) (see Box 6.1).
There are two major sources of water pollution: non-point sources (e.g., agriculture
runoff) and point sources (e.g., municipal and industrial discharges). Climate change
could have significant impacts on non-point source pollution from agriculture. In
addition, cooling water discharges could be affected by changes in temperature and
streamflow. However, climate change should have little impact on per capita or per
industrial unit pollution from municipal and industrial sources.
A wide variety of water quality models, in terms of both water quality constituents and
level of detail, are available. Some of these models include simple conservative dilution
models, simple dissolved oxygen models, detailed dissolved oxygen models (with the
nitrogen and phosphorus cycles modelled), toxics models, and advective diffusion
models for temperature, dissolved oxygen, nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus),
algae/periphyton/macrophytes, and pH.
For non-point source pollutants, there are area- and model-based methods for esti-
mating pollutant loadings to receiving waters. Simple area-based loadings can be used
as inputs to river and lake/reservoir water quality models. Where data and resources
exist, models of non-point source loadings can be used, and adaptations can also be
evaluated. Chapra (1996) provides a detailed background of water quality modelling
UNEP/IVM Handbook

and simplified tools of analysis. See Box 6.2 for an example of how a water quality
model has been used to analyse climate change impacts.

The results show that for a 2°C global warming all scenarios estimate approximately a 30%
increase in mean flooding, but less than a 5 % increase for the 20-year flood (P>Q =0.05).

Example: Impact of climate change on water quality and
wastewater treatment costs on the Nitra River Basin, Slovakia
(Carmichael et al., 1996).
Background: Climate change is expected to lead to increased river and lake temperatures,
due to the interaction of these bodies with air, by mixing and surface interaction. Changes in
water temperature affect water quality. For example, the saturation concentration of dissolved
oxygen and the reaction rates of BOD, nitrogen and phosphorus with dissolved oxygen and
with phytoplankton all will change in response to water temperature changes
Problem: To estimate climate change impacts on water quality and waste water treatment
costs on the Nitra River Basin, Slovakia.
Methods The meteorological relationship between air temperature and river temperature is
estimated using regression analysis. River water temperature is regressed on air temperature,
using a 29-year time series for the region. This yields the necessary coefficients for estimating
how great the climate change impact will be on the hydrologic system.
The hydrological system is modelled using Qual2e, which was developed by USEPA and the
Environmental Research Laboratory in Athens, Georgia, USA (Brown and Barnwell, 1987).
The effects of changes in river water temperature and river flows on river water quality may
then be analysed. The economic model incorporates two processes. First, the impacts of
pollutant emissions from each polluting site on dissolved oxygen quality levels downstream
are included. Second, the economic costs of choosing different treatment options (primary,
secondary, tertiary, etc.) at each polluting site are included. The model is then able to choose
the least-cost combination of treatment plants, across all polluting sites, that will improve
dissolved oxygen concentrations to predetermined levels.

Box 6.2, Figure 1 Impact of Climate Change on Least Cost Water Quality Solution for
the Nitra River
Testing of methods/sensitivity: the models are calibrated for existing conditions and
observed DO levels are compared.
Scenarios: Two synthetic local scenarios were developed by researchers in the Hydro-
Meteorological Service.
Impacts: The results indicate that costs required to reach generally acceptable quality levels
rise exponentially, particularly in August and October. Extremely expensive wastewater treat-
ment technologies may be partially avoided under the present situation, while significant im-
provements in water quality are still accomplished. Under the climate change scenario, these
expensive technologies are forced into use at a much lower water quality standard. Only small
quality improvements may be accomplished before costs rise dramatically.

Table 6.3 presents a summary of available water quality assessment models and des-
cribes the general requirements for each model. Data requirements for these models are
burdensome, and the choice of model will depend on data availability. The user should
choose the surface water quality model (streams and reservoirs) that has appropriate
temporal and spatial scales for the chosen scope of analysis and the data available.

6.2.1.2  Assessment of aquatic ecosystem integrity impacts
The aquatic ecosystem is complex, and assessment of this system will most likely
depend on the construction of predictive models. Freshwater ecosystems contain flora
and fauna such as algae, periphyton, and macrophytes residing directly in the water,
and these are affected by water quantity and quality. Models of these systems are
sometimes considered water quality models (see above), and many exist.
Assessing impacts on other aspects of the aquatic ecosystem (such as fish, waterfowl,
and wildlife that depend on water quality and quantity) requires integration with bio-
logical assessment methods that have been developed for other sectors such as biodi-
versity and fisheries. The results of a hydrologic assessment are often required as inputs
for these other sectoral assessments. For example, fish are sensitive to water
temperature and dissolved oxygen contents. Thus, modelling the climate change impacts
on these parameters provides the necessary information for assessing impacts to
fisheries.

6.2.2 Criteria for selecting methods to assess socio-
economic impacts
The methodologies and modelling approaches presented here span a wide range of
spatial and temporal scales. There is no single model or approach appropriate for all
socio-economic assessments of climate change impacts. Different approaches provide
different insights. Care must be taken to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the
approach being used and to identify the appropriate policy questions that it will be used
to answer. The selection of an approach will depend on the particular impact of concern
(e.g., job losses, changes in economic growth, relative growth of different sectors over
time) and the particular question being addressed (e.g., are there any significant
interactions between sectors as climate changes?). The approach should always be
selected based on the question of interest.
As with the biophysical methods, the choices to be made in method selection depends on
the hydroclimatic conditions, the water resource modelling expertise, data availability,
and the resources (time and funding) dedicated to the water resources assessment. The
relative performance of recommended models against these criteria is shown in Tables
6.4 and 6.5, which summarise available models.
6.2.2.1 Assessment of water demand impacts
When addressing climate change impacts on water demand, one is faced with two major
questions:
• 
What will the water demand be under future baseline conditions?
• 
How will climate change affect that baseline scenario?
In many respects, determining the impact of warmer temperatures and changes in pre-
cipitation on water demand is more straightforward than ?estimating? water demand 50
to 100 years in the future. Water demand is a function of population growth, economic
growth, and technological change. Techniques for developing future socio-economic
scenarios for these variables are described in Chapter 2. As part of the water resources
assessment, the socio-economic scenarios are used to estimate water demand in the
future and the expected change in water demand as a result of climate change.
Demand under future conditions
It will be very difficult within the scope of a climate change assessment to do more than
a simple ?statistical? approach to estimate water use:
Water UseRY= [ActivityRY] H [Water Use/Activity]RY ,
where RY is a reference year (year of interest for the assessment).
Water Resources
6-19
The ActivityRY will be developed as part of the future socio-economic baseline scenario.
However, the [Water Use/Activity]RY must also be estimated. The user should be
extremely careful when estimating this number and avoid the temptation of simply
applying the average water use per activity as obtained from historical data. It may be
that there are no data to justify changing this number. However, a reasonable alterna-
tive estimate should be developed based on an assessment of the factors that can affect
water demand (and on available reference documents).
What is the amount of water use by an industry, a municipality, or irrigated croplands?
Water demand is sometime confused with water requirements. Water requirement is the
minimum amount of water needed for social or economic activities. A water
requirement does not respond to the price of water supply. Although some social or
economic activities such as human daily water consumption or low-flow conditions for
navigation exhibit minimum needs or requirements, they are usually only a small part of
total water use in the activity.
Demand is a function of price as well as other factors, including the price of substitute
goods, institutional requirements or opportunities (e.g., environmental legislation), and
income. The user should consider all these factors when estimating demand for water
under climate change. For example, Kindler and Russell (1984) point out that per
capita domestic or municipal water use is positively correlated to per capita income and
inversely correlated to household size. Climate impact analyses for economies that are
likely to undergo large changes in per capita income and household sizes over the next
25 to 100 years need to address this issue.
In addition to estimating future water use, the user should also ensure that sensitivity
analyses are performed on the [Water Use/Activity]RY coefficient to examine the effect
of different demand levels on water resource vulnerability.
Demand under climate change conditions
Climate change may affect water use in five water use sectors: agricultural, industrial,
energy, municipal, and reservoir losses.
• 
Agricultural. Water use for agriculture includes irrigation and livestock water.
Changes in irrigation and livestock water use due to changes in temperature and
precipitation can be estimated using climate change impact assessment methods for
these sectors (see Chapters 6 and 9). Alternatively, irrigation water use can be
estimated by using the appropriate reference crop or crops and a potential evapo-
transpiration model. Irrigation water is used to make up the difference between crop
water requirements and precipitation. Thus, irrigation water use will be the
difference between actual evapotranspiration and the new precipitation estimates.
Livestock water use can best be estimated from the literature for livestock water
use versus climate data. If direct statistical relationships do not exist, then a spatial
analogue approach is suggested (i.e., find a location with current hydroclimatic
UNEP/IVM Handbook
6-20
conditions that are analogous to those forecast for the river basin of interest under
climate change and use the per head water use values).
• 
Industrial. Temperature and precipitation have little direct impact on the water use
of most industries. Reduction of flow in rivers due to climate change may put in-
creased pressure on waste treatment processes, leading to increased water recycling
and a decline in industrial water use, as seen in Sweden (Falkenmark, 1997).
• 
Energy. Water use for energy production takes two forms: hydroelectric and ther-
moelectric. Reduced flow will reduce hydropower reservoir storage and thus reduce
potential energy production. Warmer temperatures will increase evaporation from
reservoirs, so more streamflow will be required to maintain the same hydropower
energy production. Increased temperature has little direct effect on thermal
efficiency; however, increased river temperature and reduced flow can cause
cooling discharges to violate environmental standards (see Chapter 11).
• 
Municipal. Kindler and Russell (1984) observed that residential water use is
inversely correlated with rainfall and positively correlated with average tempera-
ture. Little work has been completed on the impact of long-term climate change on
domestic water use. Most analyses to date have drawn information from the
response of domestic water users to short-term droughts or warm periods. How-
ever, the user must be careful when selecting an analogue approach for domestic
water use because climate alone is not sufficient to determine an analogue. Similar
socio-economic indicators (income and household size) as well as climatic variables
must be used in selecting analogues since, as stated above, domestic water use is
correlated with these socio-economic indicators. In addition, short-term responses
of water use could be much different than responses to the prospect of permanent
water restrictions and possible lifestyle changes.
• 
Reservoir losses. Increased temperatures lead to increased evaporation, with all
other meteorological variables held constant. The increase in reservoir losses to
evaporation can be estimated using standard depth evaporation estimates, which are
based on estimates of lake or reservoir surface areas. Surface area is a function of
reservoir geometry and volume. The volume is a function of inflow (runoff) and
outflow (releases); therefore, demand and supply for reservoir water must be
analysed to quantitatively measure the impact of climate change on reservoir losses
to evaporation.
Total water demand is the summation over all water use sectors. The estimate of total
demand will reflect potential increases or decreases caused by climate change without
any adaptation. In assessing impacts, it is important to clearly identify the level of im-
pact associated with three alternatives: no adaptation, an assumed level of autonomous
adaptation, and planned adaptations.

6.2.2.2 Assessment of water management system impacts
Water management system impacts can be analysed using two different approaches.
First, water resource system modelling can be used to analyse reservoir systems and
determine how design and management assumptions might need to be changed. Second,
economic analyses can be used to assess how water demand and supply might be shifted
among water uses.
Water resource system modelling
Water resource infrastructure has been developed to protect socio-economic systems
from climate variability. The most important component in the water resource infra-
structure is the reservoir. This technological element is designed to adjust the temporal
distribution of water supply to the demands of the socio-economic system. This entails
storing water in wet periods of the year for release in dry periods; storing damaging
floodwater for slow, non-damaging release; and providing storage of highly variable
yearly flows.
Large capital expenses have been incurred to build water systems whose designs were
based on hydrologic regimes assumed to be driven by historical climate conditions.
However, if climate change reduces or increases river flow, the design assumptions will
need to change. The system may be able to adapt, but at what cost? Reduced flow will
mean less supply and potential economic damages. Increased flow may mean an under-
designed reservoir or spillway with potential flood risk, which may be reduced by
additional capital investment.
Two classes of river basin management models can be used to assess climate change
impacts: optimisation and simulation models. A monthly simulation approach would be
best if limited data are available. Table 6.4 presents a summary of available river basin
simulation models and describes the general requirements for each model. As in the
hydrologic assessment, any country with capabilities more advanced than those
recommended are encourage to use them as well as the recommended methodologies.
Box 6.3 provides an example of an assessment of climate change effects in Malawi.

Example: Impact of climate change on water resources of
Malawi (Chavula and Chirwa, 1996).
Problem: To estimate climate change impacts on the national water resources of Malawi and
to develop a national management strategy in light of the possible changes.
Methods: 1) Selection of the representative basin throughout the hydro-climatic zones of
Malawi, 2) hydro-meteorologic data analysis,  3) calibration and validation of the WATBAL
hydrologic model for the representative basins, 4) modelling of the climate change impacts on
the representative basins.
Testing of methods/sensitivity: The hydrologic model was calibrated and validated for three
basins using 10 years of climate and runoff data sets.
Scenarios: Synthetic sensitivity scenarios.
Impacts: Climate change impacts on water resources show an increase in annual runoff for the
GISS scenario and a decrease of runoff for the GFDL scenarios.

Adaptive response: Recommended adaptive responses to climate change for Malawi are to 1)
implement water conservation measures, 2) reduce the current variability of runoff by means
of increased storage capacity, and 3) enhance measurement, monitoring and knowledge of the
hydrologic system.
WEAP (Raskin et al., 1998) is a comprehensive river basin tool that is easy to use and
has been employed in a number of climate change impact assessments (e.g., Strzepek,
1997). This tool models reservoirs and their operation, hydropower generation, and
water demand for agricultural, municipal, industrial, environmental, and recreational
uses. A monthly time step is used in this model, and the results of a hydrologic assess-
ment of runoff changes can be used directly as input to the model.
The list of models presented in Table 6.4 is by no means complete, but it include
models that have all been used in climate change assessment and are publicly available
for assessments. A more detailed list of hydrologic and systems management software
tools can be found in the Handbook of Hydrology (Maidment, 1993) and Handbook of
Water Resources (Mays, 1996).
UNEP/IVM Handbook
6-24
Economic assessment methods
Strzepek et al. (1996) discusses economic tools for use in climate change assessment.
The following is a summary of the key elements of this publication. A variety of
analytical methods can be used to assess the economic impacts of climate change (see
Chapter 2). Each method has strengths and weaknesses, and each provides different
insights useful to decision makers. Any single impact assessment may contain elements
of one or more of these methods. Most available models can be categorised as either
macroeconomic or sectoral models.
A number of studies have examined the economic consequences of climate impacts as
related to water resources (e.g., Vaux and Howitt, 1984; Hurd et al., 1998). Typically,
the studies have taken a partial equilibrium sectoral approach, examining the effects in
a single market or a group of closely related markets. However, because of complex
interdependencies among even seemingly unrelated markets, partial equilibrium anal-
yses can yield potentially misleading results for evaluating broad, economy-wide
effects. The potential for error is exacerbated when there are direct impacts on multiple
sectors. For example, changes in temperature and precipitation may have a direct
impact on the availability of water and on water markets. This direct impact can have
indirect effects on markets that rely on the availability of water ? and are themselves
directly affected by climate change ? such as agriculture, forestry, and electricity
supply. A partial equilibrium analysis will typically not account for all of the potential
indirect effects. An aggregation of results from partial equilibrium analyses of the
separate effects will neglect potentially important interdependencies. In contrast, a
macroeconomic analysis is internally consistent. The consistency of sectoral forecasts
with realistic projections of economic growth is ensured since they are estimated within
the context of a single model. However, the ability to model an entire economy is
accomplished at the sacrifice of potentially valuable sectoral detail. For many river
basin-level analyses of water resources impacts, partial equilibrium approaches are the
most appropriate.
Table 6.5 presents a summary of available economic models for water resource as-
sessments and describes the general requirements for each model.

6.3  Scenarios
Once an assessment method has been selected and tested and the necessary data have
been collected, the key inputs and assumptions need to be formulated. Before applying a
method it is necessary to develop climatic and socio-economic baseline scenarios,
climate change scenarios, and assumptions about the potential for autonomous
adaptation.
• 
Climate baseline conditions. The climate baseline for the natural system and
biophysical impacts needs to be developed (e.g., temperature, precipitation, relative
humidity, sunshine hours, wind speed, solar radiation, albedo). Ideally these data
Water Resources
6-27
are daily, with maximum, minimum, and average temperatures. Monthly is the
maximum time scale that is useable. The data should be a time-series with as many
years of data as possible, and should be provided for as many stations as possible
in each river basin being analysed and surrounding areas. Chapter 3 addresses
development of climate scenarios.
• 
Future socio-economic baseline conditions. The socio-economic baseline is crucial
to estimating the magnitude of the impacts of climate change on the water
management system and its ability to adapt. Chapter 2 provides a discussion of key
considerations in developing these baselines.
• 
Future climate change conditions. Since the impacts on hydrologic resources are
driven by the same climate variables as for many other sectors (e.g., temperature,
precipitation, solar radiation), the user is referred to Chapter 3 for this material. For
the water resources assessment, incremental scenarios and multiple GCMs are
recommended (it is also important that the results from different GCM runs not be
averaged for the water resources assessment).
• 
Autonomous adjustment. The technological, economic, and policy adaptations to
climate change that each user may analyse will differ greatly, depending on the
hydroclimatic zone, the level of economic development, and the relative sensitivity
of the water resources system to potential climate change. An impact assessment
should examine potential impacts assuming no autonomous adjustment, but also
should examine impacts under one or more scenarios about the level of autonomous
adjustments that would occur. River basin simulation models can be used to assess
autonomous adaptations (as well as planned adaptations). For example, operational
adaptations such as changed allocation priorities and pricing structures can be
evaluated. The recommended WEAP model is well suited for this task. This is a
very powerful model, focused mainly on the technological aspects of water
resources adaptation.
6.4 Assessment of autonomous and planned
adaptation
The methods described above can be used to assess how impacts would change as a
result of adaptation. For example, river basin simulation models can be used to assess
adaptation. Structural adaptations such as new reservoirs, canals linings, and ground-
water extraction can be analysed with the simulation model. In addition, operational
adaptation, changed allocation priorities, and pricing structures can be evaluated.
Methods for assessing the trade-offs associated with implementing planned adaptation
are described in Chapter 5 of this handbook.
This section highlights the types of adaptation measures that may be applicable to the
water resources sector. When addressing adaptation in the water resources sector, it is
UNEP/IVM Handbook
6-28
important to recognise that most adaptation will take place at the project or river basin
scale. Water resources adaptations can be divided into two major classes:
• 
Supply adaptation, which can take three forms:
− 
modification of existing physical infrastructure;
− 
construction of new infrastructure; and
− 
alternative management of the existing water supply systems.
• 
Demand adaptation, which can take three forms:
− 
conservation and improved efficiency;
− 
technological change; and
− 
market/price-driven transfers to other activities.
6.4.1 Water supply adaptations
Since one of the major impacts of climate change is changes in the temporal and spatial
distribution of precipitation and temperature, the resulting river flow (or hydrologic
resources) may be shifted in time and space. A change in the spatial and temporal
distribution of river flow could greatly affect the efficiency of the existing water supply
infrastructure.
Modification of existing physical infrastructure
In many countries, extensive capital investment in water supply infrastructure has been
made. However, with climate change impacts, the systems may not perform as
designed. Adaptation to climate change may be achieved by modifying this existing
investment. In some river basins, no suitable projects exist for new development, and
thus adaptation utilising existing investment is most economical. Possible adaptations to
address decreased flows as a result of climate change include:
• 
changing location or height of water intakes;
• 
installing canal linings;
• 
using closed conduits instead of open channels;
• 
integrating separate reservoirs into a single system; and
• 
using artificial recharge to reduce evaporation.
Possible adaptations to address increased flows as a result of climate change include:
• 
raising dam height;
• 
adding more turbines;
Water Resources
6-29
• 
increasing canal size; and
• 
removing sediment from reservoirs for more storage.
Construction of new infrastructure
In river basins where full development has not been realised, new projects could be built
to adapt to the changed runoff and water demand conditions. These projects could
include the following:
• 
reservoirs;
• 
hydroplants;
• 
delivery systems;
• 
well fields; and
• 
inter-basin water transfers.
Alternative management of the existing water supply systems
In some river basins, the nature of the climate change or physical, environmental, or
institutional constraints do not warrant or allow new infrastructure projects. Thus, the
adaptations to be considered would involve changes to the management of the existing
system. Possible adaptations include the following:
• 
change operating rules;
• 
use conjunctive surface/groundwater supply;
• 
change the priority of release;
• 
physically integrate reservoir operation system;
• 
co-ordinate supply/demand.
6.4.2 Water demand adaptations
Water demand adaptation can be achieved through conservation and improved effi-
ciency, technological change, or transfers to other activities.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
6-30
Conservation and improved efficiency
There are a variety of measures that can be taken to promote conservation and im-
proved water use efficiency, including those listed in Table 6.7 by type of water use.

Technological change
A variety of changes in the production process can reduce water use, and these are
categorised as technology change. Measures that can be taken to promote technology
change are listed in Table 6.8 by type of water use.
Market- or price-driven transfers to other activities
Another adaptation approach is to use price to shift water between sectors. An example
of this would be water transfers from agriculture to municipal uses. In the western
United States, where the value of water in municipal use is as much as 20 times the
value for some irrigated crops, water rights have been transferred from agriculture to
municipal uses. Sometimes this is undertaken on a partial basis (e.g., just one or two

farmers on a canal); in other cases an entire canal’s water rights are sold and the area is
no longer farmed or is transformed to dry-land farming.

6.5  Summary and implications
The methodologies and modelling approaches presented in this chapter span a wide
range of spatial and temporal scales within the scope of assessing climate change
impacts on a nation's water resources system. The choices to be made in model selec-
tion and the scope of analyses depend on the hydroclimatic conditions, the water
resource modelling expertise, data availability, and the time and financial resources
dedicated to the national assessment. The exact nature of potential climate change at the
spatial scale of a study site is impossible to predict at this time. GCMs provide
plausible scenarios of what ?could? be. In performing a climate change assessment, the
goal should be to gain insights into how vulnerable a country’s water resources are to
the range of climate changes and what adaptation measures (if any) should be
implemented. Therefore, it is more important to analyse more scenarios with simple
models than to spend effort collecting detailed data and conducting few model runs. In
addition, it is more important to look at multiple assessment components than to
conduct many evaluations of few components. The reason for this ?simple? approach is
that first order impacts on each of the components can be identified with simple
approaches; however, some of the more intriguing and non-intuitive impacts come from
the integrated impacts of two or more components. Climate change impacts on one
UNEP/IVM Handbook
6-32
component may either mitigate or exacerbate impacts on another component. The goal
in applying the methodologies presented in this chapter is to develop insight and
understanding into water resources vulnerability and adaptation, not to develop
predictions.

7.1  Nature and scope of the problem
One of the more certain consequences of global climate change is accelerated global
sea-level rise, which will intensify the stress on many coastal zones, particularly those
where human activities have diminished natural and socio-economic adaptive capaci-
ties. As suggested by Bijlsma et al. (1996), sea-level rise can lead to increased hazard
potential for coastal populations, infrastructure, and investment. However, owing to the
great diversity of both natural and socio-economic coastal systems and their dynamic
response to anticipated changes, future impacts are not always easy to predict. Further,
appropriate adaptation will vary with site, depending on environmental and socio-
economic circumstances. Thus, careful studies are required to assess possible impacts
as well as to identify suitable adaptation options.
In 1992, the former Coastal Zone Management Subgroup of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published the so-called Common Methodology for
assessing the vulnerability of coastal areas to sea-level rise (IPCC CZMS, 1992a). The

Common Methodology has been widely applied to identify populations and resources at
risk, and the costs and feasibility of possible responses to adverse impacts. This chapter
provides an elaboration of the IPCC Technical Guidelines (Carter et al., 1994) for the
specific situation of assessing the impacts of sea-level rise on coastal zones. It is based
on a combination of widespread experience using the Common Methodology and other
methods for coastal vulnerability assessment, which have been developed in response or
addition to the Common Methodology (e.g., Kay and Hay, 1993; Gornitz et al., 1994;
Nicholls et al., 1995; Yamada et al., 1995; Leatherman and Yohe, 1996; Otter et al.,
1996).
This chapter should not be regarded as an update or revision of the Common Method-
ology, but as a new initiative to present a range of methods and techniques applicable to
vulnerability assessment rather than a single approach. It is not intended to be pres-
criptive as to the use of scenarios or methods to be applied for the assessment of im-
pacts and adaptation options. Instead, it encourages users to select those scenarios and
methods that — within the objectives of the country study —are most appropriate to
their specific situation.
Sea-level rise, which is the focus of this chapter, is expected to interact with changes in
other climatic variables such as temperature, wind regime, precipitation, and soil
moisture. Consideration of this interaction is encouraged where relevant and possible,
as it will allow for more comprehensive appraisal of possible impacts and adaptation
for specific socio-economic sectors. Methods to assess sectoral impacts and adaptation
options in coastal zones can be found in other chapters in this handbook, including
Water Resources (Chapter 6), Agriculture (Chapter 8), Human Health (Chapter 10),
and Fisheries (Chapter 14).
The response of coastal zones to sea-level rise can be highly variable and is greatly
influenced by the local geomorphic and ecological coastal configuration. Natural
coastal processes interact with and dynamically respond to regional and global changes
such as sea-level rise, and thus determine the susceptibility, resilience, and resistance of
the coastal zone to these changes.
7.1.1 Delineation of the study area
At a minimum, the study area needs to be defined so that it encompasses all areas that
could be physically affected by sea-level rise. It is advisable not to delineate the area too
narrowly so as to account for the broad range of uncertainty that is involved in impact
assessment. The Common Methodology suggests consideration of all the land area
below the contour line that corresponds with the height of a once-every-1,000 years
storm surge, given projected sea-level rise by 2100. This and other risk contours are
presented in Section 7.2.3.1, and first-order global estimates of storm-surge regimes at
a national resolution are provided by Hoozemans et al. (1993). In addition, the study
area should consider saltwater intrusion and increased river flooding. In deltaic and
estuarine areas, sea-level rise could cause these effects to extend tens of kilometres
inland.
Coastal Zones
7-3
In the absence of the required data or other clear criteria to delineate the study area, it is
recommended to use the contour line 2 metres above extreme high tide as the landward
demarcation, unless the physiography or socio-economic structure of the area suggests
that this arbitrary boundary will not suffice. This would be the case when impacts may
also be expected to occur farther inland (e.g., as a result of saltwater intrusion, extreme
storm surges, or increased river flooding) or, conversely, only close to the coast. The
seaward extension of the study area should be based on the area that is likely to be
subject to biogeophysical effects of sea-level rise, such as coral reefs, intertidal areas,
and wetlands, but may also include coastal waters containing valuable living resources.
7.1.2 Absolute and relative sea-level change
Over the last 100 years, the global sea level rose by 1.0-2.5 mm/yr (Warrick et al.,
1996; see also Douglas, 1995; Gornitz, 1995). Estimates of future sea-level rise, as
presented in the IPCC Second Assessment Report and shown in Figure 7.1, range from
20 to 86 centimetres for 2100 for the IS92a greenhouse-gas emission scenario, with a
best estimate of 49 centimetres (including the cooling effect of aerosols; Warrick et al.,
1996). This rate of sea-level rise is about 2-5 times the rate experienced over the last
century.
It should be noted that in hindcasting exercises, current models under-predict the
observed sea-level rise of the past 100 years, for reasons that are not well understood
(Titus and Narayanan, 1996). Future rises may therefore be somewhat higher than
predicted by Warrick et al. (1996). Moreover, model projections show that sea level
will continue to rise beyond 2100, owing to lags in climate response, even if global
greenhouse-gas emissions were stabilised now (Wigley, 1995).

In spite of the importance of global sea-level rise scenarios, when assessing impacts it is
the local change in relative sea level that matters, not the global average. Relative —or
observed —sea level is the level of the sea relative to the land. Subsidence of the land
results in a relative sea-level rise that is higher than the global rise, whereas uplift of the
land leads to a relative rise that is less than the global average. In extreme cases (e.g.,
Scandinavia), uplift is causing a relative fall of sea level because the rate of uplift
exceeds the present rate of global sea-level rise.
Subsidence and uplift are mostly natural phenomena, associated with long-term geo-
logical processes. However, human activities, such as water and hydrocarbon extrac-
tion, can also cause subsidence of sedimentary coastal lowlands. Locally, this human-
induced subsidence can equal or exceed the projected climate-induced sea-level rise.
Examples of cities that have subsided as a result of groundwater exploitation include
Venice (Italy), Jakarta (Indonesia), Bangkok (Thailand), Shanghai (China), and Tokyo
(Japan). In many deltaic areas, combined natural and human-induced subsidence is
made even more apparent by the removal or reduction of sediment supplies, which
reduces or stops compensating accretion. In reclaimed coastal lowlands, oxidation of
peat can lead to large declines in land level, as can consolidation and loading.
7.1.3 Biogeophysical effects and socio-economic impacts
Irrespective of the primary causes (climate change, natural or human-induced subsi-
dence, dynamic ocean effects), natural coastal systems that experience sea-level rise can
be affected in a variety of ways. It is not the aim of this chapter to discuss the details of
each type of response and explain how these can be identified. Rather, the six most
important (from a societal perspective) biogeophysical effects are dealt with in a more
general manner. These six effects are:
• 
increasing flood-frequency probabilities;
• 
erosion;
• 
inundation;
• 
rising water tables;
• 
saltwater intrusion; and
• 
biological effects.
Owing to the great diversity and variation of natural coastal systems and to the local
and regional differences in relative sea-level rise, the occurrence and response to these
effects will not be uniform around the globe. Therefore, impact studies first need to
analyse the extent to which the above effects will occur in the study area before the
potential socio-economic impacts can be assessed. The potential socio-economic
impacts of sea-level rise can be categorised as follows:
Coastal Zones
7-5
• 
direct loss of economic, ecological, cultural, and subsistence values through loss of
land, infrastructure, and coastal habitats;
• 
increased flood risk of people, land, and infrastructure and the above-mentioned
values; and
• 
other impacts related to changes in water management, salinity, and biological
activity.
The last category of impacts is not considered in this chapter but in the relevant sectoral
chapters (Water Resources, Agriculture, Human Health, and Fisheries). However, this
chapter does discuss the possibilities and limitations to assess the extent of rising water
tables and saltwater intrusion. Clearly, when conducting a comprehensive coastal study,
the consequent socio-economic impacts should also be considered, using methods
outlined in the appropriate chapters of this Handbook.
Table 7.1 lists the most important socio-economic sectors in coastal zones, and indi-
cates from which biogeophysical effects they are expected to suffer direct socio-eco-
nomic impacts. Indirect impacts (e.g., human-health impacts resulting from deterior-
ating water quality) could also be important to many sectors, but these are not shown in
the table.

7.2  An array of methods
This section presents and discusses a range of tools and techniques that are available
for coastal impact assessment. First, methods for data acquisition and management are
discussed, followed by a review of an index-based approach to coastal impact assess-
ment. Indices, which to a greater or lesser extent rely on expert judgement, may be used
when data are scarce. When data are available or can be collected, a two-step approach
can be followed to assess natural and socio-economic vulnerability to sea-level rise. The
two steps involved are the assessment of biogeophysical effects, and the assessment of
potential socio-economic impacts.
7.2.1 Acquisition and management of data
The fundamental starting point for any assessment study is the acquisition of basic data
on a number of important parameters that characterise the study area. Relevant
characteristics of the natural coastal system include the following:
• 
coastal geomorphology and topography;
• 
historical relative sea-level changes;
• 
trends in sediment supply and erosion/accretion patterns;
• 
hydrological and meteorological characteristics;
• 
meteorological-oceanographic characteristics; and
• 
ecosystem characteristics.
Additionally, it is necessary to collect data on the important socio-economic charac-
teristics of the study area, and to develop scenarios of their future development (see
Chapter 2). These include:
• 
demographic developments;
• 
trends in resource use and economic development;
• 
land use and ownership;
• 
infrastructural and other economic assets;
• 
cultural assets; and
• 
institutional arrangements.
First and foremost, it is essential to review critically any available material (maps,
aerial photographs, satellite images) and previous studies that may have yielded results

or contain background information relevant to impact assessment. Various national and
international organisations have developed sites on the World Wide Web that contain
coastal bibliographies, databases, and tools as well as numerous links to other relevant
information and organisations on the Internet. Examples include the Dutch Coastal
Zone Management Centre (http://www.minvenw.nl/projects/netcoast), the Coastal
Services Center of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(http://www.csc.noaa.gov), and the core-project Land-Ocean Interactions in the Coastal
Zone of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (http://www. nioz.nl/loicz).
7.2.1.1 Global sea-level changes
There are a number of databases that may provide useful information on sea-level
changes. For example, the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (Bidston Obser-
vatory, United Kingdom) holds a large number of tide-gauge records showing relative
sea-level changes around the world (reviewed by Emery and Aubrey, 1991; Spencer
and Woodworth, 1993). A guide to tide-gauge networks and global and regional sea-
level data sets can be accessed at http://www.nbi.ac.uk/psmsl/ sea_level.html. Also the
World Atlas of Holocene Sea-Level Changes (Pirazzoli, 1991) could provide an
indication of long-term, regional, relative sea-level changes. However, the limitations of
these data sets need to be appreciated. Hence, it is recommended to use this type of
information with caution, especially because the small spatial and temporal scales of the
data reduce the reliability of its application at larger scales. For example, see Douglas
(1995) for a discussion of sea-level trend analysis.
New data sources are becoming available, including satellite observations of sea-
surface elevations using the TOPEX/POSEIDON platform (Fu et al., 1996). Global
positioning systems are used to decouple absolute sea-level changes and vertical land
movements in some regions (e.g., Zerbini et al., 1996). Some of these data may be
useful for impact analysis.
7.2.1.2 Coastal topography and land use
For many countries where information on coastal elevations is lacking, ordinary sur-
veying can be conducted to provide these most basic and essential data for coastal
vulnerability assessment. In combination with elevation data derived from satellite
measurements (e.g., SPOT) or vertical aerial photography, surveying can yield topo-
graphical maps that have utility beyond impact assessment. However, surveying is a
laborious and time-intensive process, and therefore relatively expensive. Nonetheless,
satellite measurements alone are not yet sufficiently accurate to serve as the only source
of contour information.
A rapid and low-cost reconnaissance technique that has been developed to overcome
some natural-system data deficiencies is called “aerial videotape-assisted vulnerability
analysis” (AVVA) (IPCC CZMS, 1992b; Nicholls et al., 1993; Leatherman et al.,
1995). The combination of a video record of the coastline and ground-truth information
UNEP/IVM Handbook
7-8
can be used to characterise the coastal topography and, with the use of an appropriate
model (see Section 7.2.3), allows for estimates of the biogeophysical effects for
different sea-level rise scenarios. The video record further provides information on the
types of coastal environments, land-use practices, infrastructure, and population
indicators.
A major limitation of the AVVA method is that coastal elevations are not estimated
quantitatively, but are subjectively interpolated between occasional ground-truth data.
Therefore, AVVA does not provide information that is sufficiently accurate to assess
whether a particular parcel of land would be inundated as a result of sea-level rise. On
the other hand, validation experiments have demonstrated that AVVA is unbiased and
reasonably accurate when estimating land loss at a larger scale (Leatherman et al.,
1995). Another important limitation is that in extensive low-lying areas such as deltas,
AVVA does not provide sufficiently detailed information to allow for an accurate
estimate of elevation (Nicholls et al., 1995; Leatherman and Yohe, 1996). Thus, other
data sources are essential. Box 7.1 presents results from an impact study of Senegal,
which was conducted based on data obtained with AVVA.
Box 7.1
Example: Use of AVVA in coastal impact assessment for
Senegal.
 Senegal is a West African country with a varied coast that comprises long stretches of sandy
coastline, the Senegal Delta, the sheltered shorelines of the Saloum and Casamance
estuaries, and a small length of rocky shoreline. An impact study of Senegal was conducted
from 1990 to 1993, under sponsorship of the US Environmental Protection Agency. It is one of
a number of country studies that have used AVVA as the main source for elevation and land-
use data. Other sources of information included published reports, maps, and computer
databases .
 In following a similar approach to the IPCC Common Methodology, the study aimed to analyse
the implications of land loss, including a range of potential human responses and their costs. It
did not consider changes other than sea-level rise. The study applied four scenarios of relative
sea-level rise: 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 metres by 2100, with most attention being focused on the
1-metre scenario. Socio-economic consequences were assessed using three response scenar-
ios: no protection, important areas protection, and total protection (of areas with a population
of more than 10 people per square kilometre).
 Erosion from sea-level rise was estimated using the Bruun rule, and the simple inundation
concept was used to assess most of the area vulnerable to inundation. For mangroves, the
dynamic inundation concept was applied (see Section 7.2.3 for a discussion of these
methods). Based on the area of land potentially at loss, an inventory of the market value of
buildings was made. The number of buildings also gave an indication of the population at risk.
Agricultural land at risk was not evaluated because of a lack of information concerning the
total area involved and the market value of agricultural land. For the same reason coastal
infrastructure other than buildings was excluded from the analysis. Market and non-market
values related to the many functions of coastal wetlands were not considered either, owing
again to a lack of suitable information.
Coastal Zones
7-9
 The study found that a 1-metre rise in sea level could inundate and erode more than 6,000
square kilometres of land, most of which are wetlands. Erosion on the open coast could
threaten buildings valued at more than US$500-700 million (or 12-17 percent of Senegal’s
1990 GNP) and displace at least 110,000 to 180,000 people from their homes. Protecting the
areas that currently have medium to high development would cost US$255-845 million, mainly
for beach nourishment at tourist resorts. Assuming that this investment would be made from
2051 to 2100, it would represent an annual cost of 0.7-2.2 percent of the national gross
investment in 1990. Nonetheless, most of the coastline (86 percent) remains undeveloped,
even though the population of the Senegalese coastal zone is growing rapidly. Therefore, there
is an opportunity to plan for the impacts of sea-level rise as new coastal areas are developed.

A new technique that does provide detailed absolute coastal-elevation data is called
airborne laser scanning (ALS). This operational remote-sensing technique for digital
elevation mapping is based on a laser beam scanning the earth’s surface from an
aircraft. The precise position of the aircraft is determined by a ground-control point
operating a global positioning system receiver, allowing the plane to attain high vertical
accuracy (10 to 15 cm). ALS is currently used to survey the coastal zone of The
Netherlands, providing more than 80,000 measurements per square kilometre.
Remotely-sensed data from satellites (e.g., Landsat, SPOT) can also be used to deline-
ate land use (e.g., IPCC CZMS, 1992b; Frederic R. Harris BV et al., 1992; O’Regan,
1996). This type of information is easily incorporated and analysed within a geographic
information system (GIS). As stated above, satellite data cannot yet provide high-
accuracy contour information, so this must be obtained from other sources to allow for
quantitative analysis. Box 7.2 presents some results that have been obtained using
satellite data in an impact study of the Polish coast. Note that subsequent studies (e.g.,
Zeidler, 1997) have provided revised and updated figures, reflecting the rapidly
changing patterns of the Polish economy and inclusion of new boundary conditions.
7.2.1.3 Socio-economic data
Socio-economic data (e.g., population, gross regional product) can often be derived
from local or national authorities, and from institutions such as a census bureau and a
statistical office. Further, international organisations may possess valuable information.
Potential sources include the World Bank (http://www.worldbank.org), World
Resources Institute (http://www.wri.org), and the United Nations Development and
Environment Programmes and Food and Agricultural Organisation (UNDP, UNEP and
FAO; http://www.undp.org, http://www.unep.org, and http://www.fao.org). In view of
the often obsolescent nature of socio-economic data, it is always important to verify the
reliability of any data with appropriate experts.
7.2.1.4 Management of data
Computerised GIS provides an increasingly powerful means of not only managing but
also analysing spatial data. Once created, a GIS database may have further utility in
other aspects of coastal zone management.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
7-10
In principle, most of the analytical methods outlined in this chapter can be incorporated
within a GIS, and such an approach is preferred if feasible. As such, the analysis of
impacts of sea-level rise can be integrated with the analysis of sectoral impacts, as
outlined in other chapters of this Handbook. It is, however, important to realise that any
analysis performed using a GIS relies heavily on the accuracy of the data that the GIS
contains. The study in Box 7.2 presents some results that have been obtained using a
GIS.
Box 7.2
Example: Use of satellite data and GIS in a coastal impact
assessment for Poland.
Poland is situated on the Baltic Sea. Eighty percent of its coastline is occupied by dunes, and
the remainder is fronted by cliffs. The two main rivers that flow into the Polish part of the Baltic
Sea are the Vistula and the Odra. In 1991 and 1992 an impact study was conducted with
financial support from The Netherlands’ Ministry of Economic Affairs. The study followed the
IPCC Common Methodology, which was facilitated by the large amount of well-documented
and high-quality data available from various sources in Poland. In addition, satellite imagery
was used to identify land use.
The study aimed to establish a vulnerability profile, including ecological and socio-economic
values at risk, as well as response costs. Sea-level rise was the only climate change variable
considered, using scenarios of 0.3 and 1.0 metre by 2100. Socio-economic development was
considered over a time span of 30 years. This included extrapolating historical trends of popu-
lation and economic growth, and using current capital values from The Netherlands under the
assumption that in 30 years Poland would develop to a situation comparable to that of The
Netherlands today. Response costs were based on protection; no analysis was made of the
costs and consequences of other adaptation options.
In combination with a GIS, the use of satellite images enabled a rapid quantitative assessment
of the consequences of sea-level rise in terms of loss of land and property. Also the effects of
dike failure could be clearly demonstrated. Under a 1-meter sea-level rise scenario, taking into
account socio-economic development and assuming no protection, 1101.2 square kilometres
of agricultural land would be lost, as well as 223.0 square kilometres of forests, 140.0 square
kilometres of recreational area, 35.7 square kilometres of nature reserve, 23.4 square kilo-
metres of urban area, and 105.4 square kilometres of industrial area.
In terms of the vulnerability profile, the Common Methodology defined four vulnerability
classes for different parameters: low, medium, high, and critical (IPCC CZMS, 1992a). These
classes are used in the description of the Polish results. It was found that for a projected sea-
level rise of 1.0 metre, losses of land and property are expected to be critical (>10 percent of
1992 GNP) if no protective measures are taken. For the same scenario, the number of people
who would experience storm-surge flooding in a typical year is about 200,000 (high
vulnerability). Most of these people (146,000) would experience flooding more than once a
year, suggesting a response would be necessary (i.e., protection or relocation). Full protection
can reduce the number of people at risk to about 10,000 (a low to medium vulnerability). The
implementation costs are estimated at US$1.5 billion, which is equivalent to 0.02 percent of
1992 GNP, assuming that these costs will occur uniformly over 100 years.

Sproxton (1991), IPCC CZMS (1992b), Machida et al. (1993), Nunn et al. (1994a,b),

coastal zone management. More general information can be found in numerous texts,
such as Maguire et al. (1991) (See also Chapter 1.)
7.2.2 Index-based approaches
An important constraint that faced many past coastal impact studies was the limited
availability of data on both the natural and socio-economic coastal systems. When data
are scarce, coastal vulnerability may be assessed using indices that, to a greater or
lesser extent, rely on expert judgement. It should be noted, however, that existing
studies using index-based methods often lack the level of detail required to draw firm
conclusions, and should therefore be seen as a first-order assessment only. Quantitative
impact assessment would require at least some of the above data to form the basis of
the study. In particular, there needs to be some basic knowledge of coastal elevations
and of natural coastal processes and trends to assess the natural coastal response to sea-
level rise.
Box 7.3
Example: An index-based approach to coastal impact
assessment in Fiji.
 Fiji is situated in the Pacific Ocean and comprises two large and 330 small to very small
islands. In two phases an impact study was conducted that applied and further developed the
method outlined by Kay and Hay (1993). The study was sponsored by the Japanese Environ-
ment Agency. In the first phase, the method was tested at four sites on Viti Levu, the largest
island, after which it was refined on the peripheral Yasawa islands of Nacula and Viwa during
the second phase. Also during the second phase, the vulnerability of the port facilities of the
two most important urban centres of Fiji (Suva and Lautoka, both on Viti Levu) was assessed,
and a 25-layer GIS database of Viti Levu was constructed so as to allow for island-wide vul-
nerability analysis. This example summarises the methodology and results of the studies on
Nacula and Viwa.
 Nacula and Viwa are very small islands with populations of 1200 and 400, respectively. These
populations depend strongly on the natural environment for subsistence fishing and
agriculture. There are few opportunities for cash employment. As an impact analysis based on
monetary valuation was considered to be of little use for subsistence economies, the method
that was applied was based on qualitative evaluation of six interacting coastal systems
(natural, human, infrastructural, institutional, economic, and cultural). Based primarily on
expert judgement, the vulnerability and resilience to sea-level rise of each of these systems
were scored on a scale from -3 to 3, for the present and for the future (up to 2100). For the
future, two response scenarios were used: no management and optimal management. The
overall vulnerability was expressed as an index obtained from aggregating the vulnerability and
resilience components.
 In the method, areas with higher concentrations of assets were judged to be more vulnerable,
whereas areas with diversity and flexibility in the system —whether natural or managerial —
were viewed as more resilient. It was found that Nacula can sustain its present population
without undue difficulty, although problems could arise after a “direct-hit” cyclone. With sea-
level rise inundating some low-lying areas and rendering other areas unsuitable for agriculture,
it will become more difficult to sustain the present population. However, the strength of the
indigenous culture with its communal support mechanisms is expected to be useful in finding
solutions. Viwa is more isolated and more resource-poor than Nacula. Being low-lying, it is
more affected by storm surges associated with tropical cyclones than Nacula. The problem of
UNEP/IVM Handbook
7-12
providing sufficient freshwater supplies is already acute. The island is far less capable of
sustaining existing population levels both now and in the future. However, it is anticipated that
sea-level rise will not constitute a significant additional stress over the next century.
 Source: Nunn et al. (1994a).
One example of an index-based approach has been developed for the Asia-Pacific
region by Kay and Hay (1993). It has been applied by Nunn et al. (1994a,b) and
Yamada et al. (1995). Box 7.3 summarises the impact study conducted for two islands
of Fiji. In the framework used in this approach, the coastal zone is viewed as a set of
six interacting systems: the natural, human, and infrastructural systems (the so-called
“hard” systems), and the institutional, economic, and cultural systems (the “soft” sys-
tems). Kay and Hay (1993) have stressed the importance of determining not only the
vulnerability but also the resilience of each of these systems. The qualitative scorings of
vulnerability and resilience — largely determined by expert judgement —together
determine the coastal Sustainable Capacity Index.
The framework of Kay and Hay (1993), which has been developed to account for the
specific situation of subsistence economies in the Asia-Pacific region, does provide
some useful guidance for impact assessment, especially in areas with limited data
availability or accessibility. However, as stated above, a more comprehensive and
quantitative assessment of impacts and adaptation options can only be based on quan-
titative data.
7.2.3 Methods for assessing biogeophysical effects
 This section briefly discusses five of the six coastal biogeophysical effects of sea-level
rise that were identified in Section 7.1.3, and outlines which methods are available for
their assessment. The application of each method is described in some detail, but it is
beyond the scope of this chapter to present all the peculiarities involved in each method.
Therefore, the reader is recommended to consult the original references for more
detailed descriptions. Biological effects of climate change in coastal zones are discussed
in Chapters 10 and 14.
7.2.3.1 Increasing flood-frequency probabilities
 One of the first consequences of a rise in sea level on low-lying coastal zones is an in-
creased flood risk associated with storm surges and extreme precipitation and runoff
events. In fact, low-lying coastal areas that face permanent inundation under a certain
scenario of sea-level rise will first experience increased risk of flooding. In this chapter,
only flooding as a result of coastal storm surges is considered, although increases in
river flooding could be important locally (see also Chapter 6).
 The degree to which coastal land is at risk of flooding from storm surges is determined
by a number of morphological and meteorological factors, including coastal slope and
Coastal Zones
7-13
wind and wave characteristics. Together these factors determine a coastal zone’s flood-
frequency probability curve (also referred to as flood-exceedance curve). The
information provided by flood-frequency probability curves can be used to plot design
water levels on a topographical map. Design water levels are contour lines that indicate
with which probability a particular area could be flooded.
 Hoozemans et al. (1993) defined the risk zone as the land area between the coastline
and the “maximum” design water level, which is defined as a flood-frequency proba-
bility of once per 1,000 years, taking into account global sea-level rise and regional and
local aspects such as subsidence, tidal range, and storm characteristics (wind and wave
set-up and minimum barometric pressure). Hence, the delineation of the risk zone
requires the calculation of the maximum design water level (see Hoozemans et al.,
1993).
7.2.3.2 Erosion and inundation
 Sea-level rise can activate two important mechanisms that result in the loss of land:
erosion and inundation. Erosion represents the physical removal of sediment by wave
and current action, and inundation is the permanent submergence of low-lying land. The
primary mechanism at any location depends on the geomorphology of the coast. Many
other factors than sea-level rise can play a part in determining land loss (e.g.,
vegetation, sediment supply), yet at the intended level of analysis it is justified not to
consider them. More sophisticated analyses would require considerably more data on
the coastal sediment budget, and the development of more site-specific models. Such
analyses are therefore likely to face severe time and funding constraints in many coastal
areas.
 Sea-level rise contributes to the erosion of erodible cliffs, coral-reef islands, and gravel-
ly, sandy, and muddy coasts by promoting the offshore transport of sedimentary
material. The best known and most widely applied model to estimate erosion has been
developed by Bruun (1962) for application on straight sandy shores (see also Dean,
1991; SCOR Working Group 89, 1991; Healy, 1991, 1996; Mimura and Nobuoka,
1995). In other erodible coastal environments alternative erosion models have to be
used, which, however, are often based on the Bruun rule.
 Low-lying coastal areas such as deltas, coastal wetlands, and coral atolls may face
inundation as a result of sea-level rise. Land loss resulting from inundation is simply a
function of slope: the lower the slope, the greater the land loss. In addition, the survival
of coastal wetlands is dependent upon sediment availability and local biomass pro-
duction, as well as the potential for these ecosystems to migrate inland. Flood em-
bankments can inhibit this natural adaptation of wetlands to sea-level rise. Healthy,
unobstructed wetlands in settings with continuing sedimentation are expected to be able
to cope with projected global sea-level rise, although ecosystem characteristics may
change.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
7-14
 Healthy coral-reef systems are also believed to be able to keep up with projected sea-
level rise (Bijlsma et al., 1996), although some doubt whether maximum accretion rates
of 10 mm/yr achieved during the early Holocene can be considered realistic under
current ecological and sea-level conditions (Nunn, personal communication, University
of the South Pacific, Fiji,1997) Moreover, other climatic and non-climatic stress factors
may have diminished the natural resilience and resistance of reefs.

the appropriate land-loss model for which coastal environment.

7.2.3.3. Rising water tables
 Sea-level rise could be associated with a rise in coastal groundwater tables. The dis-
tance inland that a water table will be affected by sea-level rise depends on a range of
factors, including elevation and subsurface permeability. In some locations, particularly
deltas, rising water tables can occur as far as several tens of kilometres inland. The
need to assess rising water tables depends on the potential for saltwater intrusion in
groundwater (see Section 7.2.3.4) as well as impacts on foundations, drainage systems,
and underground services. For semi-confined aquifers, the Mazure equation (Mazure,
1936) can be applied as a first approximation of the water-table rise. Because these
impacts occur almost exclusively in urban areas, this is where attention should be
focused.
Coastal Zones
7-15
7.2.3.4 Saltwater intrusion
 As sea level rises, fresh groundwater and surface water could be displaced by saline
water, which could have substantial adverse impacts on drinking-water supply and
agriculture. To assess these impacts, knowledge of the spatial and temporal extent of
saltwater intrusion is needed. It is important to note that saltwater intrusion is already
occurring in many coastal regions, owing to overexploitation of surface water and
groundwater (e.g., Han et al., 1995). With growing populations in coastal regions,
saltwater intrusion due to this problem is expected to occur more widely, and may
enhance the rate of saltwater infiltration. Therefore, it is likely that sea-level rise will
exacerbate an already adverse situation.
 Assessing the extent of saltwater intrusion in groundwater is difficult because it de-
pends on many factors that are locally variable and often poorly understood. These
factors include subsoil characteristics such as porosity and conductivity of the aquifer,
hydraulic resistance of the aquitard, and hydraulic variables such as groundwater flow
and recharge. Also the geohydrology is important, because this determines whether a
freshwater aquifer is confined, semi-confined, or unconfined; sea-level rise will not
result in saltwater intrusion in confined aquifers.
 Saltwater intrusion in groundwater can be assessed using analytical methods or math-
ematical modelling. One commonality of the analytical methods is that they are all
based on the Badon Ghijben-Herzberg principle, which describes the equilibrium of two
stationary immiscible fluids of different density (Badon Ghijben, 1889; Herzberg,
1901). Thus, these methods assume that a sharp interface exists between fresh and
saline groundwater. A full discussion of the coastal type-dependent methods that have
been derived from the Badon Ghijben-Herzberg principle can be found in Custodio
(1987) and Oude Essink (1996).
 Owing to the complexity of intrusion processes in groundwater, reliable estimates of the
extent of saltwater intrusion in groundwater can in fact be made only by means of
mathematical modelling. By using density-dependent solute transport models, spatial
and temporal changes in salinity in coastal groundwater can be assessed. A number of
such models are available, mostly based on either the finite different method or the finite
element method.  The US Geological Survey is the leading institute in developing and
purchasing public-domain, two-dimensional and three-dimensional groundwater-flow
models (http://water.usgs.gov/software/ground_water.html). Important distributors of
affordable computer codes are, among others, the International Ground Water Modeling
Center (http://magma.mines.edu/igwmc/ software/igwmcsoft/ ground_water.html) and
the Scientific Software Group (http://www/scisoftware.com).
 Saltwater intrusion in surface water (rivers and estuaries) is a function of the following
parameters (Oude Essink, 1996):
• 
density differences between freshwater and saltwater;
• 
tidal range;
UNEP/IVM Handbook
7-16
• 
river discharge;
• 
cross-sectional area; and
• 
vertical mixing of water.
 Based on the last parameter, three distinct estuarine conditions can be identified: a
mixed estuary, a partially mixed estuary, and a stratified estuary. Stratified estuaries
are most susceptible to saltwater intrusion because a saltwater wedge is formed that can
reach far upstream.

7.2.4 Methods for assessing potential socio-economic
impacts
 For each area potentially affected by sea-level rise, analysis following the methods
outlined in Section 7.2.3 will identify the relevant biogeophysical effects, including the
area that will be at increased risk from coastal flooding and the area that is potentially
lost as a result of erosion or inundation.
 This section presents methods to assess the socio-economic implications of increased
flood risk and potential land loss. This is done using a distinction between three fun-
damental socio-economic impact categories:
• 
(human) population;
• 
marketed goods and services; and
UNEP/IVM Handbook
7-18
• 
non-marketed goods and services.
 For the last two categories, this section outlines techniques that are aimed at expressing
these impacts in economic terms, recognising that this may be impossible or undesirable
for all values at stake. The first category applies a risk-based approach, using the
design water levels described in Section 7.2.3.1.
7.2.4.1 Population
 Sea level rise would obviously affect those people living near the coast, because their
houses or businesses would be inundated, eroded, or more frequently flooded. A crude
way of estimating the number of people affected is to multiply population density by the
area affected. The national average population density could be used, but it is
preferable to use the population density of coastal counties, provinces, or similar
regions. The area affected by sea level rise, and thus the population affected, depends
on the extent of protective adaptation. The population density depends on the socio-
economic scenarios used.
 People are not affected by sea level rise in the same manner. Some would experience a
flood of minor inconvenience once in every 15 years instead of once in every 20 years.
Others would be forced to migrate. Some would drown. Unfortunately, no classification
has been established of the various ways in which people can be affected by sea level
rise, let alone methods to estimate their numbers.
 Two categories can be estimated, however. Hoozemans et al. (1993) present a method
to estimate the number of people affected3 by coastal floods each year, and how this
population-at-risk would change with sea level rise. Their report contains such esti-
mates for all coastal countries. Their databases are, not highly reliable however, and
probably include considerable errors of overestimation and underestimation. People
living in places that would get permanently inundated or eroded would need to seek a
livelihood elsewhere. Thus, an estimate of the people forced to migrate results.
7.2.4.2 Marketed goods and services
Assessment of the increased risk to or potential loss of marketed goods and services is a
complicated exercise. First, an inventory is needed of all economic assets and activities
in the coastal area affected. Examples of such inventories can be found in Yohe (1990),
Mimura et al. (1994), Yohe et al. (1995), Dennis et al. (1995a,b), and Volonté and
Nicholls (1995). This inventory needs to be projected into the future, as part of the
socio-economic scenarios (see Chapter 2). Further, a quantitative assessment needs to
be made of the degree to which these assets and activities will be subject to damage as a
result of sea-level rise. Sea-level rise may also lead to costs that are not related directly

to the economic assets and activities identified (e.g., evacuation). Further, benefits
accruing from new opportunities, if any, should also be taken into account.
 A report by Turner and Adger (1996), written for the core project Land-Ocean Inter-
actions in the Coastal Zone (LOICZ) of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Pro-
gramme (IGBP), provides specific guidance for the application of economic valuation
methods in coastal zones, as does a report by Lipton et al. (1995). Even more detailed,
and originally written for application in the United Kingdom, is the manual by Penning-
Rowsell et al. (1992).
 The most important goods and services that could be at risk of sea-level rise, and which
are readily quantifiable in monetary terms, include:
• 
land;
• 
physical structures (e.g., houses, roads); and
• 
agricultural and industrial productivity.
 These goods and services can either be irreversibly lost as a result of erosion or inun-
ation, or be exposed to a higher risk of flooding, which can cause temporal losses. Also,
rising water tables may result in increased likelihood of foundation failure, existing
drainage services may be made obsolete (Titus et al., 1987), and underground services
in urban areas would be affected (Yim, 1995). In certain low-lying areas, hazards such
as liquefaction during earthquakes may be exacerbated.
 Potential losses in capital assets such as land, property, and infrastructure cannot be
estimated accurately. The problem is that people’s anticipation of erosion and inunda-
tion will affect the extent, nature, and value of capital assets in the coastal zone, and
realistic modelling of people’s anticipation has proved exceedingly difficult. However, it
is possible to give upper and lower bounds of the potential losses; the methods are
associated with Titus (1992) and Yohe (1991), respectively. The upper bound loss
assumes that X acres of land will get inundated and eroded, and values this land at its
(current or future) market price. The market price supposedly reflects the value of the
agricultural and industrial activities the piece of land can support. The properties and
infrastructure on this land are assumed to be lost as well. These are valued at their
(current or future) market or replacement values. The lower bound loss assumes also
that X acres of land will get lost; however, this land is valued not at its market price,
but at the market price of similar land farther from the coast. Because of access to the
sea and natural beauty, coastal land is often expensive. With sea level rise, the strip of
coastal property will not disappear, but move inland. The properties and infrastructure
that would be lost with the land are not counted, on the assumption that their owners
anticipate sea level rise and depreciate their houses (say) to zero value just before the
sea enters the front. Thus, in practice the true loss probably lies somewhere between the
upper and lower bounds.

7.2.4.3 Non-marketed goods and services
 As the term implies, non-marketed goods and services are not traded on markets. In the
absence of a market, these goods and services cannot be readily expressed in monetary
terms, because there is no pricing mechanism. This does not suggest, however, that they
do not possess economic value. Examples of non-marketed goods and services include
recreational values, cultural and subsistence values (e.g., community structures), and
natural values (e.g., a wetland’s capacity to buffer wave energy and assimilate waste).
 Thus, it is important to realise that the total economic value of a coastal system is more
than simply the market value of its resources. There are methods to express non-market
values in money. These methods are based on revealed and expressed preferences, using
implicit markets (people’s expenditures on safety or landscape beauty contains
information about its value) or hypothetical markets (through interviews and
experiments). To date, economic assessment of non-marketed goods and services has
been directed primarily at quantifying the value of coastal recreation and indirect-use
values such as storm protection and waste assimilation. Empirical studies confirm that
these values may be significant in monetary terms (e.g., Dixon, 1989; Costanza et al.,
1989; De Groot, 1992; Barbier, 1994; Bateman et al., 1995). More guidance and refer-
ences on the valuation of non-marketed coastal goods and services can be found in
Turner and Adger (1996).
7.3  Scenarios
 Scenarios for impact assessment reflect plausible future conditions of all environmental
and socio-economic parameters of interest. Some parameters can be considered to be
universally important, whereas others are more site-specific. In addition to differ-
entiating between environmental and socio-economic parameters, a distinction can also
be made based on whether or not changes in these parameters will be climate-related.
7.3.1 Relative sea-level rise
 Since relative sea-level rise is the sum of global sea-level rise, regional oceanic effects,
and vertical land movements, it follows that scenarios for relative sea-level rise can be
expressed as:
 
t

 The US National Research Council has suggested expressing global sea-level rise
scenarios as a quadratic equation (NRC, 1987):

 (7.2)
 where: a
 = 
incremental sea-level rise (m/yr), and

 The most recent IPCC sea-level rise scenarios shown in Figure 7.1 can be approximated
by the values for a and b shown in Table 7.3, using 1990 as the base year. Hence, Sg,t
can be computed for any year using equation (7.2). The coefficients can be easily
adjusted to reflect new scientific knowledge (Nicholls and Leatherman, 1996).

 Alternatively, Sg,t can be obtained directly from scenario generators that link simple
climate models with sea-level models. Examples of scenario generators include
MAGICC and SCENGEN, both developed by the Climatic Research Unit of the Uni-
versity of East Anglia (see Chapter 3).
 Given the uncertainties surrounding Sg,t, it is important that scenarios are selected such
that they encompass the likely change (see Figure 7.1). Therefore, a maximum scenario
in which Sg,t equals 1 metre in 2100 is quite appropriate for such analysis.
 As indicated by Warrick et al. (1996), local values for So,t are highly uncertain and
could therefore best be considered zero until more concrete guidance emerges. Values
for V can be assessed from a number of different sources, including geological analysis,
geodetic surveys, and the analysis of long-term tide-gauge records. Note that equation
(7.1) assumes that vertical land movement is responsible for all the deviation of relative
sea-level rise from global sea-level rise, and that vertical land movement is linear and
will continue unchanged in the future. In areas subject to human-induced subsidence,
future vertical land movements may be uncertain as they will depend on human action,
necessitating scenarios for subsidence. For instance, Wang et al. (1995) estimate that
subsidence in the Shanghai area could vary from 0 to 1 metre by 2100.

7-22
7.3.2 Other scenarios
 For some coastal areas it could be worthwhile also to consider climatic changes other
than sea-level rise (Bijlsma et al., 1996). In mid- to high-latitude regions, a decrease in
the return period of extreme rainfall events appears likely. This will be especially
relevant for low-lying coastal areas prone to flooding. Cross-referencing with Chapter 6
is desirable to ensure consistency in the analysis. For coral reefs and atolls, increasing
seawater temperature could be important because this could adversely affect the growth
potential of the coral, which will reduce or remove its ability to keep pace with sea-level
rise. Information on both changing rainfall patterns and seawater temperatures may be
obtained from general circulation models (see Chapter 3).
 Other climatic changes that could have significant consequences for coastal zones, such
as changes in wind direction and intensity, remain highly uncertain. The construction of
plausible scenarios using the output of general circulation models is not yet possible.
However, sensitivity analyses using trend analysis (e.g., Zeidler et al., 1997) or
arbitrary scenarios (e.g., Peerbolte et al., 1991) could be helpful in providing insight
into the possible consequences.
 In addition to climatic scenarios, other types of scenarios may be required for a coastal
impacts assessment. Table 7.4 summarises and structures some possible scenarios.

in coastal impact assessment (Klein and Nicholls, 1998).

7.4  Autonomous adaptation
 As indicated earlier, natural coastal systems have a capacity to respond autonomously
to external pressures such as climate change. This capacity largely determines the
system’s resilience and resistance to such pressures. Resilient and resistant coastal
systems are less vulnerable to sea-level rise because —up to a certain threshold —they
can cope with the rise by “growing with the sea”. For example, a healthy unobstructed
wetland would respond by depositing more sediment, and a coral reef by increasing its
Coastal Zones
7-23
accretion rate. This autonomous adaptation is implicit in the dynamic inundation
concept discussed in Section 7.2.3.2 The best way to assess the potential of
autonomous adaptation is by looking at historical or geological analogues (e.g., Ellison
and Stoddart, 1991; Parkinson et al., 1994; Hopley and Kinsey, 1988).
 In many places, however, human activities have reduced the natural coastal system’s
resilience to sea-level rise such that the potential for autonomous adaptation has de-
creased. These activities could include infrastructural developments or pollution that
prevent natural processes from taking place. Such activities have been termed “mal-
adaptation” by Burton (1996), and it is often beneficial for reasons other than climate
change to reverse maladaptive trends. Planned adaptation to sea-level rise (see Section
7.5) should therefore include consideration of options that address maladaptation so as
to increase natural coastal resilience and resistance and thus facilitate autonomous
adaptation.
 Socio-economic systems in coastal zones also have a capacity to respond autonomously
to external pressures such as climate change, analogous to natural systems. Land
owners could respond to increasing flooding probabilities by building seawalls, farmers
may switch to salt-tolerant crops, households may move out of the affected area. Such
autonomous adaptation is likely to become more important as sea level rises, but its
occurrence will be difficult to assess. It will depend on the timing and effectiveness of
planned-adaptation schemes as well as on local culture and traditions. Moreover,
protection options that can occur as autonomous adjustments will often be small-scale,
and generally sectoral by nature. This could possibly lead to undesirable effects on
adjacent coastal areas. For example, protection of eroding cliffs could remove sediment
sources of neighbouring beaches.
7.5  Planned adaptation
 Given the potential socio-economic impacts they face in spite of autonomous adapt-
ation, countries may wish to plan further measures to prevent, reduce, or cope with
these impacts. In addition to doing nothing and reversing maladaptive trends, three
distinct response strategies to sea-level rise can be identified (IPCC CZMS, 1990):
• 
managed retreat;
• 
accommodation; and
• 
protection.
 The first strategy involves progressively giving up threatened land by strategic retreat
from or prevention of future major developments in coastal areas that may be affected
by sea-level rise. The second involves continued but altered usage of the land, including
adaptive responses such as elevation of buildings above flood levels, modification of
drainage systems, and land-use changes. These two strategies are based on the premise
that increases in land loss and coastal flooding will be allowed to occur and that some
UNEP/IVM Handbook
7-24
coastal functions and values will change or be lost. On the other hand, these strategies
help to maintain the dynamic nature of coastal ecosystems and thus allow them to adapt
naturally. The third strategy involves defensive measures and seeks to maintain
shorelines in their present position either by building or strengthening protective
structures or by artificially nourishing or maintaining beaches and dunes. This strategy,
which has been widely applied to protect human settlements and productive land against
existing coastal hazards, often involves the loss of natural functions and values,
including resilience and resistance. Therefore, the selection of appropriate adaptation
options involves important trade-offs, which need to be evaluated carefully.
7.5.1 Identification of adaptation options
 Table 7.5 provides an extensive list of possible adaptation options within the three
generic response strategies. The optimal option or mix of options for a given coastal
zone strongly depends on the local biogeophysical and socio-economic circumstances,
including the anticipated impacts of sea-level rise. For each option it is indicated
whether it can occur as an autonomous adjustment or whether it requires strategic
action, and whether implementation is effective in a reactive or pro-active manner. Note
that Table 7.5 represents a preliminary assessment, to be reviewed and updated as
experience grows. See Bijlsma et al. (1996) for more discussion on the different
response strategies.

 Table 7.5 does not explicitly consider adaptation options to saltwater intrusion in
groundwater. However, a number of options have been suggested by Oude Essink
(1996):
• 
reclaiming land in front of the coast to allow new freshwater lenses to develop;
• 
extracting saline groundwater to reduce inflow and seepage;
• 
infiltrating fresh surface water;
• 
inundating low-lying areas;
• 
widening existing dune areas where natural groundwater recharge occurs; and
• 
creating physical barriers.
 Most of the adaptation options listed in Table 7.5 appear to require strategic action; few
will occur autonomously. However, the precise distinction between autonomous
adjustments and strategic action can be difficult to make (Carter et al., 1994). Further,
options to protect against sea-level rise can be implemented both pro-actively and
reactively, whereas most retreat and accommodation options are best implemented in a
pro-active manner. However, when implementing protection options, it is important to
realise that large time lags are involved, so timely planning is generally essential to be
most effective (Vellinga and Leatherman, 1989). Moreover, a pro-active approach to
reducing vulnerability would be beneficial from both an environmental and an economic
perspective (Tol et al., 1996).
 Until recently, the assessment of possible response strategies focused mainly on pro-
tection, or “fossilising” the coast in its present location. For environmental and econo-
mic reasons, this may not be prudent in many locations. Therefore, there is a need to
identify the full range of possible options within the adaptive response strategies. It is
envisaged that the most suitable range of options will vary among and within countries
(Bijlsma et al., 1996). To begin this analysis, three simple options might be considered:
no protection; protection of the entire coast, unless uninhabited/unused; and an
intermediate option of protecting “important areas”, as defined within the study (see
Nicholls et al., 1995). It is appreciated that none of these responses is likely to be
optimal, yet their assessment can be performed relatively quickly and the results might
be used to stimulate more innovative ideas.
 Adaptation can and will exploit the fact that coastal infrastructure is not static. There is
a turnover of many coastal facilities through major rehabilitation, construction, and
technological changes in harbour, industrial, and urbanised areas, averaging roughly
25-30 years. Therefore, there will be recurring opportunities to adapt to sea-level rise,
and construction and maintenance plans can take this into account in land-use planning,
management, and engineering design criteria (Stakhiv et al., 1991; Yim, 1995, 1996).
Moreover, experience with pro-active allowances for accelerated sea-level rise is
Coastal Zones
7-27
growing in terms of protection, accommodation, and retreat, as discussed by Bijlsma et
al. (1996).
 In view of the uncertainties involved, it is important to identify low-cost, no-regret
responses that maintain or enhance the choices available in the future (i.e., maximise
flexibility), and sectors where reactive adaptation would have particularly high costs
and allowance for future sea-level rise can be considered a worthwhile “insurance
policy” (Downing et al., 1996; Nicholls and Leatherman, 1996).
 It is important for policy-makers to recognise that although a particular adaptation
option may initially appear to be appropriate, there are many constraining factors that
determine how successfully that option can be implemented. The applicability of any
option must be evaluated against, among other things, a background of a country’s
technological and human resource capability, financial resources, cultural and social
acceptability, and political and legal framework. This does not suggest that these con-
straints are insurmountable, but that policy-makers must be realistic when considering
the range of options available to them (Bijlsma et al., 1996).
7.5.2 Evaluation of adaptation options
 It has been noted by the World Coast Conference ’93 (WCC’93, 1994) that the selec-
tion of adaptation options requires making trade-offs among all the stakeholders in the
coastal zone. These trade-offs include environmental, economic, social, and cultural
values. Therefore, adaptation options need to be evaluated in the context of a country’s
or region’s coastal management or development objectives, which could determine the
evaluation technique to be applied (see Table 7.6). For example, economic cost-benefit
analysis —which could include environmental values —would suffice if decisions are
made primarily based on economic efficiency. If, however, sustainable development is a
leading policy objective, adaptation options would also have to be evaluated based on
their effects on intergenerational and intragenerational equity, and should include
consideration of environmental impacts.

 A practical application that combines cost-effectiveness analysis with multi-criteria
analysis is the decision matrix developed by Smith (1996a) in the context of the US
Country Studies Programme (see also Chapter 5). It is generically applicable for eval-
uating climate-change adaptation options for a range of socio-economic sectors, and
could also be used for coastal zones. Published examples of its application include
water-resources management (Smith, 1996b) and forestry (Smith et al., 1996).
 Computer-based decision-support systems are increasingly being developed to assist
policy-makers in selecting adaptation options. Examples include the Adaptation Stra-
tegy Evaluator (ASE), developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (see
Chapter 5) and the Coastal Zone Simulation Model (COSMO), developed for the
World Coast Conference (Noordwijk, 1-5 November 1993) by the Dutch Coastal Zone
Management Centre, The Hague , Netherlands. However, these generic software
packages have limited utility to site-specific application (CZMC, 1993), although they
do have educational value. One of the major drawbacks is the fact that, owing to the
incomplete understanding of adaptation options, many aspects cannot yet be modelled
satisfactorily, including social, cultural, and subsistence values.
7.6  Summary and implications
 When conducting vulnerability assessment in coastal zones, it is important to recognise
that climate change and sea-level rise will impact an evolving coastal landscape, which
is experiencing a range of other pressures. Therefore, to be most effective, responses to
sea-level rise need to be integrated with all the other planning taking place in the coastal
zone.
 At both the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED,
Rio de Janeiro, 3-16 June 1992) and the World Coast Conference, integrated coastal
zone management (ICZM) has been recognised as the most appropriate process to deal
with current and long-term coastal problems. There are many approaches as well as
diverse institutional arrangements that can be tailored to the particular culture and style
of governance (WCC’93, 1994; Bijlsma et al., 1996).
 ICZM involves the comprehensive assessment, setting of objectives, planning and
management of coastal systems and resources, while taking into account traditional,
cultural, and historical perspectives and conflicting interests and uses. It is an iterative
and evolutionary process, which includes adaptation to climate change and sea-level
rise by developing and implementing a continuous management capability that can
respond to changing conditions.

 As shown in Figure 7.3, assessment of impacts of and adaptation to climate change and
sea-level rise in coastal zones can be conducted in areas with low, medium, or high
knowledge bases, and with no, limited, or comprehensive ICZM in place. Impact
assessment is often described as one possible trigger for ICZM (WCC’93, 1994). Vice
versa, ICZM will increase the need for more sophisticated and detailed assessment of
the implications of climate change. Thus, an iterative evolution of such assessment
within ICZM can be envisaged, progressively drawing from and also contributing to an
improved knowledge base for decision making. As part of this evolution, climate-
change impact and adaptation assessment will become embedded in wider issues, and
with more focus on detailed responses, but it will remain an important element of the
analysis for ICZM. Such an evolution can be seen for Egypt (the Nile delta) and
Bangladesh (the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta), where initial studies raised significant
concerns (Milliman et al., 1989). Numerous, more detailed and sophisticated studies
have followed, combined with increasing emphasis on ICZM.

8.1  Nature of the problem
8.1.1 Background to the problem
Providing sufficient food for the world’s people is becoming more challenging as our
numbers are increasing and as land, water, and vegetative resources are progressively
degraded through prolonged overuse. There is now concern that the challenge will be
exacerbated in the future by the process of global warming, with its potential for af-
fecting the climate regimes of entire regions.
The Second Assessment Report of the IPCC concluded that “global agricultural pro-
duction could be maintained relative to baseline production in the face of climate
change . . . but focusing on global agricultural production does not address the poten-
tially serious consequences of large differences at local and regional scales . . . many of
the world’s poorest people – particularly those living in subtropical and tropical areas –
are most at risk of increased hunger” (IPCC, 1996). The effects of climate change on

agriculture are thus likely to vary between different regions and different scales (global,
regional, and local).
The purpose of this chapter is to describe a set of approaches for evaluating climate
impacts on arable agriculture and crop production. The overall goals of climate change
impact research are to define more clearly the ranges of possible impacts, to determine
which locations and farming systems may be most vulnerable, to identify their critical
thresholds, and to explore adaptation strategies. An overall survey of the methods of
climate impact and adaptation assessment is provided by Parry and Carter (1988).
8.1.2 Why is climate change of concern in agriculture?
World food production varies by several percent from year to year, largely as a result of
weather conditions such as the El Niño phenomenon and inter-annual climatic
variability in many regions. But agriculture in some regions is more sensitive to weather
than in others. Typically, sensitivity to weather is greatest firstly in developing
countries, where technological buffering to droughts and floods is less advanced, and
secondly in those regions where the main physical factors affecting production (soils,
terrain, and climate) are less suited to farming. A key task facing those concerned with
conducting impact assessments is to identify those regions likely to be most vulnerable
to climate change, so that impacts can be avoided (or at least reduced) through
implementation of appropriate measures of adaptation.
8.1.3 Defining the objectives of the impact assessment
The first step is to clearly define both the objectives and the targeted users of the
assessment. The general objectives of impact assessment may be concerned with one or
several targets, such as evaluation of output, management, or adaptation options;
identification of gaps in knowledge; or increased public awareness. The targeted users
of the results determine the scope and the focus of the objectives. Users of impact
assessment in the agricultural sector are varied and include the farmer, the agricultural
extension or training expert, the scientist, the national agricultural policy maker, and the
national climate change negotiator.
The emphasis here is on the choice of assessment methods which inform the national
agricultural policy maker (although the methods suggested will be relevant to other
users). With the national policy maker in mind, the key questions are likely to be:
• 
Will climate change significantly affect domestic agricultural production?
• 
Will climate change cause food shortages and lead to an increase in hunger?
• 
Will climate change threaten exports?
• 
Will climate change affect key government policies such as agricultural pricing,
support, and research and development?
Agriculture
8-3
• 
Will climate change increase food prices to consumers?
• 
Will climate change, acting through agriculture, place greater stress on natural
resources or contribute to environmental degradation (e.g., through land use
change, soil degradation, changes in water supply and water quality, pesticide use)?
The nature of the assessment is likely to be shaped by key questions in the minds of the
users. These may not be clearly articulated, particularly if relatively little is known
(before the assessment) about the possible effects of climate change, and a pilot survey
of literature (see below) may be needed to clarify them. For the national policy maker,
the primary questions are likely to include:
• 
What components of the farming system are particularly vulnerable, and may thus
require special attention?
• 
Can the water/irrigation systems meet the stress of changes in water
supply/demand?
• 
What policies and programmes exist to protect populations from hunger/financial
distress and how will they operate under climate change?
• 
Is the agricultural research/extension system capable of providing adaptation advice
to farmers? What technological options should be investigated? Does the country
have access to potentially useful options developed in other countries?
• 
Should domestic agricultural policies be reformed?
• 
Are the natural resource management programmes adequate?
• 
If domestic production is threatened, will the country be able to import food, and (if
so) at what cost?
The last of these questions is of especial significance to the impact assessor because it
provides a guide to the types of farming, the regions, and the communities that may
deserve to be the focus of study. This is expanded upon in the next section.
8.1.4 What impacts are likely to be important?
Focus on priorities
Because of constraints of time and money, it will be unlikely that all agricultural
activities in a country or region can be studied, or all parts of the country or region.
Priority will need to be given to the most important activities and areas. This can be
achieved by studying national production data to identify those:
• 
types of farming which involve or support the majority of the rural population;
• 
types of agricultural land use that account for most of the farmed area;
UNEP/IVM Handbook
8-4
• 
crops which contribute most of national agricultural GDP; and
• 
crops which contribute most to national export earnings.
While the above assumes a focus on what type of agriculture is most important to a
country, it may not identify those activities or populations which could be most
vulnerable to climate change. This would require study of:
• 
rural populations with lowest income, or dependency on subsistence farming;
• 
farming characterised by greatest year-to-year variability in output; and
• 
regions with a history of stress from extreme weather conditions such as drought or
flooding.
Whether the focus of study should be on the most important or the most vulnerable
agriculture will depend upon the objectives of the study. It may be that multiple foci can
be adopted, with the aim of assessing the major effects likely at the national level as
well as on local vulnerable areas.
A pilot survey of the literature
Several hundred studies have now been completed of impacts of climate change on
agriculture, and these can provide an indication of both the types and the magnitude of
climate change likely to be most important. A survey of such studies can provide an
approximate and initial indication of the types of impact to expect and, thus, the likely
methods of analysis that will be most effective. The survey is important because
different methods of impact assessment will yield information on some, but probably
not all, types of impact. For example, analysis of large-area shifts of cropping zones
will require broad-scale use of simple agro-climatic indices, whilst analysis of yields
can best be achieved through the use of process-based crop growth models. Effects on
income and employment can be assessed only using economic and social forms of
analysis. A summary of the impacts of climate change on agriculture, drawn from this
literature, is given in Table 8.1. More detailed surveys of existing research can serve to
provide an information base for subsequent formal assessments based on expert
judgement (see below).
Most pilot studies will serve only to identify the types of impact that may occur, and
thus deserve further evaluation. Some regions have been thoroughly studied already,
and their published studies provide suggestions of how an assessment can be developed
and reported. By far, the largest effort in past evaluations has been the assessment of
changes in optimal growing areas and final production. For example, in Europe, a large
effort has been made in understanding the location of optimal growing areas for
different crops (Saarikko and Carter, 1996; studies reported by Butterfield et al., 1997).
These studies combine evaluations for impact assessment at different spatial scales
ranging from the site to the continental scale.

Table 8.1
Types of climate change impacts likely in the agriculture sector.
1. 
Changes in the location of optimal growing areas for given crops, resulting in the shift of
cropping zones.
2. 
Changes in crop yields.
3. 
Changes in the type, location, and intensity of pests and diseases.
As a consequence of one or more of the above there are:
1. 
Changes in the mix of crops grown and hence in the type of farming, and rural land use.
2. 
Changes in production, farm income, and rural employment.
3. 
Changes in rural income, contribution to national GDP, and agricultural export earnings.
In regions where current inter-annual climate variability is a major factor determining
agricultural output, there is an additional challenge for projecting climate change im-
pacts on crop patterns. For example, the effects of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation
phenomenon in Southeast Asia have to be considered in climate assessment on agri-
cultural production in that region (Iglesias et al., 1996). In Canada, the adaptability of
agricultural systems to climate changes has been also evaluated from a geographical
perspective with the aim of defining the options for future regional sustainability
(Brklacich et al., 1997). In the United States, there have been efforts to evaluate
changes in crops yields and their economic implications (Dracup et al., 1992; Adams et
al., 1995a and b).
Fewer studies address changes in the interactions of crops with pests and diseases,
although those are estimated to be responsible for about one-third of crop losses every
year. Changes in the interaction of crops with weeds under CO2 enriched environments
show relative advantages of weeds over many important agricultural crops (Bazzaz and
McConnaughay, 1992). Insect pests are often also favoured in CO2 enriched
environments (Fajer et al., 1989) and with changes in climatic variables (Sutherst et al.,
1995).
The survey of available information is also useful to indicate the key aspects of climate
and atmospheric variables that are likely to be most significant for the type of
agriculture to be studied. Table 8.2 outlines the key environmental variables which
recent research has shown to be important in affecting crop yields in most agricultural
regions. The relative importance of a particular variable is bound to vary greatly be-
tween different crops and farming environments, and the choice of the most appropriate
methodology will depend on good knowledge of the locally important variables (see
Section 8.2).
General relationships between crop development and growth and meteorological
variables are reviewed by Fitter and Hay (1987), Ellis et al. (1990), and Hodges
(1991), among others. Several studies document crop responses to variations on
atmospheric CO2 levels (see, for example, Acock and Allen, 1985; Goudriaan and
Unsworth, 1990). Some studies also consider the interaction of CO2 with other crop
environmental factors such as water stress or nutrients (Kraalingen, 1990; Diaz et al.,
1993; Fredeen et al., 1995; Körner, 1995). A few studies report crop response to the
increment of other gases in the atmosphere (Ashomore, 1988; Bosac et al., 1993;
Manning and Tiedemann, 1995).

Climate variability is emerging as an important issue to be considered in the impact
studies, especially when evaluating associated risks of spatial agricultural production
(see Katz and Brown, 1992; Karl et al., 1995). Recent studies consider explicitly the
impact of climatic variability in addition to climate change in the evaluations of crop
responses (see, for example, Mearns et al., 1996).
8.1.5 The definition of the study
Choice of the unit
The pilot study should provide information regarding the appropriate unit for study. It
may, for example, be maize yields in high-input commercial farming or rice yields
under subsistence conditions (indeed it could be both, if an assessment were required of
effects on contrasting commercial and non-commercial farming both occurring within
the study area); or an assessment may need to be taken further, starting with an
indication of effects on yields and continuing to impacts on production and income. In
any case, it is necessary to be clear about the units of study, because their selection will
determine the research methods that can be employed and the data requirements.
Choice of study area
Selection of the study area is also likely to be affected by the goals of the study. Most
analyses of climate impacts on crop yields are demanding of data and analyst time, and
consequently may need to be based on a sample area of the exposure unit. If so, the
sample needs to be representative of the key features of the area, so that results can be
extrapolated appropriately. If, for example, the object is to provide a national-level
assessment, it is probable that certain regions (or even local sites) will need to be
selected as representative units for in-depth study.
Agriculture
8-7
Choice of time frame
The selection of a time horizon for the study is likely to be governed by both the goals
of the assessment and the data available. Many climate projections rely on outputs from
general circulation models (GCMs), and the time frame of the projections is therefore
related to that of available GCM experiments. Up to 1990 these experiments were
largely based upon a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations, assuming a time
frame of 2050 to 2100 (see Chapter 3). Recently, transient climate projections derived
from GCMs have become available, and these provide more specific (decadal) time
frames that can be incorporated into studies of the effect on agriculture.
It is difficult to make accurate projections of rates of changes in agricultural factors
(such as technological change or changes in crop varieties) or in related socio-economic
factors (such as population or economic development) beyond 15-20 years into the
future. Therefore, assessment of economic impacts over the larger time frame of the
climate projections is subject to great uncertainty. As the time horizon increases, so the
ability to project future trends declines rapidly. With these caveats in mind, the time
frame of climate impact assessments most likely to be required and valued at present
are for decade “slices” (e.g., 2020-2030) for each decade from 2000 to 2050 (see
Chapters 2 and 3 for details).
Data needs
 Which data are available or not can frequently affect the type of impact assessment that is
made, particularly if time and money are limited. Studies of the impact of climate change on
agriculture require a quantitative description of the exposure unit and the current (baseline)
agricultural conditions in the study area. Data are also needed for projecting future (reference
case) conditions in the absence of climate change (e.g., projected increases in agricultural
technology or fertiliser use). Although specific data requirements will vary with the scope of
the study and the methodology selected (these are discussed in more detail later), the
following groups of data will generally be required:
• 
yields for the crops to be studied, both mean and time series (to evaluate natural
yield variability);
• 
production (both regional and national statistics);
• 
crop management at the local and regional level (for example, crop sowing dates,
crop varieties, labour, fertiliser and irrigation inputs);
• 
land use (to enable spatial extrapolation from sample sites across the study area);
and
• 
general socio-economic data (e.g., the contribution of sample sites' agricultural
production to total output of the study area, percentage of working labour in the
agricultural sector).
UNEP/IVM Handbook
8-8
Additional data may be needed for specific studies (for example, water irrigation re-
quirements, rates of soil degradation and erosion).
The emphasis in this chapter is on a sound quantitative assessment of first-order effects
as a basis for subsequent (quantitative or qualitative) second-order estimations. The
reason for this is that robust first-order assessments are a prerequisite for higher order
assessments (such as for production, employment, risk of hunger), and therefore a
requirement common to almost all impact studies.
8.1.6 The design of the study
Impacts on agriculture can be assessed at various levels, depending on the requirements
of the assessment. Four general levels can be identified:
• 
effects on crop yield;
• 
effects on farm and village level output and income;
• 
effects on regional and national production; and
• 
effects on global production and prices.
Each level requires a different set of research methods, which are discussed in this
chapter. In general, there are advantages in moving from the first-order crop level
impacts to the second-order farm level and so on, because the outputs of the first-order
analyses are frequently required as inputs to the second. At the farm and regional levels
of assessment, various forms of adaptation can be analysed. Although the sequence of
stages may vary according to the study’s requirements, a general stepwise sequence that
has been found useful is as follows:
• 
Identify vulnerable regions and sub-sectors of agriculture that should be the focus
for study.
• 
Analyse the yield-climate relationships for these selected exposure units, to deter-
mine the climate variables of importance.
• 
Consider the changes in these variables that are likely to be most significant.
• 
Analyse the effect of these on crop yields (and other first-order effects).
• 
Analyse the effect of altered yield on second-order aspects, e.g., farm output and
income.
• 
Evaluate farm-level responses.
• 
Analyse the effect of farm-level output on regional production, employment, eco-
nomic activity, etc.
• 
Evaluate regional-level responses.

• 
Analyse national- and global-level effects and responses.
A schematic representation of this step-wise approach is given in Figure 8.1, which
distinguishes between three types of analysis that are threaded through the research
sequence: the analysis of impacts, the selection of scenarios, and the evaluation of
responses.

8.2  An Array of Methods
This section provides a survey of the methods that can be used as basic tools for the
analysis, and how these basic tools can be used at different scales of analysis. The basic
tools for climate assessment fall into two broad categories: biophysical tools and socio-
UNEP/IVM Handbook
8-10
economic tools. Because of the nature of the problem to be assessed, modelling has
been and continues to be included in many of the studies. Nevertheless, there are other
methodological approaches that can be very useful, and these range from experi-
mentation (for some biophysical evaluations) to expert judgement.
8.2.1 Biophysical tools
Experimentation
In the physical sciences, a standard method of testing hypotheses or of evaluating pro-
cesses of cause and effect is direct experimentation. In the context of climate impact
assessment, however, experimentation has only a limited application. Clearly it is not
possible physically to simulate large-scale systems such as the global climate, nor is it
feasible to conduct controlled experiments to observe interactions involving climate and
human-related activities. Only where the scale of impact is manageable, the exposure
unit measurable, and the environment controllable can experiments be usefully
conducted.
Up to now most attention in this area has been on observing the behaviour of agricul-
tural plant species under controlled conditions of climate and atmospheric composition
(e.g., see Strain and Cure, 1985; Geign et al., 1993). In the field, such experiments have
mainly comprised gas enrichment studies, employing gas releases in the open air or in
open or closed chambers, including greenhouses. The former experiments are more
realistic, but are less amenable to control. The chamber experiments allow for climatic
as well as gas control, but the chambers may introduce a new set of limiting conditions
that would not occur in reality. The greatest level of control is achievable in the
laboratory, where processes can be studied in more detail and can employ more
sophisticated analyses.
The primary gases studied have been carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and ozone, all of
which are expected to play an interactive role with climate in future plant growth and
productivity. Both temperature and water relations have also been regulated, to simulate
possible future climatic conditions. To date, there have been experiments with
agricultural plants (both annual and perennial crops) and on crop pests and diseases
(often in conjunction with host plants). For an example of the effective combination of
experimental and other approaches in western Europe and a technical explanation of the
methods employed and the resources required, see Harrison et al. (1995) and Butterfield
et al. (1997).
Few climate impact assessments, particularly those at national level, have the time or
other resources sufficient to conduct worthwhile yield-climate experiments. A prag-
matic approach is to survey the literature on experimentation and, with this as an in-
formation background, concentrate on the use of analogue or modelling approaches.
Agriculture
8-11
Agro-climatic indices
The agro-climatic indices are based on simple relationships of crop suitability or
potential to climate (e.g., identifying the temperature thresholds of a given crop or using
accumulated temperature over the growing season to predict crop yields). This type of
empirically-derived coefficients is especially useful for broad-scale mapping of areas of
potential impact.
The indices are derived variables that are defined either by manipulating values of a
meteorological variable into a different form or by combining variables with empiri-
cally-defined coefficients into a composite term. The most common derived variable to
describe the thermal agro-climate is the Effective Temperature Sum (ETS), usually
measured in growing degree days. It is calculated as the excess of temperature above a
fixed datum (base temperature) over a period required for a specific phase of crop
development. Indices frequently used to measure moisture include Thornthwaite’s
Precipitation Effectiveness Index, the Palmer Drought Index, and the Relative Dryness
Index. For a description of these, see Palmer (1965). Simple agro-climatic indices
combined with geographical information systems have been used to provide an initial
evaluation of the global agricultural climate change impacts (Leemans and Solomon,
1993) or shifts in agricultural suitable areas in particular regions. A large regional
effort in the assessment of agro-climatic suitability and potential has been made in
several African countries (see, for example, Fischer and van Velthuizen, 1996, for a
review of the methodology and report of the results of studies in Kenya).
When combined with a spatially comprehensive data base and a geographic information
system (GIS), simple agro-climatic indices enable the mapping of altered crop potential
for quite large areas at relatively low cost. An example is given in Figure 8.2, where
thermal requirements for commercial varieties of grain maize were identified from a
survey of previous research and validated through comparison with actual land use.
This enabled the identification of minimum levels of ETS required for maturation of
grain maize. Present-day ETS limits were mapped, to define the current area suitable
for production. Altered areas of suitability were then mapped for +1ºC increments in
mean annual temperature. This combination of agro-climatic index, GIS, and a
synthetic climatic scenario offers a rapid and inexpensive means of mapping the effects
of climatic change on crop suitability.
Statistical models
Complex multivariate models attempt to provide a statistical explanation of observed
phenomena by accounting for the most important factors (e.g., predicting crop yields on
the basis of temperature, rainfall, sowing date, and fertiliser application). Statistical
models are usually developed on the basis of present-day climatic variations. Thus, one
of their major weaknesses in considering future climate change is their limited ability to
predict effects of climatic events that lie outside the range of present-day variability.
They may also be criticised for being based on statistical relationships between factors
rather than on an understanding of the important causal mechanisms. However, where
models are founded on a good knowledge of the determining processes and where there

8-12
are good grounds for extrapolation, they can still be useful predictive tools in climate
impact assessment.

While agro-climatic indices provide information on crop suitability and how this may be
altered by climate change, statistical models can also be developed to describe how
climate change may affect crop yields. These are developed by taking a sample of
annual crop yield data together with a sample of weather data for the same area and
time period, and relating them through statistical techniques such as multiple regression
analysis. With well-informed selection of suitable explanatory variables, based on good
understanding of basic crop physiology and careful model validation, this approach can
provide a useful preliminary insight into climate change impacts. This is particularly
the case because statistical models are often simple to apply and less demanding of
input data than process-based models.
An example of their use is the effect of drought on wheat yield on the US Great Plains.
This was estimated for each of 53 crop reporting districts, using a regression equation
which expressed the relationship between actual yield and the weather experienced in
each district in the 1930s (Warrick, 1984). Assuming a recurrence of 1930s conditions
Agriculture

and current technology, expected yields were thus mapped, relatively quickly, for a
major wheat-producing region of the world (Figure 8.3).

Figure 8.3
Simulated wheat yields on the US Great Plains assuming 1936
climate conditions and 1975 technology. CRD = crop reporting
district (from Warrick, 1984).
The obvious drawback to this approach is the assumption of fixed technology and the
use of the 1930s drought as an analogue of climate change. The latter, however, has the
advantage of being based on a credible scenario (the climate conditions actually
occurred in the past), while the former can be improved upon by allowing for devel-
opments in agricultural technology. A more recent study of climate change in the Great
Plains (the MINK study) has combined process-based impact models with the 1930s
analogue climate scenario (for a description of this, see Box 8.1).
Processed-based models
Process-based models employ simplified functions to express the interactions between
the growth of crops and the major environmental factors that affect them (i.e., climate,
soils, and management). Many have been used in climate impact assessments but some
UNEP/IVM Handbook

are poorly documented and lack validation, and there are many different types of such
models.
Box 8.1 Example: Agricultural impacts in the US Midwest.
Background: Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas (the MINK region) are four adjacent states
in the central United States which are dependent on resource sectors known to be sensitive to
climate change: agriculture, forestry, water resources, and energy.
Problem: To study how climate change might affect the current and future functioning of
regional-scale economies. This example summarises only the assessment of impacts on the
agricultural sector. For the economy-wide assessment, see Chapter 4.
Method: A number of models were used to evaluate impacts of climate on individual sectors.
For agriculture, a semi-empirical process model (EPIC) was adopted that simulates crop
biomass and yield production, evapotranspiration, and irrigation requirements. The economy-
wide effects of changes in productivity were studied using IMPLAN; see also Chapter 4.
Testing of methods/sensitivity: EPIC was validated against national agricultural statistics
(county level) and observed seasonal yields in agronomic experiments for seven crops in the
region. Evapotranspiration terms were compared with field observations. The model
coefficients relating inputs and output flows between industries in IMPLAN were computed
from regional data for 1982.
Scenarios: A temporal analogue was employed as the climate scenario, specifically the
decade 1931–1940 in the MINK region. Overall, this period was one of severe drought—both
drier and warmer than average in the region, consistent in sign with GCM projections. These
conditions were assumed to occur in the present and also in 2030, along with an increase in
CO2 concentration of 100 ppm (to 450 ppm).
Impacts: In the MINK region of 2030 with a climate like that of the 1930s the main results of
the study are as follows. Crop production would decrease in all crops except wheat and alfalfa,
even accounting for CO2 effects. However, impacts on agriculture overall would be small given
adaptation, though at the margins losses could be considerable (e.g., a shift in irrigation from
west to east). Rising costs of water extraction would make agriculture less competitive for
surface water and groundwater supplies and would hasten the abandonment of irrigation in the
western portions of the region. Unless the climate-induced decline in feedgrain production falls
entirely on animal producers in MINK (which would lead to an overall loss to the regional
economy of 10 percent), the regional economic impacts of the climate change would be small.
This is because agriculture, while important relative to other regions of the United States, is
still only a small (and diminishing) part of the MINK economy.
Adaptation: Most of the work on adaptation dealt with responses to impacts on crop
production. Simulated adjustments included changed planting dates, altered varieties, and
changed tillage practices. In addition, technological advances were assumed in irrigation
efficiency and crop drought resistance as well as improvements in a number of crop-specific
characteristics, including harvest index, photosynthetic efficiency, and pest management. In
economic terms, in the absence of on-farm adjustments and CO2 enrichment, the analogue
climate would reduce the value of 1984–1987 crop production in MINK by 17 percent. The CO2
effect would reduce the loss to 8 percent, and on-farm adjustments would reduce it further to 3
percent.

Most of the models have been developed for purposes other than climate impact as-
sessment. Most frequently they have been developed as tools in agricultural manage-
ment, particularly for providing information on the optimal amounts of input (such as
Agriculture
8-15
fertilisers, pesticides, and irrigation) and their optimal timing. To achieve this they need
to be based on information on the amount and timing of important crop requirements
for water, heat, and nutrients. Such requirements vary between different crops and
between different environments in which they are grown, and it is important that the
assessor be familiar with these with respect to crops and environments.
One means of achieving this familiarity is to develop a schematic crop calendar to show
the significant stages of crop growth and their requirements, thus indicating important
variables affecting growth to be modelled. An example of one such crop calendar, for
spring wheat, is given in Figure 8.4.
Figure 8.4.

quirements (listed in the left hand column) and the farmer’s activities
to help meet these requirements (listed to the right of the diagram) are
indicated within the accompanying horizontal bars (unshaded bars for
plant requirements; shaded bars for management activities) as vertical
lines. The closer the lines in the bars, the more important the require-
ments or activities. The optimum range of temperatures and the sen-
sitivity of a crop to extreme weather events are depicted in the lower
part of the diagram (from Carter et al., 1988).
UNEP/IVM Handbook
8-16
In this case, where temperature is an important limiting factor on yield formation, the
optimum range of temperatures is determined for different stages of crop development,
and would feature prominently in the model functions that express the interactions
between climate and yield.
Dynamic crop models are now available for most of the major crops; a selected list is
given in Table 8.3. In each case, the aim is to predict the response of a given crop to
specific climate and soils, and management factors governing production. Several
published reviews describe the models and provide a full list of references, including
references on model documentation (see, for example, Jones and Ritchie, 1990; US
Country Studies Program, 1994; Rosenzweig and Iglesias, 1998). Comparisons be-
tween models for the same climate and soil data sets have given results that sometimes
differ (GCTE, 1996), largely as a result of differences in complexity, structure, and
parameterisation conditions.

The ICASA/IBSNAT dynamic crop growth models (International Consortium for
Application of Systems Approaches to Agriculture - International Benchmark Sites
Network for Agrotechnology Transfer) are structured as a decision support system to
facilitate simulations of crop responses to management. The ICASA/IBSNAT models
have been used widely for evaluating climate impacts in agriculture at different levels,
ranging from sites to wide geographic areas (see Rosenzweig and Iglesias, 1994, 1998,
for a full description of the methodology). This type of model structure is particularly
useful in the evaluation of the adaptation of agricultural management to climate change.

Table 8.4  Description of the ICASA/IBSNAT crop models.
Description: The IBSNAT/ICASA models employ simplified functions to predict the growth of
crops as influenced by the major factors that affect yields, i.e., genetics; climate (daily solar
radiation, maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation); soils; and management.
Models are available for many crops (see Table 8.3); these have been validated over a wide
range of environments and are not specific to any particular location or soil type. Modelled
processes include phenological development, growth of vegetative and reproductive plant
parts, extension growth of leaves and stems, senescence of leaves, biomass production and
partitioning among plant parts, and root system dynamics. The models include subroutines
to simulate the soil and crop water balance and the nitrogen balance.
Variables: The primary variable influencing each phase of plant development is temperature.
Potential dry matter production is a function of intercepted radiation, the interception by the
canopy being determined by leaf area. The dry matter allocation to different parts of the plant
(grain, leaves, stem, roots, etc.) is determined by phenological stage and degree of water
stress. Final grain yield is the product of plant population, kernels per plant, and kernel
weight. To account for the effect of elevated carbon dioxide on stomatal closure and
increased leaf area index, a ratio of transpiration under elevated CO2 conditions to that under
ambient conditions is added.

Advances in the interpretation of remotely sensed information and the combination of
this information with crop models offer an important tool for evaluating spatial crop
responses (see, for example, Maass, 1988a, 1988b, 1992).
Crop models provide some clear advantages in the assessment of climate impacts:
Agriculture
8-19
• 
Models are based on an understanding of how plants respond to weather.
• 
Direct physiological effects of CO2 on crop growth and water use are included.
• 
Rainfed and irrigated cropping is included, validated over a wide range of
environments.
• 
Improvements in crop varieties, irrigation scheduling, etc., can be tested.
• 
Although large amounts of weather data (e.g., daily variables) are needed, soil and
management data can be substituted.
• 
Models can be linked to a decision support system which enables adaptation to be
tested.
Among the sources of uncertainty derived from the use of crop models for impact
assessment are the following:
• 
Simple, empirically-derived relationships do not completely mimic actual plant
relationships.
• 
Conditions under climate change may be outside those data for which model was
developed.
• 
Weeds, pests, and disease are assumed to be controlled.
• 
Not all future improvements in technology are included.
• 
There remain serious uncertainties about the effects of elevated CO2 on crop plants.
As an example, Box 8.2 shows the approach for estimating climate change impacts on
China’s agriculture.
UNEP/IVM Handbook

Box 8.2  Estimating climate change impacts on China’s agriculture.
Problem: Recent studies have confirmed the conclusion of the IPCC 1990 and 1995 assess-
ment that the aggregate effects of climate change on global agricultural production are likely to
be small to moderate. This conclusion rests on the assumption that without climate change,
future agricultural production will rise at a rate that will keep pace with population growth, thus
continuing a long-term historical trend of declining world food prices. An alternative view is
that resource degradation and the failure of technology to keep up with population growth will
reverse the historical trend of generally improving food supply. Simplifying the problem as one
of global food supply and demand is partly misleading because of the high variation in local
and regional studies which tend to show more negative impacts for some areas in  East Asia.
So the China Country Study Program identified different impacts of different locations in China
through simulation methods.
Methodology: The simulation was conducted using monthly GCM scenarios and daily data for
1955-1985 and for a changed climate from the Chinese Weather Generator developed by the
Agrometeorology Institute, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS). Two
hundred sample years were simulated for each crop and grass to allow probability distributions
to be derived for the production potential of each crop and grass. Three different variability
scenarios were used as a sensitive analysis. Three crop models and a grass-cattle model were
adjusted where necessary to ensure that they could be applied to China (e.g., soil and genetic
characteristics are incorporated into the models). The three crop models are a rice model
(IRRI, 1993), a CERES-wheat model (Ritchie and Otter, 1985), and a CERES-maize model
(Jones and Kinir, 1986). The grass-cattle model is the SPUR2 model (Hanson et al., 1992).
Scenarios: In China’s country xtudy analyses, the results of three equilibrium GCMs  and a
regional climatic model (developed by the project) were used as the scenarios of climate
change: Geophysical Fluid Dynamics laboratory (GFDL) (Mitchell et al., 1990), Max Planck
Institute for Meteorology (MPI) (Cubasch et al., 1992) in Hamburg, Federal Republic of
Germany, and United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UKMOH) (Mitchell et al., 1990). De-
pending on the scenarios, temperatures were estimated to increase 0.4-1.9°C and rainfall was
estimated to change by -12.9% to +24.6% in China across different GCMs, and sites and
seasons. The direct effects of CO2 were not included in the simulations.
Impacts: The ranges of simulated changes in wheat and maize crop production under 2xCO2
and across GCM climate change scenarios and two types of water use are given in the table

The results of the current and past analyses show that with rises in temperature and changes
in precipitation (mostly decreases, but some increases), the maximum gain production would
probably drop  at most about 10% due to the shortened growing period and the shortage of
moisture. To meet the needs of the population and the need to improve the living standards, it
is estimated  that the average yield of grain production of China in 2030 –2050 will change to
about 6 tons per hectare through improved technology and increased inputs. But, climate
change could increase the barriers to this objective. The increased annual cost of government
investment only (excluding farmers’ additional costs) in agriculture due to climate change
through 2050 has been estimated at US$3.48 billion (17% of the cost of government
investment in agriculture in 1990).
Analogues
Two types of analogue study have been used for assessing impacts of climate change on
agriculture: analogues of time and analogues of space.
Temporal analogues. In some cases, past time periods with adequate climatic and
agricultural data have been used as analogues of possible future changes of climate due
to greenhouse gas emissions. These periods can provide a useful insight both into the
possible first-order effects of altered weather on (for example) crop yields and into
second-order effects such as on production, profitability, food supply, and rural income.
The approach can be illustrated from a study in northern Japan (Yoshino et al., 1988).
An analysis of the climatic record for the island of Hokkaido indicated that the region
had experienced a range of both warm and cool summers that had had a measurable
effect on rice yields. A warm-type year (such as 1980) was taken as an analogue of
weather that could be characteristic of a warmer climate. The average July-August
temperature in 1980 was 3.5° C above normal and rice yields were 5 percent above
average. District rice supply was 17 percent greater than normal. Warm periods have
similarly been adopted as temporal analogues of  warming in studies in Finland
(Kettunen et al., 1988) and in Iceland (Bergthorrson et al., 1988). In each of these
studies the existence of a comprehensive set of climate and yield data enabled altered
suitabilities to be mapped. In a similar manner, the warm and dry period of the 1930s in
the US Great Plains has been used as an analogue of the conditions that may result
under climate change (Warrick, 1984).
Spatial analogues. Spatial analogues of future climate work on the same principle as
analogues for present-day climate, except that here the analyst attempts to identify
regions having a climate today which is similar to that projected for the future climate
of the study region. The analogue region cannot be expected to exhibit complete simi-
larity to the present study region, because many features may themselves change as a
result of climatic change (e.g., soils, land use, vegetation). The overall characteristics
should, however, provide indicators of how the landscape and human activities might
change in the study region in the future. This principle has proved valuable in extending
the range of applicability of some impact models. For example, a model of grass growth
in Iceland was tested for species currently found in northern Britain, which is an
UNEP/IVM Handbook
8-22
analogue region for Iceland under a climate some 4°C warmer than present
(Bergthorsson et al., 1988).
Other aspects of the analogue region, however, would need to be assumed to be similar
to the study region (e.g., daylength, topography, level of development, and economic
system). Where these conditions cannot be met (e.g., daylength for grass growth in
Iceland differs from that in northern Britain), the implications need to be considered on
a case by case basis. One method of circumventing these problems is to consider
altitudinal differences in the same region.
The twin advantages of the analogues are firstly that they incorporate observed climatic
data (which thus have a greater degree of reality than those derived from scenarios), and
secondly that they enable assessment of the responses in agriculture that may actually
have occurred as a result of climatic events. Of course, the relevance of the event and
the response depends on the appropriateness of the analogue of possible future climate
change.
8.2.2 Economic tools
Economic considerations inevitably enter into the evaluation of climate changes im-
pacts. Economic analysis considers both producers and consumers of agricultural
goods. Economic considerations include the likely effect of changing conditions upon
input and output market prices and the opportunities available individuals to minimise
losses or maximise gains. Because climate change affects the costs of production, it
also affects the price and quality of products, which, in turn, can lead to further market-
induced output changes.
Economic models are designed to estimate the potential impacts of climate change on
production, consumption, income, gross domestic product (GDP), employment, and
farm value. These may be only partial indicators of social welfare, however. Not all
social systems, households, and individuals (for example, subsistence farmers) may be
appropriately represented in models that are based on producer and consumer theory.
Furthermore, many of the economic models used in impact analyses to date do not
account for the climate-induced alterations in the availability of land and water for
irrigation, though such non-market aspects of a changing climate may be critical
(Rosenzweig and Hillel, 1998).
Studies and models based on market-oriented economies assume profit and utility
maximising behaviour. These models are data intensive and are relatively expensive to
construct since they depend on access to detailed data regarding time series of price,
quantities, resource use, and other economic information. Several different types of
economic models have been used for climate change studies, including mathematical
programming models at farm, regional, and national levels and econometric models at
regional, national, and international levels. Because of the expense of model
development, many climate change impact studies have utilised currently available
models, which are relatively accessible and inexpensive to use. Such models have
already been calibrated and validated to economic conditions in the present or recent
Agriculture
8-23
past, and have been subject to review. Constructing new models to specifically address
climate change is desirable, but is an exacting and time-consuming process. A summary
of the types of economic approaches that have been used for agricultural impact
assessment is outlined on Table 8.5.

exogenously.
These models measure the potential magnitude of climate change
impacts on the economic welfare of both producers and consumers
of agricultural goods. The predicted changes in production and prices
from agricultural sectoral models can then be used in general
equilibrium models of the larger economy.
8.2.3 Scales of analysis
There is a wide range of applications of the methods for impact assessment at different
levels: farms and villages, regional and national, and global. The methods of analysis of
field crop responses are derived from the basic tools described above, and constitute, in
many cases, a first step in the evaluation of responses at other spatial levels.
The merits of each approach vary according to the level of impact being studied, and
they may frequently be mutually supportive. For example, experiments often provide
the necessary information on how crops respond to varying weather, and this can be
UNEP/IVM Handbook
8-24
used to develop models to predict responses to future climate, that can in turn be used
as a component for an economic model that analyses regional vulnerability or national
production risks. Therefore, a mix of approaches is often the most rewarding.
Assessment of farm and village effects
In most impact assessments, it will be necessary to translate changes in crop yield into
changes in output and income. In some cases the objectives may require further trans-
lation, for example, into changes in employment and activity rates. This can best be
achieved, first, by assessment of effects at the farm and village level. Aggregation of
these effects to the regional level can then be made if required.
Two broad types of approach can be used, their appropriateness depending very much
on the economic character of the agriculture under study. In regions of commercial
farming, where agriculture is characterised by farms under single ownership, farm
models may be used to analyse the effect of altered crop productivity on output and
income. In less developed areas that are characterised by a pooling of resources or some
common ownership and where the village is the dominant unit of enterprise, village
models will be more appropriate.
Farm models. These have most often been developed as tools for rural planning and
agricultural extension, being used to simulate the effect of changes in inputs (e.g.,
fertilisers, irrigation, credit, management skills) on farm strategy (e.g., cropping mix,
employment). They tend to be optimising economic models using linear programming
and requiring quite specific data and advanced analytic skills. Many take a range of
farm types that are representative of those existing in a region and, for each type,
simulate the mix of crops and inputs that would maximise farm income under given
conditions. These conditions may be varied (such as through variation of weather,
prices of crops, and fertilisers) and the appropriate farm response modelled. Changes of
climate, instead of variations of weather, can be input, and the farm-level response in
output and income then simulated.
Models of this kind have been used in climate impact studies in Saskatchewan (Canada)
(Williams et al., 1988), Minnesota (USA) (Kaiser et al., 1993), and for a multi-state
study in the United States (the MINK study; Easterling et al., 1993; Rosenberg, 1993).
The MINK study makes use of a farm-response component in the EPIC model, thus
combining crop and farm-level response in a single model. Further discussion of this
approach is given below and in Box 8.1.
Given their specific data requirements, it is unusual for farm models to be developed
specifically for climate impact studies. Most of those used have been developed for
other purposes and have been taken “off the shelf” for use in climate impact assess-
ment. An alternative to such models is to convene groups of experts in agronomy,
agricultural economics, and agricultural extension to provide advice on the likely farm-
level response to climate-induced changes in crop yields. Expert judgement of this kind,
particularly where it is based on careful formatting of prepared information, can
provide useful information on farm response to climate.
Agriculture
8-25
Household and village models. In semi-commercial economies, it may be more appro-
priate to focus on the household or village as the unit of response. Here the objective
may be to secure a minimum level of income rather than to maximise it, and the focus
of analysis should be on the strategies developed to reduce the negative effects of crop
yield changes rather than on those to increase the positive ones. Frequently referred to
as coping strategies, these have been analysed in particular detail in the context of risk
of hunger (often related to drought). As with farm models, those climate impact
assessments which included successful analyses on responses at the household and
village level tended to borrow from existing studies, adapting them to consider changes
in climate rather than variations of weather. For specific examples of their use in
climate impact assessment in Kenya and India, see Akong’a et al. (1988) and in Gadgil
et al. (1988) in Parry et al. (1988). For a more general discussion, see Downing et al.
(1993).
Assessment of regional and national effects
Regional assessments. Scaling up the impact assessment to a regional level is, as in
most scaling exercises, not an easy task. Ideally one might use information from farms
that are representative of agriculture in the region; and the degree of their representa-
tiveness would need to be established. More frequently, regional assessments have
relied upon the judgement of regional planners and economists as to regional-scale
effects, based upon local data supplied to them and discussed in workshops with local-
level analysts (see, for example, the UNEP South-East Asia study in Parry et al.,
1992). Where, however, representative farm data are available in addition to economic
data for each of the main sectors of the regional economy, then the farm data can be
used as altered inputs.
Two studies that have use input-output (I-O) models in agricultural impact assessment
are those for Saskatchewan (Canada) and the MINK study (USA) (Williams et al.,
1988; Rosenberg, 1993). In the Saskatchewan study, the I-O model served as a bridge
between representative farm models and a province-level employment model. In the
MINK study, it was linked to an analysis of parallel climate-induced effects in other
sectors (e.g., energy) (see Box 8.1). For many studies, however, the data requirements
of I-O modelling will be too onerous. Carefully developed expert judgement of the
regional-level implications of climate change may be more practicable.
National assessments. National assessments of impacts on agriculture have more
generally been based on a synthesis of knowledge, leading to reviews that describe
(largely qualitatively) the likely points of greatest impact, their implications for policy,
and the research required to improve understanding. Examples are the national impact
assessments of the United Kingdom (UK Department of the Environment, 1996) and
Japan (Nishioka et al., 1993). This approach may be rapid and inexpensive, but may
lack quantitative detail.
A more formal and quantitative approach is the use of national agricultural or land use
models. These are generally economic optimising models developed to assist national
and regional planning by “allocating” land or other resources in the national agricul-
UNEP/IVM Handbook
8-26
tural sector to their highest value use, in order to match demand and supply. Using
estimates of climate-affected changes in yield, they can be used to re-allocate land to
meet demand. The altered sectoral activity or land use is the modelled impact. A recent
development is the input of global climate-change effects as altered food prices, and the
use of the models to optimise land allocations by matching altered supply (reflecting
climate-related yield changes) to altered demand (reflected in price). These approaches
are analytically complex and require comprehensive national data on agricultural land
use and production. Thus far they have largely been limited to developed countries, e.g.,
the United Kingdom (Parry et al., 1996a and b) and the United States (Adams et al.,
1995a). However, a similar study has been successfully completed in Egypt, and it
indicates the value of attempting to upscale impact assessment to the national level.
This is described in Box 8.3.
Box 8.3 Example: Agricultural impacts in Egypt.
Background: Agriculture in Egypt is restricted to the fertile lands of the narrow Nile valley from
Aswan to Cairo and the flat Nile Delta north of Cairo. Together this comprises only 3 percent
of the country’s land area. Egypt’s entire agricultural water supply comes from irrigation, solely
from the Nile River. In 1990, agriculture (crops and livestock) accounted for 17 percent of
Egypt’s gross domestic product.
Problem: The study sought to assess the potential impact of a change in climate and sea level
on Egypt’s agricultural sector, accounting for changes in land area, water resources, crop
production, and world agricultural trade. The aim was not to predict Egypt’s future under a
changed climate, but rather to examine the combined effects on agriculture of different natural
factors and the adaptability of the economic system. This example summarises only the
agricultural component of the study (for the economy-wide assessment, see Chapter 4).
Methods: A physically-based water balance model of the Nile Basin was used to evaluate river runoff
and thus enable inferences to be drawn concerning water supply for agriculture. Process-based
agronomic models were used to estimate crop yields and crop water requirements.
External factors such as world food prices were introduced from a study of climate change which
used a global food model to assess climate change impacts on world food supply and demand
(Rosenzweig and Parry, 1994). Supply and demand at the national level were then input to a
national agricultural sector model to determine effects on land use, water use, agricultural
employment, etc.
Testing of methods: Each of the submodels used in the study was validated against local data.
Scenarios: The current baseline adopted for the socio-economic projections was 1990 and the
climatological baseline was 1951-1980. The time horizon of the study, 1990-2060, was largely
dictated by the climate change projections.
Impacts: An agricultural water productivity index was used to measure impacts on agriculture:
total agricultural production (tonnes) divided by total agricultural water use (cubic metres).
Under these 2 x CO2 GCM-derived scenarios the index declined between 13 and 45 percent.
Adaptive responses: Adaptations in water resources (major river diversion schemes), irrigation
(improved water delivery systems), agriculture (altered crop varieties and crop management),
and coastal protection against sea-level rise were all tested. They achieve a modest 7–8
percent increase in agricultural sector performance compared to no adaptation, but together
would be extremely expensive to implement. However, investment in improving irrigation
efficiency appears to be a robust, “no regrets” policy that would be beneficial whether or not
the climate changes.

Many studies are beginning to consider the interactions and feedbacks between crop
response to climate and the factors that determine final agricultural output, such as
agrarian policies (FAO, 1993; Rowntree, 1993; Brklacich et al., 1996; Binswanger and
Deininger, 1997) and other economic issues (Martin et al., 1990; Kaiser et al., 1993;
Reilly and Hohmann, 1993), especially when considering the importance of predicting
possible adaptation (Darwin et al., 1995; Darwin, 1997). Water availability and quality
and soil limitations are additional biophysical factors essential for a comprehensive and
meaningful agricultural climate impact evaluation (Gleick, 1993; Rosenzweig and
Hillel, 1998).
Methods have recently been developed that enable the analyst to incorporate the effect
of farm, village, and national level responses in the impact assessment. Mendelsohn et
al. (1994), for example, use a statistical approach to analyse cross-sectional data of
current agricultural production across both warmer and cooler regions. They examine
the relationship between agricultural land values and climate using county-level data in
the United States. This approach is often called the Ricardian (or duality) approach
because of its focus on land values. It side-steps the problems of understanding explicit
crop and farmer responses to climate by implicitly assuming that the biophysical and
economic adjustments imposed by climate change will be made automatically (an
assumption that can be confirmed today by examining crops and behaviours in warmer
climates). In other words, farmers adapt to new environmental conditions by altering
input choices, production technologies, and crop mixes. The approach is based on the
theory that in competitive market economies, land value is measured by the present
value of expected net revenues that are derived from the most economically efficient
management and use of land.
Specifically, the Ricardian approach uses regression techniques to estimate the marginal
effects of various climate, economic, and other factors on farmland values. Data
requirements include farmland values, climate variables such as mean monthly tem-
peratures and precipitation, data on soil and land conditions, e.g., salinity, permeability,
moisture capacity, erodability, and any other factors (e.g., socio-economic and cultural
characteristics) that would help explain farming practices and land values.
In contrast, Darwin et al. (1995) develop and combine a global computable general
equilibrium (CGE) model with a GIS model to analyse potential climate change impacts
on US agriculture, taking into account both interactions with both non-agricultural
sectors and other global regions. The GIS component describes regional characteristics
of land, climate, water, and agricultural suitability. In this approach, climate change is
assumed to shift the regional land class and water characteristics, thus altering the
production possibilities for a given region. The CGE component then estimates the
resulting economic changes and the effects on regional and global production and price.
The strength of spatial-analogue approaches is that structural changes and farmer
responses are implicit in the analysis, freeing the analyst from the burden of estimating
the effects of climate change on particular region-specific crops and farmer responses.
Mendelsohn et al. (1994) argue that these approaches account for changes in production
possibilities better, by implicitly capturing substitution and adaptation more than is
UNEP/IVM Handbook
8-28
possible in structural models (because the analyst cannot imagine and account for all
the adaptations farmers can make).
The weakness, however, is that these approaches assume a long-run equilibrium that
ignores short- and medium-run adjustment costs. For example, the spatial-analogue
model abstracts from the issues and costs of changes in structural characteristics such
as irrigation systems that may be necessary to mimic warmer climate practices —
presuming also that the necessary surface- or groundwater is available to service the
system. The CGE/GIS approach of Darwin et al. (1995) provides linkages with
projected global changes, which Mendelsohn et al. (1994) do not; however, these
models are data intensive at a global scale and sacrifice some of the spatial richness
afforded by country-level data. The Ricardian approach, however, does not account for
likely changes in output and input prices that result from global changes in production,
and which affect farm-level adaptation decisions. These approaches also assume that
farmers will automatically know how and when to respond to climate changes.
Assessment of global effects
Climate change may alter the competitive position of countries with respect, for
example, to exports of agricultural products. This may result from yields increasing as
a result of altered climate in one country, whilst being reduced in another. The altered
competitive position may affect not only exports, but also regional and farm-level in-
come, rural employment, and the type of crops grown in a region. While most studies
are unlikely to include an analysis of competitiveness itself, it is possible to evaluate the
relative position of a country by studying the few analyses of climate change effects on
global food trade. Indeed, some data on country-level output are available as part of the
global studies (the Egypt example in Box 8.2 shows how such data can be used).
Two general equilibrium models have also been used to evaluate effects on global food
supply: the Basic Linked System (BLS) (Rosenzweig and Parry, 1994) and SWOPSM
(Reilly et al., 1994). Both derive their information on climate-change induced
alterations of supply from ICASA/IBSNAT crop yield studies. The estimates of yield
changes were interpolated from 112 sites in 18 countries across the geographical area
of all countries and from the modelled crops to crops (such as cassava, oil palm) and
livestock not modelled. The BLS model used these inputs, in combination with assumed
changes over time in demand (due to population growth and per capita consumption
resulting from economic growth) and in supply (due to technological change leading to
increased yields), to estimate changes in food prices and risk of hunger that might result
from climate change (examples of the altered yield levels are shown in Figure 8.7).
Once a global estimate of impact of this kind has been made, this information can serve
as an exogenous control in regional impact studies.

different approaches
The approaches described above each have their merits and their limitations. Frequently
they are suited to some purposes and not to others, and they vary greatly in relation to
(1) the temporal and spatial scales they address; (2) the time, data, and analytic skills
they require; and (3) their cost. Table 8.6 summarises these characteristics.

8.2.5 Impact estimates
In this section we consider the different ways in which assessments of impacts due to
climate change can best be presented. In general, such estimates are calculated as the
differences between those conditions that are projected with climate change and those
conditions projected to exist under the future baseline (i.e., without climate change). A
wide array of adaptations is likely in anticipation of such impacts, and those need to be
incorporated in the impact assessment in order for sufficient reality to be maintained. In
practice, however, it is sometimes easier first to conduct impact assessments assuming
a limited range of adaptation in order to reduce the degree of complexity of the problem.
Subsequently different forms of adaptation can be introduced to the analysis in order to
assess their effectiveness in modifying the magnitude and rate of impact.
The impact models which have been selected as most appropriate for use should be run
first for observed (current) conditions, then for projected reference conditions (without
climate change), and finally for future conditions under climate change. Comparison of
results under current and future reference conditions allows analysis of the extent of
impact due to non-climate factors such as technological change. The series of analytical
steps is given in Figure 8.5.

8.2.5.1 Quantitative analysis
Effects at site scale. Most model-based impact assessments provide quantitative
measures of impact that express changes from the reference case. Because impact
models often require considerable amounts of input data for testing and calibration,
their use may be restricted to only a limited number of point locations or sites. Figure

8.6 illustrates tabulated changes in yields of maize in Zimbabwe for three sites under
current climate (i.e., the base case), under three scenarios of altered weather due to
climate change and under the same scenarios of altered weather together with the direct
effects of higher levels of ambient atmospheric CO2 on plant photosynthesis and water
use. The sites have been selected to represent a range of different agro-climatic
environments in Zimbabwe and assume, unrealistically, no adaptation. At the bottom of
Figure 8.6 is a tabulated representation of the effects of two forms of adaptation
(fertilising and irrigation) in reducing the negative effects of the most extreme of the
three climate change scenarios.

Muchena and Iglesias, 1995).

8-33
Changes in geographical distribution. Since climate varies over space, its effect on
agriculture also varies spatially and its spatial pattern is likely to change as the climate
changes. By mapping these altered distributions, it is possible to provide place-specific
information for policy makers concerning altered levels of resource availability due to
climate change. Our ability to conduct such analyses has been improved with the
development of computer-based GIS, which can be used to store, analyse, and depict
spatial information.
For example, where several compatible regional studies have been completed it is
possible to expand the scale of estimates from a regional to a global level. For example,
the estimates of impact on maize yields in Zimbabwe were one of a set of estimates
derived as part of the international study of global yield changes described above. The
global pattern of results is shown in Figure 8.7. Under all three scenarios of climate
change considered in this study, effects on yield levels of food grains are generally
negative at lower latitudes (where higher temperatures and changes in precipitation
exacerbate existing problems of water limitation on crop plants) and are generally
positive at middle and high-middle latitudes (where high temperatures are either
beneficial for crops through a lengthened growing season, or if they are not beneficial,
their negative effect on yield is more than compensated by the direct effects of CO2). It
should be noted, however, that no forms of adaptation (such as changes in crop cultivar,
irrigation, or cropping patterns) were incorporated in the foregoing analysis.
Changes in risk. Since many impacts from climate change are expected to occur
through the incidence of extreme weather (such as droughts, floods, hurricanes), an
effective way of characterising a change in climate is as a change in the level of risk of
such damaging effects. An important point emerging from such analyses is that
probabilities of exceedance of given values frequently alter non-linearly, indeed quasi-
exponentially, with changes in the mean value due to climate change.
An alternative to portraying altered risk values at a point is to map the spatial shift of
given risk values due to climate change. For example, where there is a linear decrease in
thermal resources either upslope due to the lapse rate of temperature or poleward in
mid-latitude areas due to shorter and less intense growing seasons, the risk of there
being insufficient warmth to permit crops to reach maturity increases quasi-exponen-
tially. Lines of equal value of probability of crop failure can be mapped, and the shift of
location of these due to climate change can be plotted (see, for example, Parry and
Carter, 1985).
Costs and benefits. One of the most valuable forms in which results of impact assess-
ments can be provided is as costs or benefits. Methods of evaluating these range from
formal economic techniques such as cost-benefit analysis to descriptive or qualitative
assessments.

Cost-benefit analysis is often employed to assess the most efficient allocation of re-
sources. This is achieved by balancing or optimising various costs and benefits anti-
cipated in undertaking a new project or implementing a new policy, accounting for the
reallocation of resources likely to be brought about by external influences such as cli-
mate change. The approach makes explicit the expectation that a change in resource
allocation is likely to yield benefits as well as costs, a useful counterpoint to many
climate impact studies, where negative impacts have tended to receive the greatest
attention.
Whatever measures are employed to assess costs and benefits, they should employ
common units of value. Thus, for example, where monetary values are ascribed, this is
usually calculated in terms of net present value, i.e., the discounted sum of future costs
and benefits. The choice of discount rate used to calculate present value will vary from
nation to nation depending on factors such as the level of economic development, debt
stock and social provision. Moreover, the depreciation of capital assets with time,
which varies from country to country, should be explicitly considered in the
calculations. For a discussion of these issues and of methods for evaluating costs and
benefits, see Pearce (1993).
8.2.5.2 Qualitative analysis
Some assessments need to be conducted rapidly and at little expense, perhaps to give a
preliminary indication of impacts for more detailed subsequent study. In such cases
there is frequently resort to expert judgement. The success of such evaluations usually
rests on the experience and interpretative skills of the analysts, particularly concerning
projections of possible future impacts of climate. The disadvantages of subjectivity
have to be weighed against the ability to consider all factors thought to be of im-
portance (something that is not always possible using more objective methods such as
modelling). The most successful qualitative analyses are those which integrate what is
known (as a result of formal research) with what is unknown, and such a mixture of
information can assist in this integration. Those are techniques of analysis that can
serve to integrate quantitative and qualitative information, such as cross impacts
analysis. For information on this, see Martin and Lefebvre (1993).
8.3  Adaptation strategies
Historically agriculture has shown a considerable ability to adapt to changing con-
ditions, whether these have stemmed from alterations in resource availability, tech-
nology, or economics. If climate change is gradual, it may be that adjustment goes
largely unnoticed as part of responses to more profound changes due to technology and
policy and that the process is one largely of autonomous adjustment. Many adaptations
will thus occur autonomously and without the need for conscious response by farmers
and agricultural planners. For example, as crop yields are affected by climate, different
areas of land will be allocated to new, highest-value, uses. As far as possible these
adjustments should be incorporated in the assessments of impact.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
8-36
 However, it is likely at least in some or most parts of the world that the rate and magnitude
of climate change will exceed that of normal change in agriculture and that specific
technologies and management styles will need to be adopted to avoid the most serious of
effects. There is therefore much to be gained from evaluating the capability that exists in
currently available technology and the potential capability that can developed in the future.
8.3.1 On-farm adaptation
 There is a very wide array of methods in crop husbandry that have been developed both to
make the most of what climate offers and to minimise the adversity that it sometimes brings.
The most relevant of these are methods designed to “weather-proof” agriculture and these
can often be adapted to afford some protection against climate change. We can consider
these in three categories: (1) altered choice of crops, (2) altered tillage and crop management,
and (3) altered inputs. Table 8.7 lists the options within these categories, along with the
action to be taken and the impacts avoided.

8.3.2 Household and village adaptation
There is a wide range of coping strategies used by semi-commercial farmers in all parts
of the world to mitigate the effects of weather. The best developed of these, and
probably the best understood, are those coping strategies for drought in India and
Africa. These are generally characterised by a mix of technological, economic and
social responses which can operate best for a short period (perhaps a few months).
Table 8.8 illustrates the range of coping strategies adopted by smallholders in central
and eastern Kenya. It includes many of the farm-level adaptations considered above but
most noticeably adds to these an array of strategies to maintain income through re-
deployment of assets and labour.
8.3.3 National level adaptation
While most agricultural adaptation to climate change will ultimately be characterised by
responses at the local level, the encouragement of response by national policymakers
will affect their speed and extent of adoption. Response at the national level will also be
necessary to encourage research, training, and communication concerning the most
appropriate adaptive measures. The most important of these, summarised by the IPCC
(1996), are as follows:
• 
Improved training and general education of populations dependent on agriculture,
particularly in countries where education of rural workers is currently limited.
• 
Identification of the present vulnerabilities of agricultural systems.
• 
Agricultural research to test the robustness of new farming strategies and develop
new crop varieties.
• 
Education and communication to bring research results to farmers.
• 
Food programs and other social security programs to provide insurance against
local supply changes.
• 
Transportation, distribution, and market integration to provide the infrastructure to
supply food during crop shortfalls.
• 
Removal of subsidies, which can, by limiting changes in prices, mask the climate
change signal in the marketplace.
Evaluating the effectiveness of these and other national responses requires information
of their costs and benefits and a comparison of their efficacy toward meeting national
objectives. A formal method of conducting such an assessment is multi-criteria analysis,
in which each strategy is evaluated with respect to maximising the level of achievement
of some objectives.

Some procedures for formulating adaptation strategies (top: multi-

Parry and Carter, 1988).
Selecting preferred strategies will almost always involve trade-offs between meeting
different objectives. One possible method of evaluating these trade-offs is the policy
exercise. This combines elements of a modelling approach with expert judgement.
Policy makers in government and agriculture are encouraged to participate with senior
scientists in exercises (often based on the principle of gaming), where they are asked to
judge appropriate policy responses to a number of given impacts which may result from
Agriculture

climate change. Their decisions are then evaluated using impact models. A description
of the procedure is given in Toth (1989), and an example can be found in the climate
impact assessment conducted in South-East Asia (Parry et al., 1992).
8.4  Summary and implications
In this chapter we have reviewed a number of approaches that are useful in analysing
impacts and adaptations in agriculture. No single approach should be considered op-
timal, because research objectives and data availability differ from one study to an-
other. Indeed, it is quite likely that a mix of approaches will be the most effective in
some circumstances; for example, using detailed models for a limited number of sites
(these models are often data-hungry) and then extrapolating their outputs across larger
areas which have been characterised by more simple agro-climatic indices. This will
generate estimates of climate-change induced yield effects, and is generally the first step
in agricultural impact studies.
A frequent second step is to evaluate these yield changes in terms of their economic and
social implications such as farm income, rural employment, and contribution to national
income. This requires the use of economic models and other techniques with which the
climatologist and agronomist are often unfamiliar. There are, therefore, great
advantages to be gained from the creation of a research team with experts from a
number of disciplines, including agricultural economists and rural planners.
As the results of the research are scaled up from effects on yields to those on income
and employment, the uncertainties become greater. It is important that these are ade-
quately described, so that the policy maker can weigh what is known against what is
not.
Finally, it is important to provide an estimate (perhaps through expert judgement,
although preferably by some of the formal methods that have been described) of the
relative roles of climate and non-climate factors in affecting agriculture in the study
over the period in question. In most parts of the world, changes in government policy, prices,
and technology will be just as important as climate change in affecting agriculture in the
future. The effects of climate change should be placed in the context of these.

9.1  Nature and scope of the problem
Rangeland and livestock ecosystems are complex, with myriad interactions among the
biotic and abiotic components of the system as well as the economic and social com-
ponents. Consequently, the effects of a changing climate will have direct (first order)
and indirect (second or higher order) impacts at many different spatial and temporal
scales. Examples of these impacts include changes in forage yield, changes in livestock
productivity, changes in ecological processes, alterations in farm level profitability,
changes in regional farm incomes, and possibly modification of regional and national
food production and incomes. Therefore, understanding lower order impacts are crucial
for anticipating and predicting higher order effects (Parry and Carter, 1989).
The goals of the rangeland and livestock assessment are to (1) identify rangeland pro-
duction areas that are sociologically, economically, and ecologically vulnerable to
changes in climate; (2) evaluate how climate affects management practices and eco-
logical processes of rangeland and livestock systems; and (3) identify possible adapt-
ation strategies to minimise adverse effects and, where possible, optimise positive
benefits of climate change. The methods described in this chapter are meant to provide
the means for accomplishing these goals.

Rangeland and
Livestock
UNEP/IVM Handbook
9-2
Rangelands, which can be defined as unimproved grasslands, savannahs, shrublands,
hot and cold deserts, and tundra, cover approximately one-fifth of the world’s land
surface and provide food for approximately 50 percent of the world’s ruminate live-
stock and countless numbers of wild herbivores (WRI, 1996). Billions of people around
the world either directly or indirectly derive food or income from livestock that graze or
browse on these lands.
Increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) can raise plant productivity and cause
changes in temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and wind patterns that could have
important effects, either positive or negative, on animal and plant production in
rangeland ecosystems. Consequently, climate driven changes in the sustainability and
productivity of rangeland and livestock systems could have profound direct and indirect
effects on human populations, local, regional, and national food supplies, and economic
security for most nations in the world.
9.1.1 Impacts on livestock
The IPCC (1996) summarised research on the potential impacts of climate change for
livestock and listed four possible effects: (1) changes in livestock feedgrain availability
and price; (2) direct effects of climate on animal health, growth, and reproduction; (3)
impacts on pasture and forage crops; and (4) changes in distribution of disease and
parasites.
Although the primary focus of this chapter is concerned with rangeland and livestock
systems, some mention should be given to the possible effects of climate change on
more intensively managed livestock production schemes. A review of available research
suggests that direct impacts may be minor for intensively managed livestock production
systems such as confined poultry, swine, and beef operations (IPCC, 1996). These
systems already have a great deal of built-in climate control through the use of shade,
misting devices, and mechanical heat regulation. However, there are important indirect
effects on these systems, for example, costs and availability of feedgrain, water quality
and quantity, and cost, availability, and type of energy sources.
The well being and productivity of livestock in natural conditions depend on the ani-
mal’s ability to cope with environmental challenges such as nutritional and thermal
environments and exposure to disease and parasites. The direct effects from heat and
water stress on grazing or browsing livestock are most likely to be manifested as de-
creases in feed intake, milk production, and rates of reproduction.
The indirect effects of climate driven changes on animal performance result from
alteration in the animal’s nutritional environment. Research suggests that changes in
climate are most likely to influence the quality and quantity of forage produced
(Walker, 1994; Van den Pol van Dasselaar and Lantinga, 1995; De-Xing Chen et al.,
1996; Fuller and Prince, 1996; Topp and Doyle, 1996a; Thornley and Cannell, 1996).
Consequently, these changes in forage may alter the productivity of grazing livestock
(Baker et al., 1993; Eckert et al., 1995; Topp and Doyle, 1996b).
Rangeland and Livestock
9-3
Climatic restrictions on vectors, environmental habitats, and disease causing agents are
important for keeping many animal diseases in check (Stem et al., 1989). Alterations of
temperature and precipitation regimes may result in a spread of disease and parasites
into new regions or produce an increase in the incidence of disease. Changes in the
incidence and spread of disease and parasites would reduce animal productivity and
possibly increase animal mortality.
9.1.2 Impacts on rangelands
Climatic changes such as increased atmospheric concentration of CO2, changes in
temperature, and changes in precipitation patterns have the potential to affect rangeland
ecosystems. An in-depth description and literature review of the current state of
knowledge regarding the effects of these driving forces on plant and ecosystem physi-
ology and biogeochemistry are beyond the scope of this chapter. Instead, a summary of
direct and indirect impacts and feedbacks of climate change is provided here. Detailed
reviews and studies regarding these processes can be found in IPCC (1996) and
Breymeyer et al. (1996).
The direct effects of climate and climate change on rangeland ecosystem processes are
fairly well described, have relatively short response times, and are somewhat easier to
predict than the indirect effects. The direct effects of climate change on rangeland
ecosystems from alterations in precipitation regimes, temperature, and atmospheric
concentrations of CO2 include (1) changes in decomposition rates; (2) changes in
aboveground net primary production (ANPP); (3) shifts in C3/C4 species of grasslands;
(4) changes in fluxes of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane
(CH4), ammonia (NH3), nitric oxide (NO), and nitrous oxide (N2O); (5) changes in
evapotranspiration and runoff; and (6) changes in forage quality (Ojima et al., 1991;
Breymeyer et al., 1996; IPCC, 1996).
The indirect effects are less well understood. Because of lags in the response time of the
system and the complexity of the feedbacks that are involved, the impacts of climate
change take longer to identify. Also human activities, including burning, cropping, and
management of grazing animals, have the potential to modify indirect effects by either
accelerating or slowing these processes. Thus predicting the direction and magnitude of
the impact is more difficult. Examples of the indirect effects of climate change on
rangeland ecosystems include (1) changes in the structure of vegetation communities;
(2) changes in vegetation cover that could alter surface albedo, humidity, and ground
level wind patterns; (3) changes in the C:N ratios or lignification of vegetation that alter
litter quality and affect soil nutrients; (4) alterations in soil characteristics; (5) changes
in biogeochemical cycles that lead to the invasion of exotic species of plants; and (6)
possible influence on frequency of wildfires in some areas (Ojima et al., 1991; IPCC,
1996).

9.1.3 Socio-economic impacts
Climate induced changes on rangelands and livestock production would have effects on
economies and societies at farm, national, and international levels. These impacts are
likely to be seen as changes in income and prices, and hence changes in livelihood,
employment, and investment. Analysing such impacts would require an economic
model, more specifically a (recursive) applied (or computable) general equilibrium
model. Such models have been applied to climate change impacts on agriculture, though
not on livestock, and are discussed in Chapter 8, Agriculture.
Social systems in some parts of the world may be stressed beyond their ability to cope
with any further changes in climate. In areas where livestock are forced to graze on
marginal lands (either by social structure, economic conditions, or governmental
regulations), further degradation or reductions in forage productivity could result in
political unrest, famine, or other social disturbances.
9.1.4 Areas and extent of impacts
The rangeland and livestock sector is most likely to be vulnerable in countries in the
poorer regions of the world and least capable of adapting to change in climate or other
environmental perturbations (Antle, 1995). Many of the countries in these regions are
experiencing high population growth that forces expansion of grazing into areas of
marginal productivity, which places extreme pressures on an already stressed ecosystem
(Parry et al., 1988).
The potential negative impacts of climate change on livestock production are likely to
be greater in those areas of the world where production is already operating at the
margins. Traditional pastoralist systems that are seen in many regions of the developing
world are less likely to have the flexibility built into the system for adapting to extreme
climatic events (such as changing the type or mix of grazing livestock, cross-breeding,
relocating), whereas modern industrialised livestock production systems in the western
regions of the United States, Canada, and parts of South America are more likely to
make adjustments to mitigate many of the potential negative effects of climate change.
Changes in precipitation are especially important in regions where lack of rainfall is
already a limiting factor (Parry et al., 1990). At a regional level, alterations in rainfall
patterns are likely to have a greater ecological and socio-economic impact than the
direct effects of small increases in mean annual temperature (IGBP, 1992). Although, in
those areas of world where daytime temperatures are at the limits or approach the upper
limits for livestock production, higher temperatures at night may cause heat stress in
animals.
The negative effects of increases in concentrations of atmospheric CO2 are most likely
to be experienced in tropical and sub-tropical rangelands. The IPCC Working Group II
(IPCC, 1996) listed the extent of known regional impacts of altered climate regimes and
the relative degree of confidence in their prediction. They predicted with medium
Rangeland and Livestock
9-5
confidence that increased atmospheric concentrations of CO2 are likely to alter the
carbon and nitrogen ratios of some forage plants. The result of this phenomenon would
be manifested in a decreased palatability and nutritional quality of the forage. This is
most likely to occur in lower latitude rangelands where forage quality is already low.
The IPCC also predicted with a high degree of confidence that small changes in the
frequency of extreme climatic events may have disproportionate effects on what
managers and herders have to cope with in rangeland systems. Changes in climate are
likely to produce alterations in the boundaries between rangelands and other biomes,
such as deserts and forests, directly through shifts in species composition and indirectly
through changes in wildfire regimes, opportunistic cultivation, or agricultural release of
the less arid margins of the rangeland territory (IPCC, 1996). They predicted that these
effects will be more common in temperate rangelands.
9.1.5 Identification of impacts and adaptations options
To keep the task of impact assessment manageable, the range of climatic impacts to be
included in the assessment should be listed and prioritised within the goals of the
assessment. Table 9.1 contains a list of the possible types climate driven impacts that
are likely to occur in the rangeland and livestock sector.
Table 9.1  Likely impacts in rangeland and livestock sector.
Livestock impacts
Shifts in rangeland vegetation structure or boundaries
Changes in forage quality and quantity
Changes in length of growing season
Changes in livestock productivity
Changes in water quality and quantity.
Ecological impacts
Alteration in carbon storage capacity of the ecosystem
Alterations in greenhouse gas emissions
Disturbances in ecosystem functions (e.g., alterations in
biogeochemical cycling, incidence of wild fires, etc.)
Change in soil quality and productivity
Changes in biodiversity
Changes in habitat suitability for wildlife.
Socio-economic impacts
Changes in food production and security (locally, regionally,
and nationally)
Changes to incomes derived from livestock production, wildlife,
and other rangeland outputs
Changes in land use
Changes in recreational use of rangelands
Alteration in scenic quality.
As can be seen from Table 9.1, there are many potential cross-sectoral impacts to be
considered in the assessment. The team designing the assessment for this section is
strongly urged to co-ordinate their effort with the water resources (Chapter 6), agri-
culture (Chapter 8), energy (Chapter 11), forests (Chapter 12), and biodiversity
(Chapter 13) sectors.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
9-6
Once the impacts to be included in the assessment are identified, a list of indicator
variables, those variables used to evaluate change in the system (see Table 9.2), and
adaptation options should be identified. Some of the methods presented in the next
section are better than others at producing outputs that can be used for adaptation
assessments or incorporation into policy assessments. Therefore, a particular method or
suite of methods should be chosen based on impacts and adaptation strategies to be
used in the assessment.
9.2  An array of methods
This section presents an array of methods for conducting climate change impact
assessments for rangeland and livestock systems.
9.2.1 Description of methods
9.2.1.1 Experimentation
A wealth of data and knowledge has been gleaned from experiments on the effects of
environmental stresses on the physiology and production of plants and animals. Also
there is a growing amount of information available on the effects of atmospheric con-
centrations of CO2 on plant production (Gonzàlez-Meler et al., 1996; IPCC, 1996;
Long et al., 1996; Shaver and Aber, 1996), plant quality and decomposition (Melillo,
1996), and soil carbon storage (Paustian et al., 1995; Tate et al., 1995). Because of the
long time delays in response, complex interactions, and lack of feedbacks, experimen-
tation has limited application with regard to impact assessment. But the data produced
and understanding gained in the workings of individual components of the system are
extremely useful for other assessment methods.
Even though the usefulness of experimentation is limited and may be considered im-
practical in the context of programs or projects with limited funding, like climate
change country studies, the establishment of long-term field experiment sites is
extremely valuable, and usually needs to be budgeted for separately. This type of
research program could be considered as a future research priority should funding or
collaborative arrangements with other national or international agencies become
available. For example, since the establishment of the first six sites in the United States
during the early 1980s, the National Science Foundation’s Long Term Ecological
Research program has been conducting research on long-term ecological phenomena in
the United States and developing a network of sites in other countries throughout Asia,
Australia, South America, Africa, and Europe. These long-term field experimental sites
represent a unique source of information on long-term ecological processes and are a
principal component necessary for regional assessments of the effects of climate on
those processes (Hall et al., 1995; Paustian et al., 1995).

9.2.1.2 Screening techniques
The purpose of preliminary screening is to identify those areas where more detailed
analysis may be needed or to develop some initial quantitative assessments of an area’s
vulnerability and response to climatic change. Regions of vulnerability may be spatially
defined by administrative, geographic, or ecological boundaries. Methods used in a
screening analysis include the construction and utilisation of simple indicators or
indices, geographical analyses, the use of remotely sensed data, or a combination of the
three methods.
 Indicators or indices
Two basic characteristics can be used to define indicators (Hammond et al., 1995).
First, they must quantify information so that the significance of the data is more readily
apparent. Second, they must improve communication by simplifying information about
complex phenomena.
In the development of indices, administrative or geographic boundaries can be used to
delineate areas that are economically or sociologically dependent on livestock produc-
tion from rangelands (Baker et al. 1993; Eckert et al., 1995). Clearly, areas that are
economically dependent on rangelands for livestock production are susceptible to the
positive as well as the negative effects of changes in climatic conditions.
Ecological boundaries can also be used to define areas that are ecologically at risk from
changes in climate. These areas can be defined by their susceptibility to degradation,
loss of biodiversity, desertification, and so on. Economic and demographic data can be
combined with ecological data to develop a socio-ecological risk index (Baker and
Hanson, 1993). However, the construction of this type of index is not an end in and of
itself. Careful analyses must be conducted to determine the nature and degree of the
risk. For example, rangelands at the northern or wetter edge of an ecological boundary
may not be at risk or at much less risk than rangelands at the southern or drier edge of
the boundary.
Geographic analysis
Another approach that can be used to determine and analyse areas that are sensitive to
changes in climate is the use of GIS (Du Preez et al., 1990; Baker and Hanson, 1993;
Baker et al., 1993). It allows for the integration and summarisation of environmental
information using natural units such as watersheds, rangeland areas, and soil units.
Indices can be included in a GIS to demonstrate spatially where the impacts of climate
change such as degradation of rangeland resources are most likely to occur and where
degradation would have economically significant societal impacts.
Rangeland and Livestock
9-9
Satellite remote sensing enables scientists to make direct observations of the land sur-
face at frequent and repetitive intervals, hence allowing for the mapping and monitoring
of changes in land use and cover at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Other
applications of remotely sensed data include inventory of pasture and rangeland vege-
tation, changes in forage condition, monitoring soil erosion and soil moisture, and
detection of episodic events on rangelands.
There is an extensive body of literature within many natural science disciplines that
document the development and potential for satellite sensor data analysis techniques for
use in climate change research. A partial and very abbreviated list of related papers on
this topic is provided in Table 9.3.
Not all remotely sensed data come from satellites. Aerial photography is also a very
useful method for collecting information regarding rangeland systems. The Systematic
Reconnaissance Flight (SRF) is the best known and most widely used method. It
employs a combination of photographs or video imagery with visual observations to
estimate the numbers and spatial distribution of human settlements, livestock, wildlife,
land use, and land cover types (Norton-Griffiths, 1988). The SRF method provides a
rapid and relatively inexpensive means for gathering a systematic sample of remotely
sensed imagery and field observations (Hassan and Hutchinson, 1992).

9.2.1.3 Expert judgement
There is no more simple or inexpensive method for rapid assessment of the state of
knowledge of the effects of climate change on rangeland and livestock systems than
asking the opinion of experts. Experts on animal science, range science, agricultural
economics, soil science, climatology or meteorology, and social sciences may be
solicited for their opinions on possible impacts.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
9-10
The use of indigenous knowledge may be valuable for filling information gaps in data
and understanding as well. There are three global centres, the US based Center for
Indigenous Knowledge for Agriculture and Rural Development (CIKARD) at Iowa
State University; LEAD in The Netherlands; and CIRAN; two regional centres in
Nigeria and the Philippines, and several national centres in, Mexico, Indonesia, Ghana,
Kenya, Sri Lanka, Brazil, Venezuela, South Africa, Burkina Faso, and Germany that
provide training, data, and establish lines of communication between citizens and the
development community. CIKARD is currently in the process of compiling a method
for the use of indigenous knowledge in a training manual.
In many data poor areas, expert judgement from resource experts may be used as data
by utilising the Delphi method. Clearly, the success of the Delphi and other methods of
utilising expert judgement depends greatly on the proper selection of the group of
experts, who should have access to the best available information and most recent
research in their respective fields of study. The usefulness of expert opinion also de-
pends on the scope and depth of the expert’s experiences and understanding of the
problem.
9.2.1.4 Analogue scenarios
Another way to examine the possible effects of climate change on rangeland and live-
stock production systems is to use an analogous scenario from either another place or
another time. There are four types of analogies, historical event, historical trend, re-
gional analogies of present climate, and regional analogies of future climate.
Little research has been conducted using analogue scenarios to examine the potential
effects of climate change on rangeland and livestock systems. Easterling et al. (1992)
constructed a historical analogue climate scenario from climate records during the Dust
Bowl era (1930-1940) in the Great Plains of the United States to determine the effects
of climate change on agricultural production in the Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, and
Kansas region. Although this study did not analyse the effects of climate change on
rangeland livestock, the team did examine the indirect effects of a changing climate on
feed sources for animal production. An overview of this study can be found in Chapter
4, Integration.
An example of an analogue scenario would be examining rangeland livestock produc-
tion practices in a region that has a current climate similar to the projected change in
climate, in the region under study. Alternatively, the impact of historical events such as
protracted drought or monsoons on livestock production could also be incorporated into
the analysis, as described above. In each of these examples, the analysis would provide
a basis for creating a qualitative or even a semi-quantitative description of potential
impacts.

9.2.1.5 Empirical-statistical models
An empirical-statistical model can be used to explain system dynamics by empirically
analysing the relationships between some defined input and output variable such as a
particular climate variable and forage yield on livestock production. This type of model
is relatively simple to develop and can have a very high accuracy of prediction over the
range of data for which it was developed. However, these models do have limitations.
Statistical models are descriptive and not mechanistic in nature. Thus they provide only
limited insight into the mechanisms underlying the particular patterns of interest. They
are also unsuited for predicting responses to novel situations for which no data are
available.
The statistical model lends itself quite nicely, however, to predicting first-order effects
of climate change on forage and livestock production. Bergthorsson (1985) developed a
model from climate and livestock data to compute the potential of livestock production
in Iceland. The computational accuracy of the model was tested against historical data.
He then used temperature deviations from historical records to determine the potential
impacts of climate change, with regard to temperature, on livestock production. For
another application of the empirical-statistical method, see Box 9.1.
9.2.1.6 Life zone, bioclimatic, or eco-classification models
Life zone, bioclimatic, or eco-classification models are actually another type of empi-
rical-statistical model. These models range from very simple models such as the
Holdridge Life Zone model (Holdridge, 1967) to the more complex models as presented
in Prendergast and Hattersley (1985), Rizzo and Wiken (1992), Wang Futang and Zhao
Zong-Ci (1995), and Li Xia (1995). This modelling approach is useful for examining
impacts of climate on regional vegetation. However, because bioclimatic models are
based on correlation they are subject to all of the limitations of empirical-statistical
models as discussed above.
9.2.1.7 Processed based simulation models
Over the past 20 to 25 years many simulation models have been constructed to simulate
rangelands and livestock production. These models can be divided into three major
categories: biophysical models, decision support systems, and integrated models. In
keeping the discussion within the context of the goals of this Chapter, the group of
models under the heading of ecosystem or biophysical models can be further subdivided
into rangeland process models and rangeland livestock ecosystem models. This last
group also includes pastoral livestock production systems.
The intent of this discussion is not prescriptive in nature nor is the list of models
presented all inclusive. Rather, the discussion is meant to provide an overview of the
models and methods that have been used and cited in the literature for the assessment of

climate change in rangeland and livestock production systems. More information
regarding model requirements and source contacts is listed in table 9.10.
Box 9.1
Example: Adaptation to climate change in the Argentine
Pampas.
 The region and the problem: The Argentine Pampas is a wide plain with approximately 60 million
hectares of land mainly suited for cattle rearing and crop production. Based on its rainfall and soil quality
patterns, the region may be divided in humid, sub-humid, and semi-arid zones. During the last century,
various crop and cattle production activities were combined in different ways in each zone in response to
the permanent environmental constraints and the cyclical climate variability. However, land-use options
were also sensitive to economic conditions and technological factors. In this case, the problem was to
assess how the rural sector has adapted to varying climate conditions by adjusting land-use strategies
and other technological tactics.
 Methods: Following a scheme suggested by Steffen and Ingram (1995) to integrate information,
geographical and historical data were displayed along three intersecting axes: space, time, and adaptation
response (Viglizzo et al., 1995, Viglizzo et al. 1997). The last one was not quantifiable, but it was
necessary to identify different land use options that arose when a multilevel approach was utilised.
Therefore, to understand the adaptive response of land-use to climate change, geographical data sets
were analysed by scaling down along the space axis from the whole region to agro-ecological zones and
specific sites. Similarly, historical sets of data were manipulated following a scale-dependent analysis
which involved the last century as well as shorter periods of no more than three decades. Considering
that rainfall was the climate variable which provided the greatest statistical variability both in space and
time, a broad transect was displayed in the study region to cut across a wide rainfall gradient. Different
sites were analysed along different periods of time. Thus different geographical and historical scales were
combined in a multilevel approach. Long-term data sets on land use were compared with long-term data
on climate (rainfall), economic (price of products), and technological (yield trend) factors. Comparisons
were made within the transect for the whole region, the main agro-ecological zones (humid, sub-humid
and semi-arid), and specific sites (political districts). Because price and production level of different
farming activities were not comparable in absolute terms, relative indices were utilised for statistical
analysis. Simple linear and quadratic regression analysis were used to associate the climate, economic,
and technological factors with land-use change.
 Adaptation assessment: The formal hypothesis was that climate might be the main force explaining
changes in land use at the wider geographical space and the longer term, but factors other than climate
(e.g., price and yield) would be explaining most of the land-use variance at the lower scales of time (few
decades) and space (specific sites). But the results suggested that the hypothesis was partially wrong.
Land-use variability tended to respond to climate variability only in the long term, but not to the variability
of climate across the whole region. Thus the adaptive response of land use to climate change appeared to
be a site-specific and a time-dependent function, mainly in the humid environments. As the environmental
conditions turn drier in the western zones, the technology to improve water utilisation in soil appears to
have more weight than land use in the adaptation process.
 Policy options: Considering that the adaptation to climate change seems to be a site-specific and a time-
dependent function, adaptive policies in the Pampas should be oriented to long-term strategies on specific
sites instead of a generalised strategy for the whole region. Given that climate can drive both the
relocation and translocation of the farming activities, a better climate scenario may show a negative
impact on soil conservation, mainly in the fragile lands of the semi-arid zone, due to the uncontrolled
expansion of crops at the expense of pastures and natural areas. A dramatic agro-ecological collapse of
this kind occurred in the region during the 1930s and the 1940s. Since the natural reaction of farmers is
to grow more annual crops when rainfall increases, a long-term land preservation strategy should be
encouraged to counteract the potential undesirable effects of improved climate conditions.
 The importance of this kind of historical assessments is that they can help to understand the autonomous
adaptive behaviour of farmers to different climate conditions. This human dimension of the adaptive
Rangeland and Livestock
9-13
response would complement other options that can be assessed through the use of GIS, mathematical
modelling, expert systems, and decision-support tools.
Sources: Steffen and Ingram (1995); Viglizzo et al. (1995); Viglizzo et al. (1997).
Where possible, the use of validated simulation models developed in or near the region
of interest is highly recommended. These models are more likely to use data that are
available for the region and incorporate system processes that are unique to the area of
interest.
 Biophysical models
Biophysical simulation models mechanistically simulate ecological and physiological
processes. Because these models are process driven, they can be applied to many dif-
ferent environments and can also be used to test the sensitivity and stability of the
system to a range of changes in climatic conditions. Box 9.2 is an example of the
application of the process-based vegetation model BIOME to an analysis of rangelands
in Southern Africa.
Box 9.2  Example: Rangelands and climate change in Southern Africa.
Hulme (1996) discusses the potential impacts of climate change on the 12 countries of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC). Substantial attention is paid to
rangelands, as pastoralism and ecotourism are major income earners in these countries.
Three climate scenarios were evaluated, one with reduced precipitation, one with unchanged
precipitation, and one with increased precipitation. The scenarios are based on different
GCMs. All three have higher temperatures. The climate scenarios were used as input to a
generic model of potential vegetation (BIOME). Two of the three scenarios show a tendency
towards more arid vegetation. Increased temperatures outweigh the enhanced water use
efficiency due to higher ambient concentrations of carbon dioxide. Only the scenario with
increased precipitation shows a modest tendency towards more moist vegetation.
The distribution of 44 wildlife species was assessed using regression models developed spe-
cifically for this project. The models consider only direct climatic influences on species distri-
bution. For all three scenarios, an increase in species diversity was found, possibly furthering
opportunities for tourism. The models also indicate that species are likely to move to different
locations than where they can now be found. A similar exercise was undertaken for tsetse flies,
mosquitoes and ticks. The spread of tsetse flies – a limiting factor to cattle – was found to
decrease under all three scenarios.
The impact of these changes on livestock and pastoralists was assessed based on expert
judgement. Two of the three scenarios were concluded to worsen production and development
potentials for the regions as a whole, and perhaps substantially so in certain areas. The wet
scenario was found to lead to little change or perhaps a slight improvement. Climate change
thus seems to enhance current problems of population growth, weather variability, and soil
degradation.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
9-14
However, these models are very data intensive, and their major disadvantage is that
complete data sets for parameterising and validating them rarely exist. Also, the models
tend to be extremely complex, and a certain level of training and expertise is required to
use the model effectively. Lastly, many of the models that have been used in this
approach are point models, which require making simplifying assumptions when results
are aggregated to the regional level.
Rangeland ecosystem
Currently, there are four well recognised models that have been used under a variety of
environmental conditions and geographical locations to simulate the potential effects of
climate change, including the effects of atmospheric concentrations of CO2, on
rangeland or pasture ecosystems (Table 9.4). The models either do not have an animal
component or the herbivore model has been simplified, thus limiting livestock
management options and the analysis of indirect effects of impacts on animal pro-
ductivity.
Rangeland and livestock
The three models presented in Table 9.5 all contain a pasture or grassland model at the
same level of detail as the animal model. As above, these models also simulate the
effects of atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and climate change impacts on the
rangelands. The direct effects of climate change on animal production are simulated
only by SPUR2. The indirect effects of climate change, reduction in performance due to
changes in forage quality and quantity, are simulated by all three models. Only the
Hurley pasture model simulates or considers carbon as contributed by methane.
One of the major limitations to all of the animal models listed in Table 9.5 is that they
were developed in countries that have a livestock management system vastly different
than the nomadic pastoralist systems often found elsewhere in the world. Therefore,
adapting these models to this type of situation may be a daunting if not impossible task.
 Decision support systems
Decision support system (DSS) models allow the user to examine the potential effects
of management decisions in a given system based on a set of decision rules that have
been formulated in the model. One such DSS, GRASSMAN, has been used to evaluate
the effects of climate on livestock and pasture production as well as to predict changes
in emissions and productivity (McKeon et al., 1993; Howden et al., 1994).
GRASSMAN is an agricultural decision support model that allows users to investigate
the effect and interactions between tree clearing, livestock and pasture management, and
climate on pasture condition, animal performance, and paddock financial returns
(Scanlan and McKeon, 1990). The model has been modified to include sources, sinks,

and storage of greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, CO, and NO) in tropical and sub-
tropical savannah woodlands of northern Australia (Howden et al., 1994).

 Integrated models
Integrated models can be considered to be a special case of process-based models in
that they usually incorporate some type of process based simulation model with other
methods such as GIS or databases or economic models. The objectives of these models
are usually to attempt to model regional biophysical and socio-economic processes and
interactions simultaneously (Rosenberg, 1993). The site or regional impacts can then be
aggregated, where appropriate to regional or global impacts. Examples of this method
included the integration of a site specific grassland ecosystem model, CENTURY, and a
GIS (Burke et al., 1990); two regional models, CLIMPACTS (New Zealand focus) the
US effort VEMAP (Kenny et al., 1995; Kittel et al., 1995); and a global model TEM
(Melillo et al., 1993). The International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme’s terrestrial
transect program provides an excellent example of how many methods may be
combined to examine climate driven impacts on terrestrial ecosystems. The transects
are a set of integrated global change studies consisting of distributed observational
studies and manipulative experiments coupled with modelling and synthesis activities
organised along existing gradients of underlying global change parameters, such as
temperature, precipitation, and land-use. The transects are 1000 kilometres long and are
wide enough to encompass the dimensions of remote sensing images. They will be used
to determine changes in terrestrial biogeochemical cycling, study the effects of global
change on ecosystem composition and structure, and serve as a platform for studying
the impacts of global change on various aspects of terrestrial ecosystems, such as
production systems, soil processes, and ecological complexity. The initial set of
transects are located in four key regions: (1) the humid tropics of the Amazon basin,
central Africa, and Southeast Asia; (2) the semi-arid tropics in savannahs of west
Africa, Kalahari (southern Africa), and northern Australia; and (3) the mid-latitude
semi-arid grasslands of the US Great Plains, the Patagonia of Argentina; and north-
eastern China; and (4) the high latitude boreal forest-tundra of Alaska, Canada,
Scandinavia, and Siberia (IGBP, 1995).
9.2.1.8 Economic models
Several types of models can be used to evaluate the economic implications of the direct
effects (first order impacts) of climate change on rangeland and livestock production
systems for local and regional economies. Some of these models use outputs that are
collected from the methods describe above as inputs for stand-alone economic models,
and others are linked or integrated into biophysical simulation models. Chapter 8
describes relevant economic models in detail.
9.2.2 Selection of the method
Selection of the appropriate method to be used in the analysis is an extremely important
step in conducting a meaningful impact analysis. The first and most important step in
this process is defining a clear and concise statement of the problem and setting
Rangeland and Livestock
9-19
quantifiable goals and objectives for the assessment. Other issues that need to be
considered are:
• 
Defining the scale, scope, and time horizon of the assessment;
• 
Assessing the availability, resolution, and quality of the data;
• 
Assessing the availability of human, technological, and financial resources.
It is important to think about method selection as an iterative process that is based on
limiting factors. For example, goals and objectives may be set that require data that are
unavailable or the institutional infrastructure may be unable to support computer
intensive analyses.
Selection of the appropriate method may also be determined in context of the temporal
and spatial resolution of results and time frame for conducting the analysis. The matrix
presented in Table 9.6 combines these criteria with a ranking of data and resource needs
presented above. Where a range of scores are provided, it is assumed that techniques
may range from the very simple to the extremely complex.
9.3  Scenarios
Discussions of socio-economic and climate change scenario development are covered in
detail in Chapters 2 and 3, respectively. Regardless of what future climates have in
store for the world, establishing climatological and socio-economic baselines is essential
for detecting and measuring change.
9.3.1 Climatological baseline
Rangeland ecosystems are event driven systems in that the amount and timing of pre-
cipitation, fire, and grazing, as well as other activities, have the capacity to alter the
structure and function of the ecosystem. Extreme climatic events such as prolonged
droughts or monsoons also have the potential to alter the trajectory of these systems.
Therefore, baseline climate data should be from as long a period as possible to capture
the frequency of extreme events. The usual climate variables needed for rangeland
livestock production systems include temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, wind
run, and in some cases humidity. The resolution of the data, maximums and minimums,
daily, monthly, seasonal, or yearly averages, will depend on the method or model
employed.

9.3.2 Socio-economic baseline
The socio-economic baseline describes the present state of non-climatic factors that
affect rangeland livestock production systems. Information needed to establish this
baseline may include the following variables: vegetation cover (type and extent); soil
characteristics (depth, texture, properties, etc.); estimations of soil organic matter,
topography, and mean atmospheric concentration of CO2 or other trace gases; and other
non-climatic environmental variables. Socio-economic factors include land use, water
use, management practices (e.g., grazing management schemes), economic factors (e.g.,
contribution to GNP, price of market outputs such as meat, milk, hide, wool, etc.), food
demand, social variables (employment, settlements), structure or land tenure. Socio-
economic factors are not likely to remain static; therefore, it is important that baseline
conditions of the most important and relevant factors are considered in the assessment.
9.4  Autonomous adaptation
Adaptations may be classified as either autonomous, which usually refers to adjust-
ments made within the system, or planned, which refers to adjustments that are external
to the system such as adjustments that are initiated or prompted by public policy (Smit,
1993; Carter et al., 1994). Clearly, rangelands and the people who derive their
livelihood from these systems have some degree of inherent adaptability. The degree to
which these systems can adapt and remain productive for their defined use depends on
the magnitude, timing, frequency, and duration of the disturbance.
Autonomous adaptation in rangeland livestock production systems can be defined in
terms of ecological processes and human management decisions. From an ecological
standpoint the limit of the system’s ability to adapt depends on the rate of change of the
disturbance relative to the inherent rate of change in the system and to changes that
have occurred during the evolution of the system. The sustainability of the system as a
productive source of food for livestock and wildlife is directly related to how human
management practices adjust to the disturbance as well.
In terms of human adaptation, the nature and processes of adaptation to climate are
poorly understood and rarely directly investigated (Smithers and Smit, 1997). Although
the process and nature of adaptation may be elusive given the current state of
knowledge, evidence does exist, through the persistence of agricultural practices, that
cattle farmers make autonomous changes, both tactically and strategically, to offset the
effects of disruptions in the system (Table 9.7).

The selection of impact method will determine the type of adaptation analysis that can
be performed. Some of the methods will allow for conducting the assessment directly
whereas in other cases, the adaptation assessment will have to conducted by using
output generated from the impact assessment (Table 9.8).

In the discussion on the usefulness of experimentation for impact assessment, the
statement was made that this method had limited application. However, if improvements
are to be made on the estimates of potential impacts of climate change on agriculture,
there is a need to know more about the processes in which ranchers perceive and
respond to changes in climate (Smit et al., 1996). Perhaps an empirical analysis of
autonomous adaptation, such as the method used by Smit et al. (1996), should be
included into the impact and adaptation assessment or conducted as a corollary.

Smit et al. (1996) state that a distinction can be made between effects that are direct,
short-term changes made in response to climate change, and responses and adaptations
that are purposeful and conscious decisions made in reaction to the effects, which alter
the nature of farming and regional agricultural systems. The focus of this section is on
those strategic adaptations that would change the face of rangeland livestock production
for a given region. Adaptations such as these are usually a result of governmental or
public policy actions. (However, some of the measures mentioned here could be
classified as autonomous agriculturist adaptations as well.) The following lists were
compiled from recommendations made by IPCC WG II (1996).
Adaptations that facilitate production under a changing climate. The actions would be
undertake by individual ranchers, but incentives, information, and assistance may be
provided by governmental agencies.
• 
use vegetative barriers or snow fences to catch snow and increase soil moisture;
• 
use windbreaks to protect soil from erosion;
• 
reduce stocking rates;
• 
use feed conservation techniques and fodder banks;
• 
improve nutritional plane by using protein, vitamin, and mineral supplements;
• 
change in mix of grazing or browsing animals;
• 
alter animal distribution by the use of mineral blocks, watering points, and fences;
• 
start weed management program;
• 
restore degraded areas;
• 
increase native rangeland vegetation or plant adapted species.
Adaptations that are undertaken by government and are purposeful and strategic,
although, they can be either short or long in duration.
• 
modify price supports and other governmental programs to encourage cattle
farmers to respond quickly to climate change such as commodity co-operatives and
marketing boards, stabilisation programs and subsidies, and tariffs and other trade
barriers;
• 
develop large-scale watershed projects;
UNEP/IVM Handbook
9-24
• 
encourage production in the most efficient area by discouraging the use of marginal
lands and protecting areas that are degraded;
• 
if shifts in location occur, establish new farm to market links if necessary; purchase
rights of way before land appreciates;
• 
prepare for veterinary animal health services for the spread of diseases and
parasites;
• 
develop breeding programs;
• 
develop agroforestry systems;
• 
if production is declining, allow for more importation;
• 
if climate change seriously undermines the viability of the animal production sector,
develop support measures to fulfil other social objectives such as food security and
preservation of the rural community, induce a movement out of agriculture through
macroeconomic policies to assure that employment will be available outside of
agriculture, develop policies and institutions that facilitate movement between
sectors, create positive incentives for people to leave agriculture, stable economic
growth, and provide education.
All adaptive responses to climate change have associated pros and cons that will be
experienced biophysically, socially or culturally, and economically. The IPCC WG II
on rangelands developed a matrix of possible practices to mitigate the impacts on
climate change in rangeland production systems. A modified version of the matrix is
presented in Table 9.9.

9.6  Summary and implications
A variety of methods and modelling approaches have been presented in this chapter to
assess the impacts of climate change on rangeland and livestock production systems.
The choice of method to be used depends on the goals and objectives of the assessment,
the quality and quantity of data available, and the availability of human, technological,
and financial resources for the assessment. The scope of the analysis should be limited
to those areas where impacts are likely to be the greatest and where the most
meaningful analysis can be performed.
Often in climate change impact assessments more time and capital is spent investigating
first order biophysical responses to climate driven impacts. The authors wish to stress
the importance of spreading resources evenly among the assessment of second order
responses to impacts and conducting thorough and meaningful adaptation assessments.
Only by carefully assessment and reporting of these higher order effects can the
importance of the potential impacts be conveyed to policy makers.
A spatial or geographical dimension is a feature common to most of the outputs or
variables that indicate change in the impact analysis. Consequently, a quick and
powerful way to display the results of the analysis is through the use of maps. These
maps may be created by sophisticated computer GIS software or by hand. Other more
conventional methods such as clear and concise charts or table are also useful for pre-
sentation of results.
What lies in the future for rangeland and livestock impact analyses? Many studies have
been conducted on the potential effects of climate change on rangeland ecosystems.
Most of this work has been directed toward examining climate driven impacts on
ecological processes in rangelands. As a result, several models have been developed and
validated for predicting changes in rangeland ecosystem processes.
However, by comparison, little work has been done to assess the effects of climate
change on livestock production in rangeland ecosystems. The majority of the studies
that have included livestock have been conducted in developed countries. Consequently,
the models used in these studies tend to reflect the conditions and assumptions that exist
in these more intensively managed production schemes. There is a definite need for the
development of a robust model or suite of models that can be used to examine climate
impacts on livestock and rangelands over a wide range of environments and
management practices. These models should be developed in such a manner that output
variables would be meaningful and useful as inputs to economic, socio-economic, and
adaptation assessment analyses. The development of such methods will improve our
ability to assess the future of the people whose livelihoods depend on the sustainability
of rangelands.

10.1  Nature of the problem
Health is defined by the constitution of the World Health Organization as “a state of
complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease
or infirmity” (WHO, 1946). The sustainable health of human populations is an
integrating measure of our long-term environmental and ecological stewardship. Envi-
ronmental degradation, whether from chemical contamination or other forms of eco-
system disruption, can affect both acute and chronic human health problems. Thus,
human health should be considered one essential criterion of the “dangerous inter-
ference” with the climate system that is described in Article 2 of the UNFCCC. The
ability to assess the human health impacts of climate change, however, is still at a very
early stage of development.
There are a number of reasons for this relative scarcity of well-developed methods for
the assessment of health impacts from climate change. Since the germ theory of medi-
cine acquired dominance in Western thought in the nineteenth century, the focus of
health research has been on specific agents of disease and methods of combating them.
Understanding the relations between environmental factors such as climate and human
diseases has received less emphasis than understanding in exquisite detail the
biochemical workings of pathogens and the drugs created to control them. As a

consequence, our ability to describe and simulate the interactions between climate and
other environmental factors and human diseases is very limited.
Research methods in human health differ from those in the physical sciences. Much of
the data required for other sectors are measurements of physical states such as water
flow rates or chemical composition. Even where data types are similar, significant dif-
ferences remain: one example is that acquisition of data in health research depends on
human behaviours and co-operation. Consider the following: determining the level of
disease in an agricultural product or in a human population involves sampling. In a
human population, however, that sampling requires extensive co-operation of many
individuals, whether they are subjects who must co-operate with an interview or medi-
cal test, or health providers who must accumulate and submit measurements of diseases
during their work day. Sampling an agricultural product either in the field or during
production is comparatively simpler. This makes the acquisition of similar types of data
much more expensive, difficult to do, and inherently uncertain for health as compared to
the other sectors. This barrier alone impedes the progress of high quality research in
health-environment interactions.
Lastly, human health is arguably more complex than most of the outcomes of other
sectors. In most cases, health outcomes cannot be simply correlated with climate fac-
tors. Numerous other factors such as the level of economic development, state of sani-
tation and public health systems, and group and individual behaviour have a significant
effect on human health. Understanding the interactions among these factors, climate
variables, and human health in the present day is a difficult task. Being able to predict
how these interrelated factors will change in the future and then analysing their effects
on future climate changes and human health is a daunting task. This difficulty is
compounded by the fact that anticipated climate changes are beyond the range of
observable events for most areas (McMichael, 1993)
As a result, this chapter differs from other sectoral chapters. It is not possible to place
before the reader an array of methods that have already been developed and applied for
predicting impacts. Rather, a suggested approach to performing a comprehensive
impact assessment for human health is offered and some general principles of climate
impacts on health are explained. Next, methods that are being used to gain insight into
relations between climate and human health are described. These methods should not be
considered capable of providing predictions of human health under conditions of climate
change. This chapter is intended to assist the handbook user in two different tasks: first,
to provide a short-term answer to what the health impacts of climate change might be
for a particular country or region, and second, to begin laying the foundation for greater
understanding of climate-health interactions through acquisition of relevant data and
development of research capability.
At the outset, two points must be emphasised. Because of the uncertainty regarding
predictions of human health, resources should be devoted to understanding current
serious human health problems and how they may be affected by climate change.
Similarly, adaptation measures should be relevant to the current situation, and not be
based solely on predictions of future events. Second, the past two decades have de-
monstrated the suddenness with which health problems may emerge. Diseases such as
Human Health
10-3
AIDS, the Central and South American cholera outbreak, and the hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome could not have been predicted prior to their emergence. While it is essential to
ensure that public health measures for climate change have relevance for current
problems, it is equally essential that countries enhance their ability to detect and react to
unforeseen health problems. Public health and biological surveillance and monitoring
will be a critical element of any national plan for human health impacts of climate
change (see Levins et al., 1994).
Recent articles and monographs have described the range of human health problems
that may be affected by climate change (McMichael et al, 1996a; McMichael et al.,
1996b; Patz et al., 1996) and these effects are summarised in Table 10.1. Some coun-
tries have also undertaken national reviews of potential health impacts (e.g., Longstreth,
1989; NHMRC, 1991; CCIRG, 1996). One of the major impacts of climate change on
health may be changes in the transmission of vector-borne diseases. A comparison of
the public health impact and likely climate sensitivity of the major vector-borne diseases
appears in Table 10.2.

distribution or seasonality because of climate change. Country teams should rely on
their internal expertise, and consider Tables 10.1 and 10.2 to be guidelines in assessing
the possible health impacts of climate change.

10.2  Selection of health impacts
The WHO definition emphasises that assessing health impacts requires more than
merely predicting future incidence of specific diseases. Deleterious effects of altered
climate on the foundations of public health (i.e., nourishing food, safe and adequate
drinking water, and secure shelter) need to be considered in addition to changes in
specific diseases. This will require input from other sectors performing parallel impact
analyses, such as agriculture (Chapter 8), coastal zones (Chapter 7), and water
resources (Chapter 6). Changes in these fundamental public health factors may dras-
tically alter a population's susceptibility to a number of diseases, both climate sensitive
and climate insensitive. While such comprehensiveness of analysis makes the process
more difficult, it is essential to integrate these fundamental health factors into the
overall assessment to be able to formulate relevant responses.
The following is a possible sequence of initial steps in a comprehensive health impact
assessment.
1. Review major national or regional causes of morbidity and mortality, especially
infectious diseases. For infectious diseases, any geographic boundaries (such as
those between areas of endemic and epidemic transmission, or between areas of
epidemic transmission and no known disease) should be noted. National experts in
public health should be consulted for opinions on reasons for such boundaries (i.e.,
Human Health

is disease transmission limited by climate factors such as temperature or
precipitation?).
2. Identify populations at risk. This would include refugee and migrant populations,
populations with marginal nutritional reserves or safe water supplies, populations
with poor sanitation infrastructure, populations in low-lying coastal areas, and non-
immune populations bordering zones of infectious diseases.
3. Review results of other sectoral climate change impact assessments. Specifically,
results from water resources, agriculture, forestry, coastal zones, and economic
assessments should be assessed for impacts on:
a.
supplies of food and water;
b.
habitability of low-lying areas; and
c.
economic future of currently vulnerable or impoverished regions and
populations.
4. Integrate the information gathered thus far. From this information, the existence of
critical areas can be proposed. Similarly, the potential for populations fleeing
uninhabitable or economically non-viable areas, with attendant health problems,
can be assessed. Conversely, positive impacts on health (such as might be seen
because of a decrease in seasonal rainfall in an area in which malaria is dependent
on such rainfall) may also be assessed at this point.
10.2.1 Selection of health impacts, populations, and regions
Once the initial assessment is completed, the need for further study should be addressed.
The direction of further study will be determined by the types of health problems
identified in the initial assessment and the current status of understanding and data
collection for a specific disease system and a specific area. For example, further study
of health problems related to heat mortality and morbidity, if this is identified as an area
of concern, may involve the application of existing models to region-specific data in a
relatively straightforward way. Further study to quantify impacts on malaria or dengue
fever, however, should be directed by the level of analysis already performed on those
diseases in a specific area. For example, the ability to apply quantitative models to
malaria in Africa has been limited by the lack of geographically referenced
(georeferenced) data on disease incidence or even vector density (see Box 10.1). Before
accurate quantitative estimates of the future can be made, accurate quantitation of
historical and current disease dynamics is essential. Therefore, collection of such data
may be the most useful form of further study for those regions. Where baseline data and
validated models of the current situation exist, further study may involve extrapolation
of the existing models or application of integrated models. Because of the time, money,
and expertise required for such studies, decision makers should consider alternatives
carefully before embarking on a specific direction for further study.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
10-6
Box 10.1 Example: Building a georeferenced data base for Africa: The
MARA/ARMA Collaborative
One of the greatest weaknesses with the current status of climate change research is that the
building blocks are not in place for it to move beyond the scenario stage. The lack of
adequate, spatially georeferenced, disease data sets means that existing models attempting to
define current distribution remain invalidated. Following on from this is the conclusion that
climate change impacts in the future will not be assessed because no baseline of existing
conditions against which to quantify impacts is available. Similarly, the resolution and
temporal detail of spatial climate data sets suitable for accurately defining existing conditions
remain a limitation.
To overcome the limitations of adequate surveillance systems for malaria in Africa, the
Mapping Malaria Risk in Africa/Atlas du Risque de la Malaria en Afrique (MARA/ARMA)
collaboration has used the parasite ratio (percent infected) in surveys of children as a marker
of intensity of transmission. The entire initiative has to date been operating on only 50 percent
of the originally proposed budget. Only $235 000 has been secured (International
Development and Research Centre, Canada; South African Medical Research Council; and
Wellcome Trust). Thus activities have restricted country visits by regional data co-ordinators.
Visit are essential as initial activities indicate that up to 71 percent of data is unpublished (Le
Sueur, 1997; Omumbo et al., in press,).
To establish MARA/ARMA, the continent was sub-divided to establish five regional centres. A
number of steps were taken to ensure uniformity of activities of the geographically dispersed
centres:
A standardised 11 page pro forma and a set of operating procedures were compiled to guide
the data co-ordinators.
Different regional centres were using different database applications (Dbase, MSAccess,
Foxpro); thus, to ensure standardisation, a stand-alone application conforming to the pro
forma was created with MSAccess/Visual Basic. A users guide was also developed.
Central to MARA/ARMA is the ability to geo-reference collected data within a completed pro
forma. To facilitate this, two steps had to be carried out:
The data co-ordinators were brought to Durban and trained in the use of a vector GIS package
(Mapinfo). This was done using a customised manual compiled by the co-ordinating centre in
Durban, which uses local malaria data sets for the training exercises.
Continental digital data sets which were capable of supporting the geo-referencing procedures
within Mapinfo were acquired. These then were converted into Mapinfo format for use by the
data co-ordinators. These include data sets such as the African Data Sampler, which includes
administrative boundaries, populated centres, rivers, roads, etc., and GeoName, an electronic
gazetteer of place names.
A copy of all completed pro formas and a digital copy were then forwarded to the co-ordinating
centre in Durban.
To date, over 2000 independent parasite surveys in children aged 1-9 have been collated. In
addition, incidence data and other associated data (drug resistance, vector distribution,
agricultural practice, etc.) have been collected. These data as well as data defining historical
distribution are being used to define the boundaries of malaria transmission within Africa.
Current models are based upon long-term mean interpolations (Hutchinson, 1995) and use the
raster GIS package IDRISI. However, recently, new annual surfaces have been commissioned
by MARA/ARMA which allow the periphery of distribution to be more accurately defined in
terms of spatio-temporal (inter-annual) variation (New and Hulme, 1997). Inherent in the
above is the fact that the numerical-eco-physiological models defining the limits of distribution
are validated. The figure illustrates the validation of such a model derived from climatic data
(Craig et al, in preparation) and in terms of existing country level maps of distribution.
Human Health
10-7
Thus the MARA/ARMA collaboration has demonstrated that despite geographic dispersion, a
methodology for creating a database can be successfully instituted; in the future, this will allow
the issue of the impact of climate change on malaria in Africa to be moved beyond the
scenario level. The MARA/ARMA collaboration with its existing skills and methodology also
has the potential to serve as a vehicle for collecting data important to other African diseases.
Box 10.1, Figure 1 Comparison of climate based numeric distribution model and
existing country specific malaria maps.
Further study of other health problems such as water-borne diseases or diseases related
to environmental refugeeism may be limited by complexity or lack of current
understanding. Additional analysis may be limited to comparison with historical and
geographical analogues. In general, it is suggested that the decision to perform further
analysis be guided by an estimation of the overall public health impact of the problem
to be studied as well as the usefulness of the additional information obtained by quan-
titative study over and above the initial qualitative assessment.
The selection of populations and areas to be studied further will be driven by two
factors: the vulnerability of that population or area to climate change and the avail-
ability of relevant data. Ideally, data will be available for the population or area deter-
mined in the initial assessment to be most at risk from specific impacts of climate
change. If not, a decision must be made of whether to invest resources in developing
data for the most vulnerable population or area or in conducting the analysis on a
population or other health problem that may not be the most critical.
An example of a critical geographic area would be the land at the edge of an endemic
zone for vector-borne diseases. In this area, small changes in temperature or rainfall
may promote disease transmission to the extent that the disease becomes endemic. For
example, in East Africa, there are regions where malaria is endemic in the lowlands.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
10-8
The highlands surrounding these endemic zones experience unstable epidemic malaria
when small local environmental or climate changes allow disease transmission within
vulnerable, non-immune populations. These highlands are thus critical areas, where
further studies (as well as surveillance and monitoring efforts) will need to be focused.
10.2.2 Selection of time scales
It is unlikely that one time frame will be appropriate for the entire health impact as-
sessment. Rather, a variety of time frames may be more useful. Because of the in-
creasing uncertainty inherent in long time frames (i.e., 2050 scenarios), short-term,
incremental analyses (i.e., 5 year steps) may be of more use to policy makers.
For many human disease systems, a threshold exists, such that once a given mean or
minimum temperature is reached, a significant change in disease transmission occurs.
Thresholds may exist for precipitation levels as well. The time it takes to reach a
threshold will depend on a number of factors, including the inertia of the climate system
and the response times of different levels of ecosystems. In some cases, it may be more
appropriate to determine the threshold for changes in disease transmission, and then
determine a range of time frames for that threshold to be reached.
Health impacts may occur rapidly with small climate changes if the relevant climate
factor is the only limitation on the range of disease transmission. For example, the
transmission of dengue at higher altitudes with increases in temperature is an effect seen
within months of extreme climate variability (Herrera-Basto et al., 1992). Alternatively,
changes in the incidence of diseases related to sea water temperature (toxic algal
blooms, shellfish poisoning) may lag changes in air temperatures by years because of
slower warming of the oceans.
The time scale of data collected for the analysis of regional sensitivity of diseases to
climate change will also vary depending on the data available and the health impact
studied. For example, assessment of heat mortality requires daily data. The study of
infectious diseases, however, will usually require weekly or monthly incidence and
climate data.
10.3  Methods
This section describes the variety of methods by which climate-health interactions have
been studied. For certain health problems such as weather-related mortality (whether
due to heat or extreme weather events), these methods may be useful to estimate
impacts of future climate changes. For other health problems, especially the vector-
borne diseases, these methods may be more useful to understand relations between
climate and health in a specific region in the present day. An attempt is made to discuss
the general advantages and disadvantages of the different methods in this section, and a
summary appears in Table 10.3. Section 10.5 discusses the details of these various
methods in the context of specific health problems.

10.3.1 Conceptual model
For the major current health problems, especially infectious diseases, a conceptual
model should be developed that describes the interactions among the various factors
contributing to the severity of the problem. Such a model assists in three processes: 1)
the initial qualitative assessment of climate impacts on health, 2) the quantitative
analysis of regional relations between climate factors and disease, and 3) the identi-
fication of possible intermediate endpoints (for example, changes in critical host species
for vector-borne diseases) that can be used for monitoring and surveillance. One
possible paradigm for approaching the development of such conceptual models has been
described by the USEPA in a 1992 report entitled "Framework for Ecological Risk
Assessment" (Risk Assessment Forum, 1992). This framework emphasises the
importance of integrating input from multiple scientific disciplines, including health
professionals, biologists, entomologists, and agriculture and forestry experts, in the
development of conceptual models of disease systems.
The process of ecologically-based risk assessment is divided into three phases: problem
formulation, analysis, and impact characterisation. The initial phase requires a
multidisciplinary team to identify critical interactions among climate factors and
ecosystem mediators of the disease system as well as specific human health endpoints.
Following the identification of these critical interactions, intermediate ecosystem
indicators which will aid in both the monitoring of ecosystems for climate change
effects and further quantitative analysis can be selected. For example, dengue fever
outbreaks are thought to be dependent on high temperatures and moisture availability
(influencing mosquito and viral life cycles), human behaviour (regarding water storage
practices), human migration, demographics and urbanisation patterns, and human
habitation (i.e., screened windows). Thus, analysis of climate impacts on dengue will
need to include not only mosquito survival and viral replication rates, but also forecasts
of human settlements and water provision systems. Key indicators to be monitored
could include mosquito larval populations in selected water storage utensils.
Along with the development of conceptual disease system models, the initial phase
involves characterising the essential elements of the system stressors. For climate
stressors, care must be given to account for the complexity of climate-ecosystem
interactions. Rate of change, frequency of events, and climate variability may be more
detrimental to ecosystems than magnitude of change (Mearns, 1993). This introduces a
level of complexity to the analysis which is beyond the capacity of current GCM
models, which agree on average temperature projections but differ greatly on estimates
of regional precipitation and extreme weather events. For now, addressing issues of
variability will require simplifying assumptions and use of fixed estimates of certain
parameters.
Intermediate ecosystem changes due to climatic stress may also be conceived of as
stressors in a human disease system, since many of the human health impacts from
climate change are anticipated to be ecologically mediated. Thus, changes in insect
vector habitats or marine vegetation may be considered both an outcome of climate
change and an intermediate stressor for human disease.
Human Health
10-11
The analysis phase applies the conceptual model developed in the problem formulation
phase to the particular area and time frame being analysed. The first stage, ecosystem
characterisation, builds on the ecosystem description of the first phase, and involves
choosing specific geographic borders and time scales. Because elements within an
ecosystem can be both responders and stressors, it is essential in ecosystem
characterisation to identify potential areas where this bi-directional dynamic interaction
may occur. For example, land use changes may affect micro-climates, which in turn
may alter the effects of climate change on mosquitoes, or irrigation of agricultural land
may alter a drought's impact on crops (while simultaneously providing potential
breeding sites for insect or snail vectors). Exposure analysis then superimposes the
spatial and temporal distribution of stressors developed in the first phase on relevant
ecological components identified in the ecosystem characterisation to determine points
of contact between stressors and responding species (or abiotic elements such as water
levels) within an ecosystem.
The responsiveness of ecosystem indicators to climate stressors is assessed in the
stressor-response analysis. For each of the endpoints identified in the first phase, the
magnitude and nature of the response to the aggregate stresses are estimated. By the end
of this stage in the analysis, those human health endpoints that are likely to be affected
by climate change should be apparent, and the final stage of risk characterisation will
begin actual impact assessment. Understanding of climate-related sensitivity and the
existence of threshold values for each given endpoint are critical in this central step.
The term sensitivity as used here refers to the amount a given endpoint is affected by a
given amount of change in a climate variable. This is analogous to the slope of the dose-
response curve in conventional risk assessment. In an ecological risk assessment, the
ultimate "sensitivity" of a human disease to climate change may reside in the life cycle
of an organism in the disease system which displays marked alterations in reproductive
or other types of behaviour in response to changes in climate variables. For example,
cold-blooded insect vectors are quite sensitive to small changes in temperature and
moisture. Diseases whose infectious agents (viral or protozoal) must reproduce within
insect vectors are thus susceptible to subtle climate variations (Dobson and Carper,
1993) .
A concept related to sensitivity is that of threshold. For relatively simple systems, a
threshold refers to a sudden change in the slope of the dose-response curve. For exam-
ple, human sensitivity to temperature extremes varies on a physiologic basis. Heat-
related mortality occurs at different temperatures, depending on the latitude and typical
temperatures for that area. For example, data from Montreal, Canada, show an
exponential increase in heat-related mortality at 29°C, whereas data from Dallas,
Texas, USA, do not show a similar increase until 39°C (Kalkstein and Smoyer, 1993).
Thus, Montreal may be said to have a temperature threshold at 29°C, and Dallas
exhibits a threshold at 39°C.
When considering ecological risk assessment, the threshold may be better conceptua-
lised as a point of non-linear behaviour of an ecosystem endpoint in response to a
combination of stressors. Multiple effects of different aspects of climate make it dif-
ficult to think of thresholds in relation to a single parameter. For example, elevated
temperatures decrease the survival of dengue-carrying mosquitoes. At the same time,
UNEP/IVM Handbook
10-12
other parameters in the dengue disease system include biting rates (related to adult
insect size) and infectivity of mosquitoes (related to maturation time of the virus in the
mosquito), both of which increase with temperature. Thus, at temperatures increasing
within the range of mosquito viability, the effect of a decreasing survival rate may be
more than offset by the combined effects of increased biting rates and infectivity,
resulting in an exponential rise in disease transmission (Focks, 1995). Further increases
in temperature outside of the range of mosquito viability would then be expected to
result in decreased disease activity. Thresholds may occur temporally, as changing
climate within a given geographic area alters the behaviour of an already-present human
disease. They may also manifest geographically, as changing climate conditions allow
migration of human disease into a previously unaffected area.
The final stage, impact characterisation, attempts to translate changes in disease
intensity or distribution into terms useful for decision makers, such as demand for
health care services or loss of productivity. The result may be qualitative or quan-
titative. Essential parts of this final phase are assessments of the uncertainty of the
results and integration of the results for a given disease system with other analyses.
10.3.2 Empirical studies
10.3.2.1 Historical analogues
Analysis of damage produced, societal responses, and attendant health problems from
past events and trends can allow some prediction of impacts of similar severe weather
events and trends in the future. Similarly, analysis of anomalous historical climate
periods can give considerable insight into the relations between climate and infectious
disease. For example, Leovinsohn (1994) found that malaria incidence increased during
an atypically warm and wet period in Rwanda in 1987. Several studies have also
examined the relationship between malaria outbreaks and temperature and precipitation
changes due to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (e.g., Bouma et al., 1994;
Bouma and van der Kaay, 1996). Boxes 10.2 and 10.3 give details on two examples of
empirical studies of historical analogues.
An advantage of the use of historical analogues is the regional specificity that comes
from analysing the area of interest. The difficulty of accounting for the complexity of
confounding factors, as would be required of a free-standing mathematical model, can
be avoided to some degree in the creation of empirical models. A disadvantage of
models based on historical analogues includes their limited ability to be extrapolated to
other regions or to climate changes out of the range of observed data. It should be
emphasised, however, that understanding historical climate-disease relations is a pre-
requisite for being able to develop models that can address changes out of the range of
historical data. Moreover, empirical models which have been developed and validated
based on historical data should have relevance for short-term changes. Box 10.1 des-
cribes the development of a georeferenced historical data base to support future climate
predictions.

Example: Heat-related mortality in US cities (Kalkstein and
Greene, 1997).
Daily mortality associated with heat episodes can be assessed with several different
approaches to characterising climate. For example, in a study by Kalkstein and Smoyer
(1993), six meteorological variables were entered into a stepwise regression procedure to
select those with the most explanatory power. In addition, variables relating to the number of
days of heat and the timing of a given heat wave during the summer season were included to
consider the impact of acclimatisation. Other studies have used standard composite
meteorological indices such as the temperature-humidity index (e.g., Karacostas and
Downing, 1996). The most sophisticated approach, developed by Kalkstein and colleagues, is
the characterisation of air masses for a given locality (Kalkstein, 1991; Kalkstein et al., 1996a).
This “synoptic” approach uses statistical methods to separate air masses into area-specific
categories based on a large number of meteorological parameters, and is believed to provide
a more meaningful tool to assess the health impacts of the specific climatic conditions on a
given day. Daily mortality in 44 US cities with populations greater than 1 million were analysed
in relation to the frequency of particular air masses. Two air masses associated with
particularly high mortality were identified. This method has also been used to develop a
weather watch/warning system in Philadelphia to prevent heat-related deaths (Kalkstein et al.,
1996b).
Box 10.3
Example: Climate and malaria incidence in Rwanda
(Loevinsohn, 1994).
Monthly malaria incidence in catchment centres in Rwanda was modelled with monthly
precipitation and mean, minimum, and maximum monthly temperatures. A least-squares
technique was used to select the best fitting model, and separate models were also developed
for each of three altitude zones. The best-fitting equation for the study area as a whole was:
ln Im = -4.32 + 1.64 Tnm-1 + 0.83Tnm-2 + 5.34 x 10-4Rm-2 + 7.7 x 10-4Rm-3
where Im is the monthly incidence, Tnm the minimum monthly temperature, and Rm the
monthly rainfall. This equation demonstrates the importance of lagging the climate variables,
as the rainfall from three months previous was more highly associated with incidence than
more recent rainfall. This study also demonstrated that at low altitudes, the amount of rainfall
was the most important predictor of disease incidence, whereas at high altitudes, minimum
temperature was the most important independent variable.
10.3.2.2 Spatial analogues
In establishing empirical relations between climate and disease, areas which display
more interannual climate variability are more likely to yield results than areas with less
variability. Areas affected by meso-scale climate systems are particularly useful. One
such meso-scale system, the ENSO, affects rainfall and temperature every 4 to 5 years
in certain areas around the world. The ENSO may be seen as a valuable natural
experiment (Bradley, 1997): variations in excess of 1°C have been associated with
ENSO, providing a temperature signal comparable with decades of anticipated global
warming. These areas (such as western South America or South Asia) where ENSO
strongly affects local climate are therefore promising study locations (Bouma et al.,
1994).
UNEP/IVM Handbook
10-14
Reeves et al. (1994) used a geographical analogue situation to assess the potential
impact of climate change on arbovirus transmission. Field and laboratory studies have
shown that temperature is an important factor in determining the transmission of a viral
agent by its mosquito vector. Reeves took advantage of a 5°C temperature differential
between two nearby valleys to compare seasonal transmission and vector abundance in
the two areas.
10.3.2.2 Techniques and tools for empirical studies
Geographical analysis/mapping
Health problems which have special associations to local geography, such as those
associated with coastal flooding and especially vector-borne disease, can be effectively
analysed through mapping techniques. In simplest form, these techniques start by
plotting the current boundaries of a health problem (e.g., flood areas, intensities of
disease transmission or incidence). The factors responsible for the geographic bound-
aries (e.g., altitude in the case of flooding, or temperature or rainfall in the case of
vector-borne diseases) are similarly plotted. Projected changes in those factors, either
from fixed projections or predictive models (e.g., GCMs), are then plotted, and the
changes in the boundary of the health problem are noted with respect to population
centres. An example of such an approach to malaria in Sri Lanka is shown in Box 10.4.
Geographic information systems
Box 10.1 describes the use of GIS for both current and future analysis of malaria in
Africa. A discussion of GIS is given in Chapter 1, Getting Started. Other GIS-based
studies include changes in vector distributions mapped by Rogers and colleagues in
southern Africa (Hulme, 1996). The use of GIS systems as data platforms to assist in
predicting disease incidence is still under development, but especially in combination
with satellite remote sensing (see below), there appears to be promise in using eco-
system parameters such as vegetation types to help predict locations of disease out-
breaks or changes in disease vector distribution (Washino and Wood, 1994).
Use of remotely-sensed images
For many parts of the world, it is very difficult to acquire high quality, geographically
referenced data on ecological factors related to disease transmission (such as types of
vegetation or temperature and composition of surface waters). Political or geographic
obstacles may impede the collection of such data through traditional field methods.
Technological advances have enabled the use of remote sensing devices to assist in
providing these data. Using low-flying aircraft or satellites, these devices are able to
measure either directly or indirectly water and air temperatures, vegetative cover, and
even water flows. Those entities measured indirectly often require significant initial
field work to establish the relations between factors which can be measured directly,
such as light absorption, and the desired entity, such as vegetative cover.
Human Health

Box 10.4 Example: Malaria transmission in Sri Lanka.
Dhanapala (1998) used mapping used to study potential malaria transmission in Sri Lanka.
Zones of perennial and seasonal malaria transmission and malaria-free zones were defined
under present climate conditions. These zones were then correlated with a moisture index
using historical temperature and precipitation data, and the threshold moisture indices which
defined the three zones were determined. Temperature outputs from two global circulation
models were combined with assumptions of either increased or decreased total precipitation
(due to uncertainty) and moisture indices were calculated for each pixel of GCM output. The
IDRISI GIS was used to store and display this geographically-based data. Threshold moisture
indices between current malaria transmission zones were applied to the new map and new
borders of malaria transmission zones were estimated. It was estimated that the area of
malaria-free zone might decrease by 45.6% to 55.1% and the area of the perennial
transmission zone would increase by 45.1% to 65.1%. Further analyses could assess the
implications of the shifts in transmission zones for specific population centres, and begin to
formulate possible adaptive strategies.
Clear limitations to this method include the fact that other geographic and anthropogenic
factors affect malaria transmission, for example, pesticide use. It is not possible to account for
these other factors either in the present situation or in the projections. Nonetheless, this
exercise provides a number of benefits. First, the relation between areas potentially vulnerable
to increases in malaria transmission can be estimated and compared to existing population
centres. Second, areas which may have decreases in malaria transmission can be noted as
well.

An example of the use of remote sensing for vector-borne disease is the study on human
African trypanosomiasis by Rogers and colleagues. Vegetation indices (specifically the
NDVI, normalised vegetation index) obtained from satellite images and tsetse fly
abundance have been correlated for regions in Central and East Africa (Rogers and
Randolph, 1991; Hay et al., 1996). Two important points are evident. First, the ability
to use remote sensing for a given area is dependent on sufficient ground-based study in
that area. The linkage of remotely sensed vegetation indices and vector populations was
made possible by previous studies associating climate factors such as saturation deficit
with vector survival. By associating both vector survival and vegetation indices to the
same climate variables, the remotely sensed data could then be applied to human
disease prediction. The second point is that different local species of vector may have
very different responses to changes in climate. In this study, it was shown that the
population of the species Glossina palpalis increased with increasing vegetation index
(indicative of greater moisture), while the species G. tachinoides decreased in number
with increasing vegetation index. This emphasises the need for regional models
developed along with expert judgement.
10.3.3 Numerical models
Although numerical modelling is often used by epidemiologists – to gain insights into the
observed dynamics of infectious disease epidemics, for example, or to estimate future time
trends in diseases – the complex task of estimating future trends and outcomes in relation to
global climate change and human health may ultimately require the use of integrated,
systems-based numerical models (Rotmans et al., 1990; McMichael and Martens, 1995).
Once empirical studies have clarified current relations between climate factors and human
diseases, numerical models can be used to highlight the effects of a wide variety of scenarios
on those relations. For example, the impacts of changes in demographics, health care
investment, immunisations, and nutrition can be better assessed with numerical models than
with standard empirical models. The information gathered from such analysis can be of great
importance to policy makers.
One example of numerical modelling is MIASMA (Modelling framework for the health
Impact Assessment of Man-induced Atmospheric changes), developed by Maastricht
University (Martens, 1997). MIASMA is an acronym devised to refer to several
models: a vector-borne disease model, a thermal stress model, and a skin cancer model.
This modelling framework is designed to describe the major cause and effect
relationships between atmospheric changes and human population health. The models
are driven by scenarios of population figures and atmospheric changes, superimposed
on baseline data regarding disease incidence, climatic conditions, and ozone-layer
thickness. Global atmospheric changes directly influence the exposure to health risks
via changes in ambient temperature and received UV-B radiation, as well as indirectly,
in influencing the dynamics and distribution of vector-borne diseases. Changes in the
pattern of health risks demarcate the changes in the levels of incidence of the diseases
influenced by the determinants. The mortality rates associated with cardiovascular
diseases are directly influenced by thermal stress, mainly in urban areas.
Human Health
10-17
The modelling approach is orientated toward a vertical integration of global atmos-
pheric disturbances and their respective health effects. The models try to cover as much
as possible of the cause-effect relationship with respect to global atmospheric changes
and human health. In the vector-borne disease model, the dynamics of malaria,
schistosomiasis, and dengue are simulated in relation to climate changes. Relationships
between temperature, precipitation, and vector characteristics are based on a variety of
field and laboratory data. Changes in transmission dynamics of malaria and
schistosomiasis are modelled using the basic infectious disease models described in
Anderson and May (1991); for dengue a well-validated, dynamic life-history model of
dengue transmission (Focks et al., 1993a,b) is used. Recognising the need for continu-
ing cross-validation of large-scale and small-scale studies (Root and Schneider, 1995),
simulations have been performed of the transmission potential of malaria in Zimbabwe
and dengue in five cities (Bangkok, San Juan, Mexico City, Athens, and Philadelphia)
(Focks, 1993 a and b; Jetten and Focks, 1997; Patz et al., 1998). The historical data
available for these locations are used for validation, i.e., testing the performance of the
model.
To represent a wide range of climatic conditions and levels of socio-economic developments,
effects of thermal stress on cardiovascular, respiratory, and total mortality have been
simulated for 20 cities throughout the world. The association between winter and summer
temperatures and mortality rates has been estimated by means of a metanalysis, aggregating
the results of several epidemiological studies on the subject. Projections of future risks are
then simulated by simple extrapolation of this calculated relationship. Effects of
acclimatisation to increasing temperatures, physiological as well as technological, are
simulated.
10.4  Selecting scenarios
Chapters 2 and 3 describe in detail the use and development of socio-economic and
climate change scenarios.
Scenarios specific to health impact studies include demographic and socio-economic
projections. In the study of vector-borne diseases, vector resistance to pesticides and
parasite resistance to drugs are also included in numerical models. In general, baseline
data are obtainable from WHO and World Bank sources (e.g., WHO, 1992; World
Bank, 1993).
10.5 Impact assessment
10.5.1 General considerations
This section is meant to provide more specific information on impact assessment for
particular human health problems. Because the best method of assessing impacts will
differ for different health problems, this section cites examples of analysis and discuss
some of the issues particular to specific health problems.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
10-18
The optimal method of expressing human health impacts is not clear. In addition to the
traditional public health parameters of disease incidence and prevalence, there has been
increasing use of terms that express the economic burden of human diseases. Because
different countries may have different costs associated with addressing the same
incidence or prevalence of disease, and because analysis of human health impacts will
be reported next to analyses of sectors with clearer economic ties, the use of economic
terms may be desirable. Measuring the economic impact of climate-related changes in
human health, however, is clearly a complex task. Unlike other sectors whose products
are inherently economic in nature, such as agriculture and water resources, human
health is historically difficult to quantify and associate with economic value. Changes in
disease incidence for different diseases can be compared by attempting to measure lost
productivity due to the disease. This requires knowing the average age of onset of the
disease, case fatality rates, and the average extent and duration of disability due to the
disease. These data are likely to be very difficult to obtain, and the levels and types of
studies from which the data come need to be examined and found comparable (Aron
and Davis, 1993). Should these data be obtainable, an estimate of healthy years of
economically productive life lost can be made. The further valuation of this measure in
economic terms is quite problematic. Regional differences in wages, employment, and
even gender roles will complicate the comparison of disease impacts.
Uncertainty analysis must accompany the overall integrated assessment. Uncertainty
will be present at all levels of the risk assessment (McMichael and Martens, 1995).
During the conceptual model phase, incorrect assumptions may prove difficult to
resolve. The inevitability of incomplete data must be addressed throughout the analysis,
and errors in measurement and sampling will need to be transparent throughout the
assessment process. Finally, the natural variability, or "stochasticity", within climate
and ecological systems must be adequately represented (Risk Assessment Forum,
1992). Communication regarding uncertainties must take place between scientists and
policy makers early on in the process to ensure that the results of the risk assessment
are accurately represented to constituencies at risk.
10.5.2 Impact assessment of public health infrastructure
damage
Although it is not currently possible to predict the frequency and severity of extreme
weather events for a given region, historical data on the impact of severe storms for a
given region can be used to extrapolate the impact of climate change on public health
infrastructure damage. Until severe weather predictions are available, a range of pos-
sible conditions based on expert judgement can be used, and infrastructure damage
extrapolated from past experience. Local experts will also need to consider the range
and extent of possible adaptive responses. An additional important element for assess-
ing the impact of climate change on infrastructure damage will be the quality of socio-
economic and demographic predictions of vulnerable populations.
Projections of future water supply are available for many countries (e.g., World Bank,
1992). These projections in general do not account for alterations in demand due to
climate change, and can therefore serve as the baseline for impact assessments. Esti-
Human Health
10-19
mates of alterations in water supply and demand should be either obtained from or co-
ordinated with results from the water resources sector assessment (Chapter 6).
Impaired agricultural food production and distribution could have substantial adverse
health effects, through mortality from starvation and through increased susceptibility to
infectious diseases from malnutrition. One study examining this issue on an inter-
national scale estimated 40 to 300 million additional people at risk from hunger because
of climate-related decreases in food production (Parry and Rosenzweig, 1993). This
study accounted for projected improvements in world-wide food distribution as a result
of decreased trade barriers as well as potential beneficial effects of increased carbon
dioxide on food crops. Smaller scale impact assessments should account for these
effects as well.
10.5.3 Impact assessment of vector-borne diseases
The assessment of the impacts of climate change on vector-borne diseases can be
performed with a variety of methods, including mapping and integrated modelling.
Some vector-borne diseases have been well-characterised in terms of the effects of
temperature and precipitation on the life cycles of the vector and disease agent based on
laboratory studies. Data from field studies are less common. Establishing current
geographic boundaries on the basis of current climate conditions, applying climate
projections, and estimating changes in geographic boundaries and transmission rates are
the essential steps in the assessment.
The eradication campaigns of malaria in the mid-1950s resulted in dramatic changes in
the ecology of many vector-borne diseases. Variations in the quantity and type of
insecticide used and the level of resistance in the vectors are difficult to estimate and
incorporate into models. These factors, however, may have a greater local impact on
disease transmission than climate factors. Therefore, historical disease data from before
the mid-1950s, where available, may allow the study of climate-disease relations with
fewer potentially confounding variables (Bouma and Van der Kaay, 1996).
Sometimes data are limited to the distribution of the vector rather than human case
data, and often this means merely presence or absence of the vector. More rarely,
historical information about vector density is available. However, this would have to be
specifically collected and therefore is less likely to available, or less likely to be freely
accessible. Since presence of the vector is not sufficient for disease activity, the
additional factors either facilitating or preventing disease transmission will have to be
analysed. Factors important for the transmission of many vector-borne diseases include
geographic and climatic features such as altitude. If possible, other relevant information
such as pesticide use, surface water distribution, and vegetative cover should be
included in the analysis as these are related to vector habitats.
Integrated models offer the additional feature of exploring the effects of changes in
other diseases and socio-economic parameters on a given vector-borne disease. Exam-
ples of the use of integrated models for malaria on a global scale can be found in
Martens et al. (1995, 1997) and Martens (1995) and for dengue in Focks et al.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
10-20
(1993a,b). To date, there have been no published quantitative assessments of vector-
borne diseases on a local or regional basis using integrated models.
10.5.4 Impact assessment of heat mortality and pollution-
related respiratory disease
Current studies of heat mortality indicate that acclimatisation plays a critical role in
determining the level and extent of sensitivity to temperature. It is not clear how long
populations would take to acclimatise to an increased frequency and severity of extreme
heat events, if at all (McMichael et al., 1996b). In addition, GCMs cannot predict the
frequency of extreme events with accuracy, so quantitative assessment must rely on the
superposition of assumed variability parameters on average temperature projections.
In extrapolating historical data to future predictions, attention should be paid to the
characterisation of climate as well as the case definition of heat-related illness and
mortality. Synoptic analysis (Kalkstein, 1991; Kalkstein et al., 1996), which charac-
terises air masses on the basis of multiple parameters such as maximum temperature,
humidity, and wind speed, is one method for organising climate model outputs. The
frequency and severity of certain offensive air masses, specifically those appearing
early in the summer season, can then be used to extrapolate future mortality from heat
waves.
Usually urban populations are studied for heat-related mortality and morbidity, largely
because a dense population is required to be able to observe a significant number of
heat-related deaths (e.g., Kalkstein and Greene, 1997). Urban areas also tend to absorb
and retain heat more than rural areas. Studies show that within the urban population (as
with most health problems), the most vulnerable are the elderly, the very young, and the
poorly housed.
There are no published estimations of health impacts of air pollution in the setting of
climate change; studies are under way to attempt to model the interactions between
climate and air pollution. Because increased air temperatures will accelerate the for-
mation of tropospheric ozone from increased reactions between ultraviolet radiation and
primary pollutants (i.e., NOx), potential worsening of urban air pollution in association
with climate change should be considered. Current impact assessment will need to be
qualitative until these interactions are better understood.
10.5.5 Impact assessment for water-related diseases
Climate change may affect water-borne diseases via several mechanisms. One mecha-
nism will be alterations in precipitation leading to flooding and biological contamination
of water supplies, or leading to possibly drought and a shortage of safe drinking water.
Linking climate prediction models with water budget or runoff models can provide an
assessment of potential changes in precipitation effects from climate change. Both
bacterial water-borne illnesses such as cholera and parasitic diseases such as
cryptosporidiosis may be approached in these ways.
Human Health
10-21
The relation between algal blooms in nutrient-rich warming coastal water and cholera
outbreaks is still under investigation. There is growing evidence that in areas of endemic
cholera, coastal waters provide an aquatic reservoir for Vibrio cholerae bacteria (Islam
et al., 1993). What is not understood is exactly how the bacteria reproduce in the
environment, and what factors cause the return to an infectious state. Thus, the
presence of Vibrio bacteria in nutrient-rich coastal waters and sporadic cholera out-
breaks may indicate a sensitivity to climate change, but the quantitative prediction of
impacts would be very difficult. Some quantitative estimates of algal blooms and den-
sities may be available to assist with projections, but the linkage between that data and
actual cholera incidence remains to be determined. One study has shown a link between
sea surface temperatures and cholera cases in Bangladesh (Colwell, 1996).
10.6 Autonomous adaptation
Given the complexity of most human disease systems, attempts to account for autono-
mous adaptation within the impact analysis will be prohibitively difficult in many cases.
For problems related to direct physiological stress, such as heat-related mortality,
physiological acclimatisation may already be accounted for in the use of historical
human data to project future mortality, although this is not clear from all studies. Non-
physiological adaptations, e.g., building design, behaviour, and use of air conditioning,
need to be addressed.
For infectious diseases, the development of immunity can be considered an inbuilt
autonomous adaptation. Malaria is an important example because the loss of immunity
in a population (i.e., when a population shifts from stable to unstable malaria) can lead
to significantly higher morbidity and mortality rates (e.g., Martin and Lefebvre, 1995).
Repeated infection with dengue, however, may lead to the serious complication of
dengue haemorrhagic fever rather than immunity if the infections are with different
serotypes of the dengue virus.
In the methods discussed above, autonomous adaptation is not considered because of
the lack of data. However, changes in population immunity have been considered in
malaria integrated models (Martens, 1997). For simpler assessment exercises, however,
the range of uncertainty of future estimates will most likely be far greater than the
potential impact of immunity or other autonomous adaptation within the population.
Many autonomous adaptations are behavioural, such as wearing protective clothing,
reducing exertion levels, or obtaining drinking water from different sources. Because of
the difficulty of predicting human behaviour, it may be reasonable to use a set of
scenarios with different levels of behavioural changes in the impact assessment stage,
and thereby investigate the possible impact of such autonomous adaptations.
For certain problems, what might be considered autonomous adaptations may have
considerable public health or societal consequences of their own. For example, migra-
tion in response to local changes in climatic and environmental conditions could be
considered an autonomous adaptation, but will by itself cause considerable societal
strain and possibly lead to outbreaks of disease due to crowding, malnutrition, etc.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
10-22
Similarly, widespread use of pesticides to combat new vector-borne disease outbreaks
may contribute to both pesticide-related toxicity and further ecosystem disruption. If
such adaptations are considered in an impact assessment, both the positive and negative
implications need to be included.
10.7  Planned adaptation
10.7.1 General considerations
Just as the differing conditions among countries necessitate different approaches to
health sensitivity and impact assessments, so too will the approaches to adaptation
differ by region. For many developing countries, the health problems that are likely to
be exacerbated by climate change are significant current problems. Thus, adaptive
strategies developed in anticipation of future climate conditions may have substantial
utility for the present situation. Many of the adaptations discussed here are not specific
to climate change and, in fact, should not be viewed in isolation from the more
generalised problem of global environmental degradation and compromised public
health infrastructure in much of the developing and developed world.
10.7.1.1 Levels of prevention and hierarchy of controls
While cost and feasibility are clearly important considerations in evaluating adaptation
options, two sets of concepts borrowed from preventive medicine and occupational
health can also be applied to prioritise different adaptation options (Patz, 1995). The
first set of concepts involves levels of prevention. Primary prevention consists of those
measures that reduce or prevent the risk of developing a disease. This may involve
protection from an infectious or harmful agent (e.g., immunisation or use of bed nets) or
the removal of the harmful agent or exposure from the environment (e.g., eradication of
disease vectors or replacement of a dangerous chemical in an industrial process).
Secondary prevention involves the detection and treatment of a disease at a stage early
enough to prevent serious clinical illness. Examples would be screening for malnutrition
or asymptomatic parasitic infections. Tertiary prevention involves limiting long-term
health deterioration from disease. Examples would include treatment of infectious
diseases and rehydration therapy for diarrhoea. Primary prevention measures are often
more cost-effective than higher level interventions, and clearly reduce the burden of
human disease and suffering. There may, however, be instances where primary
prevention measures are either unfeasible or have unacceptable financial or ecological
costs (e.g., pesticide use in large areas), and secondary prevention measures will need to
be considered. It should be noted that greenhouse gas mitigation represents an even
earlier level of prevention. Mitigating the process of global warming might be viewed,
therefore, as "pre-primary" public health prevention. Clearly, the discussion in this
chapter addresses the results of the failure to adequately mitigate the ecosystem and
human health effects of greenhouse gas emissions, and does not in any way intend to
distract attention from the need to address the root cause of the problem.
Human Health
10-23
The second set of concepts, called the hierarchy of controls, is derived from occupa-
tional health. Among primary prevention options, some may involve individual mo-
tivation and behaviour to a greater extent than others. For example, asking people to
wear long sleeves and apply insect repellent requires significant individual co-operation,
unlike using measures to decrease the insect vector population. In general, measures
that require less individual behavioural change will be more efficacious than those that
require significant individual co-operation. Because individual responses to health
threats are highly variable and misperceptions of relative health risks are common in the
public, only selected groups within a population are likely to take appropriate
preventive steps. Among measures that do not involve personal behaviour, those that
reduce or eliminate the potential for exposure to harmful situations are preferable to
measures that merely reduce the duration or intensity of exposure.
Thus, in the hierarchy of controls, the first level of attention is given to measures that
eliminate the harmful exposure, either by eliminating the agent (e.g., killing of insect
vectors or substitution of less harmful chemicals) or by constructing a mechanism to
protect the individual from exposure (e.g., engineering controls such as enclosure of
industrial exposures or construction of architecturally heat-resistant housing). The
second level of attention is given to administrative controls which reduce the amount of
exposure, such as limiting work hours for outdoor workers in a situation of potential
heat stress. It should be noted that in applying these industrial concepts to country-wide
adaptation strategies, measures that correspond to engineering controls, such as housing
or infrastructure construction, may require administrative action such as local or
national legislation. The third level of attention is given to the individual use of
protective measures, such as respirators for harmful air-borne chemicals or insect
repellent for vector-borne diseases. Again, first level adaptation options may not always
be available or feasible. These concepts can be used, however, along with consi-
derations of cost, to help prioritise among a list of available options.
10.7.1.2 Expecting the unexpected
As stated above, it is likely that there will be unforeseen consequences of climate
change for human health. It is essential that adaptation policies reflect this uncertainty
and do not focus only on the specific anticipated changes in existing human diseases.
Thus, in addition to disease-specific measures, improving surveillance and monitoring
systems will be highly valuable. Furthermore, since our understanding of the linkages
between climate and health is poorly developed, the commitment to fund and facilitate
ongoing research is an essential part of adaptation.
10.7.1.3 Surveillance and monitoring
Ongoing monitoring, both of human diseases and of critical ecosystem indicators, will
be essential to the timely institution of interventions as disease systems change. To the
extent possible, the early indicators that have been identified during the development of
conceptual models should be used rather than the incidence of actual diseases. Because
of the inertia of large ecosystems, and the fact that changes in human diseases due to
UNEP/IVM Handbook
10-24
climate factors generally represent the end result of ecosystem changes, substantial
ecosystem changes will have occurred by the time an increase in disease incidence is
detected, and intervention will be far more difficult. Where feasible, monitoring efforts
should be integrated with existing surveillance systems established for certain infectious
disease categories.
Long-term field data gathering and surveillance of vector-borne disease are essential.
Such data not only allow the study of seasonal and inter-annual variations in disease
associated with climate variability but also provide information of early climate-related
changes in incidence (Haines et al., 1994). Unfortunately, institutional changes and the
apparent success of vector control methods (before widespread resistance emerged) led
to a decline in the long-term prospective observations necessary to understand the
mechanisms by which environmental impacts influence infectious disease risk. For
example, local surveillance of vector species has been employed in the United States to
try to predict outbreaks of St. Louis encephalitis and eastern equine encephalitis
(MMWR, 1990). Domestic chickens and wild sparrows have been tried as sentinel
indicators of increased viral transmission, but the focal nature of arboviral outbreaks
and the inability to survey a broad enough area have limited the usefulness of this
application for certain arboviral diseases (Monath and Tsai, 1987).
A strategy for global monitoring of health effects of climate change has been proposed
involving remote sensing and extensive telecommunications networks of environmental
and health professionals (Haines et al., 1994). Such an effort is strongly needed on a
global scale, but smaller efforts on a regional scale, targeted at the critical geographic
areas identified in the sensitivity analysis, will be important for regional adaptation
strategies as well. An example of large-scale physical and ecological monitoring is the
new United Nations interagency Global Observing System. This consists of the Global
Climate Observing System (GCOS), the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS),
and the Global Oceans Observing System (GOOS) (Patz, 1995). While such an effort is
beyond the capacity of a single country, participation in such international efforts will
have benefits not only on a global scale but also on a regional scale.
10.7.1.4 Infrastructure development
Water treatment facilities and shelter, already in short supply in many areas, may be
further threatened by severe storms and sea level rise. For these threatened areas, in-
vestment in expanded facilities may have substantial current benefit, and attention paid
to safe location of the facilities with respect to sea level rise and extreme weather events
will be of use in adapting to future conditions. Consideration should also be given to
improving the efficiency of existing water systems as well as reducing demand for water
where possible. The involvement of local communities in planning and developing water
systems is essential (World Bank, 1992). This is another area in which present-day
investment will have public health benefits with or without impacts of climate change.

10.7.1.5 Public education
Human behaviour has a considerable influence on disease incidence. Some behaviours
such as the storage of open water containers or the improper disposal of human wastes
create favourable environmental conditions for disease-causing agents to reproduce.
Other behaviours such as the type of clothing worn and the filtering of drinking water
affect exposure to disease-causing agents. Public education efforts will be needed, both
to inform about the causes of disease and human impacts on disease and to instruct on
ways to minimise the health impacts of climate change. The need may be greatest in the
critical areas where experience with disease is limited but the risk of the spread of
disease is high.
Educating diverse groups of people in a way that does not conflict or negate present
belief systems can be quite difficult. Experience with public education efforts in Tan-
zania on malaria has shown that educational methods need to be adapted to the local
ethnic belief systems. Without the education and involvement of local communities,
regional adaptation efforts will not succeed (C. Schiff, Johns Hopkins School of
Hygiene and Public Health, personal communication, 1996). Conversely, when public
education is presented in a culturally appropriate and creative manner, the effort can be
far more successful. An example of such an effort resulting in widespread behavioural
change is the “slip, slap, slop” campaign in Australia to convince the population of the
need to use clothing, hats, and sunscreen lotion to protect against ultraviolet radiation.
10.7.1.6 Technological or engineering strategies
In certain cases, technological controls such as genetic or biological pest management
systems may be useful. For certain diseases such as dengue and malaria, modification
of the environment by engineering methods may reduce breeding sites and therefore
reduce vector populations. In all cases, consideration must be given to potential nega-
tive consequences of the use of technological adaptation methods. For example, in-
creased use of air conditioning to combat heat stress may have unacceptable costs in
terms of increased energy use, and draining of wetlands may reduce fish production.
10.7.1.7 Medical interventions
Where possible, primary preventive medical interventions such as vaccinations should
be used. Unfortunately, at present, the only disease anticipated to be sensitive to climate
change for which a vaccine is available is yellow fever. It has not been possible to
develop a vaccine for dengue. Work is continuing on the development of a malaria
vaccine; however, it is recognised that an integrated approach is needed to combat the
disease, involving local initiatives for vector surveillance and control.
Medical interventions for water-borne diseases or respiratory diseases may play a role
as further research determines the potential for increases in those diseases from climate
change.

10.7.2 Specific adaptation strategies
In addition to the general adaptive strategies discussed above, a variety of impact-
specific options are available (Table 10.4). In general, these are measures that have
been employed for present-day problems. The list of options in Table 10.4 is not
intended to be complete, but rather to initiate discussion and evaluation of a variety of
options that will be decided upon by local and regional health experts and policy
makers. Furthermore, it should be emphasised that many of these measures will only be
temporary in their effects; this list should not be viewed as an alternative to addressing
the root causes of global warming through policy initiatives.
10.8  Summary and implications
As an integrator of ecosystem changes, human health is influenced by many of the
factors that will be analysed in other sectors of global climate change impact assess-
ments. Assessments of nutritional health will depend on the outputs of the following
sectors: agriculture, fisheries, water resources, coastal zones, and biodiversity. Projec-
tions of the adequacy of shelter and water supplies will require the outputs of coastal
zones and water resources. Since disruption of ecosystems through deforestation, water
re-distribution, and other land uses can be associated with alterations in human disease
systems, particularly vector-borne diseases, the future projections of these factors
should be provided to those performing human health assessments by the forestry,
agriculture, and water resources sector assessments. It should be noted that impacts on
primary factors in public health, i.e., food, water and shelter, will have secondary
impacts on sensitive disease systems for both vector- and water-borne diseases.
Impaired or improved human health will affect most other sectors via changes in
productivity and resource allocation. As discussed in the section on impact assessment,
however, the quantification of changes in productivity is very problematic, as is the
prediction of medical and public health resource allocation into the future. Qualitative
changes in diseases (e.g., the appearance or spread of diseases to new areas) may be of
primary importance to trade and tourism.
As has been demonstrated, the health impacts of global climate change are likely to be
multiple for any given region and highly variable between different regions. A country
by country approach is warranted to ensure applicability of any health impact
assessment. While there is likely to be difficulty obtaining the data, resources, and time
necessary for a fully comprehensive quantitative impact assessment, a qualitative initial
approach, as outlined in this chapter, may be of significant benefit to policy makers.
Continuing surveillance and research activities will enable more accurate assessments in
the future.

11.1  Nature and scope of the problem
Climate change could have significant effects on the energy sector in many countries.
Rising temperatures, changes the amount of precipitation, and variation in humidity,
wind patterns, and the number of sunny days per year could affect both consumption
and production of energy. In some countries, these impacts could be profound. The
nature and magnitude of impacts may not be easy to predict, owing to counteracting
effects and uncertainty surrounding both climate change and baseline projections of
energy use.
While substantial work has been conducted to link changes in the global climate to the
use of energy, specifically fossil fuels, less work (particularly related to developing
countries) has been conducted on the reverse effect — that of climate change on the
energy sector. The several studies that have been conducted provide some indication of
the types of impacts that can be expected. For example, in the United Kingdom, which
currently has a cool climate, projected higher temperatures would decrease overall
energy demand, since demand for space heating would decline with global warming.
This effect would outweigh the higher demand for air conditioning and the net increase
in the amount of electricity demanded (United Kingdom Climate Changes Impacts

Review Group, 1991). Yet, according to Linder and Inglis (1989), global warming
could increase annual electricity generation and generation fuel use in the United States
by 4 to 6 percent by 2055.
Because many components of the energy sector are capital intensive and require long-
term planning, there could be significant financial implications stemming from climate-
induced changes to the consumption and production of energy. Estimates of changes in
energy use to climate change are needed to help ensure energy demand is met, and to
allow the development of adaptation policies that may prevent, reduce, or more
equitably share losses brought about by climate change.
One of the most significant impacts of climate change on the energy sector could be any
policies developed to ameliorate climate change, particularly in the next few decades.
The proposed targets for greenhouse gas emissions, and the policies proposed to bring
about those limitations, will profoundly affect the consumption and production of
energy. The topic of climate change policy and its effects on the energy sector is
discussed in detail elsewhere (e.g., IPCC, 1995).
11.1.1 Effects on energy consumption
The most significant impacts of climate change on energy consumption are likely to be
the effects of higher temperatures on the use of electricity and on the direct use of fossil
fuels for heating. Increases in extreme weather might result in some regional changes in
consumption if such weather changes result in population shifts.
11.1.1.1 Effects on electricity consumption
Climate change is likely to affect the following major electric end uses:
• 
air conditioning;
• 
space heating;
• 
water pumping;
• 
refrigeration;
• 
water heating.
Of these end uses, air conditioning and space heating are those most likely to be sig-
nificantly affected by climate change, since both are functions of the indoor-outdoor
temperature difference. A temperature increase would increase air conditioning use and
saturation (the fraction of buildings having air-conditioning equipment). In countries in
low latitudes, which generally already have warmer climates, such an increase could
significantly affect overall energy demand. Linden and Inglis (1989) found that in the
southern United States, electricity demand would increase by 10 to 15 percent. In high
Energy
11-3
latitude areas, which generally have cooler climates, the increase in the demand for air
conditioning would be relatively small. Linden and Inglis found that electricity demand
in the northern United States would change slightly in a positive or negative direction.
Further, electric space heating use would decrease with increased temperatures, but this
impact would probably not be significant in low latitudes. This could be a significant
effect in those high latitude areas where electric space heating is used.
Looking briefly at the other end uses, water pumping requirements can be significant if
the climate becomes warmer but not wetter, because of increased water needs for
irrigation and residential, commercial, and municipal watering. Refrigeration require-
ments would increase and water heating requirements would decrease, although the
direct effects are likely to be significantly less than the effects on space conditioning.
Refrigeration and water-heating equipment is often located in conditioned spaces (i.e.,
spaces that are heated or cooled to a relatively constant level), and thus are not affected
by outdoor temperature changes. Refrigeration equipment evaporator coil temperatures
(which are in contact with the air inside the cooled space) are significantly lower than
those of air conditioning equipment, and water heaters heat to temperatures significantly
hotter than room temperatures. Consequently, the temperature differences that these
types of equipment operate with are greater than those with which space heating
equipment operates. So these uses would be less sensitive to changes in outdoor
temperature even when the equipment is in unconditioned spaces.
The impacts on an electricity system also depend on the mix of resources used for
heating and cooling. For example, if air conditioning is produced using electricity, but
space heating is provided by gas furnaces or boilers, then global warming will increase
the use of electricity, even in a cool climate. Total energy demand, however, could be
reduced even though demand for electricity increases.
The magnitude of the impacts depends on the electricity usage patterns in the absence of
climate change (i.e., baseline demand). Increases in electricity demand caused by
economic development and increased standards of living are likely to occur along with
climate change. For example, air conditioning is more prevalent in developed countries.
As developing countries increase their standard of living, their use of air conditioning
increases, as will their sensitivity to climate change. An accurate determination of the
baseline demand for electricity, or the demand before global warming, is important in
reliably estimating the effects of climate change. Any estimates of baseline demand
should take into account substantial uncertainty over long periods.
11.1.1.2 Direct use of fossil fuels
The use of natural gas, oil, and fuel wood to provide space heat in residences and
buildings will be the type of direct use of fossil fuels most affected by climate change.
Natural gas is used to a limited extent for cooling and this use is likely to increase, but
this use is substantially smaller than the use for heating. If climate change shortens the
cold season and reduces the severity of cold weather events, energy demand for heating
UNEP/IVM Handbook
11-4
will be less. Consequently, the direction of effects of climate change on the direct use of
fossil fuels is easier to identify — this use is likely to decrease.
11.1.2 Effects on energy production
Changes in energy consumption as a result of climate change will lead to changes in
energy production. Climate change itself could also have direct effects on the produc-
tion of energy. These effects may be seen primarily in electric generation, including
hydropower, thermal electric generation, solar and wind power.
11.1.2.1 Hydroelectric generation
The effects of climate change on river flows are uncertain, but any significant changes
would have implications for hydroelectric generation. Climate change could affect the
amount and seasonality of flow in most rivers (see Chapter 6, Water Resources), which
could affect the amount of electricity produced annually by hydroelectric and the timing
of power production.
 Hydroelectric generation may be much more sensitive to changes in river flows than
other types of water systems. This would be the case when the water rights of irrigation
and municipal water systems are senior to those of hydroelectric generation. In a low
water year, water may be drawn off upriver from the turbines to meet these needs.
Consequently the reduction in hydroelectric generation may be substantially greater
than the reduction in river flow. If river flows increase, the increase in electric genera-
tion may be greater than the river flow increase, if upriver senior water rights are rela-
tively fixed. Such an increase in generation would be constrained by reservoir and
turbine capacity. Hydroelectric generation in the Colorado River Basin has been found
to be extremely sensitive to changes in climate (Nash and Gleick, 1993). A 20%
reduction in natural water runoff was projected to cause a reduction in power
generation of 60%, whereas a 20% increase was projected to cause an increase in
generation of 40%. This study was not able to say with certainty whether runoff would
increase or decrease.
 In areas dominated by snow melt, flow and consequently hydroelectric generation could
increase in the winter and decrease in the summer (e.g., see Lettenmaier et al., 1992). In
a region with a summer peak demand for electricity, the net effect could be substantially
increased costs for electricity. This has been projected for Pacific Gas & Electric, a
California utility that owns 3,903 MW of hydroelectric generation (Hanemann and
McCann, 1993). Its variable cost would increase by 12-32 percent, or US$145-370
million.
 In areas where it becomes hotter and drier, hydroelectric power generation could be
reduced virtually year-round. A reduction in hydropower generation would have to be
made up by more thermal electric generation.
Energy
11-5
 An example of the potential effects of climate change in a hot and dry climate is pro-
vided by the recent drought in Ghana (French, 1998). Ghana is heavily reliant on
hydropower for electricity production and has no other indigenous sources of power.
While hydropower is inexpensive, it is also vulnerable to climate variability. A severe
drought in the spring of 1998 resulted in hydropower dams producing less electricity.
Total power production in the country has fallen by 40%, threatening the economy.
Businesses from tuna canneries to clothing manufacturers are reducing output and
shortening the work week. Thus, a heavy reliance on hydropower may be good for
reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality, but can increase vul-
nerability to climate change.
11.1.2.2 Thermal electric generation
Thermal electric generation from fossil fuels and nuclear power could also be affected
by climate change. Higher ambient air temperatures will decrease the efficiency and
capacity ratings of natural gas or oil fired combustion turbines. Increases in ambient
temperatures and humidity will also be detrimental to electricity generation from gas,
oil, or nuclear steam cycles, which rely on cooling towers for the condensing process.
The overall effect of global warming on thermal electric power production is likely to
be small, however. The efficiency of a plant is a function of the ratio of the high and
low temperatures in the power cycle. Since the difference in high and low temperatures
is typically over 500EC, the temperatures changes projected from climate change are
likely to have an impact of significantly less than 1 percent. One US utility estimated
that the maximum impacts of climate change on both efficiency and capacity are
between 0.1 and 0.2 percent (Linder et al., 1987).
Nuclear power plants are designed for operation within certain temperature ranges.
Some plants have been forced to close down on extremely hot days. Climate change
might require modifications to allow such plants to continue to operate in warmer
temperatures.
Plants located along a river or in a coastal zone could be at risk. Increased river flows
could lead to flooding problems, and decreases could require a plant to shut down if
inadequate water is available for cooling purposes. Power plants in coastal zones could
be at risk of inundation from sea level rise. An increase in severe storms such as
cyclones and monsoons could damage plants in coastal zones.
Thermal electric generation may also be affected indirectly by shifts in consumption
patterns. In cool climates, the use of natural gas for heating is likely to be reduced,
making gas less expensive and more available for power generation. This could result in
gas being substituted for coal, which would result in the emission of less carbon
dioxide. Reduced emissions of this greenhouse gas would tend to help prevent climate
change.
In warm climates, increased demand for cooling resulting from climate change may
require significant increases in new generation capacity. Reduced hydroelectric gener-

ation would exacerbate this problem. Additional US investments in new capacity by
2055 have been estimated as between US$170 billion and US$330 billion (Linder and
Inglis, 1989).2 In cooler regions, climate change may defer new capacity needs.
11.1.2.3 Solar and wind power
Climate change may also affect the supply of energy from solar and wind power.
Changes in the number of sunny days per year could affect a region’s ability to use the
sun as a source of energy. Climate change may also lead to changing wind patterns,
which may increase or decrease the availability of wind as a source of energy. It is
unclear whether the effects on solar and wind power will increase or decrease the
potential supply from these sources.
11.1.2.4 Other energy production effects
Electric transmission lines have greater resistance in warmer temperatures, and thus
climate change will result in increased line losses. Resistance of aluminium and copper
wires increases by approximately 0.4 percent with every degree centigrade of tem-
perature increase between 0EC and 100EC. For a country with 8 percent line losses, a
3EC temperature increase will cause line losses to increase to almost 9 percent, causing
an increased need for generation of about 1 percent.
Fuel wood supply may also be susceptible to the impacts of climate change. The supply
of this primary source of energy in large regions in Africa and south-eastern Asia may
change significantly with changes in temperatures. The impacts of climate change on
fuel wood supply are not conclusive; however, if woody plants cannot respond to rapid
temperature changes, many regions may experience a shortage in the supply of energy
(Riebsame, 1989).
Costs for oil and gas exploration, development, and transportation in polar regions may
be affected. A study of the Mackenzie Basin (Cohen, 1997) found both positive and
negative impacts on all aspects of production. Pipelines built on permafrost may require
structural retrofitting if the permafrost melts because of climate change. This cost may
be counterbalanced by reduced operation and maintenance costs. New pipeline costs are
likely to be greater, because they must be designed for a range of conditions. A
reduction in ice levels is likely to reduce costs of marine transportation, although higher
waves and coastal erosion near ports would increase costs. Costs of offshore
exploration may be reduced because of longer seasons and less need to withstand ice
loads, but these effects may be counterbalanced by costs of withstanding higher waves
and costs of the increased difficulty in containing spills.

This study assumed about a 3EC warming and no improvement in technology.
Energy
11-7
Any type of energy production facilities located near or in the ocean, such as power
plants and oil and gas production facilities, could be subject to damage from sea level
rise. Also, virtually all energy production facilities, including electric transmission lines,
thermal power plants, wind and solar generating stations, and oil and gas production
facilities, are subject to damage by extreme weather, which could increase in intensity
and frequency under climate change. If increases in extreme weather result in
population shifts, some existing production facilities may lose utility, causing a
reduction in production or closure, if the demand they were designed to serve is re-
duced. This could result in financial losses to the owners of the plant and increased
costs to remaining customers.
11.1.3 What impacts are important?
The overall impacts on the energy sector in a country are difficult to determine without
analysis: they depend on the mix of types of energy uses and production. In general,
however, the most significant effects are likely to be on use in the residential,
commercial, and institutional sectors, because of the use of space heating and cooling,
and in the electric generation sector because of changes in demand from the residential
and commercial sectors and changes in hydroelectric generation. Because it is highly
capital intensive and has a long planning horizon,3 the generation sector may be most at
risk in terms of financial impacts. Because of the sensitivity of hydroelectric generation
to changes in precipitation, and the uncertainty associated with changes in precipitation,
climate change could have dramatic effects on countries dependent on hydroelectric
generation and subject to significant changes in precipitation. Increases in extreme
weather events could significantly disrupt energy production (including transportation)
in some countries.
If a country is large enough to have significantly different climates, it will be necessary
to examine impacts within different climate zones. Generally speaking, the greatest
impact is likely to be seen in the hottest and coldest climates, where the changes in use
are likely to be all in the same direction (e.g., in a cold climate, there would be no
significant air conditioning needs, so there would be no significant cancellation of the
effects of reduction in space heating use). The fuel most affected depends on the mix of
fuel used. In hot climates, the fuels used for generation of electricity will be most
affected. In most cold climates, fossil fuels used directly for space heating will be the
fuel use most affected, although this may not be the case in regions with abundant
hydroelectric, nuclear, or geothermal resources.
The baseline energy intensity, or energy use per capita, of different regions of a country
is a key factor in the relative effects of climate change. Regions with a low level of
energy use are likely to see little impact on an absolute basis, although the effects could

11.3.2.

11-8
still have a significant impact in terms of welfare. The rate of economic development is
a key factor in projecting the baseline energy intensity.
The effects of climate change on energy use could have an impact on environmental
policies, including policies to prevent climate change. For example, increased com-
bustion of fossil fuels to meet increased demand of electricity or due to direct use of
fossil fuels could make compliance with existing or proposed NOx, SO2, O3, CO2, or
other emission requirements more difficult.
11.2  An array of methods
Several methods can be employed to assess the potential impact of climate change on
the energy sector. The methods discussed in this section delineate a selected range of
options available to countries. Some of the methods will produce detailed estimates of
the impacts. These methods may require greater expertise, more money, and more time.
Other methods will yield simpler and rougher estimates, but they may require fewer
resources.
A country in the process of selecting a method will first need to assess its priorities
(e.g., the level of detail desired for outputs from the method); its available assets for
estimating climate change impacts on the energy sector (e.g., time, money, expertise);
the availability of other inputs (e.g., data, computers, models); its estimated vulnera-
bility to climate change (based on existing knowledge); and its potential risks associated
with inaccurately assessing the impacts of climate change on the energy sector. By
doing so, countries can select the method that falls within its time and resource
constraints and whose results best meets its specific needs.
This section addresses the use of the following types of methods:
• 
expert judgement;
• 
analogue approaches;
• 
quantitative models, including econometric/statistical, engineering, and hybrid.
For each method, the resolution of results, data needs, time requirements to use, and
skill or training requirements are discussed.
11.2.1 Expert judgement
The expert judgement method is the simplest, least time consuming, and least costly
method discussed in this chapter. A detailed understanding of energy use in a country
and the relationship between climate and energy use may suffice to make preliminary
estimates regarding the impacts of climate change on the energy sector. This method is
probably best suited to determining the need and establishing hypotheses for future,
Energy
11-9
more sophisticated analysis. Expert judgement may be useful in identifying the sub-
sectors in which impacts are most likely to be significant. Experts on residential and
commercial building energy use and hydropower generation might be consulted to
develop a preliminary understanding of where research resources should be focused.
Expert judgement should be able to indicate the direction of change in energy use that
countries with the warmest and coolest climates could reasonably expect to stem from
climate change. In warmer countries such as Egypt, it is likely that energy use will
increase because of the lack of heating needs and the presence of air conditioning. The
greater the presence of air conditioning in the baseline projection, the greater the impact
is likely to be. In colder countries, detailed analysis is probably not necessary to
establish that energy use is likely to decline. Care must be taken, of course, to include
complicating factors such as changes in the Gulf Stream flow. Expert judgement would
probably not yield reliable results for the potential magnitude of these impacts.
Expert judgement may be unreliable in establishing even the direction of overall impacts
in temperate climates. Because the combined impacts from increasing energy use to
cool buildings and decreasing energy use to heat buildings may be problematic,
ascertaining the directional change of energy use may be impossible without a more
sophisticated method.
11.2.1.1 Resolution of results
Residential and commercial building experts might be able to project whether impacts
within a specific residential and commercial end uses, and within broad climate zones,
are likely to be significant or not. Given an appropriate understanding of climate and
energy use, an expert could provide judgement on impacts on specific cities. A
hydroelectric generation expert could offer an opinion on the relative magnitude of
change in generation, given a specific change in precipitation. Further resolution of
results would probably not be reliable.
11.2.1.2 Data requirements
Data requirements are relatively low, although the use of expert judgement does require
an understanding of the distribution of projected energy use by:
• 
primary fuel coal
− 
oil
− 
natural gas
− 
nuclear
− 
hydropower
− 
solar
− 
wind
− 
geothermal
− 
biomass.

•

−

−

−

− 
other.
Because energy use is likely to change substantially in developing countries in the ab-
sence of climate change, an understanding of projected energy use over the time of
interest (which can be several decades for climate change assessments) is essential. A
baseline estimate of increasing electricity use is not sufficient basis for developing an
expert judgement on the effects of climate change. The expert must know to whether
this increase is due to the increased purchase and use of air conditioners, the use of
which would be strongly affected by climate change, or personal computers and refri-
gerators, the use of which would not be strongly affected by climate change.
The expert must also have an understanding of the likely effects of climate changes.
The types of effects to be considered include the average change in temperature,
changes in precipitation, and changes in stream and river flows.
11.2.1.3 Time requirements
The time requirements to use expert judgement are relatively modest — a matter of a
days, assuming that an expert is available. The time required would be inversely pro-
portional to the expert’s knowledge of a country’s energy use.
11.2.1.4 Skill or training requirements
Expert judgement presumes expertise. Achieving a level of expertise to make an expert
judgement on the effects on energy use of climate change requires years of specialised
training in physics, engineering, statistics, or economics. Little additional training or
study would be required.
Energy
11-11
11.2.2 Analogue methods
When an analysis with greater detail than the expert judgement method is desired, but
not enough country-specific information on energy use is available for quantitative
approaches, it may be appropriate to use the analogue method. In the analogue method,
climate change impact estimates for another country for which more information is
available are adapted for use in another country. The basis of this approach is an
assumption that the country of interest will have an energy use response to climate
change which is similar to that of another country or region.
This approach can also be used to capture baseline changes in the energy sector due to
a country’s economic development. A country undergoing rapid growth is likely to have
substantially different use patterns over the periods involved in many climate change
scenarios. It may be more appropriate to assume that a developing country 50 years in
the future might have usage patterns similar to those found in a developed country
today, rather than attempt to project today’s usage patterns. An example of this is
shown in Box 11.1.
This approach is most likely to be successful if the projected energy use of a subsector
(e.g., residential and commercial building energy use) is expected to be reasonably
similar in the region of interest and in the analogous region.
11.2.2.1 Resolution of results
The results will, at best, be only as good as the original study, and will depend on the
appropriateness of the analogy between the region or country of interest and the region
or country that was the subject of the study. The spatial resolution depends on the
number of analogies made — in a country with generally similar climate, one analogy
may be sufficient. In a large country with many different climates, several analogies
must be made. The temporal resolution depends on the resolution of the study on the
analogous region.
11.2.2.2 Data requirements
Climate and energy use indices in the region of interest and the analogue region must be
available to establish whether the analogy is appropriate. A typical climate index is
degree days. Degree days reflect the difference between some reference temperature and
outdoor ambient temperatures over a year. Both heating and cooling degree days are
used. A relatively high number of heating degree days indicates a cold climate, and a
high number of cooling degree days indicates a hot climate.
Energy use should also be similar between the two regions. Where energy use in a
developed country is used as an analogy for future energy use in a developing country,
it is not necessary to compare current use. It is important, however, to establish whether
fuel availability would allow use in the developing country to become similar to use in
UNEP/IVM Handbook
11-12
the developed country. For example, if the developed country has abundant natural gas
and uses significant quantities of it, but the developing country is an island country with
no indigenous gas, the two countries are probably not analogous.

Box 11.1
Example of the use of the analogue method in two countries
in transition.
A study sponsored by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (Smith et al.,
1994) was the first analysis of climate change and its potential effects on the thermoelectric
power sector in developing countries and countries with economies in transition, and in Egypt
and Poland in particular. The study addressed how economic development in the two
countries may affect sensitivity to climate change. The countries represent different economic
situations: Poland currently has a higher standard of living than Egypt. They also represent
different climatic sensitivities to thermoelectric power use and production: Poland has a high-
latitude climate and Egypt has a desert climate. The goal of this study was to take a “first cut”
at the sensitivities of these sectors to climate change and to develop bounds for possible
impacts. Using different regions in the United States as analogues, the authors developed
quantitative estimates of changes in demand for electricity in Egypt and Poland in 2060 under
different assumptions of climate change and change in baseline economic conditions.
Two sets of assumptions were made about baseline electricity demand. The first assumed that
the per capita standard of living in Egypt and Poland in 2060 does not change from their 1990
levels. This is unlikely over such a long period of time, but sets a lower boundary for standard
of living. The second assumed the standard of living in both countries in 2060 is the same as
the 1990 standard of living in the United States. This assumption is also unlikely, given
projected economic growth rates, but serves as an upper boundary for standard of living.
Under the second assumption, the authors used electricity consumption patterns from states
in the United States with climates most similar to Egypt or Poland. They then used an
engineering approach to project the effects of climate change in both countries under the two
different standard of living assumptions.
The analysis found that the effects of climate change on energy use in Egypt may be
pronounced, but only if significant economic development takes place, resulting in increased
use of air conditioning. The effects in Poland are likely to be minor — a small increase in air
conditioning electricity demand is cancelled by a decrease in space heating electricity demand.
In these two countries, development and growth may actually affect thermoelectric industries
and the demand for electricity to a much greater extent than will climate change. For areas
most sensitive to climate change effects on the thermoelectric power sector (i.e., low
latitudes), the estimated impacts on electricity demand are greatly influenced by differing
assumptions about baseline demand, which are largely driven by expectations about economic
growth and standards of living. For long-term planners, accurately estimating baseline energy
use is integral to the reliable estimation of the change in electricity demand as a result of
climate change. This study shows that long-term forecasts of electric power needs for low
latitude countries should also consider the effects of climate change because it could add as
much as one-seventh to potential increases in demand from population and economic growth.

11.2.2.3 Time requirements
The primary reasons for using the analogue method are its expediency and economy. If
a completed study for an analogue country is available, and climate data are available
for the country of interest, the analogue method may be completed in a matter of weeks.
The precise time requirement depends on the level of resolution required. If the analysis
requires conducting a study on a analogue country for which more detailed data are
available but a completed study is not, the time requirement would be much greater.
11.2.2.4 Skill or training required
Using the analogue method requires an understanding of the nature of energy use in the
country of interest and the analogue country, and a good understanding of the rela-
tionship between climate change and energy use. Training in physics, engineering,
statistics, or economics would be useful.
11.2.3 Quantitative methods
Quantitative methods can be broadly categorised within two basic approaches: econo-
metric/statistical methods and engineering end-use methods. The first approach,
sometimes called “top-down,” infers demand relationships using statistical models
based primarily on economic theory, whereas the second approach, sometimes called
“bottom-up,” relies more heavily on engineering principles. The distinction between
these two approaches becomes blurred in hybrid approaches, which use both methods.
11.2.3.1 Econometric/statistical methods
Econometric and statistical approaches use statistical models to attempt to draw infer-
ences about the relationship between energy use and climate based on historical data.
Econometric models are derived using economic theories of purchasing behaviour.
Simple engineering principles such as degree day variables may be incorporated in the
specifications of the models.
Because the models typically use income and prices as variables, these models are well
suited for analysing tax and subsidy policies. They are not well suited, however, to
modelling policies that mandate efficiency levels, such as building standards
(Braithwait and Gelling, 1992).
Econometric models can use data over a wide range of aggregation. At the most ag-
gregated level, an analysis might use, as an independent variable, energy use for an
entire country. At the most disaggregated level, energy use in individual buildings might
be modelled. The example in Box 11.2 presents the use of a highly disaggregated data
set. Linder et al. (1989) present an example of such analysis conducted at a utility level.
Energy

Box 11.2 Example of the use of econometric models.
Morrison and Mendelsohn (in press) developed econometric models of US energy demand and
used them to simulate the effects of climate change on US energy expenditures by the
residential and commercial sectors. They used ordinary least squares regression analysis to
estimate total expenditures on electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, liquid petroleum gas, district
heat, and kerosene.
They developed two types of models: a long-run model and a short-run model. In the short
run, people will not make significant changes to their buildings in response to climate change
— they will tend to make behavioural adjustments that will reduce energy expenditures. In the
long run, people will modify buildings and build new buildings to be better adapted to the
climate. The short-run model included consideration of climate sensitive building
characteristics, effectively holding them constant; the long-run model did not explicitly consider
these variables, thereby allowing them to adjust with climate. The terms “long run” and “short
run” do not reflect the period of analysis that the models consider.
Within these two types of models, they developed residential and commercial models. For
their data sources, they used the results of detailed surveys of the two sectors conducted by
the US government. These surveys provided detailed data on fuel consumption, climate
variables, demographic and business enterprise information, and building characteristics for
each building in the sample. Demographic data used for the residential model included
average fuel prices, use of alternative fuels, average income range, family size, age of
household head, race, and receipt of government assistance. Data on firms used for the
commercial model included average fuel prices, use of alternative fuels, months open per
year, and types and percentages of various building characteristics. Nonclimate sensitive
building characteristics included square meters, number of floors, and building age. Climate
sensitive building characteristics included building material, conservation efforts, heating and
cooling equipment, and high energy-consuming appliances.
The authors analysed the effects of three climate change scenarios (1.5E, 2.5E, and 5EC
increases) for a 1990 and a 2060 economy. Accounting for a 2060 economy included
consideration of GDP, per capita growth, population growth, fuel price changes, and building
stock age.
The results showed that the residential sector was more sensitive to climate change than the
commercial sector, and that the residential sector was likely to realise a net increase in energy
expenditures, while the commercial sectors were likely to see a net decrease. Results varied
by climate zone — both sectors are expected to realise benefits in the colder regions and
increased costs in the warmer regions. For the United States overall, the study projected a
range of effects. For a 2.5EC increase, the range of effects is projected to be from a US$ 2
billion gain (short-run model) to US$ 4 billion in costs (long-run model). If temperatures
increases by 5EC, the impacts are projected to be costs ranging from $ 1 billion (short-run
model) to $ 13 billion (long-run model). Costs estimated by the long-run model are higher than
those estimated by the short-run model because of increased saturation of cooling equipment
in response to warming. Since the long-run model allows more flexibility, it may be surprising
that it finds higher costs. The estimates, however, relate to energy expenditures only, ignoring
comfort levels. Costs and savings of building characteristics adjustments have not been
accounted for, so both total costs on the cooling side and benefits on the heating side are
expected to be above the estimates produced, particularly in the long-run model.

Statistical models can be used as the basis for projecting the effects of variations in
river and stream flows as a result of climate change on hydroelectric generation, if flow
histories and projections are available. Linder et al. (1989) used ordinary least squares
regression analysis with a logistic, single variable model to project hydroelectric
generation.
 Resolution of results
Resolution of results depends on the level of detail and the number of observations of
the dependent variables. If data are available for a large sample at the building and end-
use level, across several climate zones, estimates of end-use impacts by building type
and climate zone may be possible.
 Data requirements
Data requirements vary. Simple, aggregated data analysis requires only historical na-
tional or regional estimates of energy use and historical and projected average temper-
atures. The most disaggregated analysis requires detailed data on samples of buildings
and residences at a regional level, and also historical and projected average tempera-
tures.
 Time requirements to use
Time requirements are roughly proportional to the level of disaggregation of the data
being analysed, but are on the order of weeks or months.
Energy
11-17
 Skill or training required
A statistical or econometrics background is most useful for applying this type of
method. An understanding of physics and engineering principles is essential to develop
reasonable specifications.
11.2.3.2 Engineering end-use methods
Engineering models for analysis of the impacts of climate change typically involve the
analysis of demand by end use (e.g., space heating, space cooling) using engineering
principles. To assess climate change impacts, only a few end uses need to be addressed,
which simplifies the analysis. Usually only space heating and space cooling are
modelled, since the effects of climate change on other end uses are likely to be relatively
small. The engineering methods used are typically either some type of degree day
algorithm or a building simulation model. The degree day method is much simpler than
the building simulation model approach, but offers less resolution and accuracy.
Engineering methods also can encompass hydrological models of the effects on
hydroelectric generation of river flows. An example of an engineering approach that
modelled heating, cooling, and water pumping energy use is shown in Box 11.3.
Both the degree day approach and the building simulation approach require some type
of exogenous projection, either baseline end-use energy for the degree day approach or
numbers of buildings and building characteristics for the building simulation approach.
Accurate projections are likely to require consideration of econometric principles.
Such models can have a greater appeal than econometric approaches because of the
clear association between energy-using equipment and use. Because of this clear asso-
ciation and because of the detail involved, the more detailed models are well suited to
modelling mandatory efficiency standards or other types of policies that involve the
substitution of capital for energy.
The principal shortcoming of engineering end-use methods is their lack of consideration
of price elasticity response and their dependence on exogenous projection of number of
units. They are, consequently, not well suited to modelling effects of changes in energy
prices and income levels. They do also not implicitly account for voluntary substitution
of capital for energy, which would tend to reduce energy use. These shortcomings can
be overcome through the incorporation of econometric principles into the models, the
result being the hybrid approaches discussed below.

11.2.3.3 Degree day approach
The degree day approach (ASHRAE, 1997) assumes that fuel use for heating and
cooling is proportional to the number of heating and cooling degree days, respectively.
This assumption is generally quite accurate for modelling heating using fossil fuel
combustion. It is less accurate for modelling heat pumps and air conditioners using a
refrigeration cycle, because efficiency of the system is a function of outside tempera-
ture. In modelling the effects of warming, the approach tends to understate savings from
heat pump heating and understate increased energy from heat pump and air conditioner
cooling. The degree day approach does not consider changes in humidity — changes
 Box 11.3 Example of an engineering approach.
 Baxter and Calandri (1992) used an engineering end-use approach to model the effects of
climate change on annual energy use and peak demand in 2010 in California. They
focused on heating and cooling of buildings, and pumping of water for farms and cities.
The study used engineering simulation techniques for the baseline projection of heating
and cooling use and econometric techniques for the projection of municipal pumping
requirements, but relied primarily on the degree day method.
Impacts were projected by end use, using data on population and economic growth,
building and appliance stocks, and the operation of appliances. Four separate models were
used: a residential buildings model, a commercial buildings model, an agricultural and
water pumping model, and a peak demand model. The peak demand model translated
projections of energy use from the first three models into estimates of peak demand, using
a response surface model derived from building simulation analysis to translate cooling
impacts to each hour of the peak day.
The residential and commercial models used building simulation-derived estimates of
baseline energy use for prototypical buildings. The residential model includes data on
21 residential end uses in three building types for each of the 13 climate zones modelled.
The commercial model includes data on eight end uses in 11 building types for each of the
climate zones. The authors modified the projections of usage rate in each building type
using the ratios of degree days in the climate change and baseline scenarios.
The agricultural and water pumping model took into account both changes in water
demand and changes in electricity needed to meet this demand. Changes in water demand
result from changes in crop choice and increased evapotranspiration. Changes in crop
choice were modelled using a linear program algorithm. Increased demand for urban water
was modelled with an econometric model of water demand as function of price, income,
summer temperature, and household formation rates. The modelling of electricity required
to meet this demand took into account the likely changes in the source of water from
surface water to groundwater, and the increased pumping requirements as groundwater
levels drop.
The results showed that with their worst scenario, a 1.9EC increase in temperatures, state-
wide electric energy use would increase by 2.6% and peak demand would increase by
3.7%. Peak demand increased at a higher rate than energy use because California utilities
tend to be summer peaking. The increased need for water pumping contributed 34% of the
increased energy requirement and 20% of the increased peak demand.

that may be significant as a result of climate change. Humidity changes would be best
accounted for with a building simulation model.
The key to accurate assessment with the degree day method is selecting appropriate
average balance points for the base used to calculate the degree days. The balance point
represents the temperature at which a building requires no space heating or cooling. A
base of 18EC has been traditionally used for measuring degree days, but this base may
not be appropriate for most buildings because typical balance temperatures are
different. Solar heat gains and internal heat gains from lights, people, and electric
equipment decrease the balance point of a building, as does thermal insulation. Balance
points tend to be lower for commercial buildings than residential buildings because of
the higher level of internal gains and the greater significance of core areas, which tend
to require cooling at all times. Balance temperatures decline as insulation levels and
internal gains increase. In the United States, a typical balance point for commercial
cooling and heating is 10EC, whereas a typical balance temperature for residential
heating is 15.5EC. Balance temperatures for cooling can vary considerably, depending
on the use of natural ventilation, and can range from 18EC to 27EC. It is best to
conduct a study of the balance points for a specific country. Examples of degree day
approaches include Baxter and Calandri (1992; see Box 11.3) and Rosenthal et al.
(1995).
11.2.3.4 Building simulation models
Building simulation models can offer an improvement in precision relative to degree day
approaches and eliminate the need for assumptions about balance temperatures. Such
models typically calculate a building’s heat gains and losses on an hourly basis.
Changes in humidity and the effect on cooling requirements can be accounted for by
these models. Scott et al. (1994) found that the non-linear relationship of humidity and
temperature is a key factor in the tendency for simple degree day approaches to
underestimate cooling at higher temperatures. Sophisticated representations of building
heating, ventilating, and air conditioning systems can be developed in the more detailed
models. A list of such detailed models is presented in Table 11.1.
Simulation approaches use building prototypes to represent average construction
characteristics for a building segment. Simulation models may also be used in
combination with degree day approaches, as illustrated in Baxter and Calandri (1992).
 Resolution of results
The resolution of results depends on the disaggregation of the data used. The best
resolution is achieved through the use of many building segments and climate zones.

 Data requirements
The degree day approach requires substantially less data than the building simulation
approach. Simpler degree day approaches require only a projection of fuel use by end
use and estimates of degree days. Rosenthal et al. (1995) derived this projection for US
residential and commercial end uses, by building type from a nation-wide projection of
space conditioning energy use. More detailed degree day and simulation models, which
could be used to assess policy effects, would require more detailed data on number of
buildings and equipment capacity. Simulation approaches require detailed data on
construction characteristics of buildings.
The degree day approach requires estimates of degree days, using an appropriate
balance temperature as the base. Thom (1966) provides a method for computing degree
days as a function of average temperature and the standard deviation of temperature,
which is useful if hourly data are not available.
Simulation modelling requires detailed, hourly information on temperature, solar
radiation, cloud cover, and wind speed and direction. Some models use standardised
formats such as Typical Meteorological Year, whereas other models use customised
formats. Developing data for a climate change scenario could require significant data
processing time.
 Time requirements
Time requirements are relatively modest for simpler degree day approaches, if needed
data are readily available. Simulation modelling approaches can be the most time
intensive of any approaches.

 Skill and training requirements
An understanding of the engineering principles of heating, ventilating, and air condi-
tioning of buildings is required for degree day approaches. Modelling of water pumping
requires understanding of both hydrology and agriculture, and may require econometric
training for the modelling of urban water use. Use of building simulation models
requires advanced engineering training.
11.2.3.5 Hybrid approaches
Hybrid approaches are combinations of econometric and structural approaches. They
typically involve separate models for each end use, like structural approaches, but
include econometric analysis in an effort to better incorporate behavioural response.
These models are typically used for utility-specific demand forecasting. As such, they
provide more resolution of results, but require more data. Hybrid models have seen
limited use in the analysis of the effects of climate change
Two commonly used energy forecasting models, REEPS (EPRI, 1991), a residential
energy demand model, and COMMEND (EPRI, 1986), a commercial energy demand
model, are examples of hybrid econometric-engineering models that use separate sub-
models for each end use. Both models forecast electricity, natural gas, and fuel oil
demand.
REEPS forecasts residential energy sales by end use, and models appliance purchase
decisions, efficiencies, and utilisation patterns for 10 end uses. The key variables
affecting purchase decisions are household and dwelling characteristics, fuel prices and
availability, climate (heating and cooling degree days), and appliance attributes.
COMMEND disaggregates the commercial sector into building type, end use, and fuel
type. The model uses a combination of econometrically derived elasticities, statistical
and engineering simulation techniques, and life-cycle costing to address the penetration
of efficient technologies and interfuel substitution.
 Resolution of results
The resolution of results is high — data are available at the building and end-use levels.
Separate analyses usually must be conducted if separate climate zones are involved.
 Data requirements
Hybrid models are data intensive. They require the following types of data:

• 
end use (by building type)
− 
saturation
− 
energy intensity (use per unit, e.g., houses, floor area)
− 
projection of number of units;
• 
fuel prices;
• 
climate data;
• 
personal income;
• 
efficiency standards;
• 
price response data.
Time requirements to use
Because of the intensive data requirements, the time requirements can be substantial (on
the order of months), particularly if many climate zones must be modelled. Estimating
price elasticities can be a significant task in and of itself.
Skill or training required
It is essential to have an understanding of both the economic and engineering principles
involved in modelling of energy demand.
11.2.4 Summary of methods
A summary of methods is presented in Table 11.2. This table summarises resource
requirements and selection considerations.
11.3  Autonomous adaptation
Autonomous adaptation of energy use to climate change can be divided between short-
run and long-run adaptation. Short-run adaptations differ from long-run adaptations in
that they involve no significant investment of capital. Most autonomous adaptations can
be assessed using one or more of the methods described above.

11.3.1 Short-run adaptation
In the short run, buildings and generation systems will remain the same. Adaptation will
consist of using more or less energy for heating, cooling, and electricity generation. This
type of adaptation is what is modelled by most degree day or building simulation
engineering models without changes in exogenous projections and by
econometric/statistical models estimated using time series data or using specifications
for building characteristics. As temperatures increase, more energy will be used for
heating and less for cooling.
This energy use response, usually based on the assumption that thermostat settings
remain the same, may be modulated by behavioural responses. For example, if people
are spending less money on heating, they may choose to maintain their homes at warmer
temperatures in the heating season, reducing energy savings. If people begin spending
more of their income on space cooling, they may choose to retain some of that income
by maintaining their homes at warmer temperatures, reducing the increased use for
cooling.
Cooling equipment capacity will also constrain short-run response. Most people in most
countries do not have air conditioners and those that do have air conditioning have
systems with a capacity sized for specific conditions. Although larger, central systems,
particularly older units, are often oversized, smaller ones will reach their capacities in
warmer climates. They may operate for longer times over the course of a year, but their
operation during peak periods may not change. Detailed engineering models and
econometric models based on disaggregated data may capture this effect.
Prices for energy in a deregulated environment are likely to increase in warm months
and decrease in cold months relative to baseline conditions. These price changes are
also likely to modulate short-run responses. Only the most sophisticated models will
capture this type of feedback effect.
The dispatch of electric generation plants will change in the short run. The three factors
affecting this type of change will be changes in demand, in river flows, and in natural
gas prices. Change in demand will require more use of power plants during hot periods
and less during cold periods. Overall, capacity factors may increase or decrease.
Increases or decreases in river flows will require decreases or increases in fossil fuel
generation. Natural gas prices may decline because of reduced use for heating. This
may lead to a displacement of coal use by natural gas use.
11.3.2 Long-run adaptation
In the long run, people and enterprises will most likely substitute capital for energy, to
the extent that energy is valued more than capital, and energy for capital to the extent
that capital is valued more than energy. Substitution of capital for energy is likely to
take place in warmer climates, where people will have to invest more to remain com-
Energy
11-25
fortable. Substitution of energy for capital will take place in cooler climates, where
people can invest less and remain as comfortable. These substitutions will be seen in
investments in heating and cooling equipment, thermal shells of buildings, and electric
generation capacity.
Energy technology has been continually improving and is likely to continue to improve
in the absence of climate change. Any modelling of the effects of climate change should
take this type of autonomous adaptation into account to avoid overestimating adaptation
costs.
11.3.2.1 Heating and cooling equipment adaptation
In warm climates, people with air conditioning will most likely invest in more efficient
air conditioning systems to reduce air conditioning costs. Counteracting this effect
would be capital investments to improve welfare, i.e., the purchase of air conditioners
where none existed, or the purchase of higher capacity air conditioners. In cooler
climates, heating systems may become less efficient as heating costs become less
important. Electric heating systems may become more common, replacing natural gas
heating. Electric heating systems cost more to operate than natural gas systems, but
have a lower capital cost. Most residential and commercial heating and cooling
equipment has lifetimes of 10 to 20 years (ASHRAE, 1995), so there will be several
opportunities for adaptation over the time scale of climate change.
These adaptations may be affected by lack of information, separation of purchasing and
operating parties, and government standards. Lack of information at the time of initial
investment on the future costs of inefficiency may reduce the adaptation of cooling
equipment in the absence of government standards. In some situations (e.g., rental
properties), the party purchasing the energy using equipment is not the same as the
party operating it and paying the energy bills. In such situations, the purchasing party
may have little motivation to purchase more efficient cooling equipment. In the case of
heating equipment, government standards may set a minimum below which efficiencies
cannot fall without legislation.
Cooling equipment adaptation will take place in the context of increasing use of air
conditioning in most warm climates, as standards of living increase. This change will
increase the impacts of climate change. It is vitally important to consider this baseline
change, particularly in developing countries.
Heating and cooling system adaptation will not be implicitly accounted for by engi-
neering models or by time series econometric models. Econometric models using cross-
sectional data that include several climates and hybrid models may account for such
adaptation.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
11-26
11.3.2.2 Thermal shell adaptation
People may adapt building exterior surfaces (known as the shell) in both cooler and
warmer climates. In cooler climates, where heating requirements are more significant
than cooling requirements, insulation, weatherisation, and glazing resistance will
become less important. In warmer climates, shell improvements that reduce cooling
loads will become more important. Such improvements are not necessarily the same as
improvements that reduce heating loads. Common cost-effective improvements to
reduce cooling loads are ceiling insulation and glass that transmits less solar radiation.
The most cost-effective time to modify residential and commercial building thermal
envelopes is during design, and these buildings have long lifetimes (30 or more years),
so this adaptation will take place more slowly than equipment adaptation. Further
reducing the effects of this adaptation are the lack of information, separation of parties,
and minimum standards issues mentioned previously.
11.3.2.3 Electricity generation adaptation
The electricity generation subsector is likely to see three types of adaptation:
1. response to changing demand for electricity;
2. response to changing fuel prices;
3. response to changing hydroelectric generation capability.
These changes will take place within the context of restructuring and technological
change.
The electricity demand response to climate change will create a need for generators to
modify their capacity portfolios. In cool climates, decreased use of electric heating and
increased air conditioning will result in a flatter load shape. These changes in demand
are likely to reduce the need for peak utilisation power plants and increase the need for
base load power. In warm climates, increased air conditioning loads will create a load
shape with a more pronounced peak and will increase the need for more peak and
intermediate utilisation power plants. In hot climates where air conditioning is required
year-round, more capacity of all utilisation levels is likely to be required.
Fuel prices are likely to change in response to changes in energy demand and also
changes in generation patterns. These price changes will further modulate generation
patterns. In cool climates where natural gas is used for heating, decreased heating
requirements will depress prices and make natural gas a more cost-effective generation
fuel. In warmer climates that rely on natural gas as a peaking and intermediate
utilisation generation fuel, other fuels may become relatively more attractive.
Significant changes in the availability of hydroelectricity could have profound effects on
the capacity requirements of many countries. As discussed previously, the effects could
Energy
11-27
go in either direction, depending on the changes in river and stream flow. If flows are
increased, some countries may be able to defer generation expansion. If flows are
decreased, major generation expansion may be necessary.
The electric generation subsector is undergoing restructuring in many countries, in part
because of improvements in generation technology. These changes must be taken into
account in any assessment of the effects on this subsector. Natural gas-fired systems,
particularly combined cycle systems used on an intermediate and base load basis, have
become substantially more efficient, less expensive, and faster to build in recent years.
The optimal size has also become smaller. As a result, natural gas has become the fuel
of choice for generation in most places where natural gas is available. Also, these
changes have helped to erode the justification for regulated-monopoly and government-
owned utilities, which developed in an era when massive coal and nuclear plants with
long construction periods were perceived as the most cost-effective systems.
Privatisation or deregulation is happening in many countries. This shift will result in
much of the adaptation in generation being autonomous rather than planned. The time
horizon for generation planning has shrunk because of both technology changes and
restructuring, providing this subsector with greater flexibility in climate change
adaptation.
11.3.2.4 Autonomous adaptation in the absence of climate change
Technological improvements will change energy use and production in the absence of
climate change. These changes include efficiency improvements and the introduction of
new technologies. Any accounting for the effects of climate change on energy must take
these types of autonomous adaptations into account.
Currently, most of the energy-economy models represent technological change through
an exogenous parameter commonly referred to as the Autonomous Energy Efficiency
Improvement (AEEI) parameter (Edmonds and Reilly, 1983; Edmonds et al., 1991;
Manne and Richels, 1992; Peck and Tiesberg, 1992; Nordhaus, 1994). This parameter
is influenced by many factors such changes in the economy’s product mix, shifts in
consumer preferences, and true technical change (Faruqui et al., 1997). Unmodified
modelling of the effects of climate change on energy will tend to overestimate changes
in energy usage, since systems would be more efficient anyway. Over the periods of
analysis commonly used in gauging the effects of climate change, energy production
and consumption could change substantially.
Energy modellers have commonly assumed a constant rate of improvement in the
energy intensity of the economy. The assumed annual rates of improvement in the AEEI
have typically varied between 0.5 and 1.0 percent for the aggregate of all possible
technologies (Dowlatabadi and Oravetz, 1996). This assumption may not be correct
over long periods of time. One study that backcast the models over the period from
1954 through 1994 indicates that the AEEI is not constant and changes sign before and
after 1974 (Dowlatabadi and Oravetz, 1996).
UNEP/IVM Handbook
11-28
11.4  Planned adaptation
Governments can play a key role in preventing and reducing negative impacts from
climate change in the energy sector. A country can develop adaptation measures by
assessing impacts (through the methods presented in this chapter), identifying and
evaluating adaptation options, and selecting and implementing options (Benioff and
Warren, 1996). Adaptation policies will be most useful in those subsectors likely to
incur the greatest negative impacts: space cooling and electric generation. Table 11.3
presents a list of adaptation measures. Classifications of adaptation types are as
follows:
• 
Threat modifications would help reduce certain types of impacts.
• 
Effect prevention policies, if designed correctly, would eliminate certain types of
impacts.
• 
Loss sharing would involve the spreading of impact costs across different groups.
• 
Use change would involve a shift in inputs or outputs of a process.
Most of the adaptation measures in the energy sector involve requiring or encouraging
people and enterprises to bear additional initial capital costs. If the policies are designed
properly and assumptions about climate change impacts turn out to be reasonably
correct, bearing these initial capital costs will result in lower overall costs. For example,
energy efficiency standards for air conditioners will result in higher initial costs for
cooling. The overall life cycle costs, however, should be less than if there were no
standards. Such policies are probably best assessed using engineering models, since
they involve efficiency improvements.
Some adaptation measures involve a more equitable sharing of costs. For example,
residential electricity subsidies would tend to hide the true costs of producing electricity.
If subsidies are substantial enough, people would have no incentive to restrain their use
of electricity for cooling, since other sectors of society are paying for it. Elimination or
reduction of subsidies will result in the costs being borne by those responsible for
incurring them. Another result of this policy is likely to be greater efficiency. Other,
more efficient methods of achieving comfort, such as better building design, use of
natural ventilation, and more efficient air conditioners, may be more cost-effective if
prices reflect true costs. Subsidies serve to distort markets and eliminate consideration
of such options. Pricing and subsidy policies are best analysed using econometric
models.

11.5  Summary and implications
The energy sector is sensitive to climate change. The nature and magnitude of the
impacts are likely to vary widely, depending on climatic conditions and projected energy
use. The subsectors most likely to be significantly affected are space heating, space
cooling, and hydroelectric generation. Economic development is a key factor in
projecting energy use and consequential effects of climate change, particularly the
effects on space cooling.
The effects of climate change on energy use could have implications in other sectors.
The effects on hydroelectric generation are likely to have implications on other aspects
of water management, particularly in situations where overall stream and river flows
are reduced. Increased use of electricity for space conditioning is likely to lead to an
increase in various types of emissions, which may cause health problems and problems
UNEP/IVM Handbook
11-30
in achieving emissions targets, including greenhouse gas emission targets. Decreased
use of energy for space conditioning may ease problems associated with meeting such
targets.
This chapter has presented an array of methods, ranging from judgement-based methods
to data intensive quantitative methods, with different applicability and varying levels of
precision. Judgement-based methods are appropriate for establishing initial research
priorities, but are the least precise. They may suffice in cold climates where the effects
of climate change on energy use are likely to be beneficial. Analogue methods may offer
an opportunity for developing better preliminary estimates at a small increment in cost,
if an appropriate analogy can be made. Econometric/statistical methods offer the best
means of evaluating tax and subsidy policies. Engineering end-use methods offer the
best means of evaluating energy efficiency policies. Hybrid approaches offer the best of
both quantitative worlds, but have seen limited application in climate change analysis.
In any quantitative approach, the better resolution can be achieved through the use of
more disaggregated data.
Addressing long-run adaptation, i.e., modification of buildings and equipment, is the
greatest challenge in estimating these effects. Econometric models using highly
disaggregated cross-sectional data are a good means of dealing with this issue. The use
of hybrid models may offer the best approach in the long run, but more applications are
needed before a judgement can be made on their effectiveness.

12.1  Nature and scope of the problem
Forests and woodlands, whether intensively managed or not, are the main source of
timber for construction, energy, and pulp for a large part of the world’s population.
They are the basis for a significant economic sector in many countries. Further, they are
also a key habitat for many species and the focus of much of the world’s biodiversity.
Forests play a key role in either taking up and storing carbon or releasing it to the
atmosphere, which adds to the greenhouse effect.
The geographical distribution, composition, and productivity of forests are controlled,
overall, by climate. Within the climatic envelope, human actions and land use practices
strongly determine the type and performance of forests. Since the pattern and intensity
of human activity are changing all around the world, and the climate is expected to
change in the next century, it is logical to expect impacts on the ability of forests to
supply goods and ecosystem services.

The forest sector encompasses all tree-dominated systems such as forests (Innes, 1994),
woodlands, savannahs (Scholes and van der Merwe, 1996), and mangroves (Davis et
al., 1994), ranging from completely unmanaged to totally managed forms such as
plantation forests. It can also include trees grown on farmlands (agroforestry and
woodlots) and trees in urban areas. The biodiversity and ecosystem services aspects of
forests are dealt with in Chapter 13, Biodiversity. Trees which yield both timber and
fruit can be dealt with in either the agriculture sector or the forest sector; it is necessary
to be consistent and make clear what has been included where. Many of the methods
and models used in the forest sector analysis can be applied to non-woody terrestrial
ecosystems and agroecosystems as well.
Forest-based activities include the harvesting of trees for timber, pulp, other wood-
based products, or fuelwood, and industries based on these primary products, such as
furniture making, construction, and paper. They also include many other non-wood
forest ecosystem products such as the harvesting of fruits, fungi, birds, and animals,
and the use of the services that the forest ecosystem delivers, such as clean water, clean
air, and recreational opportunities. Many forest-based goods and services are not
reflected in the formal economy, but nevertheless have a high value.
12.1.1 The study area
The study area will typically include all the terrestrial parts of the national territory. In
some cases it may be possible, right from the start, to exclude some areas as being too
dry or too cold to support trees under any plausible climate change scenario. Reducing
the area of the study could help reduce the amount of data to be collected. Within the
study area the focus will be on those areas currently or potentially occupied by econo-
mically, biologically, or culturally important forest ecosystems. The smallest patch size
(minimum mapping unit) which can be addressed will to some extent depend on the size
of the national territory, the funds available for the assessment, the detail of the
available data, and the importance of forests to the nation. In most countries, 1:5
million vegetation maps (or better) are available, which translates to an absolute mini-
mum map unit of about 5x5 kilometres, which also corresponds to the minimum scale
at which interpolated climate data are typically available regionally. Global vegetation
and climate maps are available at 0.5° resolution (about 30x30 kilometres), which is the
coarsest scale at which an assessment should be done. It should be possible to work at a
more detailed scale.
12.1.2 The time frame
The period selected for the projections should satisfy the following conditions (see also
Chapters 2 and 3, where socio-economic and climate scenarios are discussed).
1. Compatible with the time periods selected for assessments in other sectors.
Forest
12-3
2. Short enough to allow plausible scenarios to be constructed. It is virtually
impossible to predict what might happen more than 100 years from the present.
3. Long enough to allow forest processes such as growth and species composition to
be significantly affected. Most forests change quite slowly because of the longevity
of the trees. Hence it is unlikely that change will be detectable in less than 20 years.
12.1.3 Expected climate impacts
A change in climate can be expected to lead to (see Table 12.1):
• 
a shift in the geographical area which will support forests;
• 
a change in the species composition of mixed-species forests;
• 
a change in the output of forest products per unit area of forest.
These changes will have effects on the economic and social systems which depend on
forestry (loss or gain of sector turnover, export earnings, jobs, access to fuelwood,
construction materials, and forest products). They will also have consequences for the
species dependent on forests and for ecosystem services such as the maintenance of
steady and clean water supplies.
Forests are influenced by climate and influence climate in return. The effect of forests
on the climate occurs directly at the local to regional scale, through their characteristic
pattern of absorption of solar radiation, evaporation of water, and surface roughness,
and also indirectly at the global scale through the carbon which they store or release.
An assessment needs to take note of these feedback loops, but at this stage the
integrated modelling technology is not widely available to treat them explicitly in a
national study.

• 
Shift in the location, type, or number of forest sector jobs
• 
Change in forest amenity value; for instance, the length of the winter-sport season
• 
Afforestation or deforestation as a result of land competition with agriculture
Forests compete with agriculture for land. When adaptation models are tested, the
forest sector analysis and the agriculture sector analysis need to be co-ordinated to
ensure that they are not both planning to occupy the same land in the future.
12.1.4 Impacts other than climate
Changes in forests are only partly driven by climate. In many parts of the world, socio-
economic and policy factors are the main drivers of land use change. Assessment of the
impacts of climate change must take place within the framework of changes in
environmental and socio-economic factors which may occur at the same time, and the
adaptations which they may cause. In particular, forests are likely to be affected by
competition for land for other uses, changing demand for forest products, rising
atmospheric CO2, and increased deposition of pollutants such as acid rain and ozone at
the same time as they are being exposed to climate change.
Forests downwind of major industrial or intensive agricultural areas are likely to be
exposed to additional inputs of nitrogen from the atmosphere in the form of wet and dry
deposition. Since most forest ecosystems are nitrogen limited, this leads to increased
productivity, up to the point where the forests become nitrogen saturated (Dise and
Wright, 1995).
12.2  An array of methods
12.2.1 Experimentation
The ideal data for assessing the impacts of climate change come from direct measure-
ments in replicated, representative experiments (Landsberg et al., 1995). These are
seldom available for forests in relation to climate change. Irrigation experiments can be
used to extrapolate the possible effects of increases in precipitation (Linder, 1987).
Several soil-warming experiments currently under way in forests will be useful for
understanding the effects of higher temperature (Peterjohn et al., 1993, 1994).
There is a wealth of experimental data on forests which are useful for an impact as-
sessment, although they were not collected for that purpose. For instance, any coutry
with significant forest activity is likely to have handbooks of forest yield tables, which
are based on experimental data. These tables estimate the amount of timber that can be
extracted from given forest stands. There are also likely to be forest inventory data on
the number, size, and species of trees in given forest stands. Forest inventory data can
be used to quantify current biomass and species composition, and forest yield tables can
be used to estimate current and future productivity (Matyas, 1994). If inventories and
yield tables are not available for the study area, they probably are for similar regions
Forest
12-5
and species in neighbouring countries. Forest yield tables and inventories are for
useable timber only; the numbers must be increased, often by a factor of two, to get
total biomass and production.
12.2.2 Analogue methods
12.2.2.1 Historical analogues
In the absence of planned experiments, natural experiments can be used as a substitute.
The climate has changed dramatically in the past, so if there is information on what the
past climate was and what forest state it supported at the time, it can be used to make
projections for the future. One weakness of this approach is that climate data have been
recorded for a few centuries at best and a few years at worst. The climate before the
period of record must be inferred from surrogate data, which introduces a further
source of potential error. Second, historical analogues are a type of correlative study,
and therefore are reliable only if future climates are within the range experienced in the
past, and as long as all other factors remain constant (which is unlikely). Historical
analogues provide a way of performing independent checks on the models. If a model
constructed and calibrated with modern data is able to represent the past successfully, it
can be applied to the task of projecting the future with greater confidence. Historical
analogues are also the main source of information about the rate at which slow
processes, for example, the migration of species, can occur (Chambers, 1993).
The two main sources of historical forest data are palynological (pollen) studies, which
can tell what species occurred in a given location over long periods of time and provide
coarse-resolution prehistoric climate data (Branchu et al., 1993, Servant et al., 1993),
and dendrochronological (tree-ring) studies, which supply annual-resolution climate and
growth-rate data stretching back several centuries (D’Arrigo et al., 1992). Both types of
studies require painstaking, specialist work over many years. Palynology requires a
suitable location for pollen to accumulate and be preserved, usually a quiet pond or
bog. Dendrochronology is generally not possible in the tropics, since few tropical trees
show clear and reliable ring structures.
12.2.2.2 Regional analogues
Regional analogues use regional variations in present-day climates as an indication of
what might happen under future climates. This method assumes that if a given climate
supports a particular type of forest at present, then a similar climate will support a
similar forest in the future, although perhaps at a different location. It can be applied
qualitatively (without sophisticated statistics) or quantitatively, in which case it is
essentially the same as the empirical-statistical bioclimatic models described below and
suffers the same problems (particularly the problem of not being able to describe
transients). The main weakness of regional analogues is the assumption that all factors
UNEP/IVM Handbook
12-6
other than climate remain constant. This is clearly violated where the location of the
future has completely different soils.
12.2.3 Expert judgement
 The judgement of experts, who may include people with a lifetime of experience but
little formal education, may be quite accurate, but its use is hard to justify in terms of
the scientific methodology since it is difficult to test. Some degree of expert opinion is
involved in all methods. The guidelines for the use of expert judgement are as follows:
• 
use it where there is no better alternative;
• 
choose the expert such that he or she is operating within his or her area of
expertise;
• 
when a finding was based on expert judgement, note it as such and acknowledge the
source;
• 
ask the expert for a likely range of values as well as a best guess; and
• 
use more than one expert where possible.
12.2.4 Quantitative models
12.2.4.1 Biophysical models
Biophysical models predict the consequences of changes in their driving variables (for
example,  precipitation, temperature, soil type, and plant species) on ecosystem attri-
butes such as the survival and growth of various species or the productivity of the entire
ecosystem. Discussions of the use of biophysical forest models for climate change
research are given in Shugart et al. (1988), Smith et al. (1992), Dale and Rauscher
(1994), and Joyce (1995). Recent reviews are by Agren et al. (1991) and Ryan et al.
(1996). Biophysical models fall on a continuum from those based entirely on statistical
relationships to those built on detailed mathematical representations of the processes
thought to be occurring in the forests.
Empirical-statistical
These models rely on statistical relationships between the input and output variables.
They are relatively simple and can have a high predictive power within the range for
which they are valid. Their drawback is that the existence of a correlation only suggests
the possibility of a causal link, it does not prove it. It is therefore extremely risky to
extrapolate these models beyond the range of data used to construct them, or to apply
Forest
12-7
them in conditions other than those under which they were derived. The further the
deviation from their zone of validity, the greater the risk of error.
Most forest industry growth and yield models (or tables) are empirical. Where they
include some way of varying the growth potential (often through a site index) which can
be linked to climate, they can be used to estimate forest production under a moderately
altered climate. They cannot be expected to estimate growth under elevated CO2
concentrations or nitrogen deposition.
Bioclimatic models are generally empirical-statistical. They establish relationships be-
tween the presence or absence of a given species (or vegetation type) and one or more
climatic variables. Typically the climatic variables include some measure of moisture
(such as mean annual precipitation, or the precipitation to evaporation ratio); tempera-
ture (such as the annual minimum and maximum), and seasonality (such as the range
between summer and winter or the fraction of precipitation in a given set of months).
The models range from very simple (Holdridge, 1967) to complex (Box, 1980). The
simple ones are easy to apply, but do not have high predictive power. The complex ones
have high predictive power, but need more detailed data and should not be extrapolated
to parts of the world other than where they were developed (see also Chapter 13,
Biodiversity). For an application of a simple global bioclimatic model within a country,
see Box 12.1.
Box 12.1
Using a simple bioclimate model to estimate forest shifts in
Venezuela.
The Holdridge model is a well-known scheme for relating the equilibrium distribution of broad
vegetation types to moisture and temperature conditions (Holdridge, 1967). It was applied
under current and future climate scenarios to estimate the distribution of vegetation types in
Venezuela. The doubled CO2 climate scenario used was from the United Kingdom Meteorolo-
gical Office (UKMO) model. The model passed the first test, which was to estimate the present
distribution of vegetation types with acceptable accuracy. Under doubled CO2, assuming a
long-term equilibrium, the area covered by dry tropical and subtropical forests and thorn
woodlands expanded by nearly 500 000 square kilometres, at the expense of the moist tropical
and subtropical forests.
Like all equilibrium models, the Holdridge model does not project how fast the change will
occur. However, it can be adapted for use in a transient scenario by making some assumptions
about the feasible rates of change (Smith and Shugart, 1993). The Holdridge model is given as
an example only; it is not recommended. In almost all cases more sophisticated and powerful
models are available, and should be used in preference (Prentice et al., 1992; Carpenter et al.,
1993).
Bioclimatic models can be thought of as a formal approach to regional analogues. They
suffer from the problems inherent in all correlative models. They are likely to fail if the
future climate combination has no current analogues or if the bioclimatic relationships
are altered by a changing environment (for instance, if elevated CO2 concentration
changes the water requirements of plants). Bioclimatic models have two further
weaknesses. First, they project the vegetation distribution under steady-state conditions
UNEP/IVM Handbook
12-8
and say nothing about the rate at which the new state will be approached. For forests,
this is a serious problem, since the turnover of species and the rate of dispersal are very
slow. If the scenario time frame is only 100 years, then it is unlikely that a new
equilibrium will have been reached by its end. Second, when they are applied to whole
vegetation types (sometimes also called biomes), they assume that the type acts as a
unit rather than as individual species. Despite these reservations, statistical bioclimatic
models remain among the most useful tools currently available for estimating the
distribution of forests under future climates, especially where they include some
process-based elements (see process-based models below).
It is preferable to use a regionally-optimised and calibrated bioclimatic model rather
than a general global model. Dedicated software is available for establishing the cli-
matic relationships (e.g., BIOCLIM from the Australian National University, or
DOMAIN from the Centre for International Forestry Research; see Carpenter et al.,
1993), or it can be done using a combination of GIS software (such as IDRISI from
Clark University) and spreadsheets. Previous studies can be used as a guide to the
combination of variables which is likely to be successful in predicting species limits.
Typically they will include upper and lower moisture and temperature indicators. The
following steps lay out a procedure for applying bioclimatic models (Box, 1980;
Woodward, 1987; Prentice et al., 1992, 1993; Carpenter et al., 1993).
1. Establish the climatic thresholds which correspond to the distribution limits of a
forest type or species. This is done by constructing a data file with each row cor-
responding to a grid point on the gridded climate surface for the study area, and the
columns to important climate variables. Add a column in which the presence (1) or
absence (0) of the forest type at that grid point (from the vegetation map) can be
noted. Plot the presence or absence on a graph with one climatic variable on the x-
axis and another on the y-axis, and look for the thresholds which separate presence
from absence. Try all pairs of climatic indices. A more sophisticated approach uses
multivariate statistical techniques such as discriminant function analysis or neural
networks. Clear discrimination requires that the study area include a climate range
greater than the limits for the forest type. If bioclimatic relationships already exist
from an appropriate study, this step can be skipped. Use half of the data to
establish the climatic relationships, and keep the rest for checking them.
2. Test the model by using the other half of the data to calculate whether forest should
be present or absent at a given point as predicted by the thresholds developed
above. Compare the predicted distribution to the actual distribution. Chi-square
tests can be used to calculate the statistical significance of the model.
3. Generate a climate surface for a given change scenario. This is usually done by
adding a given amount to all the current temperature values, and adding or sub-
tracting a given amount or proportion to the current precipitation values. The
climate relationships can be used to predict the new forest distribution.
Forest
12-9
4. Overlay the current and predicted forest distribution and calculate the areas of no
change, areas of forest loss, and areas of forest gain.
The principles underlying empirical bioclimatic modelling are not restricted to pre-
dicting the presence and absence of forest types. They can also be used to predict
various aspects of forest structure and function, such as biomass and productivity
(Kellomäki and Kolström, 1994; Peterson and Peterson, 1994). Box 12.2 presents an
application of an empirical bioclimatic model in Pakistan.
Box 12.2  Example: Application of BIOME3 in Pakistan.
Pakistan has a forest area of only 4.22 million hectares (4.8% of total area) for its population
of 130 million. A UNEP/GEF assisted study was carried out to determine potential impacts of
climate change on natural forest ecosystems in Pakistan, especially on mountain forests in
the northern regions of the country, whose altitudinal pattern of vegetation follows latitudinal
patterns of vegetation  found globally. The periods of the study were 1990-2020, 2020-2050,
and 2050-2080, with a climatic change rate of 0.3oC rise in temperature and precipitation
changes of 0 %, +/-1 % per decade; 1990 was the base year. In addition, the current atmos-
pheric CO2 concentration of 350 ppmv was assumed to increase to 425 ppmv in 2020, 500
ppmv in 2050, and 575 ppmv in 2080. The BIOME3 model was used for computer simulation
of climate change impacts. The model inputs consisted of latitude, soil texture class, and
monthly climate data on a 0.5o grid. Current and future potential area and net primary
productivity (NPP) of nine forest types or biomes were simulated with the help of the model. Of
these, three biomes (alpine tundra, grassland/arid woodlands, and deserts) showed reductions
in their area and five biomes (cold conifer/mixed woodland, cold conifer /mixed forests,
temperate conifer/ mixed forests, warm conifer/mixed forests, and steppe/arid shrublands)
showed increases in their area as a result of climate change.
Enhanced CO2 concentration in the atmosphere appeared to have a pronounced positive effect
on the potential area of all forest biomes except xerophytic woods and scrubs. NPP was
increased in all scenarios and in all biomes. However, there is a possibility of forest dieback
occurring before the dominant forest types have enough time to adjust to changed climate by
themselves. There would also be a time lag before forests could migrate to new sites. In the
intervening period, they would be vulnerable to environmental and socio-economic disturb-
ances, e.g., erosion, deforestation, and land-use changes, as a result of increase in human
and livestock population and enhanced demand for forest goods and services.
Thus, the overall impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems of Pakistan could be nega-
tive, and a number of adaptation strategies would be needed to cope with these impacts.
These include planting of more tolerant tree species, increased forest fire control, increased
forest products processing efficiency, use of wood substitute materials, provision of financial
assistance to forest communities affected by climate change, provision of subsidy on
substitute fuels and building materials for people of hilly regions, change from productive to
protective functions of forests, and establishment of forest corridors  to assist in forest
migration. These strategies would also improve the forest deficient situation in Pakistan even
in the absence of climate change, and therefore would constitute win-win or no-regret options.
Process-based models
UNEP/IVM Handbook
12-10
Process-based models are also known as mechanistic models, since they strive to re-
present what is known about the mechanisms which link their inputs to their outputs.
They are usually more complex (and therefore more data-intensive) than empirical
models, and do not necessarily give more accurate estimates for the current climate.
However, they have the advantage of being more reliable when extrapolating small
amounts beyond the data range for which they were developed. In most cases they are
able to predict the time course of the change as well as the steady-state solution (and
thus they are referred to as dynamic or transient models).
Bioclimatic models increasingly include some process-based relationships. For instance,
many of the vegetation distribution models are based on the water and energy balance
of plants rather than simply on annual precipitation, and use physiological limits rather
than arbitrary climatological limits (Friend et al., 1993).
There are some highly detailed physiologically-based growth models for monospecific,
even-aged plantation forestry stands. An example is the model developed by McMurtrie
et al. (1990) for Pinus radiata in Australia.
There is an important class of forest models which simulate the establishment, growth,
and death of a large number of individual trees within an area. They are typically
applied to mixed-species forests, since they can project the outcome, over time, of the
interaction of many different species. These are known as succession, patch, or gap
models (Shugart and West, 1980; Shugart, 1984). They are based on information about
the longevity, growth rate, and environmental requirements (such as shade tolerance) of
individual species. This information can be obtained from forest handbooks or expert
judgement in well-researched parts of the world, but may be hard to obtain for species-
rich forests in less well-studied countries. Succession models are especially useful for
estimating changes in species composition under altered disturbance regimes (such as
more or less frequent storms or fires). Since they explicitly follow the demography of
the trees, they are well-suited to transient analyses over a period of a few decades to a
century.
The theory underlying succession models is so fundamental that they can in principle be
applied to any forest; however, finding realistic parameter values to calibrate them for a
new situation, and data sets on species composition changes over long periods of time
for validating their output, is a major research task which can take several years.
Therefore, unless this information is already available, it is unlikely that succession
models can be used with confidence. Succession models, because they track thousands
of trees in thousands of forest stands, require powerful computing resources. Running
them for an entire country would require a supercomputer. In general, a stratified sub-
sample of plots is simulated, which can be achieved on a desktop computer. For an
example of a gap model applied in a country study, see Box 12.3.
Forest
12-11
Box 12.3
Using a gap model to estimate the rate of species composition
change in the forests of Estonia.
Two study sites were chosen in central and western Estonia, representing different climate and
forest types. The FORET model (Shugart, 1984) was set up for the two sites using locally-
determined parameters for 13 tree species, and run to simulate 500 years of forest develop-
ment under three climate scenarios. Under the current climate, the model reproduced the
observed patterns of succession at the sites, and projected a long-term composition similar to
that which occurred at the sites. Under warmer, drier conditions, Scots pine became dominant
after a period of 50 to 100 years. Under warmer, wetter conditions, Norway spruce dominated
after about 200 years. In both cases other species were prominent during the transition period.
Although succession models can predict forest productivity under current conditions, in
their simplest form they are unlikely to do so reliably for conditions which differ
markedly from the stands where the calibration data were collected. This is because
they are based on plant demography rather than on ecosystem energetics or nutrient
cycling. Biogeochemical models are probably more robust for projecting changes in
production and the carbon cycle of the forest under a changed environment, especially
where that change involves inadvertent fertilisation with CO2. Most biogeochemical
models simulate the water and nitrogen cycles to some degree, and use these cycles to
constrain a carbon budget derived from some representation of photosynthesis.
Biogeochemical models range greatly in complexity and focus. Models such as
MAESTRO (Wang and Jarvis, 1990; Jarvis, 1993) or BIOMASS (McMurtrie et al.,
1990) simulate the radiation regime in the forest canopy in great detail, and use it to
drive transpiration and photosynthesis. CENTURY (Parton et al., 1988) has very sim-
ple photosynthetic and transpiration routines, but models the transformation of nutrients
(especially nitrogen and phosphorus) in the soil in relatively great detail. TEM (Melillo
et al., 1993) treats the carbon and water cycle very simply, and as a consequence can be
applied almost everywhere; but the output includes little detail on forest products.
Forest-BGC (Running and Coughlan, 1988) is somewhere in between.
Most biogeochemical models include some way of varying the atmospheric CO2 con-
centration and nitrogen deposition rate (Martin, 1992; McGuire et al., 1993), and so are
essential for studying these aspects of global change, which occur simultaneously with
climate change. They can be used as transient models, but where the main time lags are
due to demographic processes rather than the slow turnover of nutrient pools, they will
not capture the dynamic response very accurately. The data requirements vary in both
type and amount with the complexity of the model. In general, biogeochemical models
are intermediate between bioclimatic models and succession models in terms of data
needs. Most require monthly precipitation and temperature and some information about
plant types (initial biomass and nutrient content) and soil type (texture, carbon and
nitrogen content). These data are obtainable for most sites with a modest research
effort. The more sophisticated models also require details of the canopy architecture,
photosynthetic parameters, and allocation patterns between leaves, wood, and roots,
which can be obtained only after an intensive research effort.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
12-12
There is an emerging class of hybrid model which attempts to marry the best features of
the bioclimatic, succession, and biogeochemical models (Comins and McMurtrie, 1993;
Friend et al., 1993). They are still under development, and consequently are not yet
widely available. When they do become available they will inevitably be relatively data-
intensive.
12.2.4.2 Economic models
Most economic models of the forest sector, or which include the forest sector, are
known as input-output models (Arthur and van Kooten, 1989; Rosenberg, 1993). These
divide the forest sector into a number of subsectors, each of which requires inputs in
given ratios from other subsectors or from sources outside the model, and produces
outputs for use in other subsectors or as model outputs. Examples of inputs are various
raw materials, capital, and labour. Outputs include products and wastes. In
transforming inputs into outputs, the subsector adds value to the product.
Dynamic economic models can also be applied to the forest sector. These models allow
the price of forest products to vary according to supply and demand, given certain
assumptions about the elasticity of the price curve. As a result of the changing relative
prices, different subsectors or resources are favoured over others. Examples of such
models are TAMM (Joyce et al., 1995) and GCTM (Peres-Garcia et al., 1995). Where
the biophysical changes in the forest sector are predicted to be large, it would be
advisable to use a dynamic economic model rather than an input-output model, given
that the quantity of timber reaching the market is likely to alter substantially, and thus
change the nature of the market.
12.2.4.3 Integrated models
Integrated models attempt to deal with biophysical processes and socio-economic
processes, and their interactions, simultaneously (Rosenberg, 1993). For instance, if
forest productivity goes down, the price of forest products will increase in compensa-
tion. A further meaning of integration is across sectors, preventing, for instance, the
agricultural and forest sectors from both occupying the same piece of land in a future
scenario. Although integrated modelling is obviously ideal, it is currently achieved by
sacrificing detail within the sub-modules. The IMAGE 2.0 model is an example
(Alcamo, 1994). It runs at a global scale, and therefore has little national-level resolu-
tion, but tries to capture some of the main interactions between the biological, socio-
economic, climate, and ocean systems. It does not explicitly handle forests as a sector,
but does model the distribution of forests.
Fully-integrated models are currently beyond the reach of most national assessments,
but some of the advantages can be had by applying stand-alone models within an
integrated, systematic framework where the outputs of one model become inputs to
another. An overall strategy for applying models systematically to the issue of global
change assessment in the forest sector is suggested:
Forest
12-13
1. Use a bioclimatic model to predict future steady-state forest distributions under a
range of plausible climate change scenarios.
2. Use historical analogues and life-history information to estimate how long it might
take for the forest boundary to migrate that distance, and use this information to
speculate about what may happen during the transition period and to modify the
steady-state prediction if it is unlikely to be reached in the assessment period.
3. Use a gap model, applied at the edge and middle of the current distribution of each
forest type, to predict species composition changes and the transient biomass
response under a change in the disturbance regime.
4. Use a biogeochemistry model to predict changes in productivity and carbon stocks
in each forest type, with and without the effects of elevated CO2 concentration (and,
where appropriate, nitrogen deposition).
5. Use an economic and demographic model to project the demand for forest products
and the land area which is likely to be available to satisfy the demand.
12.2.5 Testing the method
12.2.5.1 Feasibility studies
The first step in a feasibility study is a thorough synthesis of what is already known
about forest and climate in the study area, and in related areas. A recent review of the
topic will provide an entry point; this can be followed up by browsing recent editions of
journals which regularly publish on this topic. A search conducted on a CD-ROM
database such as the TREE-CD (Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau International) for
the keywords “forest” and “climate” is an efficient way of locating recent research. An
Internet search engine can be used with similar keywords to locate recent assessments.
Recent review articles provide an overview of the subject (e.g., see Gates, 1993). Local
or regional journals and local forest experts can provide a list of relevant work; much of
it may be in unpublished reports. Government offices and research institutes often have
a great deal of useful information, for example, a central statistical office, departments
of forestry and agriculture, and the meteorological service.
The next step is to define the forest types which occur in the study area, and then stra-
tify the study area by forest types and by zones of similar climate. A series of simple
climate change scenarios based on the regional output of GCMs could be used, for
instance, an increase in temperature of 1-4°C and an appropriate increase and decrease
in precipitation (15-20 percent is a realistic order). See Chapter 3 for details on climate
change scenarios. Simple bioclimatic models, regional analogies, and expert judgement
can provide qualitative statements about what might happen to forest extent and
productivity in each of the forest type/climate zone combinations. This is often most
effectively done by convening a workshop of four to eight experts drawn from a variety

of relevant fields such as forestry, ecology, and climatology. One way of summarising
the results is to record the estimated severity of impacts (rated on a scale of 1 to 3) in a
matrix. Table 12.2 gives an example. The row and column sums of the matrix give an
indication of which forest types and which impacts deserve most of the attention in the
main study; they do not constitute reliable estimates in their own right.

12.2.5.2 Data acquisition and compilation
The minimum data needed are listed in Table 12.3, and Table 12.4 lists the key varia-
bles driving forest impacts. If the minimum data set is not available for the study area,
then one of the coarse-resolution global data sets may be needed (for example, the
Global Ecosystems Database on CD-ROM from the National Geophysical Data Center
in Boulder, Colorado, USA). Sometimes the data exist, but are not in a form which can
be easily used. In this case a data collation or conversion project is needed before the
main assessment can begin. Where the data do not exist, and a long time series is not
necessary, it may be possible to collect new data in time to satisfy the needs of the
assessment.
12.2.5.3 Model testing
Once the main issues have been defined and the available data have been located, it is
possible to identify the types of models than can be used. Obtain an example of the
chosen models by writing to the owners of the model (a fee may be required to obtain a
copy), and attempt to calibrate and test it for a few sites. This will rapidly reveal what
data are needed, whether the model is appropriate or not, and the resources needed to do
a full analysis. Use the model to perform a sensitivity analysis. In its simplest form, this
is done by adjusting the values of the driving variables and site-specific parameters up
and down by small amounts (1, 2, 5, and 10 percent) to see what impact an error in the

data or assumptions has on the conclusions reached. This will act as a guide to the
quality of data needed (Frischlin et al., 1995).
Table 12.3 Minimum data needs.
Core data: needed for a basic
assessment and in several
advanced assessments
• 
A map of the current location of forests (broadly defined
to include all tree-rich ecosystems), by type, at 1:5M
scale, or finer.
• 
Current climate data for the forested and non-forested
area, expressed as gridded monthly surfaces of
precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature and
potential evaporation, at a grid scale of 0.5° or finer (a
rough guide to the appropriate resolution would be the
longitudinal and/or latitudinal range of the study area
divided by 100).
• 
The current output of the forest sector, in terms of the
value of wood products (in both the commercial and non-
commercial sectors) and other forest goods and services.
These data should preferably be at the scale of less than
the whole country — for instance, by district.

12.2.5.4 Indicators of change
Indicators of change which can be predicted from models and verified in the field
constitute a powerful model test and are an important way of building confidence in
your predictions. The problem lies in selecting indicators which are sensitive, easily
defined, observed, and interpreted, and have a high signal-to-noise ratio. Early and
unequivocal warning of change may be given by focusing on locations and processes
which are particularly sensitive to the climate. An example is the location of the tree
line, either on an altitudinal gradient or on a latitudinal gradient (Bonan and Sirois,
1992; Hogg, 1994). The same principle can be applied to looking at the location of the
limit of distribution of an individual species. Tree phenology (the dates on which key
physiological events occur, such as bud-break, flowering, fruit-set, and leaf-fall) is
typically co-ordinated in temperate plants by a combination of temperature and light
signals (Kramer, 1994; Sparks and Carey, 1995). Phenology is easily recorded, even by
volunteer networks, and in some cases may be amenable to remote sensing. The point is
not to use the plant as a surrogate thermometer (rather just use a thermometer), but to
understand and illustrate the biologically-integrated consequences of a set of linked
Forest
12-17
changes. Litter accumulation integrates several climatic and environmental effects
(Meentemeyer, 1978).
The location, spread, and intensity of tree diseases or pest outbreaks may be climate-
sensitive, but they are also sensitive to many other factors, including air pollution and
stand management, which complicate the interpretation of observations. Tree growth
rate, as recorded by annual growth rings, is a long-term indicator of growth conditions,
including climate.
12.2.6 Summary of methods
A brief overview of the methods which can be used is provided in Table 12.5.
12.3  Scenarios
The topic of scenarios in general is discussed in Chapters 2 and 3. There will typically
be a team developing scenarios for use by all the sector assessments. They will need to
know what the input data requirements are, in order to provide scenarios which are
specific for the forest sector, such as the projected future per capita timber use or the
planned growth in wood exports.
Even in the absence of climate change, the future of the forest sector is unlikely to be
exactly the same as the current state, due to changes in socio-economic factors and non-
climate variables such as acid deposition.
12.3.1 Climatological baseline
The dynamics of forest ecosystems are especially dependent on rare extreme events
such as wind storms and droughts, which are difficult to quantify accurately using a
short-term climate record. The record from which their frequency is estimated should be
as long as possible.
12.3.2 Socio-economic baseline
The socio-economic baseline includes documentation of the current extent and location
of the various forest types. Land cover maps are the most suitable source of this
information, since vegetation maps usually depict the “potential” vegetation (that which
is postulated to occur in the absence of human disturbance) rather than the “actual”
vegetation. Where land cover maps are not available, high resolution satellite images
and aerial photographs are the most reliable way of constructing them. Unverified land
cover statistics based on district- or national-level expert judgements are often
unreliable. A number of international and regional land cover exercises currently in
progress may provide data for the study area. The IGBP-DIS global 1 km land cover

project (Townshend, 1992) and the European Union TREES project (JRC, 1996) are
examples.

Many herbaria keep accurate records on the distribution of individual species. Addi-
tional information about the forest types, such as the soil (particularly the depth and
texture) or topographical situations under which they occur, may be useful in inter-
preting their distribution and predicting where the forests may occur in the future.
Other than climate and land use, the most important changes are the effects of the
steadily-increasing atmospheric CO2 levels and the consequences of air-borne pollution
in areas downwind of industrial and urban centres. Elevated CO2 concentration is
expected to increase photosynthesis and water use efficiency within forests (by up to 30
percent for doubled CO2), which may be manifest as an increase in growth rates if
sufficient nutrients are available (Wang and Polglase, 1995). Since the global atmos-
phere is relatively well-mixed, CO2 data from any of the global monitoring stations can
be used, as well as scenarios of increasing CO2 from the IPCC (see Chapter 3).
The deposition of nitrogen, which results mainly from the burning of fossil fuels and the
volatilisation of nitrogen from fertilised fields, also tends to increase net primary
production in a large region downwind of major source areas (Townsend et al., 1995).
In nitrogen-limited systems, this increase could be large. Globally, the growth-enhanc-
ing effect of nitrogen deposition is believed to be about one-half that of elevated CO2
(Schimel, 1995). If the deposition continues at high rates for long periods, and is ac-
companied by the deposition of sulphur (acid rain), it may eventually lead to ecosystem
degradation, tree death, and loss of carbon (Schulze et al., 1989). Nitrogen deposition
rates can be obtained from acid rain measuring networks, or they can be estimated by
combining knowledge of the nitrogen gas emission sources with dispersion and
deposition models. There are global estimated deposition fields of this sort (Galloway et
al., 1994).
High concentrations of O3 and SO2 can be detrimental to forest growth (McLaughlin
and Downing, 1995). These usually occur close to major urban and industrial centres,
especially where the regional topography and climatology allow pollutants to accumu-
late and be exposed to bright sunlight.
The long-term effects of nutrient depletion due to repeated wood harvest need to be
considered where harvests are frequent and constitute a large fraction of the biomass.
This is especially important in tropical countries, where the tree rotation is short and the
soils are inherently infertile.
Trends in the spread and severity of forest pests, diseases, weeds, and fires must also be
considered. Bear in mind that if such trends exist, they may be linked to subtle climate
changes.
The socio-economic baseline should contain a description of how the forests are
currently used and managed. How many people are currently engaged in forest enter-
prises, or depend on the forests for a living? Where do they live? What is the ownership
pattern (communal, leasehold, or freehold)? What is the location of roads, railways, and
other infrastructure which allow access to the forest resource? Information on other
land uses may also be relevant where they result in the clearing of forests or the creation
Forest
12-21
of new forests. An example of the former is the clearing of forests to create pastures or
croplands; an example of the latter is the set-aside policy in developed countries where
land is removed from agriculture and allowed to revert to forest.
Forest management includes the harvest policy (clear-felling or selective extraction),
rotation length, species planted, regulations governing where forests may be planted or
harvested, and the use of fertilisers and pesticides.
The current demand for forest products must be quantified, in both the informal and
formal sectors. The latter typically includes a within-country and export component.
Historical data showing the trend in demand and in demand-influencing factors such as
population and economic growth help to guide socio-economic scenario generation.
A socio-economic baseline study is very useful, but should not be allowed to consume a
disproportionate fraction of the resources at the expense of producing well-considered,
coherent scenarios.
12.3.4 Limits of predictability
The forest sector is characterised by a relatively long planning horizon, imposed by the
fact that trees require many years between germination and harvest. Substantial changes
in the location or species composition of natural and semi-natural forests will probably
require several centuries. Changes in the location and species composition of short-
rotation plantation forests, on the other hand, can take place within as little as a decade
or two. It is not possible to develop reliable climate and socio-economic scenarios for a
period of several centuries. Predictions of changes in these factors should not be based
on a single run of a very sophisticated model, since the long-range input data are
speculative. A more robust strategy would be to use a relatively simple model which
allows multiple runs with a variety of scenarios. Historical analogues can provide a
picture of the magnitude and type of change that can be expected.
Changes in forest productivity can occur within months or years in response to climate,
environment, or management changes. The formal forest sector relies on large fixed
investments such as roads, sawmills, and pulp mills, which have an investment lifetime
of several decades. Scenarios spanning 20 to 100 years are reasonable for assessments
of forest productivity.
12.3.5 Point-in-time or continuous scenarios
Given the relatively slow response rate of many forest processes, continuous (transient)
scenarios should be used rather than point-in-time (equilibrium) scenarios wherever
possible (Solomon, 1986). When continuous scenarios are used, it may nevertheless be
helpful to express the results at a few discrete points in time.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
12-22
12.4  Autonomous adaptation
Autonomous adaptations are the responses to climate change that will happen without
policy interventions. All ecological, social, and economic systems have some degree of
inherent adaptability, or they would not survive. The chances of autonomous ad-
justment are good if the climate change is very gradual relative to the inherent rate of
change in the system and to changes which have occurred during the evolution of the
system. The climate change which is anticipated to occur in the coming century is
considerably more rapid than climate changes which have occurred in the past. The
potential for autonomous change in the ecological aspects of the forest sector is
therefore limited.
Forestry enterprises routinely adjust the species, cultivars, and areas which they plant
and harvest in response to market supply and demand signals. In tropical countries,
where the rotation length is short, these decisions may be able to keep up with a rapidly-
changing climate. In temperate and boreal forests, where trees may take a hundred years
or more to reach harvest size, the current market may not send useful information about
future supply and demand.
Tactical decisions are required to follow shifts in the optimum growing areas for
forests, because this requires the building of expensive infrastructure such as mills and
roads. This infrastructure would be expected to have an economic life of several
decades, and would not be expected to be moved as a matter of routine.
The forest assessment should examine each of the impacts resulting from climate
change and pose the question of to what degree would the ecosystem, social, or eco-
nomic system be able to adjust to this impact without assistance from the outside. Only
impacts where the capacity for autonomous adjustment is thought to be inadequate to
match the rate of change should be carried forward to the next section.
12.5  Planned adaptation
Planned adaptation is defined here as those responses which require deliberate policy
decisions. Note that policy is made not only by governments, but at many other levels
as well, including supra-national (such as the United Nations) and sub-national levels
(such as the management teams of forest-industry corporations).
Adaptation strategies will usually be suggested by the analysis of impacts. Each
adaptation strategy can be assessed by following these steps.
12.5.1 Define the objectives of adaptation
The forest sector could have a variety of objectives in undertaking an adaptation
strategy. To name a few, they could be to maintain a given level or value of production,
to provide a certain number of livelihoods, or to preserve a particular set of species.
Forest
12-23
The sector will frequently have several simultaneous objectives, or different sub-sectors
may have different objectives. It is unlikely that all these objectives will be perfectly
compatible: some degree of prioritisation of trade-off is inevitable. National objectives
may override forest-sector objectives; for instance, a loss of forestry jobs may in some
countries be more than compensated by an increase in agricultural employment.
For objectives to be useful it must be possible to measure their success. This is done by
defining one or more evaluation criteria. For instance, if the objective is to maintain
biodiversity, the criterion might be the fraction of the area contained in formally
conserved areas.
12.5.2 Specify the climatic impacts and locations of greatest
importance
The scope of the analysis can be reduced if it can be restricted to the climatic impacts
and locations most in need of adaptation. The impact assessment will have indicated
which components of the forest sector are most at risk, or where the greatest beneficial
impacts are likely. For instance, it may be a particular forest type, or a particular
geographical area, or an industry based on a particular forest product. The adaptation
strategy should focus on these subsectors.
12.5.3 Identify adaptation options
The purpose of the climate change impacts assessment is not only to provide warning of
potential threats but also to offer constructive options which will minimise the costs and
maximise the benefits of change. This list of options needs to be as comprehensive and
detailed as is practical. The following five general types of adaptation may act as a
guide to what to look for.
1. Change the species or varieties planted and harvested.
2. Allow the size of the sector to decrease or increase, for instance by shifting land
into or out of agriculture or other uses.
3. Increase the efficiency with which forest raw materials are converted to forest
products.
4. Shift the geographical location of the industry to match the area of optimum
potential.
5. Change the product mix to utilise new species or size classes; for instance, by
producing particle boards instead of sawn timber.
Forest examples could include the planting of tree cultivars which are more tolerant to
changes in temperature or drought, increased investment in fire prevention, and control
of the spread of new diseases.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
12-24
Small decreases in forest productivity may be tolerable to the sector, especially if there
is advance warning. The industry could adapt by downsizing, by increasing its
processing efficiency to compensate for the loss, or by substituting raw material inputs
grown locally with those from elsewhere.
This includes all measures to share the loss beyond the sector or region where it has
occurred. For instance, financial assistance from governments to assist in the relocation
of forestry enterprises shares the cost across all taxpayers.
A shift in the species harvested represents a within-sector change of activity. Replace-
ment of forest by agriculture would be a change of activities between sectors.
The location of forest sector activities may need to move to follow the areas of optimum
tree production. This has implications for the location of costly fixed infrastructure
such as sawmills and pulp mills. The cost of transporting timber products from the
point of growth to the market is usually a significant component of forest enterprise
viability.
12.5.4 Examine the constraints
Forestry is a relatively long-term activity because of the fundamental biological con-
straints imposed by the growth rate of the trees and the economic constraints imposed
by large fixed investments. There are ecological constraints on where forests can grow,
determined principally by the interaction of climate and soil. Within the area of
ecological potential, it may not be feasible to establish forests everywhere because of
the presence of competing land uses such as agriculture, conserved land, and urban
settlement. Some forest sector workers have specialised skills which cannot be applied
in other sectors without retraining. Some human communities in forested regions have a
culture which is deeply embedded in their location and activity, and cannot be moved
without great social disruption.
12.5.5 Quantify measures and formulate alternate strategies
Each proposed action must be measured against the objectives set for adaptation, using
the evaluation criteria defined for the objective. It is important to assess the actions
according to several criteria and to keep in mind the uncertainty associated with the
impact scenarios. The minimum criteria should be cost, robustness, and effectiveness.
The robustness of an action is its ability to remain beneficial under a wide range of
scenarios, and its effectiveness is the probability of achieving the objective.
The method of evaluation will almost always involve models of some kind. Usually they
will be the same models that were used in impact assessment, but now applied as
simulation games to search for an optimal solution. For example, forest gap models
could be run for existing forest areas using different species to estimate future pro-
ductivity if the adaptation option is to change the species planted or harvested. If the
Forest
12-25
adaptation is to shift the location, forest productivity models could be run with the same
species, but in new locations. Where the adaptation involves changing the land use,
economic models may be needed to understand the costs and benefits as well as
production models specific to the future land use.
12.6  Summary and implications
Forests and the human activities which depend on them are sensitive to climate change
for two main reasons: the biological processes which underlie their distribution,
composition, and productivity are under strong climatic control; and the time scale of
adjustment of both the biological and socio-economic systems involved in forestry is of
the order of decades. The changes imposed by rapid land use and land cover changes in
forest regions, and by the rising carbon dioxide concentration of the atmosphere, are
factors which act additively and interactively with climate change to increase pressure
on forest resources, but make the analysis more difficult.
The state of knowledge of the response of forest ecosystems to climate change is far
from perfect, but a basic toolkit of techniques can be applied anywhere in the world to
get at least an indication of the direction and probable magnitude of change for a given
climate scenario. At this stage the uncertainties in assessing the impacts of climate
change on forests are not substantially greater than the uncertainties in the climate
change scenarios themselves, and in particular in the estimates of changes in
precipitation, which is critical for forestry function. At a local or regional scale, the
models and information available in some parts of the world are relatively sophisticated.
It is important to understand and communicate both the inherent natural variability of
forests and the uncertainty of predictions, as well as the model estimates, while not
unnecessarily obscuring the main issues in the mind of the reader.
The basic analytic toolkit consists of bioclimatic models for defining the climatic en-
velope of forest types, and thus potential shifts in distribution and composition, and
productivity models for estimating their performance under different climates. Coupled
to these are models of the economic dependencies within the forest sector and between
the forest and other sectors. All the models can range from the purely statistical to those
with a high level of process detail. As yet there are few truly integrated models of
forestry within the context of global change, including its human dimensions; those that
exist either are regional or have insufficient detail on forests to be helpful.  Pragmatism
will drive the decision on which models to use. Several different approaches to the same
problem are recommended. Ancillary data and insights can be had from regional inter-
comparisons (i.e., look to a region which currently has a climate similar to that
predicted for the target region, and see what happens there) and from paleo-ecological
data.
It is a good strategy to undertake an impact study in two phases, spending a fifth to a
third of the effort and resources in a “scoping” phase, based on simple models, expert
UNEP/IVM Handbook
12-26
judgement, and readily-available information, which serves to define the handful of key
issues which require more intensive study.
There are strong two-way links between forest impacts and several other sectors, sum-
marised in Table 12.6. This alone necessitates a two-phase approach, to allow the feed-
forward and feedback processes to be taken into account.

13.1  Nature of the problem
Biodiversity is short for biological diversity, the variety of life and its associated pro-
cesses. As defined by Hunter (1996, p. 19), it is "the diversity of life in all of its forms,
and at all levels of organisation." The term has been criticised as too all-inclusive, but it
does succinctly embody the idea of the extraordinary diversity and complexity of life on
earth. It includes all organisms, their genetic variation, and the diversity of ways in
which they interact with each other and their physical environment
As summarised in the Convention on Biological Diversity, biodiversity has intrinsic
value. It also provides many direct and indirect benefits to human populations:
• 
Maintenance of life-sustaining systems.
• 
Possibilities for future evolution of the biosphere.
• 
Ecological, genetic, social, economic, scientific, educational, cultural, recreational,
and aesthetic services for human populations. These services range from harvesting

of individual wildlife species, to production of clean water and air, to aesthetic
wilderness values, to global biogeochemical cycling.
• 
Genetic resources of critical importance for meeting food, health and other needs of
the world population.
• 
Biological resources that support traditional activities of many indigenous and local
communities.
13.1.1 Important climate change impacts in the biodiversity
sector
Recent reviews on the impacts of a changing climate on biodiversity include Malcolm
and Markham (1997) and Walker and Steffen (1997). Conclusions from these studies
include the following:
• 
Species will respond differently to climate change because of differences in com-
petitive abilities, migration rates, and responses to disturbance, and in other ways.
Thus, new combinations of species will arise. This “reorganisation” in species
composition has as yet unknown consequences for ecosystem functioning.
• 
Many species may be able to disperse fast enough to keep up with projected climate
change provided they can disperse through continuous, relatively undisturbed,
natural ecosystems. This emphasises the important consequences of fragmentation
of natural ecosystems.
• 
Depending on the rate of climate change, other niche parameters may not change at
same rate as climate, resulting in novel habitat combinations that species have not
experienced before.
• 
Changes in the relative timing of seasonal events during the yearly cycle may have
strong negative impacts for many species, especially migratory ones.
• 
Invasion of alien species into natural ecosystems is an increasing problem world-
wide which is likely to be exacerbated by climate change. Disturbance and dieback
will probably increase as more long-lived organisms (trees) are farther from their
optimal environmental envelopes and subject to increasing pressure from land use
change. An increase in disturbance will lead to more ecosystems in early
successional states, resulting in a generally “weedier”, structurally simpler bio-
sphere with fewer systems in a more ecologically complex, old-growth state.
• 
Markedly different effects of climate change on species composition will occur
within individual landscapes because of local effects of soil, land use, and topo-
graphic variation.
• 
Reductions in the area of “cold-adapted” ecosystems such as arctic and alpine
ecosystems are expected, with negative impacts for arctic and alpine species.

13.1.2 Goals of an assessment
The goal of a biodiversity assessment is to evaluate the potential impact of climate
change on biodiversity attributes, including structural attributes such as species and
genetic diversity, and functional attributes such as ecosystem properties and processes.
The chapter outlines management options that can be used to adapt to climate change
and (if possible) avoid some of its negative impacts. A comprehensive assessment will
include both structural and functional approaches.
13.1.3 The study area
The study area typically consists of the lands of the national territory. However,
because species and ecosystems frequently extend beyond national borders, a sub-
continental, continental, or even inter-continental approach is sometimes necessary. The
spatial and temporal resolution of the assessment will in many cases be determined by
the resolution of the required data sets. The ultimate utility and acceptability of the
results may be influenced by levels of co-operation at national, regional, and
international levels.
13.2  An array of methods
Because of the diverse scope for climate change impact and adaptation assessment in
the biodiversity sector, this section follows a hierarchical approach that allows the
assessment to be tailored to the specific needs of the user. The classic species-
community-ecosystem hierarchy is followed, and the emphasis shifts from the structural
to the functional attributes of biodiversity. For some users, the impacts on a single
species may be of interest, perhaps because of its special economic or ecological value.
Section 13.2.1 focuses on methods that can be applied to individual species. These
include techniques to assess vulnerability to environmental change in general, as well as
methods that can be used to examine the implications of particular climate change
scenarios. Approaches include the use of expert judgement, climate “envelope”
modelling, dynamic population modelling, and analogue and monitoring studies. For
other users, a group of species might form the focus of the analysis, as for example in
assessing the potential impacts of climate change on wildlife species richness. Section
13.2.2 outlines methods that can be applied to groups of species, defined either
according to species composition or based on community characteristics such as species
richness. At the highest level in the hierarchy, the purpose of the analysis may be to
examine the potential impacts of climate change on ecosystem properties and processes
such as biogeochemical cycling. Section 13.2.3 describes several techniques that can be
used to assess climate change impacts on ecosystems and to model possible changes in
their distributions, properties, and processes.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
13-4
13.2.1 Impacts on species
13.2.1.1 Vulnerability to change
The rate of climate change in the next 100 years is expected to be higher than during
many periods in the past (Crowley and North, 1988; Crowley, 1990; Hinckley and
Tierney, 1992; Crowley and Kim, 1995), hence a major threat to species and ecosys-
tems may be the change itself (Peters and Darling, 1985; Peters and Lovejoy, 1992).
One approach to impact assessment, therefore, is to try and determine beforehand which
species are sensitive to change in the broadest sense. For example, Dennis (1993)
assumed that species with narrow resource/habitat requirements and inflexible biology
were most vulnerable to change and hence would be most threatened by climate change.
A second approach similarly avoids uncertainty about climate change and focuses on
species or ecosystems already in danger. The reasoning here is that organisms and
ecosystems already threatened by human activities may be more vulnerable to the
additional stress of a changing climate (Peters, 1990; Markham and Malcolm, 1996).
Millsap et al. (1990) provided an example of this type of analysis. They conducted a
ranking of species vulnerability based on criteria such as biological vulnerability, gaps
in knowledge about population status, and current management investments. Mkanda
(1996) applied the Millsap et al. (1990) technique to assess potential vulnerability to
climate change of several ungulates in Lengwe National Park, Malawi.
Implementation
Dennis (1993) designed his method with butterflies in mind. If required, expert judge-
ment can be used to the rework the categories so that they can be applied to other taxa.
In both this and the Millsap et al. (1990) method, each species is assigned a score for
each variable and the scores are summed across groupings of the variables. Sums can
subsequently be ranked, grouped, or mapped to prioritise adaptation and management
investments (e.g., Millsap et al., 1990; Figure 13.1). The scores are meaningful only in
a relative sense, i.e., in comparison to scores from other species. Therefore, it is
suggested that several taxa be scored simultaneously.
Data and computational requirements
Because the Dennis (1993) and Millsap et al. (1990) methods require information on
geographic distributions, they are implicitly sub-continental or continental in scope.
Additional requirements include information on population numbers, habitat and dietary
requirements, and reproductive characteristics and seasons. In a few cases, data from
manipulative or analogue experiments are desired. Ultimately, the methods are very
flexible with regards to data requirements. Variables can be added or modified, and if
needed, dropped from the analysis.
These techniques do not incorporate climate scenarios. Instead, they attempt to assess
overall vulnerability regardless of the direction of climate change.

as determined by Millsap et al. (1990). Range maps of taxa with
biological scores ≥24 were overlaid and scores were summed
where ranges overlapped.
Advantages and limitations
The techniques are relatively easy to perform; they require relatively unsophisticated
input information, and potential impacts can be assessed regardless of the exact nature
of future climate change. However, generality is achieved at the expense of realism. All
variables are assumed to be equally important and any interaction among variables is
ignored. Also, the vulnerability scores are themselves relative measures and are useful
only when compared with other scores. On the positive side, these screening techniques
are of value irrespective of the eventual course of climate change because they help to
identify species that are already in trouble, or are likely to be trouble in the face of
additional negative human influences. Independent of climate change assessment, they
are a useful addition to local conservation efforts.
13.2.1.2 Expert judgement
This common approach is a relatively simple way to generate ideas and discussion
about potential climate change impacts. Typically, a climate change scenario is as-
sumed, the opinion of experts as to impacts on the species of interest is solicited, and a
workshop or other forum is organised to present and discuss results. Sometimes, expert
judgement is collated or organised in some predetermined fashion. For example,
Herman and Scott (1993) assessed the potential impacts of climate change on selected
vertebrate groups in eastern Canada by adopting a specific climate change scenario,
enumerating resultant changes in the physical environment that were of potential
importance to the organisms, and soliciting expert judgement to score the importance of
the changes.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
13-6
An example of an even more quantitative setting for incorporating expert knowledge is
provided by the Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) technique developed by the US Fish and
Wildlife Service (1981). A software package enables an expert or group of experts to
create a simple model that describes how features in the environment act together in
determining overall habitat suitability for a wildlife species. Future scenarios of
environmental change subsequently can be used as input to investigate changes in
habitat quality (see also Chapter 14).
Implementation
 Prior to soliciting expert opinion, several choices must be made: the taxa of interest, the
climate change scenarios to be used, and the methods to be used to organise or present
the resulting information. In the HSI system, specific steps are undertaken to create a
model: (1) taxa and cover types are chosen, (2) important life requisites and other
limiting factors of the species are identified, (3) single-variable models between
environmental characteristics and habitat suitability are developed, and (4) relationships
among the single-parameter models are established. Once an HSI model has been
constructed, various types of analyses are possible: habitat conditions under baseline
and future climate can be compared, sensitivity analyses can be used to identify
important habitat features, impacts of management and adaptation strategies can be
assessed, etc. Brody et al. (1989) gave an example of an HSI model that is integrated
with forest succession models, and Laymon and Barrett (1986) provided guidelines for
model development and testing.
 The principal tasks for the co-ordinator of an expert judgement study are to identify and
recruit the experts, specify the climate change scenarios and make them available to the
experts, establish goals and directives for the experts, and decide on methods to
organise the resulting information.
Data and computational requirements
 From the point of view of the assessment co-ordinator, this is the least data-intensive
method. Often, the most computationally-intensive task is to provide climate scenarios.
 The HSI model is available as shareware written in BASIC (available from Computer
Specialist, National Ecology Research Center, National Biological Service, 4512
McMurry Avenue, Fort Collins, CO 80535-3400 USA, 303-226-9263), and will run on
virtually any microcomputer. Requirements for input data will vary from species to
species.
In the HSI approach, climate variables may number among the environmental parame-
ters used to model habitat suitability, hence integrating HSI simulations and quantita-
tive climate models will be straightforward. In many cases, however, climate will
determine habitat suitability indirectly through its action on other environmental para-
meters. For example, island area is an important measure of nesting and roosting habi-
tat suitability for the roseate spoonbill (Lewis, 1983) and climate may indirectly influ-
ence island area through its effects on sea levels. Several approaches are available in
Biodiversity: Species, Communities, and Ecosystems
13-7
these cases. One is to model the relationship between climate and the parameter of
interest. For example, based on sea level and shore type, island area can be estimated
for different scenarios of sea level rise. Another is to use expert judgement to enumerate
possible climate change effects on the environmental parameters, and use HSI
sensitivity analyses to identify which of the possibilities might seriously affect habitat
suitability.
Examples
Herpetofauna in eastern Canada
 Herman and Scott (1992) focused on eastern Canadian vertebrates thought to be highly
susceptible to climate change (salamanders, shrews, and turtles). A regional climate
change scenario based on consensus from global circulation models was developed; it
assumed that summer precipitation would decrease and winter temperature and pre-
cipitation (especially rainfall) would increase. To assess climatic sensitivity, a list of
life history characteristics was developed and experts scored the sensitivity of each
characteristic to the hypothesised climate changes. The analysis suggested that shrews
would be very sensitive to changes in winter conditions, such as increased winter
flooding and reduced snow and ice cover.
Ungulate populations in Malawi
Mkanda (1996) used the HSI approach to evaluate nyala (Tragelaphus angasi) habitat
in Lengwe National Park, Malawi, under three climate change scenarios. The three
general circulation models (GCMs) used were the Canadian Climate Centre (CCC)
model (Boer et al., 1992), the GFD3 model from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamic
Laboratory (Manabe and Wetherald, 1987), and the United Kingdom Meteorological
Office UK89 model (Mitchell et al., 1989). The importance of several variables (in-
cluding total annual precipitation, number of preferred browse/grass species, mean
annual temperature, and distance to water) in determining habitat suitability was
developed based on expert judgement, and an overall measure of habitat suitability was
based on the geometric mean of the individual relationships. To estimate changes in
habitat suitability under the climate change scenarios, the effects of changes in annual
precipitation and mean temperature on the individual habitat variables were modelled.
Habitat suitability declined under every climate change scenario, sugges-ting that
climate change would further endanger populations of this rare antelope.
Advantages and limitations
 The compilation of expert judgement can be very useful if the biology of the species is
well known. Additionally, the mere act of bringing together specialists from diverse
disciplines can stimulate new approaches and ideas. Of course, if a particular scenario
is assumed from the start and it later becomes necessary to consider a different sce-
nario, expert judgement must be solicited again. Also, the expert judgement method
UNEP/IVM Handbook
13-8
suffers from a lack of objectivity: different experts will give different judgements as to
climate impacts.
 Although HSI model creation is very flexible, the models are descriptive of complex
relationships. Interactions among habitat variables and dynamic responses to change are
excluded (for example, feedback relationships between environmental variables and
abundance are ruled out). The focus is on pattern instead of process. The utility of the
models in predicting species-habitat relationships is thus seriously compromised, and
perhaps as a result, the models are rarely tested or refined. In many cases, habitat
relationships measured in one part of a species range do not hold true in other parts, and
as a result HSI models may give erroneous predictions when applied to new geographic
areas. From a climate change perspective, the HSI models suffer an additional
drawback. Variation in climate may directly affect abundance, but in many cases the
influence is indirect, through its effect on other habitat parameters. For example, a
change in climate may influence habitat indirectly through its effect on browse quality
and quantity. Typically, HSI models ignore these underlying indirect causes. In these
cases, climate change scenarios can be incorporated only by making additional as-
sumptions about the way in which climate interacts with the habitat parameters of
interest. On the positive side, HSI assumptions are explicit and the simplicity of the
software allows users to easily create models that may capture important elements of
habitat suitability. As usual, simplicity is both an asset and a liability.
13.2.1.3 Climate envelopes and profiles
The use of climate envelopes and profiles capitalises on the fact that the geographic
distributions of many species are highly correlated with climate. In some cases, the
correlation may reflect physiological limits: the species’ fundamental niche
(Hutchinson, 1957). In others, climate variables may be correlates of other causative
factors (MacArthur, 1972; Root, 1988a, 1988b; Sykes et al., 1996). The potential
impacts of a changing climate are investigated by comparing the current geographic
distribution with future distributions under one or more climate change scenarios.
Implementation
 The concept is similar to the HSI approach in that environmental variables are used to
model the suitability of a site for a species. In this case, however, only climate data are
used. Two basic approaches can be distinguished, reflecting the distinction between a
species’ fundamental and realised niches (physiological limits to growth and
reproduction versus observed niches). In the first approach, climate-based physiological
limits are measured and modelled in the laboratory or field. Once empirical
relationships have been established, potential geographic shifts in the physiological
range can be compared between baseline and future climate scenarios (e.g., Johnston
and Schmitz, 1997). In the second approach, a statistical model is created that estimates
the geographic range based on the climate variables. Several techniques may be used to
develop the model, including simple tabulation of climate statistics (Bennett et al.,
1991; Morse et al., 1993), logistic regression (Price 1995), and discriminant analysis
Biodiversity: Species, Communities, and Ecosystems
13-9
(Rogers and Williams, 1994; Rogers, 1996; Malcolm, 1996). The statistical model is
subsequently re-applied to the data to define the current climate envelope, which can
then be compared with future envelopes under changed climatic conditions. A third
hybrid technique has also been developed: equations that relate plant physiology to
climate are defined a priori and distributional information subsequently is used to
parameterise the equations (e.g., Huntley et al., 1995; Sykes et al., 1996).
 In all these approaches, future distributions are after conditions have equilibrated. The
species is assumed to have somehow reached its new location. Thus, the analysis does
not provide information on how far or fast it can move in reality. Instead, the approach
is useful in assessing the amount and potential distribution of change (Huntley et al.,
1995). For example, Huntley et al. (1995) suggested that the species most affected by
climate change would be those whose current and future distributions showed no
overlap.
 It should be kept in mind that the statistical and hybrid techniques are correlative and
not causative. The usual caveat of statistical modelling applies: as more variables are
included in the model, the fit of the model improves (that is, the geographic distribution
is better described), but the model increasingly relies on spurious relationships. To take
the extreme case, if one has as many climate variables as localities, it is possible to
devise a model that perfectly distinguishes sites where a species does and does not
occur, even if there is no correlation between the species' distribution and climate in the
first place. A climate scenario might project extinction across the entire species range
simply because of the new combination of climate values at each locality. For these
reasons, models should be based on some "best" subset of the original climate variables
(one of the rationales for the hybrid approach). As a rule of thumb, several statistical
models should be constructed, including a simple one that uses only a few of the best
predictors. The inclusion of extraneous, non-predictive variables may lead to spurious
results and is not recommended. An additional refinement is to use multivariate
techniques to identify discrete "climate subspecies" (should they exist) and create
separate profiles for each.
 Because distributional boundaries are required to derive the statistical and hybrid
models, the entire geographic range of the species should be used. Thus, although
analysis of final results may be at a national level, determination of the predictive model
in most cases must be at a sub-continental or even continental scale.
Data and computational requirements
 In the first approach, physiological relationships and current and future climate sce-
narios are required. In the second, in addition to the climate scenarios, the geographic
distribution of the species is required. As a rule of thumb, climate information from a
minimum of 30 sites within the species’ range should be contrasted with data from at
least as many points outside of the range. Primary data from meteorological stations
within the region of interest are preferred; however, global grids of mean monthly
temperature and precipitation can be used. Conveniently, baseline and GCM scenarios
have been made available at the same scale of resolution for large regions (see Chapter
UNEP/IVM Handbook
13-10
3). The collection and compilation of numerous climate variables and statistics is
encouraged because it increases the chances of finding a strong association between
climate and the geographic distribution of interest.
 Because the predictive models make direct use of climate data, climate scenarios can be
easily incorporated. Of course, baseline and climate change scenarios must include the
same set of climate variables.
Examples
An example of the use of discriminant analysis is presented in Box 13.1.
Advantages and limitations
 Provided that the required data sets and software are available, climate envelope anal-
yses are relatively easy to perform. They can be a useful tool in several types of anal-
ysis:
• 
Model projections under baseline conditions can be mapped to test for corres-
pondence with observed distributions. This technique can locate previously
unknown populations of a species (e.g., Bennett et al., 1991).
• 
Potential distributions under climate change scenarios can be overlaid with land-use
maps to identify potential areas of resource conflict.
• 
Models can be created for several species in a region to investigate possible
changes in biodiversity (Section 13.2.2.1).
• 
Knowledge about climate associations can provide insight into the biology of a
species and can be incorporated in habitat suitability analyses (Section 13.2.1.2).
• 
Historical range shifts can be used to validate models.
A key assumption of the statistical method is that the current distribution of the species
is in equilibrium with climate. Thus, species that are not at equilibrium with climate
must be modelled with caution (see Sykes et al., 1996). Examples include species that
are currently expanding their geographic ranges, species whose distributions are
critically influenced by non-ecological factors (for example, mountain ranges or other
geographic barriers), and species whose geographic distributions have been
significantly modified by human activities. Whenever possible, historical distributions
should be used, i.e., distributions that pre-date important human impacts. Ideally,
geographic distributions should be from the same period as the climate baseline
scenario.

Example: Use of discriminant analysis in climate envelope
modelling
Rogers (1996) used discriminant analysis to model the current and potential future geographic
distribution of a widespread species of tsetse fly (Glossina morsitans) in southern Africa.
Tsetse flies transmit human and animal trypanosomiasis, causing sleeping sickness in
humans and nagana in domestic animals, both of which are generally fatal unless treated.
Large areas in Africa are threatened by one or other of these diseases, which drastically
reduce agricultural productivity and critically influence the dynamics between human and
wildlife populations.
Distributional data were digitised from published maps and climate data layers included mean,
maximum, minimum, and standard deviation of monthly averages of eight variables (mean
temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, precipitation, potential evapo-
transpiration, vapour pressure, cloud cover, and windspeed). A series of reliable training sites
of 200 sites of vector absence and 400 of vector presence were chosen to calculate the
discriminant function. Of the full set of climate variables (i.e., 32), 10 were selected in order of
importance in distinguishing between presence and absence centroids. This was decided by
choosing each variable in turn on the basis of the increase it provided in Mahalanobis distance
(D2) between the two centroids.
New maps were created using three climate change scenarios: UKMO (Murphy and Mitchell,
1995), OSU (Schlesinger and Zhao 1989), and CCC (McFarlene et al., 1992).
The climate change scenarios showed losses in the north-western part of the range, with fewer
and more scattered gains, sometimes to the east and west (see figure). The change was
attributed to the overriding importance of changes in temperature and evapotranspiration in
determining the distribution of the species. Rogers (1996) noted that although the model relies
on correlation instead of causation, given our weak understanding of vector population dyna-
mics, most predictions must be based on this sort of analysis. He also noted that it is an
over-simplification to conclude that the maps show future distributions, because of the lack of
consideration of the relationship between the pace of climate change and the dispersal ability
of the vector.

 The statistical techniques rely entirely on patterns of correlation and as such may not
identify key processes that drive responses to climate change (Davis et al., 1998).
Under both approaches, a host of potentially important limiting factors are ignored,
such as species interactions (competition, predation, and parasitism) and soil para-
meters. Also, baseline and future climate data sets often do not include information on
extreme climatic events, which can be fundamentally important in limiting distributions.
Sykes et al. (1996) call for increased use of field experiments to determine physiological
limits, so that hybrid models can more closely approximate physiological models, and
so that differences between fundamental and realised niches can be empirically
investigated.
 These models are equilibrium descriptions of a very dynamic process. They do not
provide information on the ability of a species to move with climate change. As a final
limitation of the approach, accurate geographic distributions are available for few
organisms, especially tropical ones.
13.2.1.4 Dynamic models
 Several models have been developed that model tree community dynamics within forest
stands (e.g., Shugart, 1984; see Chapter 12); unfortunately, they usually do not
incorporate the spatial component required to model changes in species distributions.
Outside of this literature, models that explicitly model the dynamics of individual
species in response to climate change are rare.
 There are, however, a number of dynamic models that address issues associated with
climate change, such as habitat destruction, dispersal, and cycles of drought or other
short-term weather patterns. These models provide an indication of both the difficulties
and rewards of future modelling efforts. For example, Tilman et al. (1997) explore the
effects of habitat destruction on plant communities and suggest that the most abundant
species (which are also the poorest dispersers) may be among the first species to be
driven extinct by habitat destruction. McKelvey et al. (1993) use the case of the
northern spotted owl in North America to investigate conservation planning for species
in fragmented landscapes. Dunning et al. (1995) review spatially explicit population
models and their potential uses, and Ruskelshaus et al. (1997) caution how sensitive
such models can be to poor data on dispersal characteristics. Starfield and Bleloch
(1991) show how an animal species at the limits of its range might struggle to persist
under adverse weather conditions and hypothesise that behaviours that benefit a species
in prime habitat might actually be debilitating at the margin.
 Forest gap models (Chapter 12) and other forest stand models can be used to model
forested habitats (see Section 13.2.1.2 for an example). However, habitat quality and
quantity are increasingly being determined by direct human management. Thus, future
changes in habitat will be dictated in part by human responses to climate change. These
responses may significantly alter existing management regimes (whether by design or
not) and lead to the emergence of new zones or types of wildlife/human conflicts
(Dublin et al., 1995). Therefore, in addition to the direct and indirect effects of climate
change on species and their habitat, a comprehensive assessment must consider likely
Biodiversity: Species, Communities, and Ecosystems
13-13
human responses to climate change, and consequent changes in management regimes
and conflicts.
13.2.1.5 Monitoring
Monitoring is an important research priority, both for biodiversity conservation (Article
7, United Nations Convention on Biodiversity) and because plant and animal
populations serve as barometers of ecosystem integrity. Extinctions of species in many
cases reduce the capacity of an ecosystem to respond to additional changes and thus
may jeopardise the future ability of the system to provide useful services to human
populations. In the final analysis, losses of species indicate inappropriate and, quite
likely, dangerous management practices. From a climate change perspective, monitoring
is required to establish current population levels and distributional limits, and to detect
climate-induced change that is already under way.
Techniques for monitoring populations and their habitats vary greatly from one group
of organisms to another. A few examples of the many field studies that have increased
our understanding of the role of climate in natural systems are listed in Table 13.1.

13.2.1.6 Analogue studies
Understanding the past responses of natural populations to spatial and temporal climate
variability provides important insights into the possible effects of future climate change.
These analogue studies provide information on the kinds of climate changes that have
influenced resources of interest in the past. Our ability to detect and respond to global
climate change is improved with an increased understanding of the present- day role of
climate in natural systems.

Examples
Deer-caribou winter distributions in Nova Scotia
Winter snow depth affects the distribution of many mammals at both local and regional
scales (Formozov, 1946; Telfer and Kelsall, 1984). Ungulates differ in their
morphological and behavioural adaptations to snow, and current distributions of
ungulate communities in North America correspond well with their adaptations to type
and depth of snow in the regions in which they occur (Telfer and Kelsall, 1984).
Changes in winter climate will likely change the suitability of winter habitat, and hence
the ranges of these species. Such changes occurred between the Little Ice Age (1300-
1850), when moose and caribou occupied Nova Scotia, and the period after 1850 when
white-tailed deer re-colonised the province at the expense of caribou, probably because
of milder winters and the associated decrease in snow depth (Telfer, 1967).
Predator-prey relations also may shift with changing distributions of snow types;
wolves flounder in deep snow that caribou can cross, but can follow moose, which are
little better suited to travel through soft snow (Telfer and Kelsall 1984).
Tree swallows and other aerial insectivores.
 Birds that feed on insects in flight — aerial insectivores — are particularly vulnerable
to weather conditions in the spring and early summer. Mortality of adults from cold
snaps in April and May are relatively common, and growing young are vulnerable in
June when adults must spend most time catching food rather than brooding the chicks.
Unusual cold and rain at this time, such as occurred in June 1993 in southern
Saskatchewan, can lead to mass mortality of chicks because the adults have to spend
more time trying to find food and cannot keep the young warm (Hoyt in litt.). Increased
frequencies of such extreme events may cause enough mortality to lead to a shift in
distribution away from regions experiencing such weather patterns. Some other aerial
insectivores, particularly swifts (family Apodidae), are metabolically better adapted to
cold wet summer weather: the chicks have variable growth rates and can go into torpor
to conserve energy through lean periods (Lack, 1973).
African wildlife
Magadza (1994) used the impacts of previous droughts in southern Africa as an ana-
logue for predicting the possible impacts of climatic change on wildlife. Recorded
impacts of previous droughts on mammalian populations showed shifts in geographic
ranges and shifts in community structure. Because the rates of response were slower
than rates postulated to occur under global warming, and because the GCMs predicted
higher temperatures than those found during the droughts, Magadza (1994) concluded
that large mammals were likely to be threatened by climate change.
Biodiversity: Species, Communities, and Ecosystems
13-15
13.2.2 Impacts on communities
13.2.2.1 Species as independent entities
A common approach for assessing the impacts of climate change on communities is to
conduct individual species-level assessments and subsequently combine the results.
Comparisons among species can be used as a screening technique to help identify those
species or species groups at greatest risk from climate change and in need of further
detailed analysis. The community approach is implicit in some of the species screening
techniques (Section 13.2.1.1) because vulnerability scores for one species must be
interpreted relative to those for other species.
A second approach is to assess possible climate-induced changes in community
characteristics such as species richness. Baseline species richness can be obtained from
field studies or by overlaying species-specific distributional maps. Statistical methods
can subsequently be used to model species richness as a function of climate, and
changes in species richness can be mapped under current and future climate scenarios.
However, an important requirement is to distinguish between alpha (site- specific) and
gamma (regional) diversity.
Examples
Several of the species-level approaches outlined above have been applied across groups
of species. For example, Herman and Scott (1992) applied expert judgement in
assessing climate change impacts on eastern Canadian salamanders, shrews, and turtles.
Dennis (1993) assessed potential impacts of climate change on butterflies of the United
Kingdom. Millsap et al. (1990) analysed present-day vulnerability of vertebrate groups
in Florida (e.g., Figure 13.1). Examples of climate envelope modelling as applied to
species richness are in Price (1995) and Malcolm (1996). Western (1991) speculated on
the potential impacts of climate change on the abundance and diversity of African
savannah ungulates mammals using observed relationships between climate and
biomass, productivity, diversity, and average body size.
Advantages and limitations
 Climate envelope modelling of species richness can be a misleading technique because it
focuses on the sheer numbers of species in an area rather than qualitative aspects of
diversity, such as species composition, distribution, and relative abundance. Under
climate change, species numbers may increase if species adapted to the new climate
regime invade an area. Thus, even though sensitive species might be lost, and regional
diversity decrease, species richness at a site may increase. It is at the largest spatial
scale - the turnover in species composition across a region (gamma diversity) - that
biodiversity impacts must ultimately be judged (Noss, 1983).
 A simple thought experiment illustrates the danger of equating species diversity with the
numbers of species at a site. Because of the increase in species richness as one proceeds
UNEP/IVM Handbook
13-16
from the poles to the tropics, average annual temperature and species richness are
highly correlated. Making use of this relationship, a scenario of consistent greenhouse
warming might be expected to result in increased species richness in the Antarctic and
Arctic (provided that southern taxa were able to move pole-ward). At the same time
however, Arctic and Antarctic species would be going extinct because the cold polar
conditions they require no longer exist. Thus, even though local diversity might be
increasing, global biodiversity would be decreasing.
A more quantitative example of the dangers implicit in using alpha diversity to repre-
sent diversity is presented by Malcolm (1996). Based on a regression model between
climate and species richness, total species richness of ungulates was consistently pro-
jected to increase throughout southern Africa. However, species richness of a subset of
the community, the highland savannah community of South Africa, decreased under
every scenario.
13.2.2.2 Species assemblages
With respect to overall community and ecosystem properties, not all species are equal.
Some play a disproportionate role in determining community composition and func-
tional properties of the ecosystem. Nor are all species equal from a conservation pers-
pective: some may be good indicators of certain kinds of ecological impacts, others may
have a high public profile. Given limited resources and knowledge, a valuable approach
to impact assessment is to preferentially devote efforts to just a few species, perhaps
because of their overall importance in the ecosystem or their value from a conservation
viewpoint (Table 13.2).

et al., 1997).

In an example of the use of species distributions to analyse species assemblages,
Malcolm (1996) used ordination to group ungulate species according to the similarity of
their geographic distributions (Box 13.2). The analysis identified four more-or-less
distinct ungulate assemblages that showed contrasting responses to climate change.
Presumably, species in the same assemblage have faced similar selective pressures
through time, and hence will show similar responses to climate change.
Box 13.2 Example: Use of climate envelope modelling in investigating
changes in ungulate diversity in southern Africa.
The climate envelope approach was used to model the potential impact of climate change on
the diversity of hoofed mammals in southern Africa (Hulme et al., 1996). Distributions of 44
taxa from Smithers (1983) were digitised at 0.5° resolution, including the elephant and
ungulates from two orders: Artiodactyla (even-toed animals such as pigs, hippopotamuses,
giraffes, and antelopes and their kin) and Perissodactyla (odd-toed species such as zebras
and rhinoceroses). Multiple regression was used to model total diversity and diversity in four
zoogeographic groupings identified by ordination (see figure 1). Discriminant analysis was
used to model the distributions of individual taxa.
Box 13.2, Figure 1. Observed species richness in four species groups identified from a
principal components analysis. A: highland savannah group (7 spe-
cies); B: arid highlands group (7 species); C: woodland savannah
group (25 species); D: arid lowlands group (5 species). In each part,
six sizes of diamonds represent six classes of species richness. (A
and D = ≤0.5, 0.5-1.5, 1.5-2.5, 2.5-3.5, 3.5-4.5, >4.5; B = ≤1.5, 1.5-2.5,

11.5-14.5, >14.5).
The IIASA data set (Leemans and Cramer, 1990) was used to calibrate the models. Predicted
baseline values were subsequently calculated using a 1961-1990 baseline data set, and
served as a reference for judging the impacts of three doubled CO2 GCMs: a core scenario

13-18
(UKMO: Murphy and Mitchell, 1995), a wet scenario (OSU: Schlesinger and Zhao, 1989), and
a dry scenario (CCC: McFarlene et al., 1992).
Diversity was predicted to increase over much of the region, but separate zoogeographic
groupings showed contrasting responses. Richness in the savannah woodland and arid
lowlands groups increased in most grid cells, especially under the core and dry scenarios. In
contrast, species richness in the highland savannah group demonstrated a consistent pattern
of regional decrease. For the arid highlands group, predicted changes in richness varied from
scenario to scenario (see figure 2).

Results are shown for three climate change scenarios (UKTR, CCC,

Success of the discriminant analysis approach in predicting individual distributions varied
greatly from species to species. The analysis was least successful for species with restricted
or patchy distributions. Among taxa that exhibited a consistent change in geographic
distributions in response to climate change, decreases in distributions were more prevalent
than increases. Such taxa included three in the savannah woodland group (elephant, buffalo,
nyala) and two in the arid lowlands group (blue wildebeest, eland). Every species (black
wildebeest, bontebok, blesbok, Cape mountain zebra, grey rhebok, grysbok, mountain
reedbuck) in the highland savannah group showed a consistent decrease in distribution size,

as did three species in the arid highlands group (Hartmann's mountain zebra, springbok,
steenbok) and one in the savannah woodland group (klipspringer).
13.2.3 Impacts on ecosystems
13.2.3.1 Ecosystem screening
As summarised in Table 13.3, research has identified several biomes and ecosystem
types that are thought to be at special risk from climate change (Houghton et al., 1990;
Leemans and Halpin, 1992; Peters and Lovejoy, 1992; Markham et al., 1993). These
biomes can be mapped at national or regional scales to identify priority areas for
research, monitoring, and management.

Data and computational requirements
 Ecosystem screening requires that biomes or ecosystems be mapped at a national or
regional scale. Creation of these maps will be easiest if remote-sensing information or
biophysical/biogeophysical classifications are available. These data and the software
required to process them are becoming increasingly available.
A priori classification of biomes according to climate change sensitivity involves im-
plicit assumptions about the likelihood of particular climate change scenarios. Often,
assumptions are also made about the way that climate interacts with organisms in a
biome. Depending on current scientific understanding, certain climate change scenarios
may be deemed more likely than others; hence, if desired, more attention can be devoted
to subsets of the biomes listed in Table 13.3.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
13-20
13.2.3.2 Biome modelling
 Over the years, a number of biogeographic models have been developed that predict the
dominance of various plant life forms in different environments. Biogeochemical models
go another step and, based on plant life-form types, simulate cycling of carbon and
other nutrients. The VEMAP project (VEMAP Members, 1995) provides a useful
introduction to both types of models. The project was designed to provide spatially
explicit information on the sensitivity of terrestrial ecosystems in the conterminous
United States to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration and associated climate change.
A standardised methodology was created whereby climatic, biogeographic, and
biogeochemical models were linked and compared. In the Phase I analysis, three
mixed-layer ocean GCMs were selected to span a range of possible equilibrium climate
changes, from the relatively insensitive Oregon State University model (3.0oC average
US temperature increase under doubled CO2) to the more sensitive UKMO model (+
6.7oC) (the GFDL model was intermediate at +4.3oC). The resulting climate scenarios,
plus baseline controls and information on soils, served as input for three biogeographic
models (BIOME2, DOLY, and MAPSS) that simulated major vegetation types across
the lower 48 US states. In turn, these data (climate, soils, and plant life forms) served
as input for three biogeochemical models, BIOME-BGC, CENTURY, and TEM
(VEMAP Members, 1995).
These biogeographic models show similarities with the climate envelope modelling
techniques described in Section 13.2.1.3. All three biogeographic models in VEMAP
show characteristics of species-level physiological models in that they rely on ecophy-
siological constraints and resource limitations. DOLY additionally makes use of a
statistically defined vegetation classification model. Dynamic components are also
included; for example, MAPSS includes a simple fire model. The biogeochemical
models incorporate general algorithms that describe plant and soil processes such as
carbon capture by plants, decomposition, and waterflux.
Implementation
Typically, the models are run under baseline conditions and under one or more climate
change scenarios. Useful outputs include maps and tabulations of biome distributions,
properties (such as net primary productivity and carbon change), and changes in biome
distributions. These analyses are especially useful when overlaid with land- use patterns
and maps of protected areas and when used in concert with other species- and
community-level analyses (e.g., Hulme et al., 1996; Box 13.3). For example, Malcolm
and Markham (1997) used results from the VEMAP Phase I analysis to examine two
aspects of potential ecosystem change. In one analysis, they overlaid the pixel (grid cell)
change maps from the nine combinations of climate scenarios and vegetation models.
Areas that showed consistent change among the nine combinations were judged to be
particularly affected by climate change. In a second analysis (Figure 13.2), they
examined change in the regions surrounding pixels, arguing that possibilities for
reestablishment and movement in the surrounding landscape would critically influence
species' chances of survival in a changing climate. Interestingly, this second analysis
Biodiversity: Species, Communities, and Ecosystems
13-21
showed more consistent change (and hence greater impacts on ecosystems) than the
first.
Data and computational requirements
 Because the models are complex, users must rely on data sets generated by the model-
ling teams. Fortunately, these are often available. For example, all the input and output
data sets in the VEMAP Phase I project were made available electronically. In some
cases, the data sets are large and hence considerable computer storage space and
processing power are required.
Typically, the baseline and climate change scenarios are based on GCM runs, which are
made available along with the vegetation outputs.

Examples
In an illustrative example (Box 13.3), the geographic distributions of biomes in
southern Africa were modelled by Hulme et al. (1996). In another example,
Boonpragob and Santisirisomboon (1996) used the Holdridge Life Zone Classification
(Holdridge, 1947) to model potential changes of forest area in Thailand under three
GCM scenarios.
Box 13.3 Example: Use of eco-climatic classification to screen the
vulnerability of protected areas in southern Africa.
Hulme et al. (1996) used the BIOME model (Prentice et al., 1992) to investigate potential
vegetation changes in the protected areas of southern Africa. They argued that biome shifts
can indicate significant threats to the ecosystems that reserves were established to protect.
The current distribution of natural vegetation in the region was reasonably well simulated using
baseline (1961-1990) climate and the BIOME model (see figure 1), although several significant
differences were found. The actual border between the savannah and grassland biomes [as
illustrated in White (1983)] was in poor agreement with the predicted one and modelled
savannah areas were too extensive. In addition, swamplands and salt pans, which cover
significant areas in the region, were not defined by the BIOME model. Recent attempts to
improve the model by incorporating interannual climate variability and soil nutrients may
improve performance.

The authors ran the BIOME model for three GCMs scenarios for the region, including a core
scenario (UKMO: Murphy and Mitchell, 1995), a wet scenario (OSU: Schlesinger and Zhao
1989), and a dry scenario (CCC: McFarlene et al., 1992). Recognising that plants may
increase their water use efficiency (WUE) under the increased carbon dioxide concentrations,
the authors ran two versions of the BIOME model: one in which only climate determined the
changes in distributions of biomes, and a second in which a WUE response was simulated by
setting a lower limit for the moisture index of each modelled biome (=Plant Functional Type).
Under all scenarios, there were significant shifts in most biomes. Without a WUE response,
Biodiversity: Species, Communities, and Ecosystems

the most significant shift was a loss of grassland. About 20% of the region showed a shift in
biome type. With a WUE response, grassland was much less affected, but even larger shifts in
biome types were predicted.
The IUCN national reserve and national parks database compiled by the World Conservation
Monitoring Centre in the United Kingdom contained 349 reserves in the southern Africa region
that were larger than 1000 hectares. For each reserve, it was determined whether its current
vegetation would change. Climate change alone impacted some 17 percent of reserves. Under
greater WUE, some 25 to nearly 40 percent of the reserves were affected (see table). Thus,
the analysis identified the importance of considering climate change in developing long-term
planning strategies for protected areas. A more detailed analysis would include
country-specific and reserve-specific analyses.

Advantages and limitations
 These methods are valuable because they explicitly incorporate climate variables. Also,
because species and other structural and functional system properties are often
characteristic of a biome, biome distributions provide information applicable to many
aspects of biodiversity assessment. In essence, the biogeographic models combine cli-
mate variables in a biologically meaningful way. For example, water availability to a
plant will depend not only on precipitation, but also on the rate of water loss via eva-
poration, which is partly a function of ambient temperature. Thus, a map that already
combines these two variables in a biologically realistic way will be of greater value to
an ecologist than maps of one or the other.
It was recognised by the VEMAP members that current understanding of ecosystem
structure and functioning, or for that matter of global climate, does not yet allow the
identification of "best" models or acceptance of correct predictions. However, by pro-
viding information from a suite of models, the results can be used to provide prelimi-
nary information on the overall sensitivity of natural ecosystems to greenhouse warming
(VEMAP Members, 1995).
Just as in the climate envelope techniques, the biogeographic models assume that
vegetation is in equilibrium with climatic conditions. For the moment, the models
provide no information on rates of change, although dynamic models are being created
(e.g., Kirilenko and Solomon, 1998). They are thus static and non-interactive
descriptions of a very dynamic process.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
13-24
13.2.3.3 Dynamic ecosystem models
 Process-based models of the causative agents in an ecosystem are very diverse in their
approach. It is useful to distinguish two general types of models: tactical and strategic.
The former are very detailed models of specific systems, and their objective is to mimic
the behaviour of the system as closely as possible. These models are probably the most
common type in the climate change literature and can provide very detailed predictions
as to vulnerability and climate change impacts. Strategic models, on the other hand,
sacrifice detail for generality, and attempt to incorporate the essences of a broader class
of systems.
 Tactical models face two problems. First, they may be strong in some details, but weak
in others (for example, the effects of disturbances such as large fires and insect
outbreaks). Second, they may be difficult to scale up from detailed patches to extensive
landscapes. Starfield and Chapin (1996) attempt to overcome these problems by using a
parsimonious, frame-based modelling paradigm.
It is difficult to validate the predictive powers of these models. However, investment in
modelling effort can pay off in a number of ways: identifying data needs for boosting
confidence in model projections, helping to sharpen hypotheses, exploring alternative
scenarios, and generating new possibilities and ideas.
Examples
Some examples of dynamic models are listed in Table 13.4.

Advantages and limitations
Tactical models are especially useful in concrete problems of resource management, but
a detailed understanding of the system is required. Also, they are often so specific that it
is difficult to extract general insight and the calculations are so detailed that the model
Biodiversity: Species, Communities, and Ecosystems
13-25
behaviour is not transparent. Of course, there is a continuum of approaches between
tactical and strategic models that reflect attempts to balance thoroughness and realism
on the one hand and generality and workability on the other.
13.3  Autonomous adaptation
All multicellular organisms are able to sense and respond to abiotic factors, and have
evolved various mechanisms to track the set of the environmental conditions under
which they are able to exist and reproduce. Thus, in response to climate change, orga-
nisms and the ecosystems in which they occur will adapt autonomously. In a sense,
impact assessment is the task of identifying those species and or ecosystems that are
least likely to adjust to a changing climate. Note however, that in the absence of
significant evolutionary change, species are dependent on their inbuilt phenotypic
plasticity and capabilities in order to respond to climate change. Thus, their ability to
autonomously respond to climate change is inherently limited. If suitable habitat
conditions disappear entirely, or shift in position faster than a population can react,
extinctions will occur and ecosystem simplification will result.
13.4  Planned adaptation
 It is possible to adopt policies and practices which assist species in adjusting to climate
change, for example by designating and protecting migration corridors. However, our
ability to manage ecosystems is very limited because of our inability to predict
ecosystem responses. The analogy that ecosystems can be "managed" in the same way
that much simpler human-designed industrial systems can is misleading and dangerous
(Walker and Steffen, 1997). In a changing climate, one must expect the unexpected
(and unpredictable) and keep open as many response options as possible (Walker and
Steffen, 1997). In the face of these uncertainties, a key adaptation strategy is to
maintain ecological structure and processes at all levels and reduce existing pressures
on natural ecosystems (Markham and Malcolm, 1996). Perhaps the most significant
challenge is to incorporate biodiversity conservation into adaptation strategies in other
sectors, so that societal responses to climate change do not further jeopardise
biodiversity.
 Adaptation strategies should be developed within the context of global, regional, and
national biodiversity conservation plans and according to the articles of the United
Nations Convention on Biodiversity. Various strategies are available to aid efforts to
conserve biodiversity in the face of climate change, including the establishment and
maintenance of protected areas (in situ preservation), the active management of wild
populations outside of protected areas (inter situ management), and the maintenance of
captive populations (ex situ methods) (see Table 13.5). Of these, highest priority should
be placed on in situ and inter situ conservation (Markham and Malcolm, 1996). A
protected areas review is a logical first step in defining conservation objectives and
goals and in assigning adaptation priorities.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
13-26
Various habitat management and intervention techniques can be used as part of an
overall adaptation strategy. Many of these are already in use in protected areas and
managed reserves throughout the world, and the techniques can be adapted to respond
to a change in climatic conditions (Table 13.6).

• 
The ability of natural habitats to withstand climatic change depends on their ability
to both absorb change and bounce back from change. These abilities can be im-
proved by:
− 
conserving biological diversity;
− 
reducing fragmentation and degradation of habitat;
− 
increasing functional connectivity among habitat blocks and fragments; and
− 
reducing anthropogenic environmental stresses. Threatened and endangered
species and ecosystems already under stress from environmental degradation
and human pressures are likely to be vulnerable to the added stress of climatic
change.
• 
Reducing population and ecosystem vulnerability to climate change is likely to have
strong additional benefits through the simultaneous reduction of vulnerability to
other environmental and anthropogenic stresses.

In addition to these general principles, several adaptation principles apply specifically
to protected areas (Markham and Malcolm 1996):
• 
Adaptation strategies should emphasise redundancy of populations and protected
areas. Just as poorly enforced regulation or political instability can be arguments
for increased number of reserves and therefore, greater redundancy (Soulé, 1991),
so too can the uncertainty of climate change impacts.
• 
Design considerations that promote the evolutionary potential of species within
protected areas include maximisation of reserve connectivity, size, and number.
• 
A protected areas network must balance preservation of ecological complexity with
preservation of landscape diversity. Altitudinal range within reserves is important
because species may be able to migrate upslope to avoid the consequences of
warming (Peters and Darling, 1985; McNeely, 1990). Heterogeneity of topography,
habitat, and microclimate in reserves allows for greater flexibility of organismal
responses to climate change. Gap analysis (see below), based on representative
ecosystem and enduring landscape features, will have to become more dynamic
(Halpin, 1997). Reserve planning in a changing climate must examine future needs
in areas where present-day conservation needs are few, but where migration and
dispersal of valued species may make protection necessary or desirable.
• 
Flexible zoning of reserve boundaries, development of more effective buffer zone
management, and inter situ management will play an increasing role as climate
change forces changes in species distributions and migration patterns (Peters and
Darling, 1985; Bennett et al., 1991; Parsons, 1991).
• 
Fragmentation itself may be the single biggest barrier to ecosystem adaptation in a
changing climate. Even where paleoecological studies suggest that species have
been able to adapt to rapid climatic changes in the past, current habitat fragmenta-
tion patterns and human barriers may prevent range shifts. Edge effects that ac-
company fragmentation expose complex habitats to climatic extremes in adjacent
simple habitats (e.g., Malcolm, in press). Thus, reduction of fragmentation rates is
a critical climate mitigation strategy and increases in connectivity are a high pri-
ority adaptation response. Because range shifts are a likely response to climate
change, corridors will need to function as habitat rather than as mere transit lanes
(Simberloff et al., 1992).
13.4.1 Assessing the vulnerability of protected areas
One goal of adaptation is to ensure that the existing network of protected areas will be
successful in conserving biodiversity into the future. Given that existing problems will
most likely only worsen under climate change, a logical first step is to identify and
correct existing weaknesses in the protected areas network. A powerful tool for
conducting such analyses are gap analyses that identify taxa and ecosystems which are
underrepresented in the network (these are not to be confused with gap models used in
forest simulation; see Chapter 12). A full discussion of these techniques is beyond the
Biodiversity: Species, Communities, and Ecosystems
13-29
scope of this chapter, but several components are usually involved, including 1) land
cover and land use change maps, 2) species distributions, 3) predicted species
distributions based on climate envelope or habitat suitability modelling, 4) land
stewardship patterns, and 5) existing protected areas. These techniques can be used to
assign priorities for land acquisition and to provide information that is useful for a
variety of land planning exercises, quite independent of climate change per se (Scott and
Csuti, 1997). A gap analysis is a useful addition to attempts to establish national or
regional priorities and action plans.
13.4.1.1 Screening techniques
An additional approach is to attempt to assess the vulnerability of an existing protected
areas network under a changing climate. A number of characteristics that predispose
protected areas to climate change impacts have been suggested (Table 13.7) and can be
used to rank protected areas. Malcolm and Markham (1997) undertook a more
quantitative analysis and overlaid protected areas onto maps of pixel or landscape
change as determined from the VEMAP results (Figure 13.2). Protected area vulnera-
bility was assessed based on the consistency of change among nine vegetation models
and scenarios.
Table 13.7
Some characteristics of protected areas that predispose them to
climate change vulnerability.
• 
Presence of sensitive ecosystem types (see Table 13.3)
• 
Presence of species and/or ecosystems near the edges of their historical distributions
• 
Presence of species and ecosystems that have geographically limited distributions
• 
Topographic and geomorphological uniformity
• 
Small size and high perimeter:area ratio
• 
Isolation from other examples of component communities
• 
Human-induced fragmentation of populations and ecosystems
• 
Existing anthropogenic pressures within and close to borders
• 
Presence of natural communities that depend on one or a few key processes or species
Implementation
 One procedure is to rank each protected area for each of the characteristics in Table
13.7 and sum the rankings to obtain an overall vulnerability index for each protected
area. Alternatively, different characteristics can be differentially weighed to assign
some higher importance.
The vulnerability characteristics listed in Table 13.7 are guidelines only and in some
cases will require refinement in order to form the basis for a quantitative, or even
qualitative, ranking scheme. For example, to score protected areas according to “pres-
ence of taxa with geographically limited distributions”, decisions must be made as to
which floral or faunal groups are to be considered and how limited distributional will be
scored. For the final analysis, additional decisions must be made as to the relative
importance of each of the various characteristics.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
13-30
Data and computational requirements
 Various sets of information are required for each protected area and the area sur-
rounding it, including ecosystem types, land-use patterns, and species distributions.
Ultimately, the screening technique is very flexible with regards to data requirements.
Variables can be added or modified, and, if needed, dropped from the analysis. A
comprehensive analysis requires the amassing of considerable amounts of data. Some
are already available on a global basis, albeit at low resolution. The required data sets
will be of immediate use in other efforts to conserve natural resources and to achieve
the goals of the United Nations Convention on Biodiversity (Articles 8(a) and 8(b)).
Some of the characteristics listed in Table 13.7 require that assumptions about future
climatic conditions be made, others provide measures of vulnerability to change irres-
pective of the direction of change, and some measure vulnerability irrespective of
change. Thus, the user can adjust the final set of characteristics to reflect knowledge
about future conditions or, if desired, to make as few assumptions as possible.
Examples
An example of the use of biome-level modelling in assessing protected area vulnera-
bility is provided in Box 13.3.
Advantages and limitations
The screening technique outlined here is easy to perform; it may require relatively
unsophisticated input information, and vulnerability in some cases can be assessed
regardless of the exact nature of future climate change. However, generality is some-
times achieved at the expense of realism; for example, all variables are assumed to be
equally important and any interaction or feedback among variables is ignored. Also, the
vulnerability scores are themselves relative measures and are useful only when
compared with other scores. On the positive side, the screening techniques are of value
irrespective of the eventual course of climate change because they help to identify
protected areas that are already in trouble, or are likely to be because of additional
negative human impacts. The use of biome models to assess protected area vulnerability
is only as reliable as the biome models themselves.
13.5  Integrating the methods
The assessment involves not only the selection of an appropriate suite of techniques, but
also specification of the manner in which the various inputs and outputs will be
integrated. Careful integration of methods during the assessment offers many benefits:
input data sets (especially climate scenarios) can be shared, results from one technique
can be used to validate those from others, and comparisons among methods can provide
new insights. The identification of vulnerable populations and ecosystems provides
important guidance as to where adaptation efforts should be devoted.
Biodiversity: Species, Communities, and Ecosystems
13-31
Several general strategies are available for conducting an integrated method assessment:
• 
Preferentially devote research and conservation efforts to species and areas iden-
tified as being under particular threat from climate change.
• 
Couple preliminary screening with detailed investigation of selected taxa and
communities using quantitative modelling techniques (Table 13.8).
• 
Use screening techniques to identify potential indicator species and subsequently
use process-based models to determine which species might be affected first or
most.
• 
Test predictions from one model against those from others. For example, sites
where a species is predicted to go extinct based on climate envelopes should also
show a decrease in habitat suitability using HSI.
• 
Achieve different levels of detail, depending on data availability. For species with
poorly-known habitat requirements and geographic distributions, use qualitative
screening. Build detailed models for those species or systems that are well under-
stood and are the subject of active research.
• 
Preferentially devote monitoring to species where their changes in distributional
limits are predicted. Use dynamic models and analogue information to estimate the
time-frame of any predicted change.
• 
Overlay maps of overall species and ecosystem vulnerability with the geographic
boundaries of reserves and protected areas to assess the strength of the reserve
system in protecting threatened organisms.
• 
Overlay maps of distributional changes in biome distributions (e.g., Hulme et al.,
1996; Malcolm and Markham, 1997), climate envelopes, or habitat suitability (e.g.,
Lancia et al., 1986) with the geographic boundaries of reserves and protected areas
to examine the extent to which taxa and communities will be represented in
protected areas in the future. Use these analyses also to identify protected areas
where climate change might be manifested first.

 Economic analyses
 Some examples of the potential integration of the assessment with economic analyses
are as follows:
• 
When species can be assigned direct market values, for example, based on their
harvest value, the techniques can provide an estimate of the economic costs as-
sociated with climate change. A comprehensive economic analysis must consider
impacts on the supply of the resource and secondary impacts on values and pricing
that result from changes in supply.
• 
Given relationships between harvest rates, productivity, and habitat suitability, the
influence of climate change on economic returns from harvests can be investigated
using habitat suitability indices.
• 
Changes in species and habitat distributions can be overlaid with maps of regional
resource utilisation to identify regions of high impact and areas of likely shifts in
resource utilisation patterns.
• 
In the case of non-marketed environmental resources, attempts can be made to
utilise non-market valuation techniques (Thresher, 1981; Smith, 1993).
Unfortunately, quantifying the value of biodiversity resources is, at best, a difficult task
(Krutilla, 1967; Kellert, 1984; McNeely, 1988). These attempts need to made, however.
Kellert (1984) argued that in the face of an inherent societal bias toward consideration
of only those factors that can be measured and quantified, attempts need to be made to
quantify all environmental values, including recreational, ecological, moralistic,
scientific, aesthetic, utilitarian, and cultural ones. If natural resources are valued based
solely on their contribution to monetary gain, a steady erosion in environmental quality
can be expected (Krutilla, 1967).
13.7  Summary and implications
 Ecosystems, with their myriad plant and animal species, are complex systems whose
structure and function are intimately influenced by climate. Responses to climate
change involve patterns and processes over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales,
from the nearly instantaneous physiological responses of individual organisms, to shifts
in species distributions from one year to the next, to large-scale shifts in biomes over
decades and centuries, to shifts in the genetic makeup of populations over millennia. As
yet, our understanding of the role of climate in ecosystems, or for that matter in the
biology of individual species, is incomplete, and our ability to predict future responses
is rudimentary. Much work remains to be done in furthering the science of climate
change assessment, particularly in developing realistic dynamic models, in
understanding interactions of species with their environment and with each other, in
amassing baseline data on species distributions, and in making baseline and climate
change scenario data sets widely available in the scientific community.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
13-34
 Impact assessment in the biodiversity sector has broad scope. Techniques are available
at several levels of biological organisation, including populations, species, communities,
ecosystems, and biomes. Depending on the resources available, many techniques are
available within each level, from simple screening based on data in the literature, to the
collation of expert judgement, to statistical descriptions of existing climate
relationships, to the creation of dynamic simulation models. Most of these techniques
are undergoing active development, and steady improvement is expected in the coming
years.
 Even more rudimentary than our understanding of the role of climate in natural eco-
systems is our ability to manage natural ecosystems. Natural ecosystems are much
more complex than human systems, and possibilities for emergent and unexpected
behaviour are manifest. Our history of interactions with natural systems provides many
more examples of mismanagement than of successful management.
 The primary goal of adaptation in the biodiversity sector is to ensure that natural
systems are able to respond to climate change to the limits of their capabilities. An
effective strategy for achieving this is to reduce or remove existing pressures. Many of
the same principles that are currently used to minimise negative impacts of development
on natural systems find direct application in avoiding the potential negative impacts of
climate change, such as the designation of interconnected and comprehensive reserve
networks and the development of ecologically-benign production systems. A significant
challenge is to incorporate biodiversity thinking into adaptive responses in other sectors,
to ensure that future development activities do not further jeopardise the world’s
biological resources.
Because the potential responses of natural systems to human-induced climate change
are inherently limited, the best overall strategy is to minimise the amount of change.

14.1  Problem definition and scope
Evidence has been accumulating in recent years that suggests climate change may drive
changes in fish stocks, although global fisheries production may not change
substantially (particularly in marine systems). Rather, the relative abundance and dis-
tribution of individual species as well as distributions of centres of fish production may
be significantly altered (IPCC, 1996). There are considerable uncertainties as to how
much, how fast, and where the climate will change, and this creates considerable
uncertainty in predicting changes in fisheries. But as average air temperature increases
and precipitation patterns change, we can expect changes in water temperature, water
quality, and hydrology, which will in turn affect fish populations. Thus, the goal for a
fisheries assessment will be to evaluate the impact of climate change on the fisheries of
interest or concern in a particular location. Specific aspects of the fisheries of concern
to be evaluated may include biodiversity, total catch (biomass), species changes in catch
composition, and displacement of fishing grounds.

The ways that aquatic habitats may be affected by climate change will depend in large
part on the specific geographic region where the fisheries are found, the type of aquatic
system potentially affected (such as marine upwelling zones and freshwater lacustrine
or riverine habitats), and the nature and magnitude of the climate change. Ultimately,
many species of fish could be affected. Some climate-related changes are likely to be
beneficial to local or regional fish stocks, whereas other stocks may be negatively
affected. There is some agreement that, at the least, significant redistribution of both
marine and freshwater fisheries will occur (see Beamish, 1995). Poleward migrations
may be the most likely change (IPCC, 1996) as waters generally warm, but many
specific estimates will have to wait for more certainty in regional estimates of climate
change.
14.1.1 Fisheries resources affected
Some of the fisheries resources that may be most affected by climate change include 1)
fisheries stocks that are currently heavily or over-exploited, 2) species with narrowly
defined physiological tolerances to environmental conditions such as high water
temperatures or low levels of dissolved oxygen (Stefan et al., 1995; Jobling, 1997;
Magnuson and DeStasio, 1997), 3) threatened and endangered anadromous species
whose complex life cycles are currently affected by artificial structures such as dams,
4) coastal species dependent on nearshore wetland nursery areas that are already sub-
siding and likely to be vulnerable to sea level rise, 5) species that currently occur only
in physically isolated habitats for which there are no emigration pathways to other
habitats, 6) species dependent on coastal upwelling zones, 7) species dependent on
habitats that will be lost because public infrastructure impedes or blocks migration of
habitat, and 8) heavily managed high-density aquaculture stocks.
14.1.2 Climate change impacts on fisheries
Fisheries resources provide a considerable amount of protein in diets around the world,
and in some countries provide the majority of the animal protein consumed by local
human populations. In addition, fisheries resources may support significant recreational
and tourism economies at a local or regional scale, and the export of fisheries products
contributes considerably to the economies of a number of countries. Thus, maintaining
healthy and sustainable fisheries resources is of major importance. Regardless of the
nature of the stress (e.g., overfishing, pollution, climate change), fisheries will continue
to be important to subsistence, recreational, and commercial fishers on both a local and
regional scale.
Today, many of the world’s fisheries are already under considerable stress. For exam-
ple, many of the world’s major marine commercial fish stocks are currently fully or
over-exploited (IPCC, 1996). Most of the anadromous salmonid fish stocks in the
Pacific Northwest of the United States are threatened or endangered because of barriers
to upstream spawning migrations, extensive habitat alterations associated with
impoundments, and water quality deterioration associated with sedimentation or urban
Fisheries
14-3
pollution. For marine fisheries, perhaps the greatest concern is that 70 percent of the
global fish resources depend on nearshore and estuarine ecosystems (IPCC, 1996) that
are being threatened by physical loss and pollution. Growing human settlement and
development in the coastal zone is rapidly eliminating many important nursery habitats
as these areas are converted into agricultural lands or residential or commercial
development, and domestic and industrial sewage from coastal population centres is
degrading water quality. In addition to the effects of human activities, native and
endemic fisheries are under stress from introductions of other species. For example, the
introduction of the Nile perch into Lake Victoria has been associated with a decline
there in the native cichlid fish populations.
14.1.3 What fisheries impacts are important?
World-wide fisheries resources can be placed into three principal categories, marine,
coastal and estuarine, and freshwater, and each of these may be affected differently by
climate change (Beamish, 1995). For example, marine fisheries may be most affected
by changes in the magnitude, duration, and location of upwelling zones and major ocean
currents. These changes may directly affect distributions of fish stocks by shifting
locations of larval, juvenile, and adult habitats; they may also have secondary effects
associated with reduced food resources and altered food webs and community structure.
Coastal and estuarine fisheries may be most affected by the loss of nearshore coastal
wetland nursery habitats, resulting in major declines in recruitment and standing stocks.
Freshwater fisheries may be affected by changes in water temperatures affecting habitat
quality, and changes in precipitation could affect habitat availability, leading to
isolation of some habitats, as well as timing of hydrograph-driven life-cycle events.
Additionally, changes in overall water availability may affect the extent of both adult
and juvenile nursery habitats. Table 14.1 identifies some categories of potential climate
change impacts to fisheries resources.
14.2  An array of methods
14.2.1 Current approaches
Three general approaches have been used to evaluate potential impacts to fisheries
resources from climate change: 1) estimating changes in the availability of thermal
habitat by evaluating changes in the thermal structure of lakes and streams; 2) esti-
mating impacts of changes in physical habitat features (i.e., water temperatures, flow
rates, water levels, water quality, and wetland nursery areas) to important life cycle
stages (such as migration periods and spawning times), to species distributions, or to
overall productivity; and 3) estimating effects of temperature changes on fish physio-
logical processes, particularly growth and feeding, using process-based bioenergetics
models. Some researchers have identified these general approaches as the basic
framework for evaluating climate change impacts on fisheries resources

(Regier and Meisner, 1990; Shuter and Meisner, 1992). Data needs associated with
these approaches include historical environmental and biological data (including catch
or yield data), species-specific physiological information, and species-specific life
history data.
Studies that evaluated potential impacts of climate change on fisheries in temperate and
northern latitudes (see Beamish, 1995) largely followed the first two approaches, in
particular evaluating potential responses of fisheries to the thermal aspects of climate
change (see Transactions of the American Fisheries Society, 1990, Volume 119). Many
of these studies estimated changes in the production or distribution of fisheries
resources within particular habitats such as individual lakes of the North American
Great Lakes (Hill and Magnuson, 1990), or in the distribution of suitable thermal
habitats across large geographic regions such as the interior of Canada (Minns and
Moore, 1992) or the Pacific coast of North America (see Beamish, 1995).
In contrast, evaluations of fisheries resources in tropical latitudes focus on estimated
changes in seasonal water availability rather than on estimated temperature changes.
The magnitude of temperature changes in tropical areas of the world is expected to be
relatively minor in comparison to the magnitude of those changes in more temperate and
northern latitudes. However, water availability in tropical regions is expected to be
affected to a greater extent by potential climate changes (Meisner and Shuter, 1992).
Seasonal water availability affects lake levels, stage and flow in rivers, extent and
timing of floodplain inundation, and sea level, and thus plays an important role in
Fisheries
14-5
maintaining the life history of tropical fish species (Welcomme, 1976, 1985; Lowe-
McConnell, 1987; Shuter and Meisner, 1992). Because of the importance of water
availability and seasonal flooding to the life history of many fish species, changes in
water availability due to changes in precipitation may affect tropical fisheries resources
more than will changes in temperature (Meisner and Shuter, 1992).
In addition to these approaches, a number of studies have attempted to assess potential
future responses of fisheries resources by examining past fisheries’ responses to
historical climate changes (Beamish, 1993; Murawski, 1993; also see Beamish, 1995).
These studies examined how actual changes in environmental parameters such as water
temperature affected species distribution and abundance, community structure, and
distribution of fishing grounds. The observed responses are considered representative of
how the fishery resource will respond in the future under similar climate-related
environmental changes.
In all cases, the spatial scale of the assessment is directly related to the nature of the
climatic change and the fisheries resource of interest. The effects of climate change on
freshwater fisheries are more likely to be associated with localised climate conditions
than will be effects on marine environments. In marine systems, major shifts in
productivity and species distributions can be the product of changes in currents and
upwelling zones that are driven by the aggregate of climate changes (e.g., ENSO, the
North Atlantic oscillation) over very broad geographic regions (Mann and Lazier,
1996). Thus, assessments for freshwater resources are typically performed at a water-
shed level that may or may not extend beyond a country’s boundaries (e.g., Meisner,
1990; Minns and Moore, 1992). In contrast, assessments of marine fisheries are done at
geographic scales that extend well beyond that of an average country (e.g., Brander,
1997).
14.2.2 Applicability of methods to specific fisheries resources
The assessment methods described in this chapter address freshwater (riverine and
lacustrine) and marine (coastal, estuarine, and pelagic) habitats and evaluate potential
impacts to fisheries resources from climate-induced changes in water temperature,
water quality, and hydrology. The methods focus primarily on growth, feeding, and
mortality of individual taxa; fish yield or catch for entire fishery resources; species-
specific habitat suitability; and habitat availability. Because of the diversity of fisheries
resources and aquatic habitats that must be addressed, no single method or approach is
likely to adequately evaluate potential impacts to all the resources and habitats. In many
cases, the assessment for evaluating potential climate change impacts on fisheries
resources may require the use of a weight-of-evidence approach (USEPA, 1992) to
adequately evaluate the vulnerability of a particular fishery resource to climate change.
The weight-of-evidence approach uses multiple lines of evidence to identify potential
impacts and evaluate the significance of any estimated impacts. Thus, any number of
the following assessment methods may be used to relate climate change to biological
responses.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
14-6
Four basic approaches are presented: 1) using empirical models and historical envi-
ronmental and ecological data to estimate changes in catch, yield, natural mortality, and
other ecological parameters; 2) evaluating historical climate, limnological, and
hydrological data together with species- or fishery-specific data to estimate changes in
habitat quality, availability or distribution; 3) comparing species-specific physiological
parameters to projected climate conditions to identify changes in growth and biomass
production and shifts in distributions; and 4) forecasting future fisheries’ responses by
analogy with past responses to historical climate events. These four approaches are of
two major types: species-specific methods that permit evaluation of potential impacts to
target species and non-species-specific methods that focus on potential impacts to entire
fish communities.
Because of the importance of the fisheries resources to the diet of many nations, a
number of the methods focus primarily on estimation of yield or catch, and largely do
not address or consider the effects of climate change on species diversity, predator-prey
relationships, or other ecological issues. Many of the methods do not directly address
such factors as community structure and function, nutrient cycling, or predator-prey
relationships, although some methods are amenable to evaluating these aspects of the
fishery resource. No stock assessment methods are described here. Although some stock
assessment models include environmental variables, most do not; they do require long
time series of data on the size of the fish stock and the annual recruitment, which may
not be available for the fishery of concern. Most stock assessment models do, however,
include a natural mortality parameter, which can be related to changes in temperature
(see Pauly, 1983) and thus may be amenable to evaluating the effects of climate change
(Edwards and Megrey, 1989). For information on one computerised fish stock
assessment model that includes climate variables (CLIMPROD), see Freon et al.
(1993).
Many of the assessment methods were initially developed to investigate ecological
problems other than climate change, such as to predict potential fish yield in planned or
newly constructed reservoirs (Marshall, 1984) or to conduct general fisheries stock
assessments (Sparre and Venema, 1992). However, each of these methods is based on
at least some parameters that are expected to change with climate, and thus are appro-
priate for consideration for use for assessing climate change impacts and the responses
of fisheries resources. In addition, many of the methods can also be used to assess the
impacts of other human activities at the same time.
The choice of approaches to evaluate the impacts of climate change on fisheries
resources in any particular place or region will depend on the habitats and fisheries
present and on the availability of climate, hydrology, limnology, ecology, and fisheries
data, as well as the expected nature of the change in climate. In general, the approaches
focus on changes in temperature, precipitation, and sea level, and evaluate potential
effects at either the species or the total fishery (yield) level. The approaches are not
restricted to specific geographic regions. However, some of the specific methods
discussed under the various approaches are restricted to a basic habitat type (e.g.,
coastal, lake, or river) or a particular geographic region (e.g., African lakes). A number
Fisheries
14-7
of methods recommend the use of mapped data, and the use of geographic information
systems (GIS) is particularly applicable to these methods (see Chapter 1 for a fuller
discussion of GIS). Some methods where expert opinion can be especially useful are
mentioned. The approaches and methods are summarised in Tables 14.2, 14.3, and
14.4.
14.2.3 Description of assessment methods
14.2.3.1 Empirical modelling using historical environmental and fishery
data
In this approach, models are developed by regression and correlation from historical
data. The principle is to identify a sufficiently accurate quantitative relationship be-
tween yield (or abundance) and a climatological parameter (temperature or precipita-
tion) to estimate future yields under different climate scenarios. The overall approach is
similar between freshwater and marine systems, differing primarily in the species of
interest (e.g., pollock, king crab, walleye) and the climate variable of interest (tem-
perature or precipitation or both).
The largest obstacle for using this approach is the availability of sufficient historical
climatological and fisheries data to permit development of acceptable models. Data
needs for these models may include historical time-series precipitation, temperature,
surface water area, surface water runoff, floodplain area, stream flow and discharge,
and catch data, as well as water depth, dissolved solids, and estimated precipitation and
temperature data. Potential impacts are assessed by comparing recorded yield or catch
under historical climate conditions with the yield or catch estimated for future climate
conditions. This approach also does not consider potential impacts associated with
changes in water temperature, water quality, biotic interactions, or fishing effort, gear,
or success.
Assessing the effects of precipitation changes on fish yields in
lacustrine systems
Changes in local or regional precipitation patterns or precipitation magnitude are likely
to affect inflows to lakes and reservoirs, thereby affecting surface water area or water
depth. Empirical models that estimate potential annual fish yield from lakes and
reservoirs as a function of the surface area of the water body may be developed which
permit estimation of fish yield as a function of precipitation-related limnological or
hydrological parameters. For example, Crul (1992) employed regression analysis to
develop an empirical model for estimating total annual fish yield as a function of sur-
face water area for lakes and reservoirs in Africa. If appropriate limnological and fish
yield data are available, similar empirical models could be developed using regression
analyses for lakes and reservoirs of interest. Regression analyses using historical and

climate scenarios. These models can then be linked with fishery yield models to estimate
how fishery yield will respond to estimated changes in precipitation.
Assessing the effects of precipitation changes on catch in riverine
systems
Welcomme (1976) and others have reported on the relationships between catch and
discharge or floodplain area, and discharge and floodplain area are directly related to
precipitation. As described for lacustrine systems, empirical models for estimating catch
as a function of discharge or floodplain area can be developed using regression analyses
and historical catch, discharge, and floodplain data. Discharge and floodplain area can
be estimated for various precipitation scenarios. Total annual catch is estimated by
inputting the estimated floodplain area or discharge to the appropriate empirical model.
For example, Welcomme (1976, 1980) developed empirical models estimating annual
catch per kilometre of river reach as a function of floodplain area per kilometre of river
reach for African rivers, and Sagua (1993) developed an empirical model relating mean
total catch and mean river discharge for the Niger River at Mopti. Similar models can
be developed using flood area or discharge data and total annual catch data.
Assessing the effects of temperature changes on fish yield in lacustrine
systems
This method employs empirical models to estimate maximum sustainable yield in lakes
as a function of mean annual air temperature and morphoedaphic index (MEI). The
MEI is calculated as the total dissolved solids divided by the mean depth. A similar
approach was used by Schlesinger and Regier (1983) to evaluate effects of
environmental temperatures on the yields of subarctic and temperate fishes in North
America. These authors developed a number of models of the form log10 MSY =
aTEMP + blog10 MEI + c , where MSY is the maximum sustainable yield, TEMP is the
mean annual air temperature, MEI is calculated as above, and a, b, and c are constants.
Similar relationships could be developed for other areas of the world, including lakes
within a particular country or a particular region. Such models are not suited for use
with lakes that 1) exhibit wide fluctuations in depth, 2) do not conform to a typical
carbonate-bicarbonate chemical type, or 3) contain a large area of swamp. Box 14.1
describes an example of using environmental data, fish yield regression equations, and
temperature increase estimates to assess the impact of climate change on eastern
Canadian lake fish yields.
Fisheries
14-13
Box 14.1 Example: Assessing the impact of climate change on the
spatial pattern of freshwater fish yield capability in eastern
Canadian lakes
Minns and Moore (1992) used existing environmental data, fish yield regression equations
developed by Schlesinger and Regier (1983), and climate model estimates of air temperature
increase to estimate the effects of climate change on the spatial distribution of fish yield
capability in eastern Canada.
A total of 406 watersheds were selected in eastern Canada (excluding the Great Lakes), rang-
ing in size from 100 to 45,000 square kilometres. Watershed boundaries were then put into a
GIS. Climatological data for 1951-1980 from 179 stations in eastern Canada were used to
construct a mean annual temperature map of eastern Canada which, in turn, was used to
estimate the average water temperature for each watershed unit. Output data from three differ-
ent general circulation models were then used to produce maps of estimated mean annual air
temperatures for eastern Canada and to estimate an average temperature increase for each
watershed. These results were then used to develop a 1 ºC isotherm map for eastern Canada.
Species distributions were also developed for each watershed.
The fish yield regression equations of Schlesinger and Regier (1983) for lake whitefish, north-
ern pike, and walleye were used to estimate yields of these species for current and estimated
temperature regimes by watershed. The yield and species distribution maps were then com-
bined to form a regional model estimating the spatial distribution of yield capability in eastern
Canada with and without climate change. For a mean temperature increase of 4.5 ºC, the
model estimated a substantial redistribution of fishery capabilities. Areas currently supporting
high yields became marginal, and areas at the margin or outside the current species ranges
became optimal. Yield capabilities were estimated to be unchanged in only 12 to 19 percent of
the three species’ ranges, and the overall effect was a decline in yield capability.
Assessing the effects of precipitation changes on yield in marine
systems
As in studies for freshwater systems, numerous studies have investigated potential
climate effects on marine fisheries using time-series data and regression analysis, and
these studies show good correlations between fishery yield and environmental condi-
tions. For example, Megrey et al. (1995) used time-series data to develop models re-
lating age-0 pollock abundance in the Gulf of Alaska to precipitation. Studies con-
ducted in the United States, Senegal, the Gulf of Mexico, and Australia have demon-
strated the influence of rainfall on shrimp production (see Garcia and Le Reste, 1981).
Particularly good correlations between total annual shrimp catch and the previous two
years of total annual rainfall have been identified; both positive and negative relation-
ships have been found, depending on the specific area or the species. This approach
only indirectly assesses the effects of continental discharge or variability in salinity.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
14-14
Assessing the effects of temperature changes on yield in marine
systems
Most studies evaluating climate impacts in marine systems have focused on the effects
of temperature change (see Beamish, 1995). Many have evaluated time-series yield and
climate data to develop empirical models that permit estimation of yield as a function of
environmental temperature. For example, Regier et al. (1990) used empirical data from
several sources to develop a model of the Arrhenius form for estimating the stabilised
commercial penaeid shrimp yield (kilogram/hectare of intertidal vegetation) as a
function of mean annual air temperature. The Arrhenius form of an exponential
relationship may be given as loge k = a – b (1/T), where k is the rate constant, T is the
absolute temperature (K), and a and b are coefficients estimated by regression analysis.
This same approach could be used to develop models for other fisheries. For example,
Muter et al. (1995) evaluated North Pacific sea-surface temperatures (SST) and
identified significant correlations between catches of pollock (large catches associated
with warm temperatures in the Gulf of Alaska) and red king crab (decreased crab catch
10 years after a low SST anomaly) and SST.
14.2.3.2
Estimating changes in habitat quality, availability, and
distribution
This approach draws qualitative evaluations of impacts to fisheries (species-specific or
overall) from quantitative estimates of habitat suitability, availability, and distribution.
The individual approaches discussed below include methods that 1) evaluate total
habitat availability as a function of precipitation or sea level, 2) evaluate habitat quality
as a function of temperature, or 3) evaluate habitat suitability as a function of multiple
environmental parameters, including temperature and precipitation. Data needs may
include bathymetric and topographic maps, aerial photographs, or satellite imagery for
the surface waters for the habitats of concern; historical data on sea levels, lake levels,
surface water area, streamflow, or river stage; species-specific physico-chemical habitat
requirements; historical precipitation and temperature data; and future precipitation and
temperature scenarios. Impacts are assessed by comparing habitat quality, availability,
or distribution under historical and projected future climate conditions.
Assessing the effects of precipitation changes on habitat availability in
lacustrine and riverine systems
River and stream hydrographs are graphical representations of changes in streamflow
over time (e.g., minimum flows in late summer, maximum flows during spring). The
shape of the yearly hydrograph and the magnitude, timing, and duration of flood events
have been shown to play an important role in the maintenance of riverine fish stocks
(Welcomme, 1976, 1985; Lowe-McConnell, 1987; Poff and Allan, 1995; Galat and
Frazier 1996). Similar importance has been attributed to seasonal changes in lacustrine
conditions (such as depth and shoreline inundation). In this approach, regression
analyses are used to develop models for estimating aquatic habitat availability as a
Fisheries

function of lake level, surface water area, streamflow, or river stage. This type of
approach is widely used in North America to monitor fish and wildlife (including
submerged aquatic vegetation) habitat and to identify rates and trends of habitat loss
(see Orth et al., 1991; Neale, 1994; Galat and Frazier, 1996). The regression models
are developed for estimating lake level, river stage, streamflow, or surface water area at
important fisheries habitats (such as nursery habitats and spawning areas) as a function
of precipitation. These models can then be used to estimate habitat availability under
different precipitation scenarios. The development and use of these models will require
close interactions with water resource specialists to assist in estimating precipitation
effects on water resources (see Chapter 6). Estimates can then be applied to the maps
and photographs of the fisheries habitats to infer impacts from changes in water depth
and inundation.
Assessing the effects of sea level rise on habitat availability in shallow
water marine areas
A number of studies have shown positive relationships between habitat availability and
the growth, recruitment, or annual yield of a fishery (for example, see Turner, 1977,
1992; Turner and Boesch, 1988). For habitats that are directly linked to sea level, such
as coastal and estuarine areas and coral reefs, the loss or gain of habitat due to changes
in sea level should reflect similar changes in the fishery resource. For some habitats, the
rate of sea level rise may also be important. For example, if sea level rises at a rate that
exceeds the capacity of coral to grow upward and remain in the photic zone, the corals
may die.
The suggested approach uses regression analysis to develop models of the relationship
between habitat availability and sea level. Depending on the fishery of concern, these
habitats could include submerged aquatic vegetation, coral reefs, mangrove stands, mud
flats, and others. The changes in habitat availability that could result from changes in
sea level are estimated using map and image analyses together with the approach used
to evaluate biogeophysical effects of sea level rise presented in the Coastal Zones
chapter (Chapter 7). The rate of sea level rise may also be compared to data on the
accretion rates of marshes or growth rates of corals to infer possible impacts associated
with the rate of sea level rise. The rate of sea level rise may be estimated following the
methodology discussed in the Coastal Zone chapter (Chapter 7).
If suitable yield and habitat data are available, it may be possible to develop models of
the relationship between fishery yield and habitat availability (see Boesch, 1988;
Turner, 1992). Habitat availability can then be input to the models to provide estimates
of yield under different sea level scenarios, and impacts are assessed by comparing
current yields with estimated yields under the different sea level scenarios.
Assessing the effects of temperature on habitat suitability – thermal
habitat
UNEP/IVM Handbook
14-16
This species-specific approach compares projected water temperatures to species-
specific thermal habitat (i.e., thermal limits and preferences), and can be applied to a
particular habitat or for multiple habitats within a large geographic area. For example,
Meisner (1990) estimated loss of thermal habitat in two southern Ontario streams, and
Eaton and Scheller (1996) estimated thermal habitat loss for the continental United
States.
In this approach, maximum temperature profiles can be developed for selected aquatic
habitats. Water temperatures for different climate scenarios can be obtained directly
from climate models, or estimated from historical and projected air temperatures [see
Stefan and Preud’homme (1993) for an approach to estimate stream temperatures, and
Hill and Magnuson (1990) for an approach to estimate lake temperatures] or from ex-
pert opinion. The estimated temperatures are then compared to species-specific pre-
ferred temperatures and temperature limits to infer potential impacts. This procedure
quantifies the amount of suitable thermal habitat within a particular water body, or the
thermally suitable water bodies within a region, for a particular species on the basis of
its thermal biology.
Assessing the effects of multiple stressors on habitat suitability using
habitat suitability models
This species-specific approach includes the development of habitat suitability index
(HSI) models for individual species of concern. Habitat suitability modelling was
developed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service to aid in impact assessment and habitat
management, and HSI models have been developed for more than 100 species of North
American terrestrial, freshwater, and marine biota (Hays, 1987). The models
incorporate environmental variables such as water temperature, water depth, dissolved
oxygen (DO) concentrations, and substrate composition. These variables are measured
on continuous scales, and individual suitability curves are developed for each variable.
These individual variable curves are then combined to produce an index of habitat
suitability that is also continuous, ranging from 0 (unsuitable habitat) to 1.0 (optimally
suitable habitat). Because of the flexibility in incorporating variables, these models can
be useful for species with complex life cycles, such as anadromous species.
The specific variables to be included will depend on the known habitat requirements of
the target species and the availability of appropriate data. Estimated changes in water
temperature can be directly put in the models and also used to estimate DO levels for
model input. Estimated precipitation must be converted to changes in streamflow.
The strength of any HSI model is a direct function of the availability of the ecological
and physiological data for each species of concern as well as the availability of habitat
data. In the absence of such data, professional judgement may be used to develop some
components of the models, although this will lessen the strength of the suitability
estimation. If species interactions (competition, predation) are known, these parameters
can be incorporated into the models. Following construction of species-specific HSI
models, habitat suitability can be estimated for specific habitats using historical (or
Fisheries
14-17
current) climatic, hydrological and ecological data. Suitability values can then be
calculated for climatic and hydrological conditions associated with future climate
scenarios. Box 14.2 presents an example of the application of an HSI model in the
evaluation of the effects of climate change.
Procedures for developing HSI models are presented in Hays (1987), and these proce-
dures are amenable for developing spread-sheet based models. Alternately, Micro-HSI
is an existing DOS-based software package used to calculate existing HSI models and
develop new models.3
Box 14.2
Example: Habitat suitability model for white and brown shrimp
and application to evaluating effects of climate change
Turner and Brody (1983) developed HSI models for white and brown shrimp inhabiting the
northern Gulf of Mexico. The model parameters included water temperature, sea level, salinity,
substrate composition, and amount of estuarine and intertidal vegetation. A mean water
temperature between 20 ºC and 30 ºC was considered optimal for growth, and temperatures
below or above this range were considered less than optimal. The percentage of marsh and
submerged grassbeds in or near a bay or estuary was considered the most important variable
in the shrimp HSI models. A 100 percent coverage of vegetation was considered to be optimal.
To evaluate potential effects of climate change on habitat suitability, estimated changes in
temperature can be directly put in the models; the effects of sea level rise must first be related
to impacts on estuarine and intertidal vegetation. With all other parameters being optimal, with
an increase in mean spring water temperature from 30 ºC to 35 ºC, the HSI models would
estimate a 50 percent reduction in habitat suitability.
14.2.3.3
Evaluating physiological and life history constraints on growth
and reproduction
This approach considers the potential effects of climate change on the growth and
reproduction of target fish species as a function of species-specific physiological
constraints. Specifically, the methods link climate parameters with specific physio-
logical (thermal tolerance, growth rates, mortality rates) parameters to infer species-
specific responses to estimated changes in climate. Data requirements may include
historical and estimated climatic parameters and species-specific physiological data.
Impacts to the fishery are assessed by comparing species-specific physiological res-
ponses under historical and estimated climate conditions. The greater the difference in
the physiological response (such as in mortality or growth rates) between historical and
estimated climate conditions, the greater the potential for impacts to the fishery.

Assessing the effects of temperature changes on mortality
This species-specific method used the empirical relationships between natural mortality,
asymptotic length or weight, a species-specific growth coefficient, and mean annual
water temperature developed by Pauly (1980) to estimate the exponential coefficient of
natural mortality under historical and estimated air temperatures. All else being equal,
the higher the estimated coefficient of natural mortality, the greater the mortality of a
particular fish stock. The empirical models were developed using data from 175 fish
stocks from 84 species, including marine and freshwater species from tropical to polar
habitats.
Use of these models will permit estimation of the natural mortality for particular fish
stocks under various annual temperature scenarios. These models overestimate natural
mortality for strongly schooling pelagic fishes such as herrings (Clupeidae) (Pauly,
1983). To address this, Pauly suggests reducing estimates of natural mortality for such
species by 20 percent. The natural mortality estimates can also serve as input to stock
assessment models to estimate changes in standing stock or annual yield.
Assessing the effects of temperature change on growth using
bioenergetics modelling
This species-specific method uses a bioenergetics simulation model originally developed
by Kitchell et al. (1977) and commercially available from the University of Wisconsin
Sea Grant program as the Bioenergetics Model 3 (Hanson et al., 1997). The model is
available in an IBM-compatible format.4  It is applicable to riverine and lacustrine
systems and may be especially useful for well-controlled aquaculture systems. The
model processes data on fish physiology, diet composition, energy density and water
temperature and generates consumption and growth estimates. The model includes a
database containing specific information for 33 taxa, including 5 marine and 6 salmonid
taxa. Species not included in this database can be added and modelled using species-
specific parameter values. Climate change impacts on fisheries resources are inferred
by putting historical and projected water temperatures into the model and estimating
growth and feeding rates under those temperature conditions.
This model is data intensive. Data requirements include historical and projected water
temperatures for the habitats of concern and species-specific physiological data for each
species of interest, including consumption, respiration, and digestion/excretion data.
The Bioenergetics 3 species database can be used to provide surrogate-species data in
the absence of species-specific data.

For a given temperature scenario, the bioenergetics model estimates growth and feeding
rates for an individual of a species, and biomass production for the entire cohort.
Results for individuals may be extrapolated to the resource as a whole.
Assessing the effects of temperature change on physiological processes
Because fish are poikilotherms, the rates of all their physiological functions are directly
dependent on environmental temperature, and any climate-related changes in
temperature may dramatically affect the biological processes controlling growth,
reproduction, development and other physiological parameters. Wood and McDonald
(1997) offer a review of the effects of temperature on the physiology of marine and
freshwater fishes.
Regier et al. (1990) (also see Lin and Regier, 1995) used the Arrhenius equation, which
describes the effect of temperature on the specific rate constant k in chemical reactions,
to examine the effects of temperature on various aspects of fish physiology. Regier et
al., (1990) used this relationship to relate standard metabolic rate, egg incubation
period, and mortality rate to absolute temperature for a number of freshwater and
marine fish; growth rates for marine and freshwater algae; and crustacean plankton
biomass. Lin and Regier (1995) fitted appropriate versions of the Arrhenius equation to
data for standard and active metabolic rates, hatching rate, growth rate, and critical
swimming speed of sockeye salmon and largemouth bass. Similar models may be
developed to examine the potential effects of climate-related temperature changes on
other aquatic biota of interest.
14.2.3.4 Using historical analogy
Historical analogy can be used to estimate potential impacts to fisheries resources for
areas for which extensive fisheries and oceanographic time-series data are available
(Glantz, 1990). In this approach, the status and the response of fisheries resources to
past environmental conditions are assessed and used to estimate the nature and direction
of responses to future climate conditions. Many of the studies presented in Beamish
(1995) follow this approach in evaluating potential climate effects on northern marine
fish populations. Data needs include time-series data for any number of environmental
parameters such as water temperature, hydrology, water chemistry, oceanic conditions,
and atmospheric conditions, together with corresponding biological data (such as
biomass, catch, primary productivity, and recruitment). These data can then be used to
obtain qualitative or quantitative estimations of the resource in question. The
availability of long-term time series of environmental and biological data sets represents
the most significant limitation of this approach, and these types of data may be very
limited or absent for specific fisheries resources. Box 14.3 presents an example of using
historical analogy.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
14-20
Box 14.3
Example: Using historical analogy to examine climate change
and marine fish distributions
Murawski (1993) evaluated time-series data sets for 36 fish and squid species sampled in
standardised bottom-trawl surveys of the north-west Atlantic Ocean from 1967 to 1991. Anal-
yses of these data revealed a continuum of distributional responses associated with seasonal
and annual variations in water temperature. Mean and maximum latitudes of occurrence of the
species were regressed against average surface and bottom water temperatures and indices
of relative abundance from spring and autumn trawl surveys, and significant regressions were
developed for 17 of 36 species. Variations in water temperature were significant in explaining
changes in mean latitude of occurrence for 12 of 36 species. For pelagic species, mean
catches shifted poleward by 0.5-0.8º latitude for each 1 ºC increase in average water tempera-
ture. Species exhibiting the greatest poleward range extension in relation to water temperature
were primarily temperate-water migrants.
Murawski postulated that variations in the functional responses of distributions to temperature
change due to environmental warming may alter trophic relationships among fishes of the
ecosystem, including species that are important prey for a variety of fish and marine birds and
mammals. Changes in mean shelf temperatures may alter distributional overlap among some
prey and their predators and thus may change the balance of predation mortality rates among
competing predator species. Furthermore, the quantity, species composition, and geographic
distribution of fisheries yields in marine ecosystems such as the North Atlantic are apt to shift
considerably in response to climate warming.
14.3  Testing the method
Before proceeding with a full-scale assessment, it is critical to look at the feasibility of
using any particular methods. Figure 14.1 presents a framework for identifying and
evaluating methods and developing an appropriate assessment approach. The selection
of appropriate methods will consider, in part, a number of factors, including:
1. the specific fishery resource of concern;
2. the nature of the estimated climate change;
3. the specific data needs of each method;
4. the availability of existing data;
5. the availability of time and resources to collect new data; and
6. the capability to integrate analyses with other sectors, mainly water resources and
coastal resources.
The species-specific approaches may be the most difficult to accurately use, largely
because of the relative absence of data on life history and physiology for species in
some regions of the world. In some cases, data from other taxa, i.e., species of the same
genera, family, or guild (Jobling 1981; Lin and Regier, 1995), may be used in place of
species-specific data. In the absence of species-specific or other data, professional
judgement may be used to estimate life history and bioenergetics variables. In contrast,
Fisheries
14-21
difficulties associated with the overall catch and yield approaches will be largely
associated not with the lack of biological data but rather with the absence of
hydrological and environmental information. Certain methods lend themselves better to
use of expert judgement. For example, in the absence of suitable data, a Delphi ap-
proach can be used to develop HSI models based solely on expert judgement (Crance,
1987).

Figure 14.1
Process framework for selecting methods for assessing potential
climate impacts to target fishery resources.
It is important to note that not all of the cited methods must be used. The methods
should be selected to address the goals of the assessment, the expected changes in
climate, and the best use of the available data. It may be true that a single method will
be sufficient. Alternately, a weight-of-evidence approach employing multiple, inde-
pendent assessment methods may be deemed appropriate, and in most cases will provide
a more robust evaluation of potential climate effects. In situations where little data
exist, expert judgement can be sufficient, although this will increase the level of
uncertainty of, and decrease confidence in, the assessment results.
The descriptions of data requirements provided with the methods discussions above are
the basis for screening background information and sources of data. Since the methods
also tend to focus on a particular climate variable (or set thereof), those methods can be
screened for their sensitivity to the appropriate climate factor (e.g., precipitation,
temperature, water level). Specific geographic regions can be considered for their
vulnerabilities to climate change. Particular species of fish or entire fisheries can be
screened for their ecological and economic importance and for their potential
vulnerabilities to climate change.
Models can be tested if sufficient data are available (Carter et al., 1994). Validation
studies look at how closely estimations of a particular fisheries model track real-world
observations. However, it is important to note that oftentimes sufficient data are lacking
to carry out detailed validation studies. Nonetheless, a given fisheries model may be
perfectly suitable to use for a climate change assessment. Sensitivity analysis examines
how the output of a particular fisheries model changes with changes in its structure or
the actual values that are input into the model. This kind of analysis is helpful to see if
the model will respond reasonably to the likely changes in climate variables. In the end,
the experts carrying out the assessment will need to make a judgement about the overall
validity, applicability, and usefulness of any specific fisheries model and to what level
of uncertainty will the results be considered acceptable.
14.4  Scenarios
14.4.1 Climate change considerations
Chapter 3 discusses climate change scenarios in detail. Of critical importance to the
fisheries assessment is the conversion of the climate scenario data into useable input for
the fisheries methods. For example, the output of climate models typically includes
estimates of changes in air temperatures and in the magnitude, duration, and
distribution of precipitation. These models do not, however, provide direct information
on potential changes in water quality or hydrologic parameters that directly affect
freshwater and marine coastal fisheries resources, or on potential changes in ocean
Fisheries
14-23
currents and the distribution of upwelling zones that are important to pelagic marine
species.
To assess the vulnerability of the fisheries to climate change, estimated atmospheric
climate changes must be translated into changes in environmental variables that are
directly important to fisheries resources, such as lake and sea levels, ocean currents,
streamflow and water temperatures (Meisner et al., 1987; Christie and Regier, 1988;
Kennedy, 1990; see Figure 14.2). Only when these climate-induced hydrologic changes
are estimated can the responses of the fishery resource (e.g., reduced growth rates or
reproductive success, increased mortality, and altered distribution) be identified and
evaluated. The assessment of fisheries impacts will depend critically on the analyses
from the water resource and coastal resource sectors and their associated hydrologic
models. Multisectoral, multidisciplinary teams will be necessary, and fisheries
specialists will have to interact with technical specialists from other resource areas
when developing riverine hydrographs; estimating sea and lake levels, water
temperatures, and salinity; estimating the timing and extent of floodplain inundation and
the fate of wetlands; and estimating the distribution of oceanic currents and upwelling
zones under different climate change scenarios.
14.4.2 Socio-economic considerations
Changes in abundance of specific fisheries will have direct social and economic effects.
Changes in commercial fisheries will have very direct economic impacts, either
beneficial or negative. These economic impacts can be measured directly through
changes in total monetary value of the catch and can be used in a cost-benefit analysis.
Changes to recreational fisheries may also incur socio-economic impacts. Decreases or
increases in abundance of key recreational species will affect the likelihood of people
travelling to a specific place to fish and thus directly affect the livelihood of that sector
of the population employed supporting the recreational fishery. This in turn can affect
local or regional economies (USEPA, 1995).
These same impacts to fisheries can affect subsistence activities. Areas that are highly
dependent on fish as a daily food source may be significantly affected by climate
change impacts to fisheries resources. Reduced subsistence catches may result in direct
local or regional impacts on human health. In extreme cases the drying of a tropical
water body could lead to entire villages having to move. In other cases it may require
people to migrate on at least a seasonal basis to other fishing grounds. So it is important
to look at socio-economic impacts outside of the formal economy. Chapter 2 discusses
socio-economic scenarios in detail.

14.5  Autonomous adaptation
Given any set of effects of climate change, certain changes in fishery populations and in
the human social and economic systems that depend on them will happen without
purposeful intervention. One of the more obvious examples will be the likely poleward
redistribution of marine fisheries. There will not be significant barriers to this process
occurring naturally. Other changes in fish distributions, including freshwater fisheries,
Fisheries
14-25
are also likely without human management and intervention. The changes estimated in
the assessments will provide a guide for these adjustments, and monitoring programs
can confirm these changes.
Some social and economic responses to climate change are likely to be virtually
autonomous also. It would be expected that subsistence fishers will switch to other
available species, and some groups may migrate to stay with favoured fish species or to
find new fishing grounds. Stocking of at least some species better adapted to the
changed conditions is likely, even without major public programs.
14.6  Planned adaptation
As previously discussed, global warming is expected to lead (on average) to higher air
temperatures and changes in the geographic distribution, temporal pattern, and magni-
tude of precipitation. These changes in temperature and precipitation in turn affect
marine and freshwater habitats and eventually lead to changes in the distribution,
composition, and abundance of fisheries species around the world. However, specific
estimations of effects to habitats and fisheries resources are difficult to develop given
the uncertainty associated with the overall accuracy of estimations of climate change,
and the very difficult problem of providing regional- or finer-scale estimations of
climate changes. Nonetheless, the development of preliminary cost-effective adaptation
measures is warranted and should be initiated if a potential for adverse impacts is
indicated by the impact assessments. The adaptation measures may then be revised as
confidence in the climate and impact projections increases and as technology improves.
The development of adaptation policies and strategies to address problems that may
arise as a result of climate-induced impacts to fisheries will depend on a number of
physical, ecological and socio-economic conditions. These conditions include 1) the
nature of the climate change impact on the fisheries resource (changes in thermal
habitat, habitat dewatering, alteration in timing of flood flows, etc.); 2) whether the
fisheries resource of concern is marine, estuarine, or freshwater based; 3) the location
(latitude) of the fishery resource; 4) whether the resource of concern comprises cold-
water or warmwater species; 5) the current status or condition of the fishery of concern;
6) whether the fishery is commercial or subsistence (or some combination thereof); and
7) the overall importance of the fishery of concern to a local, national, or regional
economy. Equally important, the development of adaptation responses specific to the
fishery resource will be dependent on and interrelated with the adaptation activities in
other sectors, particularly water resources, coastal zone resources, and agriculture and
land use.
Adaptation responses (Table 14.5) specific to fishery resources may address issues of
water management strategies; habitat construction, modification, and protection; man-
agement of catch levels, development of new fishing techniques and equipment; de-
velopment of new processing infrastructure; development of new species strains for
stocking; and management of land use within important watersheds. In many countries,
UNEP/IVM Handbook
14-26
the development and implementation of appropriate adaptation strategies will be
strongly dependent on the availability of financing. Adaptation can become increasingly
important, relative to autonomous adjustments, for scenarios that lead to a net reduction
in available fishery resources. This net reduction may come about either from actual
reductions in productivity or from significant geographic redistribution of the resources.

14.6.1 Marine fisheries
Impacts to marine fishery resources will most likely result from climate-induced
changes in ocean currents (IPCC, 1996) and upwelling zones (Glantz, 1994). Fishery
responses to these changes may include shifts in the locations of major fishing grounds,
reductions in overall fish production (biomass), and changes in species compositions.
Potential changes to the physical environment may be among the most difficult changes
Fisheries
14-27
to estimate with any reliability, and technical options to directly modify climate effects
on the open ocean environment, in contrast to estuarine and freshwater habitats, are
limited or non-existent.
In general, measures for adapting to potentially major redistributions of fisheries stocks
may include 1) developing fishing fleets capable of travelling greater distances to new
fishing grounds or 2) building coastal and ocean-going processing facilities to expedite
delivery of catch to customers. It is likely that countries with modern fishing fleets and
the most refrigeration and processing capability will be willing to pursue relocated
fisheries even at the cost of travel to more distant and different locations. Because of the
heavy capital investment and debt in many of the marine fishing fleets of wealthier
nations, there will be a real need to locate new or substitute fisheries to pay for this
investment (Glantz and Feingold, 1992).
Land use may also be an important factor in this process of change. Fish processing
plants may have to locate to new areas along with the fishing fleets. Available land in
the coastal zone for new processing facilities may be scarce, and in some countries too
valuable for this use (Feingold, 1992). Alternately, ocean-going processing capabilities
will need to be developed.
As difficult, if not more so, will be establishing new catch limits or geographic res-
trictions. This may require international negotiations and fishing treaties or imple-
mentation of limited entry schemes. This type of fisheries management has been
difficult in the past, and is not likely to be easier in the future (IPCC, 1996). For
example, shifts to substitute fish stocks may add stress to stocks currently under
significant fishing pressure (Regier and Goodier, 1992). Nevertheless, reducing fishing
pressure now on overexploited species may increase their resilience to the direct effects
of climate change and to the possible effects of redistributed fishing pressure.
14.6.2 Estuarine fisheries
Estuarine fisheries are anticipated to be most at risk to climate change as a result of sea
level rise and its effects on coastal habitats such as wetlands. In contrast to the
uncertainty associated with estimates of precipitation and temperature change, there is a
greater capacity for estimating sea level rise and anticipating its expected impacts on
fisheries. There is some certainty to the estimated current and future rate and magnitude
of sea level change (Douglas 1991; Titus and Narayanan, 1995), and the importance of
sea level to some critical estuarine fisheries (e.g., shrimp) is at least partially
understood. For example, the world-wide catch of shrimp is directly related to the
acreage of wetland nursery habitat (Turner, 1977, 1992). Shrimp are frequently major
exports and sources for hard currency. Furthermore, in some developing countries the
bycatch from fishing for shrimp is saved, rather than disposed overboard, and used for
domestic consumption. Oftentimes, the fish that comprise the bycatch are too expensive
to gather directly even though they serve as an important domestic protein source.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
14-28
In addition to the greater confidence in estimates of sea level rise, present day tech-
nology provides an opportunity to design and if necessary implement adaptation
strategies for addressing anticipated impacts to estuarine fisheries resources. Estimates
of sea level rise provide some capability to estimate the fate of specific coastal wetlands
and other nearshore nursery areas that are important for specific fisheries resources.
This capability thus gives coastal and island countries some ability to plan for the
impacts of sea level rise on these nursery areas and therefore the long-term health of
their fisheries. Countries that are committed to maintaining their coastal fisheries will
have to maintain undeveloped inshore areas to which coastal wetlands (like mangroves)
can retreat (Kjerfve et al., 1994). For example, mangroves, an abundant and important
coastal nursery habitat, are quite vulnerable to sea level rise (Ellison, 1993). These
habitats may be lost as sea level rises. However, if inland areas estimated to be
inundated as a result of sea level rise are protected from development, they will be
available for mangrove colonisation and establishment. Thus, government policies
related to development in the coastal zone will be critical to maintaining wetland
nursery areas and thus fisheries. Fisheries adaptation will be potentially competing with
various parts of the public and commercial land use/development sector.
14.6.3 Freshwater fisheries
Climate impacts to freshwater fisheries will be more directly related to changes in water
temperature (at higher latitudes) and to changes in water availability (lower latitudes).
In northern latitudes, inland freshwaters are estimated to become warmer, and some
coldwater species are likely to be replaced by warmer water species (Meisner et al.,
1987; Shuter and Post, 1990). The warmwater species may naturally expand their
ranges into newer, thermally suitable habitats if invasion routes are available, or may be
stocked into isolated water bodies. These warmer water habitats are also likely to show
increases in fisheries production if nutrients are present and if prey are present for
higher order species. However, the rates of environmental change (mainly temperature
extremes as well as thermal structure) and the availability of replacement species will
greatly affect a system’s intrinsic ability to adapt to different climate conditions.
Countries are likely to have more technical capabilities to address freshwater impacts
when compared to marine or estuarine impacts. Stocking with new species may be the
most feasible technical solution where there are natural or human-made barriers to mi-
gration into newly warmer habitats. Some countries already have the hatcheries and
associated infrastructure for stocking major aquatic systems like the Great Lakes in the
USA, and aquaculture is practised at least on a small scale in most countries throughout
the world. For freshwater habitats with human-made obstacles to fish passage,
removing or modifying obstructions may represent the most straightforward and
effective adaptation measure. This approach may be necessary to maintain and restore
threatened and endangered stocks of anadromous fisheries.
Perhaps the greater impacts that may occur to fishery resources will be to the existing
drought- prone regions that may become even drier, such as Southern Africa (Hulme,
Fisheries
14-29
1996) Changes in the magnitude, timing, and duration of precipitation events could lead
to significant regional or local reductions of aquatic habitat. Reduced precipitation with
resultant declines in lake or stream levels could reduce or eliminate critical habitats
such as spawning areas. Alternately, changes in the timing of precipitation events could
lead to a lack of water during key stages of the life cycle and thus threaten the health
and diversity of fisheries populations. Temperature changes in drought-prone regions
could also affect runoff and therefore affect hydrological changes.
Maintaining productive fisheries in the face of changes such as these will be difficult.
Some countries may lack sufficient technical or monetary capability to respond to
altered climatic conditions. In addition, current droughts in some regions are already
putting increasing pressure to use diminishing water supplies for irrigation and hydro-
power generation, and these needs are likely to conflict with the need for protecting
fisheries resources.
14.6.4 Aquaculture
Aquaculture may become a major area for freshwater fisheries resource adaptation.
With climate warming, aquaculture is likely to become more productive (IPCC, 1996).
Fish production rates will be higher, other things being equal, in warmer water. The
aquaculture practised throughout the world includes both marine and freshwater
fisheries. As a consequence, technical knowledge for fisheries production using aqua-
culture methods is well developed and widely available. The use of aquaculture may be
most appropriate for areas (i.e., equatorial latitudes) which will experience altered
precipitation regimes that result in reduced water availability. In these areas, the de-
velopment of large-scale aquaculture facilities could be used to increase fish production
to offset losses in natural fish production.
Although aquaculture may represent a major area for adaptation, the suitability of
aquaculture will be highly dependent on the availability of water, and the implementa-
tion of aquaculture measures will most likely require co-ordination with the water de-
mands for agriculture, industry, and domestic use. Additionally, a number of aspects
currently associated with aquaculture practises world-wide may affect the suitability
and acceptability of aquaculture as an adaptation activity. For example, current prob-
lems associated with aquaculture include 1) accidental introduction of non-native spe-
cies to the wild; 2) water quality and habitat degradation due to discharge of operational
wastes, 3) direct conversion of natural fish habitat to aquacultural facilities; and 4) the
abuse of additives in aquaculture stocks.
Use of aquaculture to offset losses in the marine environment may be more problematic.
Species raised in sea pens may be just as vulnerable to major changes in currents as are
wild stocks.
UNEP/IVM Handbook
14-30
14.7  Summary and implications
As the world’s fisheries shift in distribution and abundance and the human population
continues to grow, the demand for fish in the diet is likely to continue growing. Where
fishing remains profitable, commercial fishers will respond with the necessary changes
in gear. An even more motivated group will be people around the world who depend on
fish for subsistence or for the major part of protein in their diet. These people will adapt
to the extent feasible out of sheer necessity. They will fish new species and make
feasible modifications to their gear. Yet adapting for the long run in fisheries will
require shifting attitudes away from a short-term economic and social focus. Productive
fisheries collapse from the economic pressures that lead to overfishing, particularly in
combination with environmental variability (Glantz and Feingold, 1992). As most
fisheries are currently fully exploited or overexploited (IPCC, 1996), there is little
evidence that people have yet learned to manage fisheries resources for the long term.
Yet this is critically important. The countries whose people are most dependent on
natural resources like fish are typically those with the least capacity to cope with the
coming changes. These countries need sustainable development strategies that relieve
current levels of pressure on their resources and increase their resilience to climate
change (Secrett, 1992).
Adaptation planning must begin with the results of the impact analysis and the best
estimate of which fishery resources are at risk. Adaptation policies and techniques must
be screened (Benioff and Warren, 1996) for their effectiveness in reducing vulnerability
of fishery resources. One can map an iterative process of performing a impact
assessment, screening for high priority adaptation options, and then again examining the
vulnerabilities. High priority adaptations to climate change (Smith et al., 1997) may
address (also see Chapter 5, Adaptation):
• 
irreversible consequences;
• 
habitat loss/extinction;
• 
decisions, such as coastal land use, that keep options open for the long term; and
• 
reversing unfavourable trends such as declining fish stocks.
Given the uncertainties of the impacts of climate change, it is important to begin with
feasible, cost-effective adaptations and those adaptations that may provide benefits even
without significant climate change effects. An example of this might be the preservation
and restoration of wetlands. Wetlands are often important spawning areas for fish and
critical nursery areas for early life stages. But wetlands also are known to provide
benefits such as flood control and improved water quality. Another example might be
the reduction of fishing pressure on overexploited stocks. This would improve the
condition of a fish stock even without climate change, and should make those stocks
more resilient in the face of this new stress. A step like this may not be costly; however,
if more than one country is involved, it may still be difficult to accomplish. This
Fisheries
14-31
example shows, however, that there may be steps that will provide value to society
regardless of the extent of climate change.
If quantitative methods such as cost-effectiveness analysis or benefit-cost analysis to
select adaptation options are not appropriate to a specific situation, other qualitative
methods may work. Multicriteria analysis can use qualitative approaches that do not
rely on quantifying benefits in dollars or other metrics. Decision makers are asked to
identify policy objectives and subjectively determine how well the adaptation measures
may meet the objectives (Benioff and Warren, 1996).
The management of water resources is frequently a result of a mix of government
policies and market forces that promote conflicting activities such as navigation, flood
control, agricultural irrigation, and hydroelectric power production. This conflict among
water use sectors has affected fisheries for decades in many countries. Rarely are
fisheries the primary consideration in large-scale management of water resources.
Indeed, the growing world population is likely to increase demand for all these other
uses of water, in addition to the fisheries, even without climate warming. Thus as
various water management practices become increasingly necessary for irrigation,
hydroelectric power, and drinking water supplies, policies for fisheries management will
have to evolve to fit within those constraints. These policies can be modified to support
fisheries if sufficient consensus within a society exists that there are key fisheries
resources worth preserving. Thus, adaptation measures for fisheries must be consistent
with adaptation measures in other sectors. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that fisheries
would ever take precedence in direct competition with these other sectors. Promoting
integrated water management should become a high level policy goal if societies are to
give fisheries their greatest opportunity to prosper under a new climate regime.
One of the most important considerations in assessing potential impacts and developing
adaptation strategies is the understanding of the relationships among fisheries and the
other sectors. The fisheries analysis must be built primarily on the analyses of water
availability within the water resources sector and, for coastal marine fisheries
resources, also on the analyses of the loss of coastal wetland areas performed for the
coastal zone sector. In addition, the management of other resource sectors must be
considered when developing any fisheries adaptation strategies. For example, the pre-
servation of wetlands is as much an issue of land use and water management as it is of
fisheries production. Water availability is also a major issue for agriculture and must be
considered in the development of fisheries adaptation strategies. This thread of
interaction and integration of the water-dependent fisheries sector with other sectors will
need to be considered throughout any specific impact and adaptation assessment for any
particular fisheries resource.
