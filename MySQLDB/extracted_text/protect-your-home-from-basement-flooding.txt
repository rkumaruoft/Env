About the Institute
for Catastrophic Loss Reduction
The Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction (ICLR), established in 1997, 
is a world-class centre for multidisciplinary disaster prevention research 
and communication. ICLR is an independent, not-for-profit research 
institute founded by the insurance industry and affiliated with 	
Western University.
The Institute’s mission is to reduce the loss of life and property caused 
by severe weather and earthquakes through the identification and 
support of sustained actions that improve society’s capacity to adapt to, 
anticipate, mitigate, withstand and recover from natural disasters.
ICLR’s mandate is to confront the alarming increase in disaster losses 
caused by natural disasters and to work to reduce disaster deaths, 
injuries and property damage. Disaster damage has been doubling 
every five to seven years since the 1960s, an alarming trend.
The greatest tragedy is that many disaster losses are preventable. 
ICLR is committed to the development and communication of disaster 
prevention knowledge. For the individual homeowner, this translates 
into the identification of natural hazards that you and your home are 
vulnerable to. The Institute further informs individual homeowners 
about steps that can be taken to better protect your family and 	 	
your home.
The purpose of this handbook is to outline steps that you can take 
to protect your home from basement flooding. Some of these measures 
are simple and free; others cost money. All contribute to reducing the 
risk of basement flooding.

Start reducing your risk of basement flooding
Quick and free things everyone can do to reduce the 
risk of basement flooding
There are some easy and free things that you can do to reduce the risk that 
your home is flooded.
Never pour fats, oils and grease down your drains!
Reduce home water use during heavy rains.
Keep the storm sewer grates on your street clear of yard waste, 
leaves, garbage, ice and snow.
Clean and maintain your eavestroughs and downspouts at least 
once a year.
Store anything expensive, valuable or irreplaceable upstairs
These are some initial steps to prevent basement flooding. However, if you 
have had water in your basement in the past then you need take more 
significant steps to protect your home.
Six reasons you should invest in ways to protect 
your home
1 	 If water got into your home before, it could get in again unless you 
take action.
2 	 Finished basements used as living space may have more furniture	
 and expensive electronics, making it more important to protect 	
your home.
3 	 Overland flood damage is not covered by your home insurance 
policy. A small cost now can save you a lot of money after the flood.
4 	 Floods may have long-term health impacts on your family if they 
cause moulds to grow.
5 	 Homes in older neighborhoods are usually more vulnerable than 
homes in newer neighborhoods.
6 	 Climate change scientists report that severe rain storms are 
occurring more often in many parts of Canada, and they are 
expected to continue to increase in frequency and severity.

1.	 Talk to your local government.
The first step is to visit your municipal government’s website or contact 
the public works, utilities or building department to find out about their 
programs on reducing basement flooding. 
2.	 Talk to your insurance agent or broker.
Talk to your insurance agent or broker to find out about what types
of water damages are covered under your policy. Trying to make a claim
after you have suffered water damage is not a good way to find out
that you don’t have the proper coverage, or that overland flooding
is uninsurable.
3.	 Get a plumber to conduct a plumbing 
investigation of your home
Each home is unique. A plumber or contractor who is fully 
versed in home and municipal drainage systems can best help 
you protect your home. Understanding the risks of basement 
flooding and the nature of your plumbing and sewer 
connections will help to ensure that the best course of
action is taken to reduce future water damage in your
home. Your municipality may help you find a plumber.
First steps
What advice do they offer?
Are there engineering studies on your subdivision?
How do you report basement flooding to them?
What does your local government suggest you do?
Do they offer any financial assistance programs for plumbing 
installations?
Do they recommend contractors or plumbers?
What permits do you need in order to begin?

1. Taking action on your own
Seal cracks in foundation walls and basement floors 
Sealing cracks is a simple way to help reduce basement flooding in 	
your home. In many cases, cracks can be effectively sealed from inside. 
Most of the time, you should not have to dig anywhere beside the 
foundation to repair them.
Disconnect your downspouts, add extensions and splash pads
Downspouts are designed to 
convey water from eavestroughs 
and down the side of the house. 
Downspouts often direct water to 
the surface of the lot, but in many 
cases they may be connected to 	
the weeping tile or the sanitary 
sewer lateral.
• 	 Downspout extensions should 
be directed at least 1.8 metres 
(6 ft) away from the home, and 
the flows should be directed 
over permeable surfaces, such 
as lawns or gardens, and not 
paved surfaces including driveways or walkways.
• 	 Talk to your municipal government before you do this.
When connected to the municipal sanitary sewer system, eavestrough 
downspouts can contribute a substantial amount of water to these 
systems. Because of the 
environmental impacts resulting 
from combined sewer overflows 
and the increase in basement 
flooding risk that connected 
eavestroughs cause, it is illegal to 
connect downspouts to municipal 
sewer systems in many Canadian 
communities.
If your downspout looks similar to these, chances are it is 
connected to your weeping tile or the municipal sanitary 
sewer system and should be changed.

2.	Questions for a plumber
In many cases, it is the more substantive measures that are the most
effective way to reduce basement flooding. Many of these require the
assistance of a licensed plumber. Municipal governments often require
permits for the plumbing and drainage improvements described in this
document. Talk to your municipal government to make sure you or
the person you have hired have the proper permits.
Is poor grading causing my flooding?
The slope of your yard is very important to keep water away from your
home and foundation. This helps keep the basement dry. You should:
•	 Check your lot to see if your yard slopes away from your home. 
Look everywhere, including under stairs and decks. The soil directly 
beside your foundation wall should be 
approximately 10 cm to 15 cm higher than the 
soil 1.5 metres away from the foundation.
• 	 If you notice that the ground close to the 
foundation of your house has settled beside 
your foundation wall, fill it in with a solid, 
compactable soil – like clay – so that there is a 
constant slope away from the foundation.
• 	 Talk to the department in your municipal 
government that is responsible for building 
inspections and stormwater drainage about
swales (the grassy depressions that help direct water away from 
homes) and lot grading. Ask them where swales should be on your 
property, and where water from your lot should be directed.
Do I have a weeping tile?
A weeping tile or foundation drain is an underground perforated pipe
that runs along the bottom of a home’s foundation. Older Canadian
homes, for example those built before the 1940s or 1950s, may not
have foundation drains. If you find that your home does not have a
foundation drain and you experience serious infiltration flooding, you
should consider having a foundation drain installed.

If you do have a foundation drain, it can become clogged with debris
or collapse in some sections. A plumber will need to decide if it can be
fixed or it needs to be replaced.
If a plumber does fix or replace
the weeping tile, ICLR recommends 
including a cleanout port with 
access from the surface to allow 
easier maintenance in the future.
       What is my weeping tile 
connected to?
A weeping tile that is directly 
connected to your home’s sanitary 
sewer lateral increases the amount of water that enters the 
municipal sewer system during a heavy rainfall. Disconnecting 
your weeping tile from the sanitary or storm sewer can help 
reduce the chances that you and your neighbours will 	
experience basement flooding. It can also reduce the risk of 	
structural damage to your home.
        Do I have a sump-pump?
When weeping tiles are disconnected from sewer laterals, a sump-pit
and sump-pump must be installed. The sump-pump is used to pump
water from the weeping tiles to the lot’s surface. In some unique 		
cases, municipalities may recommend a sump-pump to pump 
weeping tile water to the storm sewer system.
Is my sump-pump working correctly?
Sump-pumps get blocked and can fail if they are not routinely
inspected and maintained. On-going maintenance helps to
ensure the sump-pump keeps working long term. You can
inspect the sump-pump by pouring water into the sump pit,
and seeing whether or not the pump starts automatically.
Sump-pumps need electricity. They stop working during a power 
failure. You should use a back-up system to make sure the pump works 
when you need it. Talk to your plumber or electrician about options.

       Do I need a backwater valve?
A mainline backwater valve is placed directly into the sewer lateral at
the foot of your basement wall. The device allows sewage to flow in
only one direction – out of your house. When sewage begins to move
toward your basement, the valve closes. Some municipalities offer
subsidies to offset the cost of installing a backwater valve. Make sure
you install the type of valve recommended by your municipality.
Installation of the backwater valve may reduce the cost of insurance
or be required as a condition of insurability.

Some municipalities have backwater valve rules. In most cases they
require the normally open (or open-port) mainline backwater valve.
This valve is installed directly into the sanitary sewer lateral, and serves
to protect all home plumbing fixtures from sewer backup.
When installing backwater valves:
The valve should be installed based on the manufacturer’s installation
instructions, which have specifications for placement and grading.

Proper placement and 
installation of the backwater 
valve is extremely important. 	
If placed in the wrong location
relative to other plumbing
fixtures on the sanitary lateral,
the valve could be bypassed
and provide no protection. 	
If the valve is placed in the 
wrong location, sewer backup 
pressure can build up and crack 
the basement floor and lead 	
to flooding.
If the weeping tiles are still 
connected to the sanitary sewer 
lateral downstream of the valve, sewage could be forced back into the 
weeping tiles and lead to structural damage to the foundation, this can 
also lead to infiltration flooding.
Like other parts of your home, backwater valves require periodic 
maintenance to ensure proper performance. An improperly maintained 
valve may fail during a flood. Most mainline backwater valves come 
with a see-through top so you can check to see if it is clogged with 
debris. The valve should be checked regularly to ensure that it will 
function properly when it is needed. You will likely need the help of a 
qualified plumber to carry out maintenance of the valve.
After a backwater valve has been installed do not use plumbing, for 
example, flushing toilets, running dishwashers, washing machines, or
running taps, etc. during intense rainfall events. If the home plumbing
is used when the backwater valve is closed, water will have no way
to exit your home until the valve has reopened. If you’re not sure if the
valve is closed, check it – you should be able to see it through the
clear, plastic top.

        Are my sewer laterals working properly?
Sewer laterals, the pipes that connect a home’s plumbing system to
the municipal underground sewer system, should be regularly 
maintained. Over time, the sanitary sewer lateral can get clogged with
fats, oils and grease (FOGS) or other debris, which can restrict flows
and cause sewer backup. This may especially be a problem in older
homes when the lateral has not been routinely maintained. Sewer 
laterals are accessed through the cleanout port, which may be located 
either inside of the basement or outside of the home, close to where 
the lateral enters the home.
To find out how well your sanitary sewer lateral has been maintained,
you should talk to a licensed plumber who can carry out a camera
inspection of your lateral. A plumbing inspection will identify if it is
contributing to your flood risk. Some communities recommend that
homeowners replace their sewer lateral every 30 years or so.
        Basement windows
If your basement windows are
close to the surface of the
ground, window wells and
window well covers can reduce
the crevasses that allow water
to enter. The outer edges
of the window well should fit
snugly against the wall. The
bottom of the well should be
15 cm below the underside
of the window with a mixture
of gravel and sand to allow
drainage.
