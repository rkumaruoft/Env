Introduction: Climate change is a global phenomenon with far-reaching consequences, and its impact on
human health is a growing concern. The intricate interplay of various factors makes it challenging to accu-
rately predict and understand the implications of climate change on human well-being. Conventional meth-
odologies have limitations in comprehensively addressing the complexity and nonlinearity inherent in the
relationships between climate change and health outcomes.
Objectives: The primary objective of this paper is to develop a robust theoretical framework that can effec-
tively analyze and interpret the intricate web of variables inﬂuencing the human health impacts of climate
change. By doing so, we aim to overcome the limitations of conventional approaches and provide a more
nuanced understanding of the complex relationships involved. Furthermore, we seek to explore practical
applications of this theoretical framework to enhance our ability to predict, mitigate, and adapt to the diverse
health challenges posed by a changing climate.
Methods: Addressing the challenges outlined in the objectives, this study introduces the Complex Adaptive
Systems (CAS) framework, acknowledging its signiﬁcance in capturing the nuanced dynamics of health
effects linked to climate change. The research utilizes a blend of ﬁeld observations, expert interviews, key
informant interviews, and an extensive literature review to shape the development of the CAS framework.
Results and discussion: The proposed CAS framework categorizes ﬁndings into six key sub-systems: ecological
services, extreme weather, infectious diseases, food security, disaster risk management, and clinical public
health. The study employs agent-based modeling, using causal loop diagrams (CLDs) tailored for each CAS
sub-system. A set of identiﬁed variables is incorporated into predictive modeling to enhance the understand-
ing of health outcomes within the CAS framework. Through a combination of theoretical development and
practical application, this paper aspires to contribute valuable insights to the interdisciplinary ﬁeld of climate
change and health. Integrating agent-based modeling and CLDs enhances the predictive capabilities required
for effective health outcome analysis in the context of climate change.
Conclusion: This paper serves as a valuable resource for policymakers, researchers, and public health profes-
sionals by employing a CAS framework to understand and assess the complex network of health impacts
associated with climate change. It offers insights into effective strategies for safeguarding human health
amidst current and future climate challenges.

1. Introduction
Climate change affects virtually all aspects of human life and
health [1]. Clear evidence of the human health impacts of climate
change has been presented in many research papers [2−9] and inter-
national reports. Climate change impacts the health of individuals
and populations through multiple pathways. Many independent vari-
ables lead to emergent outcomes that are difﬁcult (or impossible) to
predict with hypotheses that entail reductionism or linearity based
on mechanistic understandings of reality [10]. For instance, ﬂoods
induced by climate change and population displacement may impact
accessibility to safe drinking water and increase infectious diseases
[11]. Conversely, risk management actions and climate change adap-
tation policies can mitigate disaster [12]. The health impacts of cli-
mate change here also refer to complex, large-scale, non-linear
interactions within which behaviors may evolve along with the
potential for powerful feedback loops to rapidly precipitate catastro-
phe [13].
Complexity theory has evolved to study contemporary problems
and investigate the interconnected nature of unpredictable phenom-
ena [14,15]. The Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) theoretical frame-
work can be used to study complex contemporary problems. CAS are
systems involving multiple components that react to other compo-
nents in the system and the system as a whole, thereby leading to
emergent phenomena [16−18]. These components are also referred
to as adaptive agents or simply as agents.
The principles of CAS can be used to model the impacts of climate
change and understand their human health implications. Human vul-
nerability to climate change is considered dynamic and depends on a
place-based socio-biophysical system, affected by the continuous
interaction of multiple stressors (climatic, socioeconomic, political,
and cultural), as well as the interactions of components with that sys-
tem [19−21]. Understanding the interrelations of agents within a CAS
allows a pinpointing of areas that are priorities for adaptive learning,
that can represent potential maladaptive trajectories, or that could
be susceptible to positive and negative feedback [19,20]. The ﬁrst
step in designing a CAS for climate change health vulnerability is to
produce a high-level representation of the system, capturing its
major sub-systems or dimensions and their linkages [21]. Each sub-
system is composed of many variables and interconnections. The sec-
ond step is to generate a conceptual model of the inner workings of
each sub-system [21]. Finally, more speciﬁc conceptual models may
be generated addressing particular sub-systems of interest.
A collaborative approach among different stakeholders may be
adopted at any stage of each system representation, and the com-
plexity of systems representation may depend on data availability to
establish relationships between variables [19−21]. For example,
Groundstroem and Juhola apply systems thinking to identify climate
change impacts on international bioenergy supply systems [19]. They
establish an analytical framework laying out the sub-systems and
interconnections of a bioenergy supply system. They rely on causal
loop diagrams (CLDs) to map out the system’s structure and networks
to reveal causalities and feedback within the system. The result is a
complex and interconnected network of social, environmental, politi-
cal, and economic sub-systems, and various cascading impacts of cli-
mate change affecting the bioenergy supply [22]. Sellberg et al.
(2021) analyze how a complexity perspective was used across twelve
resilience assessment and planning cases in contexts of development
and natural resource management in different parts of the world
[23]. They found that several core complex adaptive system strategies
were employed, including adapting the systems approach to a local
context, identifying external drivers of change and interactions across
scales (administrative to biophysical boundaries), conceptualizing
social-ecological
interactions,
and
identifying
historical
trends,
regime shifts, and alternative future scenarios. These CAS strategies
are mainly concerned with capturing the complexity of the social-
ecological systems and making sense of them through meaningful
interrelated simpliﬁcations. Actual system complexity is difﬁcult to
fully capture in a modeling approach, yet simpliﬁcations of system
linkages can provide a better understanding of cascading impacts
[19,23]. Challenges may also exist with data availability and statistical
correlation methods to model aspects of the variable linkages, or
shortcomings may exist when using simulated data that may not
fully or reliably capture future conditions. It is generally strongly rec-
ommended that model weaknesses and limitations be identiﬁed and
critically assessed, so that results can be appropriately qualiﬁed [19].
Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) is an approach capable of modeling
complex systems in their disaggregate form [24−26]. Other system
methods such as system dynamics [27] and network analysis [28],
capture system complexity as an aggregate of its parts and have been
used in modeling various aspects of public health [25,29]. However,
these are less effective than ABM for capturing the non-linear rela-
tionships of a systems’ agents or variables. In this paper, we present a
novel framework based on CAS and ABM to model some aspects of
human population health impacts of climate change. Our model
reﬂects the values and data needs of community, government, and
non-government organizations for planning actionable adaptation
strategies to the short- and long-term health impacts of climate
change [13,30].
We envision this framework to be relevant in a wide range of
applications. From a public health perspective, for instance, it may be
applied to assess the emergence of particular infectious diseases due
to changing climate and environmental conditions at the level of
individual health facilities, as well as in predicting which health facil-
ities may be overburdened by increasing healthcare demand. Model
outputs can be intersected with social condition data to identify
underlying causes that predispose people to health risks associated
with climate change, and to design adaptation interventions to cli-
mate change that may reduce human health impacts. A holistic
assessment of the complex system causing health impacts of climate
change can further identify vulnerabilities in disaster risk manage-
ment and could function as a support tool to target resources to
strengthen the resilience of health services. Finally, the proposed CAS
based framework is intended to be executed using quantitative
methods and models (e.g., ABM), and would identify data gaps that,
once addressed, could contribute further to a richer and more accu-
rate understanding of the health impacts of climate change.
The remainder of this paper is organised so that Section 2
describes the methods used for developing the conceptual CAS based
framework; Section 3 presents subsystems of the relationship
between climate change and human population health, a list of data
sources based on a literature review to demonstrating or suggesting
the quantiﬁability of each subsystem, and a methodology for agent-
based modeling (ABM) of the subsystem; Section 4 provides a vision
for how the CAS based framework may be implemented for scenario
simulation and decision support, its limitations, as well as possible
entry points for local expert knowledge; and Section 5 presents con-
clusions.
2. Methods
The motivation for this framework is based on years of accumu-
lated ﬁeld experience of the authors in Bangladesh, India, Cambodia,
Malawi, South Sudan, Rwanda, Paraguay, the USA, Canada, and else-
where [11,31−43]. A visualization of the full methodological process
used to develop this framework is portrayed in Fig. 1 and is based on
four steps: (i) authors’ observations and knowledge gathered from
long-time practical ﬁeld experience with the health impacts of cli-
mate change in developing countries in terms of global, public and
clinical health, sustainability of agriculture, ecological degradation,
disaster management, and systems thinking about environmental
health issues; (ii) narrative literature review; (iii) mobilization of

2
expert opinion by formal interview, and (iv) key informant inter-
views through informal discussion.
The initial approach was developed based on the ﬁeld experiences
of the authors. This was then augmented collaboratively through con-
sultation with key informants from NGOs, government ofﬁcials, and
educators working on climate change’s health impacts in coastal Ban-
gladesh and the Lake Chilwa Basin of Malawi. Both countries are highly
affected by, and have limited capacity to cope with ongoing climate
change, and its associated extreme weather events [11,44−46].
Five questions guided our consultations with the experts and key
informants: (i) What are the commonly occurring diseases for which
climate change is a driver? (ii) How do extreme weather events affect
health outcomes? (iii) How does and will climate change impact agri-
cultural production, food security, and health? (iv) Does ecological
degradation amplify the impacts of climate change on health? (v)
How can disaster management and public health policy help mitigate
climate change-related health impacts? Feedback from experts and
key informants in Bangladesh and Malawi, as well as author ﬁeld
observations conﬁrmed that climate change, and its associated
extreme weather events have human health impacts which are mag-
niﬁed by human behavior, and many socio-ecological variables such
as ecological degradation, and agriculture and public health policy.
With the goal of identifying and reviewing probable issues related
to developing a CAS based framework, the authors and other experts
used brainstorming and deductive (theoretical) and inductive (statis-
tical) based reasoning as described by Rotello and Heit [47]. A tar-
geted narrative literature review was conducted to conﬁrm and
reinforce the objectives of the study and expert and key informant
inputs by classifying, assessing, and mixing the ﬁndings of high-qual-
ity studies related to one or more issues relevant to the CAS of health
impacts of climate change. This literature review utilized Google
Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science to identify subsequently
reviewed literature related to the topic. Key search terms included:
“climate change and health,” “complex adaptive systems and health,”
“ecological services and health,” “climate change and infectious dis-
ease,” “climate change and extreme weather events,” “climate
change, disaster management and health” and “climate change and
clinical health.”
3. Results
The authors’ experience, expert knowledge and opinion, key
informant interviews, and the literature review provided data and
information to identify and link six major sub-systems of a CAS as
these relate to the human health impacts of climate change:(i) eco-
logical services [48], (ii) extreme weather events [49], (iii) infectious
diseases [49], (iv) food security [49], (v) clinical public health [3], and
(vi) disaster risk management [3,48].
A useful visual tool to represent the complex interactions between
changing climatic conditions and health outcomes are causal loop
diagrams (CLDs) [50,51]. “Cause and effect” indicates that one ele-
ment must lead to another either in absolute (deterministic) or prob-
able (stochastic) ways [52]. CLDs help identify the circular nature of
complex cause-and-effect relationships [53], show the big picture for
understanding the interrelationship of the elements, and facilitate
recognition of the system structure that generates overall health
impacts while providing a descriptive and visual model of the CAS of
health impacts of climate change. A high-level CLD of the linkages
between the sub-systems is shown in Fig. 2X. The CLD demonstrates
the interaction of the six sub-systems in a complex web and the posi-
tive and negative relationship(s) to one another. Hence, the health
impacts of climate change can be viewed as the outcomes of the
Fig. 1. Methodological ﬂow chart for developing the framework. First, ﬁeld observations allowed the authors to link the health impacts of climate change (CC) in terms of six sub-
systems: ecological services (ES), extreme weather events (EW), infectious disease (ID), food security (FS), disaster risk management (DM) and clinical public health (CPH). Experts,
key informants, and a literature review then verify the ﬁeld observations. Following the ﬁrst step, the interactions of the sub-systems are visualized and established as a complex
adaptive system (CAS) of health impacts of climate change.

complex causal inter-relationships, interactions, and interconnectiv-
ity of elements within and between these six sub-systems [17,54].
The high-level CLD of the health impacts of climate change can be
used as a guide to further break down each sub-system into many
lower-level elements, which interact with each other inside and out-
side the dimensions of the high-level subsystems in non-linear and
dynamic relationships [17,23,56−58]. Conceptually, this is shown in
Fig. 2Y.
Through an extensive narrative literature review and based on the
authors’ ﬁeld experience in Bangladesh, India, Malawi, and Paraguay,
we developed CLDs relative to the six sub-systems that are integral
in capturing the interconnectedness between climate change and
population health in these countries: ecological services, extreme
weather, infectious disease, food security, clinical public health, and
disaster management.
3.1. CLDs of the health impacts of climate change
In Sections 3.1.1 to 3.1.6, the CLDs of the health impacts of climate
change are illustrated with respect to the six sub-systems. The CLDs
below have been developed based on knowledge acquired in Bangla-
desh and Malawi and therefore, reﬂect system dynamics pertaining
to those regions. Here, they are used to exemplify the proposed
framework and will require modiﬁcation for different geographical
areas. In the following CLDs, positive causal links (marked by a plus
sign [+] to mean “same direction”) represent a positive correlation
between variables, so that an increase in variable “A” leads to a rise
in variable “B,” and a decrease in “A” leads to a reduction in “B”. It is
essential to understand that the plus sign at the arrowhead does not
necessarily mean that the variables are increasing, only that they are
changing in the same direction (i.e., increase or decrease together).
Negative causal links (marked by a minus sign [] to mean “oppo-
site”) represent a negative or inverse correlation, so that an increase
in variable “A” leads to a decrease in variable “B.” [59]
3.1.1. Ecological services
Ecological services are the central pillars of all life [60]. The Mil-
lennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) proposed four ecosystem serv-
ices categories: regulating, provisioning, supporting, and cultural
[61]. Regulatory services include ﬂood and disease regulation, water
puriﬁcation, pest control, disease control, disaster mitigation and pre-
vention [62]. Provisioning services make available food and essential
nutrients, medicines and medicinal compounds, fuel, energy, liveli-
hoods, and cultural and spiritual enrichment for humans [62]. Provi-
sioning services contribute to cleaning water and air [62,63] and, in
this way, have positive health effects [2]. Both regulatory and provi-
sioning services have direct and indirect consequences for human
health and well-being, and each is an important component of the
epidemiological puzzle that can act to stem the tide of infectious and
non-communicable diseases [62].
As shown in Fig. 3., climate change impacts provisioning and reg-
ulatory ecological services in several ways [64,65]. Ongoing climate
change has a negative effect on habitat and vegetation health, reduc-
ing biodiversity and air quality while increasing the spread of pests.
Changes to the hydrologic cycle and extreme weather events further
affect food production and the availability of clean water, allowing
human disease and illness to increase. In particular, ecosystem modi-
ﬁcations help spread pathogens into new ecological niches [5]. How-
ever, “healthy ecosystems and environments are necessary for the
survival of humans and other organisms, and thus constitute the
basis of sustainable development” [66]. Ecological degradation has
been associated with increased global connectivity, encouraged the
intermixing of human and animal habitats, and has ampliﬁed climate
change impacts on migration, all of which have affected human well-
being, as many wildlife species are or have become reservoirs of
pathogens that threaten human health [67].
3.1.2. Extreme weather events
Extreme weather events are deﬁned as anomalies denoting a sig-
niﬁcant departure from long-period average weather observations
such as atmospheric temperature, wind speed, and precipitation.
Droughts, periods of extreme heat or cold, and ﬂoods are examples of
extreme weather events [7], and with accelerating climate change,
the frequency and magnitude of these events are likely to increase
[44,68,69]. Extreme weather events have profound impacts on health
[70] and the environment [71], affecting “individual ﬁtness, popula-
tion dynamics, distribution and abundance of species, and ecosystem
structure and function” [72]. For example, extreme heat and cold
cause immediate rises in weather-related mortality [73,74]. More
broadly, natural hazards, including ﬂoods, tsunamis, earthquakes,
tropical cyclones (e.g., hurricanes and typhoons), and tornadoes have
been secondarily associated with infectious diseases, including diar-
rheal diseases, acute respiratory infections, malaria, leptospirosis,
Fig. 2. Schematic of the effects of climate change on health as a complex adaptive system (CAS). Part [X], the causal loop diagram (CLD) or systems thinking diagram [55], captures
the interactions of the six sub-systems (i.e., ecological services, extreme weather events, infectious disease, food security, disaster risk management, and clinical public health) and
represents the descriptive model of a CAS of the health impacts of climate change. It shows that the sub-systems are connected in a complex way. For example, climate change
increases extreme weather events and reduces agricultural production, leading to food insecurity, and food insecurity leads to clinical public health issues such as malnutrition. The
impacts of extreme weather events may be countered with the robust design of public health services and policy. In part [Y], A, B, and C represent different variables of each sub-sys-
tem. These variables interact within the individual system and with the adjacent variables of other sub-systems, and all sub-systems interact with each other as a whole. Thus, the
CAS model captures the overall health impacts on agents (individual or population) from climate change.

measles, dengue fever, viral hepatitis, typhoid fever, meningitis, teta-
nus and cutaneous mucormycosis [75,76].
Extreme weather events can cause severe crop damage and jeop-
ardize agricultural production and socio-economic development, and
directly affect livelihoods and food security [77−79] . One review
estimates that, 83 % of the damage and losses caused by droughts are
in agriculture, and that by 2050 crop yields are projected to decrease
by 25 % if climate change is not mitigated. Extreme weather events
damage crops and leave households vulnerable to weather shocks
[80]. Damaged crops lead to food insecurity, eventually leading to
poor nutrition and clinical public health impacts. Extreme weather
events can also cause food safety issues. For example, in some set-
tings, Salmonella has become prevalent in lettuce and green onion
products because of drought followed by heavy rainfall [81]. Some
examples of how extreme weather may impact health are shown
in Fig. 4.
3.1.3. Infectious diseases
CLDs of the health impacts of climate change concerning infec-
tious diseases are presented in Fig. 5. Climate change and other
anthropogenic activities (such as agriculture) play a signiﬁcant role
in infectious disease emergence [82−84] and in the spread and re-
emergence of infectious diseases in natural and socio-ecological sys-
tems [85]. Among infectious diseases, vector-borne (e.g.: mosquito-
borne) diseases, including malaria, dengue, viral encephalitis [86],
yellow fever [87], and West Nile virus [88] are among those most
sensitive to a changing climate [89]. For example, “globally, tempera-
ture increases of 2−3 C would increase the number of people who,
in climatic terms, are at risk of malaria by around 35 %, i.e., by several
hundred million, as the seasonal duration of malaria would increase
in many currently endemic areas” [90]. A changing climate will also
inﬂuence the incidence of water-borne infectious diseases such as
cholera [11,91,92] and diarrheal disease [88]. Climate change has
increased the risk of ﬂoods, and with these, the spread of multiple
infectious diseases such as malaria, dengue, hepatitis A, cholera,
schistosomiasis, and diarrhea. Moreover, skin and soft tissue infec-
tions, conjunctivitis, and dermatitis are related to ﬂood events [93].
3.1.4. Food security
The CLD in Fig. 6 depicts the causes and effects of climate change
on food security (sustainable agriculture), and human health. Climate
change will negatively affect food systems [94−96] and thus food
security [97−101]. Food security affects individual and population
health [96,102], which depends on access to adequate, affordable,
good-quality, and nutritious food [103]. However, climate change
potentially affects all aspects of food security, including food access,
utilization, and price stability [104]. Climate change also increases
the occurrence of food safety hazards at various stages of the food
chain, from primary production through consumption [105]. Increas-
ing CO2 threatens human nutrition by reducing zinc and iron in C3
grains and legumes (e.g., wheat, rice, oats, barley, potatoes, soybeans,
cassava, etc.), the primary dietary source of zinc and iron for billions
of people and the deﬁciency of zinc and iron in crops is a substantial
global public health problem [106]. Food insecurity leads to undernu-
trition [107], which has short-term mortality, morbidity, and disabil-
ity consequences. There are also long-term consequences for adult
height, intellectual ability, reproductive performance, and metabolic
and cardiovascular disease [108].
Natural disasters jeopardize agricultural production and develop-
ment [109], and as described above, climate change tends to increase
the frequency and intensity of weather-related natural disasters
[110]. Natural disasters signiﬁcantly impact the agricultural sector by
directly damaging livestock, crops and the ecosystems that support
their supply chain and agriculture, affecting livelihoods, food secu-
rity, and nutrition [77,111,109].
3.1.5. Disaster risk management
Realistic disaster risk management plans enable societies to pre-
pare for and mitigate the severe effects of extreme weather events.
The CLD of health impacts of climate change in relation to disaster
management and clinical public health is shown in Fig. 7. Climate
change has signiﬁcantly increased the extent and magnitude of disas-
ters [112]. Appropriate disaster preparedness can maintain food sup-
ply and thus food security and individual and population health.
Disasters have the greatest impacts on the poor and most vulnerable

people [113]. Effective disaster management is crucial in reducing the
risks and effects of climate change on socioecological systems [114].
For example, building resilient infrastructure, deploying early warn-
ing systems, implementing well-informed community preparedness
plans, and developing sound emergency response procedures can
lessen the impacts of natural disasters by reducing loss of life and pre-
venting damage to sanitation, health, and food supply infrastructure.
3.1.6. Clinical public health
Clinical public health systems and their resilience determine the
magnitude of a health crisis associated with a disaster, as shown in
the CLD in Fig. 7. Effective health care in a disaster critically depends
on an appropriate disaster preparedness of a health system, the
broader social systems, and how these intersect to promote health
and resilience before, during and after a crisis [91,115,116].
Contributing
factors
to
disease
transmission
after
disasters
include for example: environmental risk factors; type of endemic
organisms; population demographics and characteristics such as
crowding; the pre-event structure and functionality of a clinical pub-
lic health system and its facilities; levels of immunization, and the
magnitude of the disaster [117]. Risk factors for disease outbreaks
after disasters are associated primarily with poor potable water and
or population displacement and the availability of hygienic sanitation
facilities. The capacity to rapidly re-establish effective primary
healthcare delivery post-disaster is vital to reduce the risk of commu-
nicable diseases and death in the affected population [76,118].
3.2. Selection of variables
The CLDs presented in Sections 3.1.1 to 3.1.6 help identify vital
representative variables from the six sub-systems that can be used to
model the health impacts of climate change in a CAS based frame-
work. Using the CLDs, literature review, discussion with key inform-
ants, and formal interviews with experts, a set of representative
variables that affect the health of agents (individual and population)
are identiﬁed and listed in Table 1 to demonstrate the potential value
of this approach. In total, 92 variables are identiﬁed that address eco-
logical services (10 variables), extreme weather events (9 variables),
infectious diseases (11 variables), food security (18 variables), disas-
ter management (23 variables), and clinical public health (21 varia-
bles). Two criteria were considered in selecting variables: (i) the
capacity of the variables to represent quantiﬁable inﬂuences of com-
plex relationships and (ii) their signiﬁcance in capturing maximum
impacts on agents. The variables identiﬁed here are not comprehen-
sive. Instead, they are an illustrative selection based on an assumed/
hypothetical location (informed by the authors’ experience, espe-
cially in Bangladesh and Malawi) where ﬂoods and droughts occur
with increasing frequency due to climate change-related extreme
weather events. These are causally associated with population dis-
placement, disruption in health services, increases in speciﬁc infec-
tious diseases, and acute and chronic undernutrition. The targeted
health impacts in this location are (i) infectious diseases: malaria,
cholera, schistosomiasis, and acute diarrheal disease; (ii) food secu-
rity outcomes: protein energy malnutrition and growth stunting in
children; and (iii) potable water and sanitation and hygiene.
Variables/indicators play a helpful role in highlighting and quanti-
fying problems, identifying trends, and contributing to the process of
priority setting, policy formulation and evaluation, and monitoring of
progress. Most importantly, breaking down a system into multiple
variables and associated linkages helps simplify its complexity while
paradoxically demonstrating complexity by tying together the ele-
ments of the six sub-systems [160]. Only well-deﬁned and carefully

selected variables provide meaningful insight for a model to be useful
in decision-making and policy development [160]. The variables sug-
gested here are within the boundaries of the intended geographic
region, and more may be available from further local sources. The
variables may be different in other scenarios since the health impacts
of climate change vary depending on the speciﬁc scenarios and their
geography.
3.3. Proposed modeling framework
In this section, a framework of CAS modeling [161] of the health
impacts of climate change is presented based on the background dis-
cussion in Section 1.0, the methodology in Section 2.0, and the results
in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.
To reiterate, the health impacts of climate change are the out-
comes of linear and non-linear dynamic relationships with the agents
within the six sub-systems that generate macro-level phenomena
[162]. The health impacts of climate change depend on the interac-
tions of various components (variables) of the sub-systems in ways
that create feedback and cascading effects on the components of the
sub-systems. The interactions of the units of each sub-system can
lead to a nonlinear transformation to macro-level phenomena (emer-
gent properties) [163]. The health impact of climate change is a com-
plex phenomenon, and modeling it requires a method capable of
capturing the linear and non-linear interactions of the agents and the
relationships of the sub-systems [164]. In this modeling framework, a
system dynamics-integrated ABM is proposed for modeling the com-
plex interactions of the variables in Table 1 with agents (individual
and population) within a region of concern.
Using the variables identiﬁed in Table 1 for ecological services {10
parameters: (ES1 . . . ES10)}, extreme weather events {09 parameters:
(EW1 . . . EW9)}, infectious disease {11 parameters (ID1 . . . ID11)}, food
security {18 parameters (FS1 . . . FS18)}, disaster management {23
parameters (DM1 . . . DM23)} and clinical public health {21 parameters
(CH1 . . . CH21)} and the core concepts of agent-based modeling, the
proposed framework is hypothetically illustrated in Fig. 8. These vari-
ables and their variations can represent the actions and interactions
of autonomous agents at different levels of granularity, as individuals
or collective entities, and at different spatial scales, to understand the
emerging behavior of a system and what shapes its outcomes.
Depending on the level of granularity of agents and the scale of their
interaction, different CLDs and sets of variables may need to be
deﬁned for each agent for adoption into ABM. Various commercial
and open-source software packages offer the ability to perform
agent-based modeling (e.g., AnyLogic, AgentScript, GAMA Platform),
and the authors recommend model validation to be included in the
model setup procedure as a way to quantify the implications of lim-
ited data and statistical correlation between sub-system variables
[19].
4. Discussion
To determine the health impacts on agents, the presented frame-
work requires consideration of the overall cause-and-effect relation-
ship of the interconnected variables chosen to represent the six sub-
systems. More speciﬁcally, each set of agents (e.g., industry sectors,
population age groups, health center catchments) will require their
own set of sub-system variables, and interactions between agents
will also have to be considered. Therefore, selecting and parameteriz-
ing appropriate variables is essential for this framework.
The success of this CAS based framework depends on the range
and quality of the data available to represent system variables. In
other words, discovering insights into the dynamics of climate
change-driven health impacts depends on the ability to represent

meaningful deterministic or statistical relationships between varia-
bles for the agents of interest.
The proposed CAS based framework is not restricted by the partic-
ular agent (e.g., governments vs individuals, vs watersheds) of the
sub-systems. It can integrate various types or scales of agents and
variables and allow users to think about the problems of climate
change and health holistically. Physicians, climatologists, biologists,
and social scientists can use this CAS based framework to explore dif-
ferent realizations of health outcomes from climate change scenarios
by developing “What-If’ analysis by adjusting the values of the CLD
variables. For example, testing prolonged drought periods could
directly inform malnutrition potential by examining the climate
change impacts on water supply and farming and agriculture (see
Fig. 4). Such a scenario can be further expanded by testing actions
mitigating the effects of droughts. For example, the Food Security CLD
could be used to simulate a quantiﬁcation of how much farming and
agriculture could vary dependence on local water supply during
drought conditions to maintain minimum or maximum positive
health outcomes. Thus, the CAS based framework can be an accessible
scenario planning tool to explore the health impacts of climate
change, with a view to understanding and identifying solutions
within this complex system.
The proposed framework is expected to guide the development of
a multi-agent-based simulation model. This could be used to support
decisions about ecological services or adapt clinical public health
interventions that seek to ameliorate the health impacts of climate
change. Simulations generated by such an ABM can also be used to
formulate multi-sector adaptation policies.

Fig. 8. A step-by-step illustration of a hypothetical agent-based model. Ecological services, extreme weather events, infectious diseases, food security, clinical public health, and
disaster management inﬂuence climate change and health impacts. This hypothetical agent-based climate change and health impacts model incorporates the six sub-systems’ static
and time-varying causal variables. Part [A] represents the CAS and linkage between each sub-system as an aggregate system modeling approach. In part [B], the interaction of the
agents and sub-system variables is used for the model formulation of the disaggregated parts of a system. In part [C], the model’s ﬁnal process and its purpose are presented. This
hypothetical model represents potential outcomes of the health impacts of climate change on agents of an area Ya where Xn of the population is living.

Evidence- and data-based step-by-step deﬁnition of the six sub-
systems and their identiﬁed agents ensure a broadly applicable deci-
sion model that various stakeholders, including researchers, govern-
ment and non-government practitioners, and policy makers, can use.
The ABM simulation model could help stakeholders understand and
act on factors that shape the health impacts of climate change; facili-
tate knowledge sharing and mobilization among various organiza-
tions and generate new knowledge and information to facilitate
practical implementation of adaptation strategies.
Agent-based modeling of the health impacts of climate change is a
predictive process for forecasting future climatic inﬂuences on infec-
tious diseases, malnutrition, and other aspects of human health
[165]. The proposed model highlights the need for a more complex,
multi-disciplinary, and operationally focused understanding of the
causal dynamics contributing to climate change’s health impacts. It
can also highlight the multiple sub-system effects of carefully tar-
geted and sequenced treatment, prevention, and ecological adapta-
tion interventions. Modeling the health impacts of climate change
can reveal the causal links shaping health outcomes and can also offer
a collective narrative of the complex relationship of variables and
agents. This model is not a goal in itself, but can help identify the
actions needed to reduce impacts using systems thinking for commu-
nity-based health adaptation.
5. Conclusion
Climate change will continue to affect human health through
extreme weather events, changing patterns of infectious diseases,
and impacts on food security, livelihoods and population displace-
ment. These impacts are already profoundly inequitable and will
accelerate among poor and vulnerable people. Climate, biospheric
and ecological factors, as well as disaster management, and clinical
public health planning will largely determine the overall health
impacts of climate change. For example, changing temperature and
precipitation will affect vector-borne disease ecology and related
human infectious disease impacts, and will be inﬂuenced by human
treatment, prevention and adaptation choices and interventions.
Applying transdisciplinary perspectives is vital to identifying and
understanding complex causal relationships, and to designing and
implementing effective prevention and adaptation interventions
(including early warning systems and responses). This is one of the
greatest challenges for global health. Considering the complexity of
climate change and its health impacts, we used ﬁeld observations,
expert input, key informant interviews, and a comprehensive litera-
ture review to capture these dynamics, and propose a CAS based
framework with six subsystems. We propose and conceptually
develop the use of the framework as a foundation for agent-based
modeling of health outcomes, with causal loop diagrams (CLDs)
designed for each CAS sub-system and a set of context speciﬁc varia-
bles identiﬁed for use in predictive modeling. The CAS based frame-
work can be a valuable resource for policymakers, researchers, and
public health professionals seeking to assess, mitigate and adapt to
the multifaceted challenges posed by climate change.
