Developing  
Levels of Service for 
Natural Assets
A Guidebook for  
Local Governments
Preface
Local governments in Canada are responsible for providing their citizens and 
businesses with numerous services. Healthy natural systems underpin their 
ability to do so in a sustainable, cost-effective manner. These natural systems 
will become ever more critical to build local resilience to the impacts of climate 
change. 
Many local governments are beginning to understand, account for and manage 
natural assets as part of their core infrastructure and have begun to develop 
natural asset inventories to formally document data and information about 
natural assets, as they have done for grey infrastructure assets. Others have 
begun to assess how these natural assets contribute to municipal services in 
their jurisdiction by studying their condition and performance across priorities 
including stormwater management, drinking water, carbon sequestration and 
storage. Some have assessed risks to natural assets and the services they 
provide, from factors like land use change, development pressure, overuse, 
forest fires, and climate change. 
While many local governments have taken the steps described above, few have 
robust natural asset management strategies and plans to support them in 
proactively protecting and managing the natural systems they rely on to deliver 
services. Overall, Canada’s municipal sector is at an early stage of using an asset 
management lens to integrate the management of natural assets into municipal 
planning and operations. 
In February 2021, the Municipal Natural Assets Initiative (MNAI) engaged 19 local 
governments and interested organizations to identify opportunities to support 
progress in natural asset management. The participants identified six key 
opportunities:
1/	 Better integrate natural asset management into asset management 
policies, plans and processes. 
2/	 Integrate natural asset management into land use plans, policies, 
zoning, by-laws. 
3/	 Make stronger linkages between natural asset management and climate 
change mitigation and adaptation.
4/	 Build capacity of local government staff in natural asset management. 
5/	 Build awareness/support for natural asset management among key 
decision-makers. 
6/	 Support local governments to work with other jurisdictions, 
stakeholders, or levels of government to achieve natural asset 
management objectives.
MNAI used the findings from this engagement to develop the concept for this 
guidebook, How to Develop Levels of Service for Natural Assets: A Guidebook 
for Local Governments. The guidebook aims to support local governments with 
the first of the six identified key opportunities: to better integrate natural asset 
management into asset management policies, plans and programs. Defining 
levels of service (LOS) is a key element of this.
Local governments in Canada are at a relatively early stage of defining LOS in 
their overall asset management practices for all asset types. Defining LOS for 
any type of infrastructure assets is a notoriously challenging task, and there is 
no commonly recognized approach or framework for developing LOS for natural 
assets. This guidebook, therefore, will evolve over time as local governments 
make progress in this area. 
Note that the instruction provided in this guidebook may also be useful to other 
organizations responsible for protecting and managing natural assets, including 
other levels of government, conservation authorities, Indigenous communities, 
utilities, agricultural producers or other industries that own and manage large 
tracts of land.
Acknowledgments
MNAI would like to thank the Neptis Foundation and the Greenbelt Foundation

How to Use this Guide 
This guide to developing levels of service (LOS) is not prescriptive. Local 
governments are structured differently from one another and while many have 
common goals, they vary in the strategies and plans they develop. They also 
face unique risks and have different infrastructure priorities depending on the 
state of their infrastructure.
This guide shows how local governments might approach defining natural asset 
LOS, no matter what their current priorities or maturity in asset management 
may be. Asset management is an ongoing, non-linear process of managing 
infrastructure to support sustainable service delivery, as shown in Figure 1 
below. The process of natural asset management is shown in the outer circle. 
LOS are defined (or adjusted) in the planning phase of asset management.

1.2.	
What are Levels of Service (LOS)?
Levels of service (LOS) define the expected performance of assets and represent 
a commitment of a local government that will inform asset management and 
financial plans. Using a three-legged stool as an analogy, service represents 
one leg of the asset management stool and it is balanced with cost and risk, the 
other two legs. They are a fundamental building block of asset management. 
Defining LOS enables local governments to link strategic organizational 
objectives with technical and operational requirements of infrastructure and 
is a way to steer a local government to making the best possible investments 
towards sustainable service delivery. 
Local governments usually document service levels in an asset management 
plan (AMP). An AMP is a tactical plan that outlines the current state of 
infrastructure assets and how they will be managed over their lifecycle to meet 
service delivery objectives and strategic priorities. AMPs also document the 
investment required annually and over time to meet those objectives. AMPs 
take a long-term view of infrastructure needs and local governments update 
them every few years to reflect their changing contexts.

It is the responsibility of a local government’s council to approve and monitor 
progress on LOS. Doing so enables them to be transparent and accountable 
for their decisions about service delivery. When councils share information 
about current LOS and associated costs with the public and other affected 
stakeholders, they are better able to communicate the social, environmental 
and financial impacts of improving or reducing services and engage the 
community on their “willingness to pay” for changes in service levels. 
TYPES OF LOS MEASURES1
There are three main types of LOS that, taken together, show how day-to-day 
operational activities of infrastructure will be aligned with and support a local 
government’s strategic objectives: corporate, customer, and technical LOS.
Corporate LOS is a strategic objective used to measure progress on service 
delivery and informs the development of multiple customer and technical levels 
of service linked to that objective. 
Customer LOS is a performance measure that describes the service the 
community should expect to receive, expressed in terms that make sense to 
them. 
Technical LOS is a performance measure that describes the operational 
requirements of infrastructure that will enable the local government to deliver 
the expected customer level of service. In the case of natural assets, these 
would be indicators to measure the ecological performance of natural assets 
in relation to service delivery objectives, and operational performance on 
activities like monitoring condition and ecological health of natural assets, 
maintenance activities to keep individual assets and ecosystems healthy, 
naturalization or restoration activities, or in some cases, disposal (e.g., street 
trees that have died or reached their end of life). 
The graphic below shows how these types of LOS fit into the hierarchy of 
decision-making in a local government.2

Public Works and Engineering Australasia.

DRINKING WATER SUPPLY EXAMPLE: 
Corporate LOS objective: Proactively protect and preserve the primary source 
of raw water. The xx River and its surrounding watershed (drainage area) is 
protected to ensure the local government’s supply is sustainable and impact to 
the environment is reduced.
Customer LOS: There are no disruptions to the community’s primary source of 
raw water. 
Technical LOS: Performance measures associated with source water quality, 
monitoring of source water quality, monitoring ecological health of riparian 
areas, and other local government actions to protect source water. Examples 
include coverage of source water monitoring stations, frequency of monitoring, 
and turbidity of source water. These are specific to managing natural assets 
to protect source water and are different from other technical LOS the local 
government would have related to the quality of drinking water (i.e., tap water 
quality).

Why Develop Levels of Service for Natural Assets? 
When local governments develop LOS for natural assets, it helps ensure: 
	
 Natural assets’ role in service delivery is recognized and there is 
accountability for their management. 
	
 Lifecycle management activities for natural assets (e.g., monitoring, 
maintenance, restoration) make their way into budgets and long-term 
financial plans.
	
 Progress on natural management can inform continuous improvement 
objectives to protect and manage natural assets when strategic plans 
and policies, including land use plans, are updated. 
1.4.	
What is the Difference Between a Local Government’s 
LOS for Natural Assets and Ecosystem Services? 
Knowledge about the ecosystem services that natural assets provide is needed 
to develop asset management-oriented LOS metrics. Examples of ecosystem 
services that natural assets provide in biophysical (or comparable) terms 
include degrees of heat reduction contributed by natural assets, tonnes of 
carbon sequestered, ability to store water or provide habitat for flora and fauna. 
With an understanding of the ecosystem services provided by natural assets 
across a range of services, local governments can then define LOS measures 
for natural assets that represent their commitment (through e.g., conservation 
and management) to sustain or enhance these ecosystem services to achieve 
a desired level of service. Many local governments are now striving to enhance 
ecosystem services through restoration, planting or re-wilding, conservation, 
adaptive management, acquisition, or other activities. Local governments 
may need to collaborate and build partnerships with other landowners or 
government jurisdictions to achieve their desired level of service from natural 
assets as the natural assets upon which they rely may often be owned and/or 
under the jurisdiction of others.
Local governments will need to collect technical data about bio-physical 
ecosystem services to help them define LOS for certain service objectives (e.g., 
drinking water, stormwater, wastewater, biodiversity, climate mitigation and 
adaptation). Section 5 describes the range of ecosystem services that natural 
assets provide and some of the data needed to determine them. 
1.5.	
Natural Asset Inventories are a Foundation for 
Developing LOS for Natural Assets 
Local governments must develop an understanding of the services natural 
assets provide to the community prior to defining LOS they will commit to 
sustaining over time.

An Introduction for Local Governments

Natural asset inventories are one foundational piece that local governments can 
put in place to assist them in developing robust and meaningful LOS for natural 
assets. Developing an inventory or refining it as part of continuous improvement 
efforts is part of the Assessment phase of the natural asset management 
process shown in Figure 1 on page 3. A basic inventory will enable local 
governments to begin to answer the questions:
1/	 What natural assets do we (or could we) rely on for services?
2/	 Where are they located?
3/	 What condition are they in?
A robust natural asset inventory could also answer the questions:
4/	 What is their performance on a range of services they provide to the 
community?
5/	 What are the risks to them and the related services they provide? 
Many variables can be taken into consideration when identifying data inputs for 
natural asset inventories; however, at a minimum, almost all start with two data 
sets: 1) Watershed, sub-watershed, or another catchment area boundary; and 2) 
detailed land cover and land use mapping of the area within the boundary to 
specify natural asset types, which may include3:

RIPARIAN AREAS
GREEN OPEN SPACES
URBAN GREEN 
INFRASTRUCTURE
Groundwater – aquifers
Surface water – rivers
Lakes
Creeks
Streams
Meadows
Grasslands
Bushlands/shrublands

The Canadian Standards Association will be releasing a National Standard for 
natural asset inventories in 2023.
For more information about natural asset inventories and examples, see MNAI’s 
website: Communities – MNAI | Municipal Natural Assets Initiative.
3    Note: This classification is broad and encompasses major natural asset types generally found in a natural asset 
inventory. Note there is no universal classification system for natural assets and depending on an organization’s 
needs, they may wish to add specificity, for example by breaking down forested assets into species types.

Section 2 	Considerations for Defining 
LOS for Natural Assets 
Grey infrastructure assets normally have only one main purpose. Natural assets, 
by contrast, are “multi-taskers” that provide many services and benefits to 
humans and all life. Local governments need to build a holistic understanding 
of the services natural assets provide to their community to ensure their full 
value informs decisions about land use and infrastructure management.
The following are some tips to keep in mind when defining LOS for natural 
assets.
  TIP 1  	
Pay Attention to the Big Picture 
LOS for natural assets can be defined in different types of asset management 
plans, including those focussed on a service (e.g., stormwater service or drinking 
water) or specific natural asset types (e.g., a natural areas management plan or 
an urban forest management plan). 
Developing LOS for natural assets in one service area only (e.g., stormwater 
management) or focusing solely on one natural asset type (e.g., tree canopy) 
risks under-estimating and under-valuing the services nature provides. This 
can lead to sub-optimal land-use decisions that undermine both ecological 
integrity and healthy ecosystems, and services of value to the community. Land 
use changes and management decisions should therefore be informed by an 
understanding of the full extent of services that would be affected if natural 
assets were enhanced, compromised or lost entirely. 
Example: If a marsh in the centre of a city is only considered for its aesthetic 
features and the land faces development pressure, it may be more likely to 
be filled and converted to housing than if a wide range of services the marsh 
provides were determined and valued, including its ability to store water now 
and in a future climate scenario, its ability to sequester carbon, provide habitat, 
access to green space, and regulate the urban heat island effect.
To avoid perverse outcomes from a decision, LOS for natural assets will need 
to reflect multiple service areas and objectives. Understanding the full value of 
services that natural assets bring to the community helps build the business 
case for their protection. Often this leads to more elaborate, qualitative 
valuations of its full range of benefits than is possible for grey infrastructure 
projects. This understanding will support local governments in determining 
the trade-offs associated with their decisions and will help support the 
prioritization of infrastructure decisions. See Section 4.1 for more information 
about valuation approaches for natural assets.

Local governments that have a robust natural asset inventory and 
understanding of the services nature provides to their community may be in a 
good position to develop a specific asset management plan that encompasses 
all natural assets and the priority services they deliver to the community.4 
For example, the City of Edmonton is presenting the Urban Forest Asset 
Management Plan (UFAMP) to council in 2022. It includes LOS measures for its 
natural and enhanced tree assets but it excludes some key natural asset types 
such as wetlands, even though they are an important part of the City’s Green 
Network5. The City may move to develop a broader natural asset management 
plan that encompasses all natural asset types in their jurisdiction in the future. 
See case study of the City of Edmonton’s Urban Forest on page 66.
  TIP 2  	
Low Carbon Resilience is a Big Picture Goal
Natural asset management should be a consideration in most local government 
plans because of nature’s ability to “multi-task” and support sustainable service 
delivery. Wherever possible, LOS for natural assets should seek to align with 
broad organizational policy objectives and strategies around climate action and 
biodiversity protection, which are urgent priorities for many local governments 
across Canada.
Low carbon resilience (LCR) is a planning approach that focuses on developing 
integrated strategies that reduce both greenhouse gas emissions (climate 
mitigation) and vulnerability to climate change impacts (climate adaptation). 
Local governments should be very cautious of management decisions for 
natural assets that have a positive climate mitigation impact while undermining 
biodiversity and ecosystem integrity. An example might be a tree-planting 
program that focuses on planting a mono-culture forest to sequester carbon, 
but that undermines biodiversity and healthy ecological functioning, which 
could in turn undermine climate adaptation efforts. 
4    Some local governments only have one asset management plan that encompasses all assets and services. In those 
cases, natural asset management considerations may be incorporated into the overarching plan.
5    The City of Edmonton’s Green Network comprises three interrelated networks: its ecological network, its wellness 
network and its celebration network. In many open spaces these networks do overlap; in others (such as paved 
gathering spaces with no vegetation), they do not. See the Glossary for the term Ecological Network.

What Is a Low Carbon Resilience Planning Approach?6
A low carbon resilience approach encourages decision-makers to pursue integrated strategies and 
investments that climate-proof their communities while strengthening overall sustainability. It embeds 
three key questions in all decision processes relating to: 
1/	 Risk: Does the investment or action minimize community vulnerability to projected climate 
impacts such as flooding, wildfire, heat, and other extreme events? 
2/	 Emissions: Does the investment or action measurably reduce corporate and/or community 
emissions and help advance carbon-reduction goals? 
3/	 Co-benefits: Does the investment or action advance community sustainability goals such as 
health, equity, biodiversity, and economic savings and development?
  TIP 3  	
Pay Attention to Scale and Jurisdiction
Watershed-scale planning is essential to define LOS for some services natural 
assets provide, particularly for water and climate-related services. Hydrological 
functioning is typically bound by watersheds and sub-watersheds and many 
local governments rely on services from watersheds outside their jurisdictional 
boundary. It is recommended that natural asset inventories are created at the 
watershed scale to ensure that all natural assets providing services to local 
governments are accounted for. See the stormwater and drinking water service 
descriptions in Section 5 for more information. 
Local governments may need to find ways to protect (or enhance) the services 
of natural assets in a watershed outside their official jurisdiction. This will likely 
require collaboration and partnerships with neighbouring local governments 
and/or with higher levels of government during assessment, planning and 
implementation stages of the natural asset management cycle (see Figure 1 
on page 3 for a diagram of the asset management cycle). Similarly, 
collaboration will be required for natural assets they do not own (see Tip 4 
below). LOS measures can be developed to track progress (see the stormwater 
example on page 13). 
Example: Conservation Halton and the cities of Burlington and Hamilton 
in Ontario collaborated to develop a natural asset management initiative 
for the Grindstone Creek watershed, including developing an inventory, 
determining the role of natural assets in managing stormwater, now and in 
a future climate scenario and identifying, based on the foregoing, options 
for long-term management. Grindstone Creek is an important watershed in 
Conservation Halton’s jurisdiction that provides multiple services to both cities. 
The City of Hamilton is upstream from the City of Burlington, so protection 
and management of natural assets in Hamilton may support Burlington to 
manage stormwater, mitigate flood risk and manage risks to water quality and 
biodiversity at the mouth of Grindstone Creek.

Build on the Knowledge of Organizations with Natural Asset Management Expertise
Local governments will benefit from collaborating with the multiple organizations in and outside their 
jurisdiction that are able to provide expertise and support on natural asset management and that are 
managing natural assets in their region. For example, in Ontario, the watershed-based conservation 
authorities play a critical role in protecting, conserving and managing natural assets and are important 
partners of local governments.
  TIP 4  	
Pay Attention to Ownership of Natural Assets 
Local governments should include details on ownership of natural assets in 
their inventory because they often rely on natural assets they do not own to 
deliver services, even when those natural assets are located in their jurisdiction. 
These could be large tracts of land owned by farmers, forestry companies, 
utilities, airport authorities, Crown land, First Nations Urban Reserves or Land 
Holdings, or smaller properties owned by residents. Many small actions can 
lead to substantial cumulative impacts over time. 
Example: The graphic below shows the breakdown of ownership of natural 
assets that exist within the jurisdiction of the City of Saskatoon. 
Source: Saskatoon’s Green Infrastructure Strategy: Towards an Interconnected Green 
Network, p. 54.
Knowledge about ownership will help local governments define LOS measures 
that track progress in achieving community-wide service objectives for natural 
assets not directly under their control. The diagram below shows some possible 
actions local governments can take to achieve community-wide outcomes for 
natural assets, and how that might translate into defining LOS for natural assets.

Natural Asset Management is a Cross-Cutting Theme
In every built-up community, green infrastructure exists alongside grey 
infrastructure and can support local governments in delivering services 
cost-effectively and in minimizing risks associated with climate change and 
biodiversity loss. Green infrastructure also provides many other services 
to communities, including public health, recreation, and local economic 
development. Local governments are beginning to put more attention towards 
integrating green infrastructure with grey infrastructure to support service 
delivery objectives. The diagram below shows infrastructure types ranging

from that made with grey, engineered assets (exclusively made from concrete, 
steel or other non-living materials) to a spectrum of green infrastructure that 
includes engineered green infrastructure assets that combine grey and natural 
assets, enhanced natural assets that have been constructed and natural 
infrastructure that is compromised of intact natural ecosystems. All types 
contribute to local service delivery.

Framework: Key Concepts, Definitions and Terms, 2021, p. 5.
To support integration of green and grey infrastructure in the built environment, 
LOS for natural assets will need to be defined to support service delivery 
in areas that have typically been confined to tracking progress on grey 
infrastructure (e.g., water, wastewater, transportation, parks). To do this 
effectively, multiple departments and services of a local government must 
play a role in natural asset management planning, even if they are not directly 
responsible for managing the natural assets themselves. 
Inter-departmental coordination is required to support holistic approaches 
that prioritize ecological integrity of natural systems and to ensure that a local 
government protects and manages natural assets optimally alongside grey 
infrastructure. Staff with responsibilities for managing natural assets can be 
included on the local government’s cross-functional asset management team 
where one exists to ensure that natural asset management considerations are 
fully integrated in infrastructure planning and decision-making.

Example: The City of Vancouver’s Parks Board is responsible for managing 
natural assets in the City’s parks and open spaces. The City’s Engineering 
department is responsible for managing stormwater and has begun 
to implement low-impact development projects across the City, along 
transportation corridors, or in areas prone to flooding. For example, a study 
is underway on how to use natural infrastructure solutions to build resilience 
to climate impacts in the False Creek neigbourhood. In some cases, the 
Engineering department implements natural infrastructure solutions to manage 
stormwater in the parks themselves. In those cases, there is coordination with 
the Vancouver Parks Board, which must give permission for the work to occur.
Why Is it Important to Distinguish Between Different Types of Green Infrastructure?
There are different implications for service delivery between engineered or enhanced green infrastruc-
ture assets and natural assets. Natural assets (e.g., forest stands with a biodiverse understory, wetlands, 
ravines) are complex natural ecosystems that have greater ecosystem service potential and resilience 
than enhanced assets (e.g., isolated urban trees, semi-natural parks with a low diversity of species that 
are often non-native and more susceptible to pests) or engineered assets (e.g., green roofs, permeable 
pavement, rain gardens). 
In addition, there are typically more maintenance activities required for engineered green infrastructure 
than for enhanced or natural assets and local governments will need to define LOS differently for these 
different types of assets. Investment needs and management activities will differ between them. The 
ecosystem service value and co-benefits are generally greatest for intact natural assets. For example, 
in the City of Edmonton’s experience, natural areas are among the lowest cost maintenance sites in its 
municipal open space network, while assets like permeable pavement and rain barrels are not self-sus-
taining and require replacement over time.

Section 3 	Steps To Get Started in 
Defining LOS for Natural Assets
Local governments across Canada differ in their service delivery responsibilities, 
in how they are built (e.g., how densely populated and urbanized they are) and 
in their geographic context (e.g., coastal, inland, forested, prairie). But natural 
asset management is a cross-cutting theme across services areas for all local 
governments. 
There could be several entry points for integrating LOS for natural assets. 
The following steps are meant to support local governments in finding an 
appropriate entry point to get started and make progress.
  STEP 1  	 Map the Relevant Natural Asset and Service 
Combinations 
An important first step is to develop a “big picture” understanding of the local 
government’s natural asset and service delivery context. Specifically, it can be 
beneficial to map and prioritize the natural asset and service combinations 
that are relevant to the local government. As mentioned in section 1.3, a 
natural asset inventory provides a good data foundation for this exercise, 
but even without one, staff likely have some understanding of the significant 
natural assets that exist and are providing services to the community in their 
jurisdiction, even if they do not yet have technical information about the 
ecosystem services they are providing. 
Consider the natural assets that deliver services to the community. Note 
whether the local government has direct control over the management of the 
natural assets providing the service or could influence their management in 
other ways (e.g., by-laws, partnerships, stewardship programs). 
The table below provides a snapshot of some possible asset and service 
combinations that local governments may want to consider. Local governments 
that do not yet have detailed technical information about natural assets 
can focus on identifying significant natural assets or natural areas that are 
important to the community, and note where data and information gaps exist. 
Remember: Even without a lot of technical insight into services that some 
natural assets may be providing, those services likely do exist and strengthening 
data and information about them should be part of continuous improvement 
efforts. Section 5 provides an overview of how the natural asset types shown 
below contribute to each of the service areas described.

  STEP 2  	 Identify Key Risks
Once local governments have developed a big picture analysis of the natural 
assets providing services to the community, consider the risks to the community 
that can be mitigated with a natural asset management solution. Climate risks 
such as extreme heat, drought, flooding, sea level rise and extreme weather 
pose risks to engineered infrastructure, to people, and to the natural assets 
themselves. Other risks that natural asset management can help mitigate 
include poor air quality, erosion, and pollutant-loading of source water. A high-
level risk identification exercise will help prioritize objectives for natural asset 
management, and LOS can be defined to support those objectives. 
Example: The Town of Gibsons, BC, began proactively protecting and managing 
its aquifer, which provides pristine drinking water to the community with 
minimal treatment requirements. The Town recognized that the aquifer is a 
critical natural asset that supports cost-effective service delivery and developed 
a monitoring and maintenance regime to ensure it is protected. The Town then 
moved on to manage other natural assets to support stormwater management 
and other services. It also developed an organization-wide eco-assets strategy 
that sets higher-level corporate service objectives for natural assets. 
18

An Introduction for Local Governments
Municipal Natural Assets Initiative 
MNAI.ca
See the case study of the Town of Gibsons on page 63 for potential LOS 
measures the Town might use to measure progress on managing the aquifer. 
The Town has not yet formalized LOS for natural assets.
  STEP 3  	 Identify Relevant Strategic Objectives 
Identify where the local government has already defined strategic objectives 
for natural assets in high-level documents such as climate action plans or 
resilience strategies, biodiversity strategies, official plans or other strategic 
plans. Local governments should seek to define corporate, customer and 
technical LOS for natural assets that flow from their strategic objectives. This 
can help ensure that best-laid plans do not simply “sit on the shelf.”
Example: The City of Edmonton’s City Plan and its Connect Edmonton Plan both 
include a strategic objective of having 2 million trees for 2 million people. The 
City then defined LOS measures in its UFAMP, a tactical plan, to help achieve 
that objective by 2050, which is the assumed date the population will reach 2 
million. The LOS measures are important because they help justify and guide 
the investments in tree planting, lifecycle management of the urban forest 
and other programs outlined in the Plan. See the Edmonton case study on 
page 66.
  STEP 4  	 Find an Entry Point
At an advanced stage of natural asset management, local governments will have 
a comprehensive understanding of how natural assets are contributing to all 
services and will be in a good position to optimize investments to support their 
management and protection across all service areas, while ensuring ecological 
integrity of natural systems. Their LOS for natural assets could be defined in a 
natural asset management plan that encompasses all assets across all services, 
or in an overarching asset management plan if the local government only has 
one plan. 
The reality is that most local governments still have limited knowledge about 
natural assets and are just beginning to learn about what natural assets they 
have and what ecosystem services they provide. They may have limited data 
and information about the condition and performance of natural assets in and 
around their jurisdiction. While they are managing natural assets to some extent 
and taking some measures to protect significant natural assets that provide 
vital services to communities, few local governments are doing it proactively 
through asset management planning. Investments tend to be ad hoc rather than 
made through a structured asset investment planning approach that considers 
long-term needs, and few local governments have valued the services natural 
assets provide across multiple service areas. Generally, more progress has been 
made in urban forest management than in other areas.7

asset management with 30 local governments across Canada, including large metropolitan regions and very small 
communities.

Although most local governments still have work to do to assess their natural 
assets, this should not be a major limitation in defining measures to track 
progress on natural asset management in asset management plans. The 
advantage of asset management planning is that it enables local governments 
to manage infrastructure (including natural assets) with a long-term perspective 
and continuous improvement in mind. Performance measures can still be 
developed to track progress based on an understanding of what services the 
community expects to receive from natural assets and the steps the local 
government will take to get there. 
At an early stage of natural asset management, it will be important to find 
entry points to begin integrating LOS for natural asset management into asset 
management plans. Local governments can use the information gathered in 
the first three steps above to determine where the best point of integration 
might be. Consider asset management plans (AMPs) that are scheduled to be 
developed or updated, such as parks and recreation AMPs, urban forest AMPs, 
stormwater management AMPs, and water services AMPs. Based on that, local 
governments can determine the scope of natural assets to focus on to define 
LOS. 
Considerations may include:
	
 A focus on natural assets at a watershed scale may be required if 
stormwater management and flood risk mitigation is a priority;
	
 Natural assets in parks and open spaces in the local government’s 
jurisdiction may be an appropriate scope for a parks asset management 
plan; or
	
 A focus on one critical natural asset may be appropriate, for example an 
aquifer, because drinking water supply and protection are priorities; the 
foreshore of a coastline, because the local government has identified 
a priority to manage risks to property from sea level rise; or the urban 
forest, because AMPs are in progress or require updating.
Example: The Town of Halton Hills, Ontario began its natural asset management 
journey using a phased approach. In Phase 1 the Town completed a full 
inventory of its natural assets and a valuation of the services they provide. 
In Phase 2, it selected two study areas for which it updated the natural asset 
inventory, assessed the condition of the natural assets and the risks associated 
with them, and then developed LOS measures for those areas. The Town 
developed different risk scenarios (including climate change) and evaluated 
the impacts on those LOS. This approach will help the Town to decide on 
investments required to manage natural assets and maintain their LOS. In Phase 
3 the Town plans to replicate this approach for its whole jurisdiction.
The next section provides guidance on how to develop LOS for natural assets for 
any scope or priority your local government has identified.

Section 4 	How to Develop LOS for Natural 
Assets 
This section outlines how to develop LOS for natural assets based on a local 
government’s hierarchy of objectives, with strategic objectives at the top 
flowing down to operational objectives at the bottom (refer back to the graphic 
on page 6 of Section 1.2 for an example of what this hierarchy looks like). 
Measuring performance on corporate, customer and technical LOS helps to track 
and report on progress. 
Local governments should use the same general process for defining LOS for 
natural assets as they do for any asset class they are managing, with two added 
considerations:
	
 Avoid developing service levels for natural assets that conflict with 
each other (e.g., human use of natural assets for recreation at a level of 
service that will undermine essential services natural assets provide, 
such as clean drinking water and biodiversity); and 
	
 Seek to protect the underlying ecological health, integrity and 
biodiversity of natural assets and create connected ecological networks. 
4.1.	
How does Valuation of the Services Natural Assets 
Provide Guide the Development of LOS? 
Natural assets are not considered tangible capital assets by the Public Sector 
Accounting Board and therefore their value is not officially included in local 
government financial reporting. However, it is common knowledge that 
nature and natural assets are the foundation of our well-being and that our 
entire social and economic systems are dependent on nature. As a global 
society, we have failed to properly account for the value of natural assets and 
this limitation has led to a context in which we are seeing unprecedented 
biodiversity loss and degraded natural systems, a threat now seen as the twin 
challenge of the climate crisis. Local governments should begin to account for 
the value of nature in service delivery.
One key difference between valuation of natural assets and valuation of grey 
infrastructure is that grey infrastructure depreciates and eventually needs to 
be decommissioned and replaced with other assets that will support service 
delivery, based on the needs defined at the time. Natural assets do not 
depreciate in the same way, but in the face of risks (e.g., overuse, dumping, 
invasive species, encroachment, wildfire) and without some degree of 
management, natural assets (especially those in urban settings) will degrade 
and hence depreciate over time. Conversely, their service value may appreciate 
over time when they are restored, especially because of the central role they 
play in buffering the impacts of climate change.

No price tag can be put on nature, but environmental economists have 
spearheaded the thinking on how to measure the value of ecosystem services 
and these approaches can be helpful in the context of asset management 
planning.
4.1.1.	
Valuation of the Services Natural Assets Provide 
Supports Cost/Benefit Analysis of Infrastructure 
Decisions
Some local governments are doing comprehensive valuations of the services 
provided by natural assets to build an understanding of the full value of the 
services they deliver to communities. A comprehensive valuation is needed 
to assess the full costs of losing natural assets and the full benefits of 
protecting them and is important when local governments are contemplating 
any significant land-use change that may affect natural assets. A full valuation 
brings clarity and transparency to the process of analyzing trade-offs of 
infrastructure projects and it avoids the risk of under-valuing natural assets’ 
role in service delivery.
Example 1: The City of Toronto and Toronto Region Conservation Authority 
2018 report, Ecosystem Service Values of the City of Toronto’s Ravine System8, 
determined that the ravine system provides a total of $822 million annually 
in ecosystem services related to recreation, physical health, mental health, 
air quality, carbon sequestration, food provision, aesthetic appreciation, and 
habitat. The report helps build the case for investments in its management, 
enhancement and protection. 
Example 2: Within its city limits, the City of Saskatoon contains more than 
1,400 wetlands (1,207 ha), a portion of the South Saskatchewan River (388 
ha), grasslands (1,285 ha), and forest/shrublands (577 ha). In 2019, the City 
implemented the Natural Capital Asset Valuation (NCAV) Pilot Project9 as an 
initial step toward evaluating key ecosystem services of Saskatoon’s natural 
assets, including supporting services (habitat), regulating services (carbon 
sequestration and storage, moderation of extreme weather, wastewater 
treatment, pollination, biological control, air quality) cultural services 
(recreation, mental and physical health, aesthetic appreciation and inspiration 
for art, culture and design, increased property values, heritage) and forage 
production (livestock). While only two pilot areas were studied in-depth, the 
City was able to extrapolate that the service value of aquatic natural assets, 
grassland and forest shrubland was more than $48 million annually.

There are common valuation approaches that local governments use to 
determine the value of services natural assets provide, sometimes used in 
combination. They include: 
Figure 6: Valuation methods
Market valuation approaches: Only a subset of ecosystem services – things like 
agricultural products - is recognized in markets directly but many more are not. 
When ecosystem services are not directly captured in markets, indirect proxies 
can be used, such as avoided cost and replacement cost. The avoided cost 
method of ecosystem service valuation assumes that the value of ecosystem 
services can be measured by calculating the damages that would occur if the 
ecosystem service was lost. It is frequently used to value the flood mitigation 
service of natural assets. The replacement cost approach determines the value 
of a service based on the costs to deliver an equivalent service using grey 
infrastructure instead. This approach is commonly used to assess the value of 
stormwater services. 
Revealed preference approaches: If market information is unavailable, there is 
another set of valuation approaches which rely on parallel market transactions 
that relate indirectly to the ecosystem service being valued. These are known as 
revealed preference methods, the most important of which are hedonic pricing 
and the travel cost method. The hedonic pricing method measures the value of 
ecosystem services that should be reflected in market prices of nearby goods 
due to proximity to those services. This method is most commonly used to value 
ecosystem services that impact the price of housing real estate. The travel cost 
method assumes that the value of an ecosystem service can be measured by 
the amount people are willing to spend to access it. Thus, the value of changes 
in the quality of a recreation site can be measured by the change in demand for 
people to travel to the site. This method is useful for measuring the recreational 
value of a forest or lake.

Stated preference approaches: If neither direct nor indirect market information 
is available for an ecosystem service, a hypothetical market must be used. The 
methods that take this approach are known as stated preference methods 
and they are based on survey responses which try to estimate individuals’ 
willingness to pay for a good or service. This method is commonly used to 
assess cultural values.
Benefits transfer: The last approach to mention is the benefit transfer method. 
This involves applying values derived in previous analyses to the same 
ecosystem service in a different area. This method is fairly common, particularly 
given it requires less time and resources. It can be quite effective depending 
on the type of ecosystem service. This approach yields the most useful insights 
when adjustments to the transferred value are made based on differences 
between the original site and the study site. Because it is based on existing 
studies in other locations, it is best to regard the results as order-of-magnitude 
estimates. The City of Saskatoon used the benefit transfer approach for its 
natural capital valuation.
MNAI emphasises the valuation of services, which do not translate into the value of natural assets 
themselves. Although every attempt is made to recognize a range of service values, such valuations will 
always be, at best, minimum valuations since some values cannot be captured in monetary terms. For 
example, if an area is the ancestral and current home of a First Nation it would not be possible to put a 
dollar value on their identity with the land, water and resources. 
When completing valuations, MNAI considers (i) the perspective of the 
audience seeking the valuation and (ii) how the valuation will be used. MNAI 
values services from the perspective of local governments, so understanding 
avoided infrastructure costs is relevant to this audience. The same service can 
be valued very differently by different groups. For example, 250 metres of a 
remnant stream provided Oakville with $1.2 - $1.4 million dollars of services, but 
community members may value it at much less if is degraded and not capable 
of supporting significant recreation. Secondly, the valuation approach is driven 
by how the results will be used. If the value estimates are being factored into 
asset management, the avoided cost or replacement cost is important. If the 
service lies outside of local mandates and doesn’t require a high level of 
rigour, a benefit transfer approach may be preferable. As such, MNAI typically 
recommends or conducts detailed modelling for core services such that direct 
comparisons can be made with the performance of grey engineered assets; and 
combines valuations for core services with more qualitative valuations for co-
benefits to provide a “composite” valuation of nature’s services.

Financial Planning for Natural Asset Management 
A comprehensive valuation of ecosystem services provided by natural assets 
is beneficial to build the case for investments in natural asset management 
because it allows local governments to develop a robust understanding of the 
trade-offs associated with land-use decisions and infrastructure options. This 
could include a valuation of core services to the local government, or these plus 
other benefits to the community.
Once that case is made, local governments also need to have information 
about the cost of conservation and lifecycle management activities for natural 
assets to inform financial planning for the necessary investments. LOS will be 
determined by estimating the costs of lifecycle management activities such as 
monitoring the condition and performance of natural assets, maintaining them, 
restoring them (e.g., planting, re-wilding, naturalization), acquiring them, or 
working in partnership with other organizations to manage and protect them. 
While it is the role of staff to define LOS and estimate the investments required, 
it is the local government council’s responsibility to approve them in plans and 
budgets. 
Developing LOS is a Team Effort
Local governments develop LOS during the process of developing their asset management plans. Usually 
this is in an iterative process that considers financial, risk, and level of service trade-offs. This typically 
involves discussion or debate about funding constraints and implications of LOS measures until there 
is agreement around what LOS is both desirable and feasible. Staff will be best placed to defend LOS 
measures when they are well informed about the needs of the community and all stakeholders and their 
willingness to pay for the services. 
4.2.	
Build an Understanding of Stakeholder Needs and 
Interests 
Both corporate and customer LOS need to be defined based on an 
understanding of the expectations of the community in relation to the services 
natural assets provide. Local governments defining LOS for natural assets for 
the first time will likely have some information about this and may also need to 
state some assumptions around which the measures are based. 
Example: When the City of Edmonton developed its 2022 UFAMP, it engaged 
a cross-functional group of staff in two workshops. They defined relevant 
stakeholders and their interests using a set of stakeholder groups that the City 
considers when developing LOS in all services areas. 
The table on the next page shows the included stakeholder groups.

Edmonton)
The City then defined urban forest-related services of interest to the 
stakeholders based on results of previous engagement exercises and staff 
knowledge. The City also ensured that the service objectives were consistent 
with objectives contained in existing strategic documents. See the case study of 
Edmonton on page 66 for details. 
When possible, local governments should validate assumptions about service 
delivery and document new information about stakeholder interests as it 
becomes available. Asset management plans should always be considered 
living documents that are updated when key assumptions, strategies or budget 
decisions change, and council may need to adjust LOS accordingly. 
One useful tool that can support development of LOS is called a value 
proposition canvas (VPC). The VPC can be used to identify and clarify the value 
of the services natural assets provide to the community’s various stakeholders, 
which can build an understanding of the ways a local government can positively 
influence services and prioritize service level indicators for a given asset 
type. The process helps determine corporate and customer LOS. Appendix B 
provides an example of the results of this exercise for the hypothetical example 
of the value of natural spaces to a community. The exercise was done by the 
organizations that contributed to the development of this guidebook.10

4.3.	
Developing Corporate LOS for Natural Assets
Natural systems underpin a community’s quality of life. Local governments likely 
already have some insight into the value of nature and healthy ecosystems to 
the community from the following sources:
	
 Engagement they have done in planning exercises.
	
 Information gathered through surveys, feedback or direct observation 
of how natural assets are being used and accessed.
	
 Council priorities that reflect interests of their constituents.
	
 Research that demonstrates how natural assets and healthy ecosystems 
contribute to service delivery and overall quality of life.
Local governments can use these insights to establish strategic objectives for 
natural assets and healthy ecosystems, even when the data and information 
they have about their natural assets is limited. Strategic objectives should be 
used as a basis for developing corporate levels of service objectives in specific 
service areas or for specific natural asset types. The corporate level of service 
outcome is needed to support the development of more granular customer 
and technical levels of service used to measure progress in implementing asset 
management plans. 
Strategic objectives may be articulated as a vision or set of goals and policy 
objectives. They do not necessarily have to be tied to specific scientific data and 
information about natural assets. For example, the City of Edmonton’s target of 
2 million trees for 2 million people was not set based on scientific knowledge 
of the number of trees needed to optimize a whole range of services. Rather, 
it was set based on research demonstrating the value of trees for quality of 
life, building resiliency to climate change and community interests. As the City 
builds its knowledge of the biophysical services provided by its urban forest it 
could adjust its target as part of continuous improvement efforts.
The choice of corporate LOS measures will depend on how local governments 
have chosen to focus efforts on natural asset management. The table below 
provides examples.

No local government asset management plan is based on perfect data, and 
particularly for natural assets, most local governments in Canada still have 
limited data and information about the services natural assets provide. 
Local governments may be leery of setting corporate LOS targets in the face 
of uncertainty over whether approved budgets will be sufficient to achieve 
their objectives or if they do not have baseline data related to current LOS. 
In those cases, asset management plans can indicate risks associated with 
implementation of their plans that may limit them in achieving targets. 
Another option is for local governments to define an LOS measure without a 
target and determine the baseline as a first step. Targets can be set in future 
AMPs. Local governments may also wish to consider identifying LOS targets 
that represent “no regret” scenarios that are known to have positive social, 
environmental or resiliency benefits with little or no added cost. Ultimately it 
is council’s role to approve corporate LOS measures, to monitor progress in 
achieving them, and to adjust them in the face of changing local government 
circumstances. 
Asset management is a process of continuous improvement and as local 
governments build knowledge about the state of their natural assets and the 
dynamic services they provide, their LOS measures will improve.
4.4.	
Developing Customer and Technical LOS for Natural 
Assets 
Once corporate service objectives have been defined, local governments will be 
able to develop customer and technical LOS to guide implementation of natural 
asset management to achieve them. To ensure that all important aspects of 
service delivery are accounted for and tracked, several customer and technical 
LOS are generally developed to measure performance on a single corporate LOS 
objective.
28
Developing Levels of Service for Natural Assets 
An Introduction for Local Governments
Municipal Natural Assets Initiative 
MNAI.ca
Customer LOS are the publicly facing performance measures that represent 
the service the community is receiving, in terms that are meaningful and 
relevant to them. Technical LOS are more granular performance measures local 
governments use internally that define the required ecosystem performance of 
natural assets and operational performance required to achieve those customer 
service levels (monitoring, maintenance, restoration of natural assets). Together, 
customer and technical LOS provide insight into the progress local governments 
are making towards achieving their corporate LOS. 
The number of customer and technical LOS measures that local governments 
track needs to be realistic and will be influenced by factors such as a local 
government’s size and complexity, its regulatory framework, community 
priorities and expectations for services that rely on healthy natural systems, 
and capacity (budget and human resources). Examples of corporate, customer 
and technical LOS are in the case studies in Section 6. 
The general rule-of-thumb for developing good performance measures is that 
they adhere to the following “SMARTER” principles11:
S: Specific, meaning they define results to be accomplished for a specific aspect 
of the service objective
M: Measurable, meaning they define a quantity, cost or quality. 
A: Achievable, meaning the target should be realistic (not a stretch target or 
easy target)
R: Relevant, meaning it supports an organizational goal and provides a clear 
picture of whether the service is being provided. A customer LOS should also be 
relevant and meaningful to the community.
T: Timebound, meaning the measure specifies the frequency of action or a 
due date. Long-term targets should be stated along with annual or short-term 
targets that measure progress to be achieved over time. 
E: Evaluation, meaning that there will be ongoing evaluation of the 
appropriateness of the measure/target.
R: Re-assess, meaning that LOS will be reviewed and updated to reflect the 
changing business environment. 
Local governments can use the principles above to define LOS based on the 
following key service attributes (generally considered universal values of service 
delivery): 12
Safety: the service is delivered safely and risks are managed
Regulatory: the service meets all regulatory requirements
Reliability: the service is reliable 
Accessibility: the service is accessible (and affordable) 
Quality: the service is satisfactory to those who use it or benefit from it

Section 5 	The Contribution of Natural 
Assets to Service Delivery
This section describes how different natural asset types contribute to a range 
of local government service objectives and provides examples of corporate, 
customer and technical LOS. Local government service areas included are:
	
 Stormwater management
	
 Wastewater management
	
 Drinking water management
	
 Biodiversity
	
 Climate resilience
	
 Transportation 
	
 Public health
	
 Recreation
	
 Culture and heritage
	
 Local economic development
Each description shows at a high level the type of ecosystem services natural 
assets may provide and the type of data and information needed to define 
meaningful LOS. The ecosystem services are grouped into four main types: 
provisioning services, regulating services, habitat/supporting services and 
cultural services.14 These ecosystem categories are described in more detail in 
Appendix C: Description of Ecosystem Services.
The LOS examples included in this section were developed through expert 
input, academic literature and local government sources (e.g., local government 
strategies and asset management plans). These examples are not exhaustive 
and local governments will need to develop LOS measures based on their 
priorities and capacity.
5.1.	
Stormwater Services
Natural assets can play an important role in stormwater management, 
sometimes at a lower cost than grey infrastructure solutions. They can be 
very effective in storing water, controlling peak flows, supporting groundwater 
recharge and controlling erosion, for example. By reducing stormwater runoff 
in urbanized areas, natural assets also contribute to the protection of source 
water and overall ecosystem health.

Water
Groundwater - aquifers
Regulating:
•	 Water storage
Sustainability of groundwater supply is dependent 
on the recharge rate. Water regulation services are 
provided when the rate of groundwater withdrawal 
does not exceed the natural renewal rate. Recharge 
rates are determined by integrated hydrologic and/
or hydraulic modeling.
Net recharge is a function of many variables. It 
varies temporally and spatially by season, storm 
water intensity, stream stage, soil type, vegetation 
type and cover, elevation, slope, temperature, solar 
radiation, and other factors, including the presence 
of buildings, paved surfaces, and drainage culverts.
Surface water – rivers, 
creeks, streams
Regulating:
•	 Conveyance of water 
and attenuation of 
peak flows
•	 Groundwater 
recharge
•	 Water storage
Factors negatively impacting stormwater services 
include:
•	 Development in floodplains 
•	 Channelized streambeds
•	 Over-extraction of water / unsustainable water 
extraction rates
•	 Damage to headwater streams
•	 Any of the above factors could be exacerbated by 
climate change
Factors positively impacting stormwater services 
include:
Watershed-scale stormwater management 
planning that sets policies or targets around 
imperviousness over the watershed and 
minimum widths of riparian buffers
Note: Services provided when hydrological, 
geological, and biological components of stream

Regulating: 
•	 Flood & drought 
mitigation
•	 Groundwater 
recharge
•	 Erosion control / 
bank stability
The width needed for a riparian buffer to be 
effective depends on multiple factors, but in 
general, the wider the buffer, the greater the 
benefits delivered. This is particularly true for 
headwater streams.
•	 Flood & drought mitigation provided with buffer 
widths of 20 – 150m. Forested buffers are more 
effective than grass buffers.
•	 Groundwater infiltration provided with buffer 
widths of 5-30m.

Major factors influencing the performance of trees 
for stormwater management:
•	 Tree (e.g. evergreen/deciduous; species; size/
age; leaf area index; evapotranspiration rate; root 
structure/depth)
•	 Atmosphere (e.g. climate zone; annual 
precipitation; precipitation intensity & duration; 
temperature)
•	 Soil (e.g. rooting volume; water holding capacity; 
compaction; drainage)
•	 Landscape (e.g. surrounding land cover; impervious 
services; watershed position; tree density)
Factors impacting erosion mitigation include:
•	 Vegetation establishment (e.g. planting forests 
on erosion-prone soils and runoff pathways to 
reduce & intercept sediment
•	 Soil type (e.g. gravel less prone to surface 
erosion than sand)
•	 Connectivity with adjacent ecosystems
•	 Forest operations (e.g. cultivation, drainage, road 
construction, timber harvesting)
Inland green open spaces  
(vegetated areas, 
meadows, grasslands, 
bushlands)
Regulating:
•	 Erosion mitigation
•	 Flood control
Factors impacting erosion & flood control include:
•	 Vegetation type (e.g. native species that are 
tolerant to local conditions)
•	 Location (e.g. floodplain meadows should be 
kept intact to limit flooding)
•	 Soil type
Coastal natural spaces  
(vegetated areas, beach, 
dunes, eelgrass & 
seagrass, rocky shoreline, 
estuaries and ocean 
wetlands)
NOTE: Coastal natural spaces are impacted by stormwater but do not 
contribute to managing stormwater (as it comes from upstream of these 
ecosystems). Sea level rise that encroaches on foreshores could limit the 
ability of upstream natural assets to store and transmit water.
Wetlands  
(isolated palustrine, 
riverine)
Regulating:
•	 Flood control
•	 Water supply & 
storage
•	 Water level fluctuations determined by wetland-
to-watershed area ratios, level of watershed 
development, outlet conditions, and soils
•	 Percent imperviousness of land cover
•	 Topography
•	 Wetland type (isolated wetlands most effective, 
then palustrine wetlands, then riverine wetlands)
•	 The balance of inflows and outflows of water 
through a wetland defines the water budget and 
determines the amount of water stored within 
the wetland (ibid)
•	 Wetland type (isolated wetlands most effective, 
then palustrine wetlands, then riverine wetlands)

SCALE OF ANALYSIS NEEDED TO DEFINE CUSTOMER LOS 
	
 For intact natural assets it is preferable if analysis is completed at a 
watershed scale as all components of ecosystem interact to manage 
quality and quantity of water. If this is not feasible, the scale should be 
catchment or drainage basin (smaller sub-basins that combine to form 
a larger water basin).
	
 For urban green infrastructure, the scale of analysis is the local 
government boundary and may be completed at the site level.
TYPE OF DATA AND INFORMATION NEEDED TO DEFINE LOS 
	
 Modelling may be needed to inform LOS: Modelling: hydrologic model 
uses a variety of hydrologic parameters (e.g., runoff, evaporation, 
snowmelt) to estimate the runoff/storage/infiltration from a watershed 
for a given rainfall event based on a suite of physical characteristics 
of a given watershed (e.g., size, slope, length/width, surface cover, soil 
types).
	
 Floodplain flood control data needs: channel geometry, flow data, 
digital elevation model (DEM).
	
 Marsh flood control data needs: flow and water level monitoring.
	
 Channel flood control data needs: water levels, groundwater, 
precipitation, and velocity.
	
 Water level monitoring: water level logger (Oct – Dec and March – July)
	
 Groundwater monitoring: drivepoint piezometer (to be installed 
in proximity to the surface water level monitoring stations). Each 
monitoring location had one ‘shallow’ and ‘deep’ piezometer to observe 
the impact of the remnant channel on the surface water groundwater 
interaction.

Drinking (potable) water services
Fresh water is essential for human survival and all local governments that 
provide drinking water services have an interest in protecting source water 
quality. The cleaner a community’s source of drinking water, the more cost-
effective service delivery will be through avoided costs of water treatment. 
Local governments also need to build an understanding of the quantity of 
source water available for the community and take relevant actions to protect 
the supply of source water. There may be natural asset management activities 
(e.g., forest conservation) that support aquifer recharge for communities relying 
on groundwater. Local governments can also implement demand management 
programs and policies to help conserve water. 
With increased risk of drought from climate change, some local governments 
are looking into strategies to conserve drinking water, which has very stringent 
treatment requirements, and separate it from other uses such as emergency fire 
services and irrigation.

SCALE OF ANALYSIS NEEDED TO DEFINE CUSTOMER LOS 
	
 For intact natural assets – preferable if scale of analysis completed at 
watershed scale as all components of ecosystem interact to manage 
quality and quantity of water. If this is not feasible, scale should be 
catchment or drainage basin (smaller sub-basins that combine to form 
a larger water basin).
	
 For urban green infrastructure, the scale of analysis is the local 
government boundary and may be completed at the site level.
TYPE OF DATA AND INFORMATION NEEDED FOR TECHNICAL LOS 
	
 Modelling may be needed to inform technical LOS: Modeling: hydrologic 
model uses a variety of hydrologic parameters (e.g., runoff, evaporation, 
snowmelt) to estimate the runoff/storage/infiltration from a watershed 
for a given rainfall event, based on a suite of physical characteristics 
of a given watershed (e.g., size, slope, length/width, surface cover, soil 
types).
	
 Water quality monitoring. Measurements may include: physical-
chemical parameters (temperature, pH, alkalinity, major ions), nutrients 
(P, N, TSS) and metals.

river or streams, where streams/river discharge into lakes.
	
 Increasingly, monitoring efforts are aimed at determining the condition 
of entire watersheds because of an improved understanding of the

Wastewater services
While a range of natural assets play a role in water purification, the use of 
natural assets for wastewater treatment is generally discouraged as pollutant 
loads can overwhelm natural treatment capacity. Natural and constructed 
wetlands are an exception and have been used for water purification in different 
parts of the world since the 1950s, but mainly as supplementary treatment. 
Constructed wetlands are human-made and used to treat non-point source 
pollution.15 They have emerged as a cost-effective, environmentally friendly 
method of treating a variety of wastewaters, particularly because they have the 
added benefit of being designed for optimal performance and maximum control 
of hydraulic and vegetation management.16

on Constructed Wetlands, Fact sheet: Constructed wetlands — Guidance and Orientation for the Selection of 
Technologies — Contaminated sites — Pollution and waste management — Environment and natural resources —

Climate resilience services 
Ecosystems and the natural assets contained in them are vital to the climate 
system through their role in the carbon cycle, the water cycle, and the 
maintenance of biodiversity. The IPCC’s Special Report on Global Warming of 
1.5°C (2018)17 highlighted how land plays a key role in storing greenhouse gases. 
Within Canada, the soils of the tundra, forests, wetlands, and grasslands are 
of heightened importance for carbon storage. However, once ecosystems are 
disturbed, carbon is released to the atmosphere (IPBES, 2018)18. These stores of 
carbon may have accumulated over centuries or millennia.
Ecosystems also play an important buffering role in reducing the severity of 
climate change, including through services such as flood attenuation, urban 
heat island reduction, and storm surge protection. Maintaining, restoring, and 
managing ecosystems to address climatic and non-climatic stressors are key 
strategies for reducing their vulnerability and the vulnerability of communities 
in the face of climate change, by enhancing their resilience to changing 
conditions. 
Many knowledge gaps exist about how ecosystems will respond to climate 
change because of their complexity. For example, feedback loops can limit, 
reduce, or magnify further impacts on ecosystems and people and create 
tipping points where ecosystems are no longer able to cope with environmental 
change. Future projections of ecosystem function and dynamics are built on 
an incomplete understanding of this complexity. Long-term monitoring and 
adaptative management strategies are therefore essential to managing the 
impacts of climate change.

Biodiversity services
Biodiversity is the diversity among living organisms. It is essential to support 
functioning ecosystems. Changes in biodiversity can influence the supply of 
ecosystem services, just as changes in the quantity and condition of natural 
assets in an ecosystem can influence biodiversity.
The Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) is a United Nations-led 
initiative to tackle the root causes of biodiversity loss and could have a similar 
impact as the United Nations Climate Change Conference Paris Agreement. 
Cities are a main driver of biodiversity loss, and local governments are critical to 
implementing solutions. The GBF includes an action agenda to:
1/	 raise public awareness about the urgent need to stem biodiversity loss 
and restore biodiversity health for the sake of humanity and the global 
ecosystem.
2/	 to inspire and help implement nature-based solutions to meet key 
global challenges.
3/	 to catalyze cooperative initiatives across sectors and stakeholders in 
support of the global biodiversity goals.21
Canada’s commitment to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity 
includes Target 4, that by 2020, biodiversity considerations are integrated into 
municipal planning and activities of major municipalities across Canada.

SCALE OF ANALYSIS NEEDED TO DEFINE LOS
	
 A watershed-scale understanding of natural assets and biodiversity is 
beneficial to identify protection and management actions that support 
ecological integrity and manage risks to biodiversity.
	
 Some local governments begin with an analysis of a significant natural 
area or areas within their jurisdiction where they have direct control or 
influence over how natural assets are managed. 
TYPE OF DATA AND INFORMATION NEEDED TO DEFINE LOS
	
 Local governments require input from a range of disciplines to 
effectively incorporate and conserve biodiversity in and around their 
jurisdiction, including planners, architects, landscape architects, and 
urban designers because of their central role in influencing land 
use change; and ecologists, biologists, foresters and other scientists 
because of their ability to assess the health of species and ecosystem 
functioning. 
	
 Local governments need to ensure their land use decisions, policies 
and by-laws adhere to all relevant provincial/territorial and federal 
regulations related to protection of biodiversity.
	
 The federal and provincial/territorial governments have databases 
of the status of wildlife and species at risk: chm.cbd.int/database/
record?documentID=241248.
	
 Monitoring data related to ecosystem health, including changes in 
prevalence/condition of species at risk, invasive species, diversity of

 Monitoring of ecological functioning including soil health, hydrological 
functioning.
	
 Water purification: determined through water quality monitoring or by 
estimating pollution removal rates based on existing literature.
	
 Standards and guidelines that support protection and enhancement 
of biodiversity (e.g., bird and wildlife-friendly design standards, tree 
planting and naturalization guidelines).
	
 Local governments may wish to refer to the City Biodiversity Index, also 
referred to as the Singapore Index (SI), a self-assessment tool for cities 
to evaluate and monitor the progress of their biodiversity conservation 
efforts in relation to a baseline. It comprises the “profile of the 
city” and 23 indicators that measure native biodiversity, ecosystem 
services provided by biodiversity, and government and management of 
biodiversity. It also includes a user’s manual.22 The cities of Ottawa and 
Montreal contributed to the development of the Index.

Public health services 
This service outcome area describes the services natural assets provide that 
promote physical and mental health. 
Note that services natural assets provide related to drinking water quality 
are addressed in the drinking water service outcome area. Services natural 
assets provide related to temperature regulation are addressed in the climate 
mitigation and adaptation service outcome area. 
Several studies demonstrate that when people live close to, and can access, 
greenspace, it can lead to improvements in physical and mental health and 
wellbeing, reduced mortality and reduced health care costs. A 2017 study of 
close to 1.3 million people, “Urban Greenness and Mortality in Canada’s Largest 
Cities”, found that being around trees and other vegetation reduced the risk of 
dying from several common causes of death by eight to twelve per cent.23

makers to understand the health-related business case of specific investments 
in greenspace to help inform policies, programs and planning decisions to 
enhance greenspaces. The literature review that guided the development of the 
framework showed that the evidence connecting greenspace investments to 
health outcomes was strongest for:
	
 Physical health improvements associated with higher levels of physical 
activity;
	
 Mental health improvements associated with spending time in nature; 
and
	
 Health improvements associated with lower levels of air pollution 
and specifically reduced respiratory symptoms and incidences of 
cardiovascular disease (page 24).
There is still no standard or policy to guide local governments on how 
much greenspace people need, how close to their homes, and what quality 
of greenspace or amenities should be provided to support positive health 
outcomes. Natural England created an Accessible Natural Greenspace Standard 
(ANGSt methodology) that states that each resident should have at least one 
area of accessible environmental space conforming to the following size and 
distance criteria: 2 ha, <= 300 m from home; 20 ha, <= 2 km from home; 100 ha, 
<= 5 km from home; and 500 ha, <= 10 km from home.24
Local governments can use resources like the Greenbelt Foundation’s 
conceptual framework to estimate the health-related value of greenspace for 
their community.
A common approach to determine the value of greenspace to communities 
is contingent valuation. This involves the use of surveys to determine 
the willingness of the community to pay for the services that greenspace 
provides (e.g., improved air quality, reduced health risks, access to nature 
and recreation). Other valuation methods are explained in the Greenbelt 
Foundation’s conceptual framework. 
Example: The City of Edmonton, through its Urban Forest Asset Management 
Plan, did not specifically put a value on the public health-related services the 
urban forest provides to the community. However, it drew on several of the 
City’s strategic documents and previous public engagement activities to define 
a corporate service objective for the urban forest “To provide natural areas for 
gathering, enjoying, relaxing, recreation and mental health.” Several customer 
and technical LOS measures were then defined to support that objective, based 
on highly valued services the City had identified through public consultations, 
including:

Recreation services
Recreation services play a vital role in fostering healthy, engaged and 
socially cohesive communities and is a primary service offered by most local 
governments. Local governments have typically focused on built infrastructure 
such as facilities and park amenities in their asset management plans, although 
there is widespread recognition of the value of the natural assets themselves in 
places where people recreate. 
In addition to urban parks, many types of green infrastructure such as urban 
and nearby forests, tree-lined streets, and other types of natural assets (e.g., 
a naturalized stormwater management facility), can support nature-based 
recreation. Accounting for all the green infrastructure that can be accessed for 
recreational purposes can inform natural asset management planning.27

SCALE OF ANALYSIS NEEDED TO DEFINE LOS 
	
 Natural assets located within local government jurisdiction: most 
relevant are assets in close proximity and accessible to the community 
including urban parks and greenspace, green corridors and trails.
	
 Local governments can collaborate with nearby jurisdictions to support 
community access to near urban nature for recreational purposes.
TYPE OF DATA AND INFORMATION NEEDED TO DEFINE LOS
	
 Direct observation of access to, and use of, natural assets to collect 
data on the number and type of users, the amenities they are seeking, 
time spent in greenspace, distance travelled, expenditures. Trail 
counters can provide an indication of the extent of how amenities are 
being used.
	
 Similar to public health, one common approach used to determine the 
value of greenspace to communities is through contingent valuation, 
which involves the use of surveys to determine the willingness of 
the community to pay for the services that greenspace provides 
(e.g., improved air quality, reduced health risks, access to nature and 
recreation). Local governments can also engage communities to inform 
the quality of greenspace and natural areas for recreation and features 
to prioritize, such as walking paths, shade, water features, lighting, 
birdlife, BBQs, tables and seating, dog enclosures, formal sport features, 
playground features, and proximity to public transit.
	
 For intact natural areas, local governments should build an 
understanding of the natural assets’ capacity to absorb human 
activities without compromising ecosystem functioning and biodiversity. 
For example, some local governments have identified the overuse of 
trails and camping as a key risk to natural assets 28.
	
 Valuation of recreational services for which natural assets play a role is 
not common or necessary to define LOS, but some local governments 
may wish to do a valuation if they are building the business case 
for natural asset protection and management. For example, the City 
of Toronto did an Ecosystem Assessment of its ravine system and 
included the value of recreational services it provides. The assessment 
calculated the welfare benefit of walking and biking in the ravine 
system for recreational purposes.29

Culture and heritage services
Note: This section focuses on how local governments might measure progress 
on nature-based culture and heritage benefits beyond those associated with 
recreation and public health, which may also be culturally significant and 
support overall well-being in communities. 
Nature plays an important role in supporting community culture and heritage 
goals. A cultural landscape is any geographical area that has been modified, 
influenced, or given special cultural meaning by people:

“ 
Cultural heritage honours and celebrates excellence, creativity 
and innovation from eras past that have shaped and inspired our 
present. It recognizes landmarks, sacred places and landscapes of 
memory.”

The UK National Ecosystem Assessment Follow-On describes key components of 
cultural ecosystem services as: environmental spaces; cultural values; cultural 
practices; and benefits.31 It includes a conceptual framework for understanding 
cultural ecosystem services, shown below. 
Figure 7: Conceptual Framework (Fish and Church, 2013)
Levels of service that are defined for natural assets in relation to culture and 
heritage should be based on an understanding of the needs and interests of 
the community in relation to how natural spaces contribute to their cultural 
experience and practices. An example is the City of Vancouver, which included

Local governments can support reconciliation with Indigenous peoples through 
cultural heritage goals. These goals may help prioritize protection and co-
management of natural areas that are home to, for example, sacred sites, 
cultural practices and artifacts.

Transportation services
Natural assets do not provide transportation services directly. Instead, they 
tend to be associated with local government objectives to create a connected, 
green network that serves to enhance people’s active transportation experience 
while walking, riding bikes, scooters or using mobility support devices like 
wheelchairs. Degradation of natural assets may also impede transportation 
services, for example through flooding of roads and tracks.
The City of Saskatoon’s Active Transportation Plan found that almost half of 
Saskatoon residents want to walk or cycle more often for both commuting 
and recreation. Its Green Infrastructure Strategy notes that many of the 
City’s existing paths and trails already traverse green spaces, and that 
green infrastructure could become a major component of the City’s active 
transportation network. The City’s Transportation and Construction division has 
identified a need to find overlap between the active transportation network, 
park trail systems, and the local conservation authority’s trail network. 
The City of Oshawa recognizes that connected green space has important social 
benefits for vulnerable populations, based on a significant body of research 
that indicates vulnerable groups such as children, seniors, and people with 
low income often gain the most from increased access to green spaces. Local 
governments can define objectives to track progress on providing green active 
transportation corridors in vulnerable neighbourhoods.32
With transportation services, and particularly road assets, local governments 
are increasingly recognizing the interdependency between grey and green 
infrastructure (adjacent green infrastructure that provides drainage, shade, 
aesthetic value). Low-impact development can improve drainage and build 
resilience to climate impacts. See the section on stormwater services for the 
type of data and information needed to support development of LOS for urban 
green infrastructure as part of low impact development.

Local economic development services 
Natural assets are foundational to local economies through the provisioning 
services they provide for agriculture, forestry, fishing and resource extraction. 
An example is the high-quality soils in Ontario’s Greenbelt, which contribute to 
food and drink production including fruit and other produce, wine, craft beer 
and cider, generating significant economic benefits for the region.33
Natural assets also contribute to local economies by providing opportunities for 
nature-based tourism and recreation activities. In addition, studies have shown 
that trees and nature located close to residential and commercial properties 
increase their property value. 
While the use of natural assets provides many economic benefits, local 
governments have an important role in balancing their use with their 
conservation and management to ensure ecosystem services can be provided 
sustainably over the long-term. To determine that balance, local governments 
need to consider how risks like climate change, pollution and land-use change 
from development pressure affect natural assets and could undermine local 
economies.
When local governments undertake a valuation of natural assets’ services in 
terms of their contribution to local economies, it can build a business case for 
their protection and restoration and influence land-use decisions. Note that if 
a local government or other level of government is contemplating a significant 
land-use change, for example through an official community plan update, they 
should undertake a more comprehensive analysis of all ecosystem services that 
could be affected (e.g., stormwater, drinking water, biodiversity, public health, 
recreation, local economic development, etc.). Such an analysis would build an 
understanding of the local economic development impact of the loss of natural

Section 6 	Case Studies
The case studies of the Town of Gibsons, BC, and the City of Edmonton, AB, 
provide examples of two local governments leading the way in developing LOS 
for natural assets. 
6.1.	
Town of Gibsons, BC
The Town of Gibsons, BC, embarked on a journey in 2009 to proactively 
manage natural assets when it realized the importance of the local aquifer 
in providing untreated water to three quarters of the Town’s population. 
The Town commissioned an aquifer mapping report, published in 2013, that 
expanded the community’s understanding of the aquifer’s boundaries, 
hydraulic properties, and recharge and discharge. 
The aquifer mapping report provided a good data and information 
foundation about the aquifer’s water quality and quantity, flow and 
recharge, and included 15 recommendations for the Town on how best to 
manage and protect it, shown in the table below:

The Town of Gibsons has implemented several of the recommendations in the 
aquifer mapping study and in 2017, updated its water supply strategy which 
recommended that it continue its direction of ongoing aquifer management and 
water quality management. 
The Town continues to strengthen its knowledge of the health and capacity of 
the aquifer and is now proposing modelling to further build its understanding 
of the relationship between surface water and groundwater. The modelling will 
provide insight into how natural assets such as creeks and forested areas affect 
aquifer recharge rates, and how pumping water out of the aquifer for the Town’s 
use could affect the quantity of water in the creeks and overall ecosystem 
health. Notably, a significant aquifer recharge area has been identified that lies 
outside of the Town’s jurisdiction. Protection and management of natural assets 
in the recharge area will therefore require collaboration with the Sunshine 
Coast Regional District, the Sk_wx̱wú7mesh Úxwumixw (Squamish Nation), and 
the provincial government.
The Town of Gibsons has not yet defined LOS for natural assets to measure 
progress on water service delivery, but it plans to do so in the short-term, 
possibly as part of a natural asset management plan that encompasses all 
natural assets that deliver services to the community.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES FOR NATURAL ASSETS 
The Town has adopted strategic objectives that guide how its aquifer and other 
natural assets will be managed. They should inform how corporate, customer, 
and technical levels of service are defined for the aquifer and other relevant 
natural assets: 
	
 In 2014, Gibsons adopted a municipal asset management policy that 
explicitly defines and recognizes natural assets as an asset class and 
creates specific obligations to operate, maintain and replace natural 
assets alongside traditional capital assets. These obligations include 
having well-defined natural asset management strategies in place, as 
well as the financial resources to maintain them.
	
 One of the goals in the Town’s Official Plan is to “protect the Gibsons 
Aquifer, as a source of high-quality drinking water for the Town.” The 
Official Plan goes on to say “A well-managed aquifer provides clean 
drinking water in perpetuity and reduces the risk of liabilities for new 
water purification and storage infrastructure.”
	
 The Town’s eco-assets strategy includes objectives around managing 
risk, maintaining healthy ecosystems, and long-term financial 
sustainability that requires Gibsons “to retain the fewest assets 
possible, and to ensure that assets are natural, energy-efficient and the 
lowest cost possible to operate over the long-term.”
Below are some examples of LOS measures that could be used to track Gibsons’ 
performance based on current objectives and management activities related to 
the water services delivered by the aquifer.35

City of Edmonton, AB
The City of Edmonton developed an Urban Forest Asset Management Plan 
(UFAMP) in 2021 (scheduled to be presented to council in 2022). The Plan 
outlines forecasted costs for activities and programs to manage the City’s 
urban forest over the next 50 years. It describes the characteristics and 
condition of publicly managed urban forest assets, the levels of service 
expected from them, the planned actions to achieve the levels of service 
at the lowest possible life cycle cost, and the costs and strategies to 
implement the planned actions. The Plan also shows how investments in 
urban forest management activities contribute to the City’s strategic goals: 
healthy city, urban places, regional prosperity, and climate resilience. 
SCOPE OF THE URBAN FOREST ASSET MANAGEMENT PLAN 
The natural (including enhanced) assets within the scope of the plan are both 
planted and naturally occurring.

INCLUDED IN THE PLAN
NATURAL ASSETS OUT OF SCOPE OF 
THE PLAN
Enhanced assets:
•	 Publicly owned, maintained trees 
along the city’s streets and open 
spaces 
•	 City-owned areas that have been 
managed back to a natural state 
(i.e., naturalization sites)
Natural assets:
•	 Stands of primarily native trees 
growing in tableland, ravine, 
river valley, and other city-owned 
natural areas
•	 Wetlands, 
•	 Naturally non-wooded areas (e.g., 
grass and shrublands)
•	 Naturally non-vegetated areas (e.g., 
open water and exposed sands)
The natural assets out of scope of the plan are still considered part of the City’s 
Green Network and should be incorporated in all-encompassing natural assets 
AMP as part of the City’s continuous improvement efforts.
This is the City’s first comprehensive asset management plan and its first effort 
to define Levels of Service for natural and enhanced tree assets. The City’s 
Open Space Operations Group is ultimately responsible for developing lifecycle 
management strategies and operations and maintenance activities of the 
urban forest. That said, the LOS measures defined in the Plan have implications 
for several services the City delivers, including stormwater management, 
transportation, and parks and recreation. The LOS were defined with input 
from a cross-functional group that included staff from multiple service areas, 
including the operations, planning and climate team.
ALIGNING EDMONTON’S URBAN FOREST LOS WITH ITS STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 
AND PLANS
The City of Edmonton is a large, complex organization serving a population 
of nearly one million people. The LOS defined in its Urban Forest Asset 
Management Plan had to be aligned with a range of organizational objectives 
found in multiple strategic planning documents and master plans. The diagram 
below shows how four strategic goals in the City’s Strategic Plan, Connect(Ed)
monton 2019-202836, relate to its urban forest-specific goals.
36  Source: City of Edmonton Urban Forest Asset Management Plan, page 14.

The Strategic Plan also notes the health benefits and regulating services that 
the urban forest assets provide, including pollutant filtration, carbon storage, 
water cycling, disaster protection, and mitigation of heat-island effects. The 
City of Edmonton depends on these services to meet its commitment to 
sustainability, which is a key theme underlying all corporate and strategic 
objectives. 
There were also 15 key policy directives in Edmonton’s Municipal Development 
Plan (the City Plan) that informed the LOS measures defined in the UFAMP. They 
include:
1
Protect, restore, maintain, and enhance a system of conserved natural areas 
within a functioning and interconnected ecological network. 
2
Manage the impact of environmental stressors on people and natural systems 
including excessive noise, air, and light pollution. 
3
Conserve, restore and reconnect natural areas and ecological networks within 
the built environment for ecosystem health. 
4
Improve the quality and function of habitat greenways and ecological 
connections within the Green and Blue Network. 
5
Expand and diversify Edmonton’s urban tree canopy and native vegetation. 
6
The community and Administration are increasingly knowledgeable about the 
value of natural areas, and actively involved in their stewardship. 
69

7
Conservation of Edmonton’s natural areas is increasingly achieved through 
partnerships.
8
Steward ecological networks and systems to ensure ongoing function, long-
term sustainability and ecological connectivity within Edmonton and the 
region. 
9
Acquire lands within the North Saskatchewan River Valley and Ravine system 
for natural areas protection, open space connectivity and use.
10
Edmonton protects, expands and improves access to its natural systems and 
open spaces in support of biodiversity and the health and enjoyment of all 
Edmontonians.
11
Use environmental reserve to protect land and water bodies that meet the 
definition of environmental reserve but are not claimed by the province in a 
manner that balances interests and enables contiguous and efficient urban 
development.
12
Design new and retrofit existing open spaces to encompass wellness, 
celebration and ecology at the district level.
13
Improve local open space and public amenities to support density increases. 
14
Maintain the North Saskatchewan River Valley and Ravine system’s key role as 
an environmental protection area and for open space, cultural and recreational 
uses. 
15
Incorporate nature and natural systems into the built environment.
The City Plan also includes the direction that 2 million “net new trees” will be 
planted throughout its nodes and corridors, parks, private and public realm by 
the time the city reaches a population of 2 million people. 
Finally, the UFAMP (and therefore the LOS measures) is also aligned with and 
builds on six other plans and strategies, including:
1/	 An Urban Parks Management Plan (2006), where:
	
 A minimum target of 2.0 hectares of parkland/1,000 people is 
required for new neighbourhoods.
	
 A target of 70 trees per ha was identified for areas within the River 
Valley and Ravine Parks, City Level parks, and pocket parks.
	
 Minimum targets of 45 trees per ha and 55 trees per ha were 
identified for District Activity Parks, and School and Community 
Parks, respectively.
	
 A target of 65 trees/ha for Urban Village Parks.
2/	 A city-wide Natural Areas Management Plan (2014) that identifies 
objectives and strategies for managing and restoring City-owned natural 
areas, and community stewardship strategies.
3/	 A Naturalization Master Plan (1999) that identifies candidate areas and 
criteria for naturalization areas.
70

4/	 A Natural Connections Strategic Plan (2007) that sets out the City’s 
conservation vision, goals and natural area system outcomes.
5/	 Its Green Network strategic plan (Breathe, 2017) that sets direction for 
the care and expansion of the City’s open space networks.
6/	 A Climate Adaptation Strategy and Action Plan (2018).
DEFINING STAKEHOLDER NEEDS AND INTERESTS RELATED TO THE URBAN FOREST 
The City of Edmonton follows an organization-wide approach to asset 
management planning and has tools and processes to guide staff in identifying 
stakeholder needs and interests. A cross-functional group of staff used these 
tools to identify the relevant stakeholder needs and interests for the urban 
forest during two workshops. The results were based on staff knowledge and 
insights from previous public engagement undertaken by the City of Edmonton, 
including significant engagement done during the development of its City Plan. 
The table below shows the stakeholders staff identified.
STAKEHOLDER GROUP
STAKEHOLDERS 
Service recipients:  
they use the urban forest
residents, park users, transportation corridor users, visitors, tourists, 
recreational users, researchers, schools, adjacent landowners, environmental 
special interest groups, and native flora and fauna

Other service providers:  
they require the 
municipal service/assets 
to provide their own 
services
water, power, drainage, telecom, and pipeline utilities; other city departments; 
school boards; emergency responders

LOS PERFORMANCE MEASURES INCLUDED IN THE CITY OF EDMONTON’S URBAN 
FOREST AMP
The City of Edmonton developed a set of corporate service objectives and 
customer and technical LOS that will be used to track performance on its 
Urban Forest AMP. These were defined based on their alignment with the City’s 
strategic goals and policy directives and the analysis of stakeholder needs and 
interests. The measures selected focus on stakeholder interests that have an 
impact on asset lifecycle activities and asset performance38 and address a set of 
universal service values the City uses to define LOS in all service areas:
38  Levels of service have not been defined to measure progress on all stakeholder interests. Some interests will be 
addressed through policies, master planning and other processes outside the scope of the UFAMP.

FACTORS THAT INFLUENCED THE SELECTION OF LOS MEASURES AND TARGETS 
	
1. Data limitations 
The primary focus of the AMP is on managing tree assets. While data was 
available for some of the performance measures in Edmonton’s Urban Forest 
AMP, staff identified key gaps for assessing connectivity, biodiversity including 
native plants, and specific canopy coverage targets for city owned assets. 
City staff considered adding performance measures related to reducing 
stormwater runoff, tonnes of pollution removed, and tonnes of carbon 
sequestered by the urban forest, but did not yet have the confidence in the 
methods they could use to measure performance to be able to include them 
in the current UFAMP. In addition, there were no LOS measures defined for 
enhanced or engineered green infrastructure like bioswales, rain gardens 
and other low-impact development features that contribute to stormwater 
management as these types of assets were out of scope of the Plan.
The City of Edmonton will be better able to define LOS measures related to 
stormwater, climate and biodiversity when it builds its understanding of how 
the biophysical properties and dynamic relationships between all its natural 
assets and other urban green infrastructure contribute to these services, and 
has the tools to do so. 
75
Developing Levels of Service for Natural Assets 
An Introduction for Local Governments

MNAI.ca
	
2. Assumptions
The City of Edmonton assumed that its target of 20% canopy coverage could 
be created through planting 421,500 new maintained trees and 1,900 ha of 
naturalization area with shrubs and trees, and incentivizing other property 
owners to create an additional 2,900 ha of new canopy. This assumption was 
based on limited condition data for the urban forest. Condition data was only 
available for 1.6% of the maintained trees and no condition data was available 
for naturalization or natural areas. All trees besides maintained trees were 
assumed by the City to have a condition rating of 70% for the purposes of 
valuation. The City may need to adjust its LOS targets as it builds knowledge 
about the health of the urban forest and the investments required. 
	
3 Valuation of Natural and Enhanced Tree Assets and Costs of the AMP 
The City of Edmonton estimated the value of its urban forest assets within 
the scope of the plan using two methods. The first was determining the total 
replacement or restoration costs at $1.1 billion, which includes:
	
 the cost to remove a maintained tree that has reached the end of its 
life and plant a new, usually smaller tree, including watering it for three 
years; and
	
 the cost to replant naturalization areas or restore naturally wooded 
areas plus watering for three years until the plants are established (plus 
occasional investment for renewal due to poor condition or outside 
events causing damage).
The second valuation approach recognizes the services provided by a tree or 
tree stand as it grows and its canopy increases. The estimated service value of 
the urban forest asset using this approach is $2.7 billion. For maintained trees, 
this value is based on the City of Edmonton’s Guidelines for Evaluation of Trees 
- Boulevard and Open Space Trees, Open Space Operations. For naturalization 
and naturally wooded areas the value is based on canopy cover according to 
a methodology stated within the City of Edmonton’s Natural Stand Valuation 
Guidelines.
The City of Edmonton did not do a valuation of urban forest services related 
to public health, recreation, local economy, biodiversity, or climate, although 
several LOS measures were defined to support service outcomes in those areas. 
It was able to define LOS for those services because of the linkages made 
between the services provided by the urban forest and the City’s strategic 
objectives related to sustainability. Future valuations in these areas could be 
beneficial if a strong business case is needed to protect and manage urban 
forest assets that are threatened by potential land use changes. 
The valuation of the urban forest did not influence the level of service 
measures; however, the targets do reflect what was considered realistic and 
achievable based on the estimated costs of implementing the UFAMP.

OPPORTUNITIES IDENTIFIED FOR CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT 
The City of Edmonton identified several actions that it aims to undertake that 
will support its urban forest management activities. If implemented, these will 
also ultimately lead to refining its LOS in future plans. These included: 
	
 Update management plans for the urban forest assets to more 
accurately estimate quantities of new assets and additional funding 
needed to achieve long-term goals for canopy coverage, number of new 
trees planted, and total amounts of natural and naturalized areas. The 
plans should also: 
	
 Identify primary demand factors for forecasting future quantities of 
urban assets.
	
 Confirm assumptions underlying demand forecasts in the plan.
	
 Develop a data management strategy and plan including collecting 
data on the attributes of the below-ground infrastructure, soil and 
soil volume for maintained trees and additional data on trees that 
are removed (e.g., age and reason for removal).
	
 Develop a condition assessment approach and collect data for 
natural and naturalized areas.
	
 Develop performance measures for ecological connectivity and 
diversity of native species.
	
 Plan for and improve the Emergency Response Plan.
	
 Prepare a risk framework for assessing and identifying unacceptable 
risks to infrastructure assets.
	
 Work with utility companies and developers to find new ways to 
create and share green space (page 15 Urban Forest AMP).
	
 The Plan also notes the need for the urban forest operations team to 
work with the environmental strategies team to quantify the ecological 
benefits of the urban forest such as tonnes of pollution removed, 
carbon sequestered, and quantity of stormwater runoff retained.

Appendix A: Glossary of Terms
Governments use a range of terms in reference to the protection and 
management of the environment and in relation to policies and programs 
supporting natural infrastructure solutions. Most terms in this glossary are 
drawn from the 2021 publication of the Canadian Council of Ministers of 
the Environment (CCME), Natural Infrastructure Framework: Key Concepts, 
Definitions and Terms. In cases in which CCME is not the source, MNAI is noted 
as the source of the term. 
Biodiversity: The variability among living organisms from all sources, including 
inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological 
complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, 
between species and of ecosystems.
Blue-green infrastructure: Blue-green infrastructure describes the common 
elements, linkages and connected spaces formed between water and land, 
whether in a coastal or inland, rural or urban context. It includes such features 
as lakes, ponds, marine waterways, rivers and creeks, as well as engineered or 
built water features in developed areas.
Constructed wetlands: Green infrastructure designed to mimic the terrestrial 
and aquatic features of natural wetlands, and are designed to support similar 
ecological and hydrological functions. 
Ecological Network: A network of connected natural areas that functions as a 
natural system. In urban areas, the network may be anchored by large patches 
of natural areas such as large parks, shorelines and riparian areas. 
Ecosystem services: the conditions and processes through which natural 
ecosystems (and the species that make them up) sustain a flow of direct and/or 
indirect benefits to people. They include the benefits resulting from ecosystem 
processes (e.g., flood management, nutrient cycling, water filtration and climate 
regulation) as well as sociocultural benefits (e.g., recreation, aesthetics, cultural 
heritage and practices).
Engineered Green Infrastructure Assets: See definition of green infrastructure 
below.
Enhanced Green Infrastructure Assets: See definition of green infrastructure 
below.
Forests: Forested land may consist of either closed or open forest formations, 
and demonstrate the absence of other predominant (e.g., agricultural) land use.
78

MNAI.ca
Green infrastructure: The terms natural asset and green infrastructure are often 
used interchangeably, but one is broader than the other. Whereas natural assets 
refers to the stock of natural resources and ecosystems that yield a flow of 
benefits to people, green infrastructure also includes designed and engineered 
elements that have been created to mimic natural functions and processes in 
the service of human interests. See figure below for the distinction between 
natural assets, enhanced green infrastructure assets and engineered green 
infrastructure assets (Source: MNAI1).
Green (or natural) open spaces: GOSs or simply green spaces are terms used 
to describe city or town parks, conservation areas, ravines, woodlots, riparian 
areas, provincial and federal parks, playing fields, as well as schoolyards and 
golf courses. 
Grey infrastructure: Features of the built environment made exclusively of 
materials such as concrete and steel, including bridges, dams, water treatment 
plants, culverts, concrete lined ditches and storm drains.
Habitat: A place or type of site where an organism or population naturally 
occurs. It is also used to refer to the environmental attributes directly or 
indirectly required by resident species to carry out their life processes such as 
reproduction, hibernation, rearing, migration and feeding.
Low impact development: LID is a broad-based urban planning approach 
usually used for stormwater management applications, and sometimes to wider 
practices of minimizing ecosystem impacts in the design and development of 
municipal water services in particular. Related to stormwater management, it 
involves strategies for reducing runoff and stormwater pollution by managing 
runoff as close to its source as possible.

An Introduction for Local Governments
Municipal Natural Assets Initiative

Managed landscapes: Managed landscapes include livestock grazed/grazing 
lands, farming lands and orchards. When located on natural floodplains, these 
landscapes can help prevent large-scale damage and reduce the financial 
impact of inland floods.
Municipal natural assets: Municipal natural assets are the stock of natural 
resources and ecosystem elements that are (or could be) relied upon and 
managed by a municipality, regional district, or other form of local government 
for the sustainable provision of one or more municipal services. Examples 
include native forests, shrublands, grasslands, lakes, ravines, and open water 
(Source: MNAI).
Note: Indigenous communities do not typically use the term natural assets 
as nature is typically interpreted in a broader sense encompassing all life 
represented in the Earth’s land, water and resources. MNAI uses the term 
natural assets to mirror the language of municipal asset management, 
while recognizing that expressing Indigenous traditional knowledge in 
asset management frameworks will predictably lead to better, more robust 
understandings of natural assets of all kinds and is thus a vital component of 
natural asset management.
Traditional Indigenous knowledge relies on nature-based solutions and has a 
key role to play in adaptation and resilience strategies at the local, national and 
global levels. It also builds qualitative data from a large number of variables 
instead of building quantitative data based on a small number of variables. 
When local governments interweave Indigenous knowledge, world views and 
perspectives into asset management and find meaningful ways to recognize 
Indigenous cultural and natural assets within local government processes, 
it can enhance respectful relationships that support reconciliation, the 
implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples (UNDRIP), and the Pan-Canadian Framework which recognizes the 
importance of climate action that is respectful of Indigenous peoples and 
integrates their knowledge.(Source: MNAI2)
Natural Assets (used interchangeably with the term natural capital): The stock 
of renewable (e.g. plants, animals, air, water, soils) and nonrenewable (e.g. 
minerals) resources that combine to yield a flow of benefits to people. 
Natural infrastructure (NI): refers to a specific segment of nature-based 
solutions that uses preserved, restored or enhanced ecosystem features and 
materials (e.g., water, native species of vegetation, and sand and stone) to 
meet targeted infrastructure outcomes, while providing a range of co-benefits 
to the environment, the economy, community health and well-being. It can be 
differentiated from the related category of green infrastructure based on its 
composition exclusively of natural ecosystem features and materials (e.g., water, 
native species of vegetation, sand and stone), and from grey infrastructure

because it provides a range of co-benefits to the environment, the economy, 
community health and well-being that grey infrastructure usually cannot.
Nature-based solutions (NBS): refer to nature-based measures that protect, 
repair and sustainably manage natural or human-modified ecosystems, with the 
aim of maintaining or enhancing the services provided to human communities 
and benefits to biodiversity. 
Nature (or Green) Corridors/Greenways: Habitat connections that facilitate the 
movement of wildlife and ensure the overall continuity of human communities 
with the natural environment or ecological network.
Urban forests: Urban forests are groups of trees with placement along streets 
and on rooftops, in parks and woodlands within the municipal boundaries of 
towns and cities, rural communities and on private and public lands. They are 
ecosystems encompassing shrubs and other greenery, as well as the soil and 
water that support vegetation. Nature-based projects using urban trees include 
preserving, restoring or creating forested spaces, and planting and maintaining 
street trees, those in parks, as well as managed conservation areas within a 
municipal jurisdiction. Private trees and vegetation include those in private 
front and backyards, around apartment buildings, in parking lots, and on 
commercial and industrial lots.
Wetlands: Non-tidal wetlands in Canada are located on riparian lands, on the 
natural floodplains of drainage basins, along the margins of lakes and ponds, 
and in low-lying areas where groundwater contacts the soil surface (e.g., 
swamps, marshes, and peatlands including fens and bogs). Coastal wetlands 
occur inland of ecosystems that begin offshore and move inland through 
estuaries and salt marshes.

Appendix B: Tool: Defining 
Levels of Service Using a Value 
Proposition Canvas
A Value Proposition Canvas (VPC) is a tool that can help identify and clarify 
the value of the services that infrastructure assets provide to the community’s 
various stakeholders and Indigenous rights holders. The process of developing 
a VPC can build an understanding of how a local government could positively 
influence services and prioritize service level indicators for a given asset type. 
The process is described below.1
Note that the organizations involved in the development of this guidebook 
participated in a workshop to develop a VPC for the natural asset category 
“natural spaces” in parks.2 The outputs from their workshop are included here 
as Illustrative examples. A VPC could be developed for any of the major natural 
asset and service combinations that have been described in Section 5 of this 
guidebook to help inform development of relevant LOS.
  STEP 1   	Map the typical stakeholders for the natural asset of 
interest. 
The relationship between the natural asset and service it provides is what helps 
identify stakeholders. Stakeholders and Indigenous rights holders of the natural 
asset include:
	
 People and groups that use the natural asset.
	
 People and groups that are affected by the services the natural asset 
provides.
	
 People and groups that manage, govern, or impact that natural asset in 
some way. 
Stakeholders can be grouped according to their relative importance in relation 
to the services of interest. The example below shows essential, important and 
interesting stakeholders that may use, manage, or be affected by natural spaces 
in parks that were identified during a brainstorming session.

Proposition Canvas adapted from Osterwalder, A., Pigneur, Y., Bernarda, G., Smith, A. (2014) Value Proposition 
Design: How to Create Products and Services Customers Want, John Wiley & Sons.
2    The group defined both natural spaces and parks very broadly for the purpose of this exercise and did not consider 
specific natural assets within natural spaces or the size of a park or its amenities. The examples provided here are 
illustrative only.

ESSENTIAL STAKEHOLDERS 
INCLUDING INDIGENOUS  
RIGHTS HOLDERS
IMPORTANT STAKEHOLDERS

•	 Researchers 
  STEP 2  	 Identify the services and service outcomes the asset 
provides to a stakeholder group.
i/	 Select a stakeholder group of interest to develop a VPC for. Begin by 
listing all the services that stakeholder group uses, manages, is affected 
by, or impacts in relation to the natural asset in the Products and 
Services section on the left side of the VPC tool (as shown in figures 1 
and 2 below). This side of the tool characterizes the services from the 
perspective of the organization.
ii/	 Next, identify the “jobs to be done” for or by the stakeholders in 
relation to the natural asset and the services identified. List these 
on the right side of the tool, which describes the services from the 
perspective of the stakeholder. The “jobs” or “jobs to be done” are a 
way of describing the outcomes the stakeholders are trying to achieve 
when they use, manage, impact, or are affected by the service. These 
could be functional, social, or emotional tasks.
iii/	Depending on the time available for this exercise, it will be important 
to choose a scope that matches the local government’s priorities 
and capacity. Refer to Section 3 of the guidebook that provides 
instruction on how to get started and find an entry point. Once the local 
government has selected the relevant natural assets and services they 
would like to focus on, they may wish to consider developing VPCs for as 
many essential stakeholders as possible for them, for a few important 
stakeholders, and for one or two important stakeholders.

  STEP 3  	 Identify the stakeholder gains and pains for the asset 
and related service 
Next, identify the gains stakeholders hope to achieve, and the pains the 
stakeholders want to reduce or eliminate through the “jobs” defined previously. 
Gains describe the outcomes and benefits the stakeholder wants. 
Pains describe the annoyances, barriers, or negative outcomes for stakeholders. 
Figures 1 and 2 below3 show the example VPCs for natural spaces in parks for 
two of the essential stakeholder groups that were identified: 1) residents and 
2) the ecosystem.4 It shows the suite of services provided by natural spaces for 
each stakeholder group, the jobs they are attempting to do, and the gains and 
pains experienced by the stakeholders in those attempts.

4    Note that the ecosystem is not typically included by local governments as a stakeholder in its own right, but that 
perspective may change as some governments have begun to assign inherent rights to rivers and other living 
systems).

Figure 2. Stakeholder = Ecosystem
  STEP 4  	 Identify the stakeholder gain creators and pain 
relievers for the asset and related service
Once the pains and gains associated with the stakeholder’s “jobs to be done” 
are identified, identify how the local government can create gains and relieve 
pains with the natural asset and service. List these on the left side of the tool, 
again from the perspective of the organization. These are a description of the 
specific ways in which the services provide value to the stakeholder. 
Examples:
i/	 Residents stakeholder group:
	
 Gain creator = an increase in fruit trees in parks that they can 
harvest at no cost and enjoy as a source of healthy, local food.  
	
 Pain reliever = increased shade from large trees to protect them 
from sun and heat while they are recreating in parks. 
ii/	 Ecosystem stakeholder group:
	
 Gain creator = increased coverage of pollinator trees and vegetation 
to support pollination and biodiversity. 
	
 Pain reliever = an invasive species program that controls the spread 
of invasive species.

The trigger questions below5 can be used to help identify how the services 
provided can create gains and relieve pains for each stakeholder.
TRIGGER QUESTIONS FOR STAKEHOLDER GAINS
The following trigger questions can be used to think through potential 
stakeholder gains: 
1/	 Which savings would make the stakeholder happy? Which savings in 
terms of time, money, and effort would they value? 
2/	 What quality levels does the stakeholder expect, and what would they 
wish for more or less of? 
3/	 How does the service provided delight the stakeholder? Which specific 
features do they enjoy? What performance and quality do they expect? 
4/	 What would make the stakeholder’s job or life easier? Could there be 
more services, or lower costs?
5/	 What positive social consequences does the stakeholder desire? 
6/	 What is the stakeholder looking for most? Are they searching for good 
design, guarantees, specific or more features? 
7/	 What does the stakeholder dream about? What do they aspire to 
achieve, or what would be a big relief to them? 
8/	 How does the stakeholder measure success and failure? How do they 
gauge performance or cost? 
9/	 What would increase the stakeholder’s likelihood of using or benefitting 
from the service?
TRIGGER QUESTIONS FOR STAKEHOLDER PAIN RELIEVERS 
Pain relievers describe how the natural asset and related service alleviates 
specific pains for that stakeholder. They explicitly outline how the organization 
intends to eliminate or reduce some of the pains. The following questions can 
be used to think through potential stakeholder pain relievers.
Could the natural asset and related service:
1/	 Produce savings? In terms of time, money, or efforts?
2/	 Make the stakeholder feel better? By eliminating frustrations, 
annoyances, and other things that cause problems for the stakeholder?
3/	 Perform better? By introducing new features or enhanced quality? 
4/	 Put an end to difficulties and challenges the stakeholder encounters? 
By making things easier or eliminating obstacles? 
5/	 Wipe out negative social consequences the stakeholder encounters or 
fears? 
5    Value Proposition Canvas trigger questions from Strategyzer (https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas) have been 
adapted for a local government context.

6/	 Eliminate risks to the stakeholder? In terms of financial, social, technical 
risks, or things that could potentially go wrong? 
7/	 Help the stakeholder sleep better at night? By addressing significant 
issues, diminishing concerns, or eliminating worries? 
8/	 Limit or eradicate common mistakes stakeholders make? By helping 
them use a solution the right way?
9/	 How could the natural asset and related service eliminate barriers that 
are keeping the stakeholder from adopting the value proposition?
  STEP 5  	 Organize and prioritize (define the core jobs/pains/
gains/relievers/creators)
For each natural asset and service of focus, the next step is to prioritize 
actions or interventions with the most potential to meet stakeholder needs 
and interests related to service delivery. Prioritize the gain creators and pain 
relievers. When possible, local governments should validate the services, jobs, 
pains, gains, pain relievers, and gain creators with actual stakeholders. See 
section 4.2 of this guidebook for information about the sources of information 
that local governments can use to validate stakeholder needs and interests.  
  STEP 6  	 Write a value proposition statement for each 
stakeholder group, using the following template6.
This exercise can be done for each of the natural assets and services of focus 
for the local government and for each priority stakeholder group. These will 
form the foundation of a corporate service objective. 
Substitute actual answers from the Value Proposition Canvas into the bracketed 
areas: 
	
 Our (products/services) 
	
 help (stakeholders) 
	
 who want to (jobs to be done) 
	
 by (verb, such as reducing, relieving) (customer pains) 
	
 and (verb, such as increasing, enabling) (customer gains) 
Example: 
	
 Our wastewater services
	
 help our local ecosystem
	
 who want ensure their survival, resiliency and safety 
	
 by eliminating toxic substances, foreign objects, and other harmful 
detritus from the local water supply 
	
 and increase flora and fauna diversity in and near our local water 
systems

  STEP 7  	 Identify where there are gaps and conflicts in the 
current service offering for each stakeholder group. 
How is the current way the service is delivered creating gains for each 
stakeholder group? How is it relieving pains? Local governments should seek to 
answer the following questions: 
	
 Are there any core pains/gains for any essential stakeholders that are 
not being met by the current service offering? 
	
 What information is missing about the understanding of service delivery 
or performance? 
	
 What level of influence does the local government have in the delivery 
of the service?
	
 Are there any obvious conflicts between the value propositions of 
stakeholders? Local governments should focus efforts on where there 
are gaps or conflicts. 
  STEP 8  	 Identify potential Levels of Service (LOS) objectives 
and indicators 
The VPC can help identify service objectives and customer LOS because it 
describes the specifics of the values stakeholders receive from the service, i.e., 
the gains created and pains relieved. It highlights those aspects of the services 
that are important to stakeholders and where measures can be taken to 
improve the services and alleviate problems in service delivery. The VPC is also 
useful in identifying expected customer levels of service, which are metrics that 
represent the LOS the stakeholders expect.
Local governments may already have metrics that represent the LOS currently 
being provided. They will be able to determine target LOS measures by 
undertaking a process of dialogue with elected officials, staff, and stakeholders 
to determine what service can realistically be delivered for a reasonable cost. 
The VPC, along with customer LOS, can be used to write out a short, simple 
statement that covers what the service is, what it provides, what the target 
service performance is, and how it will be measured.
See the City of Edmonton case study in Section 6 for examples of service 
objectives for its Urban Forest Asset Management Plan and related customer 
levels of service. The City included targets for most of its LOS measures.
