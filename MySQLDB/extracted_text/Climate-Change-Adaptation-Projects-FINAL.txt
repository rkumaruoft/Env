Spring Creek Channel Restoration Project
Since 2012, Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) has been 
leading the design of the Spring Creek Channel Restoration Project in Brampton, 
Ontario, with implementation expected to take place in 2019.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
Under the direction of the Climate 
Change Adaptation Project (CCAP 
– overseen by the Intact Centre on 
Climate Adaptation), 11 flood risk 
mitigation projects were implemented 
across Canada between 2012 and 
2017. The purpose of the initiative – 
and by extension this report – was to 
identify and assess practical actions 
that communities and organizations 
(i.e. municipal governments, non-
governmental organizations, 
conservation authorities) could 
engage to limit flood risk at a local or 
community scale.  
 
As illustrated in Figure 1, the projects 
were grouped into the following 
categories: Empowering 
Landowners; Rain Gardens, 
Bioretention Systems, and 
Permeable Pavement; and 
Restoration of Banks and 
Shorelines. While the two projects 
under the Empowering Landowners 
category were educational, the 
projects under the other two 
categories involved the application of 
flood risk mitigation measures.  
 
The eleven projects revealed broadly 
applicable lessons – highlighted 
throughout this report – that may 
contribute to greater efficiency applied 
to the execution of similar future 
projects. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EMPOWERING LANDOWNERS
Across Canada Workshop Series: Showcasing British Columbia’s 
“Water Balance Model Express for Landowners”
In 2014, the Partnership for Water Sustainability in BC led the Across Canada 
Workshop Series on Adapting to a Changing Climate, showcasing British Columbia's 
WBM Express in Calgary, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, and Halifax.
RAIN Home Visit Program
In 2014, Green Calgary (a local partner of Green Communities Canada (GCC)) led 
the RAIN Home Visit Program in Calgary, Alberta, where 100 home visits were 
completed by certified RAIN guides as part of a larger campaign across Canada.
RAIN GARDENS, BIORETENTION SYSTEMS, AND PERMEABLE PAVEMENT
Leaders for Clean Water ‐ Community Resilience Campaign
Between 2012 and 2015, Credit Valley Conservation (CVC) led the implementation 
of three LID demonstration projects: one in Caledon, Ontario and two in 
Mississauga, Ontario. All projects were executed with a high degree of community 
involvement.
Green Alley of Saint-Leonard
In 2015, Nature-Action Quebec (NAQ) led the implementation of a green alley 
project in the borough of Saint-Leonard in Montreal, Quebec, reducing impervious 
surfaces in the urban environment and creating a plantation zone for gardening.
Depave Paradise
Between 2013 and 2015, Green Communities Canada (GCC) led six Depave 
projects – five in Ontario (North Bay, Kingston, Otttawa, Peterborough, and 
Mississauga) and one in Alberta (Calgary). These were part of a larger campaign 
involving 30 projects done between 2012-2017.
City of Beloeil Dionis–Désilets Retention Basin
From 2014 to 2016, Nature-Action Quebec (NAQ) planted trees and shrubs in the 
Dionis-Désilets retention basin, which manages stormwater runoff from the recently 
developed Les Bourgs de la Capitale district of the City of Beloeil.
Bioretention System for Flood Risk Mitigation
In 2016, Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) led the installation of 
a bioretention system at the Kortright Centre in Woodbridge, Ontario.
RESTORATION OF BANKS AND SHORELINES
Alfred Kuehne Natural Channel Design Project: Pre- and Post-
Restoration Stream Monitoring
From 2012 to 2013, Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) led the 
restoration of a 500-metre section of Spring Creek in Alfred Kuehne Park in 
Brampton, Ontario. Pre-restoration and post-restoration monitoring conducted.
Living Shorelines: Climate Change Adaptation Along Urban Coasts
In 2015, Ecology Action Centre (EAC) led the Living Shorelines restoration project 
at Saint Mary’s Boat Club (SMBC) in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
Seymour Estuary Restoration Project
In 2015, Adaptation to Climate Change Team (ACT) supported the implementation 
of the Seymour Estuary Restoration Project in British Columbia.

TOO SMALL TO FAIL: Protecting Canadian Communities from Floods | 5 
As most of the projects involved actual implementation of flood risk mitigation measures, the findings are presented in the 
context of a project lifecycle (Figure 2). While the Empowering Landowners projects were educational, key insights from these 
projects are still included.   
 
A comprehensive analysis of the 
projects revealed two key success 
drivers that are often important 
throughout the entire project 
lifecycle: 
 
 
Partnerships and Community 
Engagement 
Partnerships and community 
engagement can significantly 
contribute to the success of a 
project. There are many ways in 
which a partner can add value 
to a project, such as through 
providing scientific expertise or 
having a significant level of 
influence and leadership in a 
community. Engaging local 
stakeholders is critical, as they 
are the ones who are directly 
impacted by floods in an area. 
Continual engagement of 
stakeholders can result in 
greater widespread support, 
which could last well beyond 
the first few years following a 
project’s implementation. 
 
 
 
Monitoring and Adjusting 
Monitoring and adjusting are 
critical to the success of a 
project. Systematic collection of 
data can provide insight on 
changes in conditions of a 
project area, indicating progress 
towards achieving the goals and 
objectives. If monitoring results 
indicate deviations from the 
predicted path of a project, 
timely adjustments should be 
made. 
 
 
 
 
 
Not only are the two success drivers important throughout an entire project lifecycle, they are very often interdependent. The 
interdependency is particularly evident in projects that involve stakeholders in monitoring activities. In such cases, the stronger 
the relationship with the stakeholder, the more effective the monitoring program will be. 
 
Whether empowering landowners to better understand flood risk, implementing bioretention measures and permeable 
pavement, or restoring banks and shorelines, all eleven projects demonstrated collaborative approaches to tackling the negative 
impacts of flooding at a local scale. 
 
Accordingly, this report presents tangible examples of flood risk mitigation initiatives that have local utility and that 
can be replicated in communities across the country. If a combination of local initiatives were deployed on scale, the 
additive benefits could materially reduce the costs of flooding at the provincial or federal level.

6 | TOO SMALL TO FAIL: Protecting Canadian Communities from Floods 
DEFINITIONS1 
 
Coastal Flooding: flooding associated with a defined shoreline 
along an ocean. Can occur due to a combination of high tides, 
storm surges, waves, rising sea levels.  
 
Ecological Restoration: a process which seeks to recover 
degraded, damaged, or destroyed ecosystems. 
 
Flood Mitigation: a sustained action taken to reduce or eliminate 
long-term risk to people and property from flood hazards and their 
effects. Mitigation distinguishes actions that have a long-term 
impact from those that are more closely associated with 
preparedness for, immediate response to, and short-term recovery 
from specific events.  
 
Flood Protection: any combination of structural and non-structural 
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or 
eliminate risk of flood damage to real estate or improved real 
property, water and sanitation facilities, or structures 
with their contents.  
 
Flood Risk: flood risk is a combination of the likelihood of 
occurrence of a flood event (flood frequency) and the social or 
economic consequences of that event when it occurs (through 
exposure to the flood hazard).  
 
Floodplain: an area adjacent to a lake, river or coast, which can 
be expected to be regularly inundated or covered with 
water.  
 
Hydraulic Analysis: an engineering analysis of flow scenarios 
carried out to provide estimates of the water surface elevations 
and velocity for selected recurrence intervals.  
 
Hydrologic Analysis: estimation of flood magnitudes as a 
function of precipitation.  
 
Infiltration (Sewer): the water entering a sewer system, including 
building sewers, from the ground through defective pipes, pipe 
joints, connections or manhole walls.  
 
Lake Flooding: flooding associated with a defined land area along 
a lake. Can occur due to a combination of high water levels, 
waves, and storm surges.  
  
Low Impact Development (LID): a of set of stormwater 
management design strategies which seek to mitigate the impacts 
of increased runoff and related pollution. 
 
Overland Flooding: flooding that occurs when runoff water flows 
from the streets onto properties causing flood damages. It can 
happen anywhere in the community, independent of an 
overflowing water body.  
 
Permeable Pavement: a pavement design in which uniformly 
graded stones are spread across a pervious paving material, used 
for managing stormwater. 
 
Rain Garden (or Bioretention System): a system which captures 
and treats stormwater runoff through a combination of soil and 
plant material. Engineering filter media may be used to enhance 
the treatment function. 
 
Regulatory Flood: the defined flood event used to delineate areas 
prone to flooding for the purposes of regulating land use. The 
minimum regulatory flood criteria standard in Canada is the 100-
year return period flood, which is the peak flood flow with a one 
percent chance of occurring in any given year. Some regions, 
provinces, and territories implement standards that are more 
stringent.  
Riverine Flooding: excess of stream flow in a watercourse, such 
that land outside the normal banks is submerged or 
inundated. Can be caused by extreme rainfall or snowmelt, or 
physical conditions (such as ice jams and undersized watercourse 
crossings) associated with a watercourse.  
 
Runoff: the amount of water deriving from precipitation/ snowmelt, 
not otherwise evapotranspirated or stored, that 
flows across the landscape.  
 
Sanitary sewer: part of the public sewage works for the 
transmission of sanitary sewage (includes human and industrial 
waste, and septic waste, but not stormwater).  
 
Storm sewer: a sewer, the purpose of which is to carry 
stormwater (including surface and rainwater, melted snow and ice) 
and water in underground pipes and foundation drains.  
 
Storm surge: the increase in coastal water levels above predicted 
astronomical tide levels (i.e. tidal anomaly) resulting from a range 
of location-dependent factors including low atmospheric pressure, 
wind and wave set-up and astronomical tidal waves, together with 
any other factors that increase tidal water levels.  
 
Stormwater: rain, melting snow and ice that washes off driveways, 
parking lots, roads, yards, rooftops, and other surfaces. 
 
Stormwater Management: the planning, design and 
implementation of systems that mitigate and control the impacts of 
man-made changes to runoff and other components of the 
hydrologic cycle. Stormwater management is better known as 
“rainwater management” in much of the world.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Flooding is a challenge of financial and social concern affecting a growing sector of the Canadian population. Multiple 
factors affect flood risk, such as a general increase in population density in urban and sub-urban centres, the loss of natural 
landscape impacting all provinces, growth in the impermeability of primarily city landscapes, all of which can be coupled 
with more intense and longer lasting storms driven by a changing climate. Despite the foreboding picture these factors 
paint, there are nonetheless many practical actions that may be deployed to mitigate flood risk. 
 
The purpose of this report is threefold: 
1. To outline the imperative for flood risk reduction in Canada; 
2. To provide examples of practical flood risk mitigation initiatives that can be deployed in communities across the 
country; and 
3. To highlight key factors that can influence the success of flood risk mitigation efforts. 
 
 
Section 1 describes the rising financial costs and causes of flooding in Canada and presents key actions to limit flood risk 
 
Section 2 profiles eleven flood risk mitigation projects that were implemented across Canada between 2012 and 2017, 
under the auspices of the Climate Change Adaptation Project 
 
Section 3 highlights factors that can influence the success of flood risk mitigation efforts, based on findings of the 
mitigation projects, and 
 
Section 4 presents summary remarks.

Figure 3: Catastrophic Losses in Canada in US$ billions, 1980 to 2016 
FLOODING: A COMPLEX PROBLEM 
 
Every year, on average, Canada faces economic losses of over $1.2 billion due to flooding.3 However, this dollar value 
alone does not illustrate the many ways in which Canadians are challenged by flooding. Considering different 
perspectives as well as the causes of flooding can help in the interpretation of this complex problem. 
 
 PERSPECTIVES OF KEY STAKEHOLDERS 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MORTGAGE MARKET 
As residential savings rates remain low 
and more households are subject to 
debilitating uninsured flood damage, 
mortgage holders may be faced with more 
flood-induced mortgage defaults. 
HOMEOWNERS 
Canadian homeowners have and will likely continue to face impacts 
due to flooding. Property damage, loss of personal belongings, and 
impacts to physical health (i.e. mould-related) and mental health 
(i.e. post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression4) are 
amongst the many ways in which flooding can affect a homeowner. 
Not only are these impacts often devastating, they can be 
exacerbated by the economic, social, and health conditions of those 
affected, leaving already vulnerable people at a greater 
disadvantage.5 People may also be forced to temporarily or 
permanently leave their homes. 
In 2017, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency 
reported that just one inch of water in a 2,500 square foot home can 
cause over $25,000 in flood damage6 – an equivalent level of 
impact could be problematic for Canadian homeowners, as follows: 
 Living Paycheque to Paycheque 
In 2017, the Canadian Payroll Association reported that almost 
half of working Canadians are living paycheque to paycheque 
and one in four would not be able to “scrap together $2000 if an 
emergency arose next month.”7 
 Households at ‘Very High Risk’ 
In 2016, a flood model supported by the Insurance Bureau of 
Canada indicated that 1.8 million Canadian households are at 
‘very high risk’.8 While this figure represents 10% of Canadian 
households, another 20% are deemed to be at ‘high risk.’ 9 
 Limited Flood Insurance 
Growing flood risk results in substantial increases to premiums. 
In cases where risk is excessive (i.e. households deemed at 
‘very high risk’ or those experiencing repeated basement 
flooding), flood insurance coverage may be reduced or 
withdrawn altogether. Every year, Canadian homeowners bear 
approximately $600 million of uninsurable losses from 
flooding.10  
INSURERS 
Property and Casualty insurers play an 
important role in absorbing the financial 
burden of natural disasters in Canada.  
When a disaster results in insured 
losses totalling $25 million or more, 
these losses are deemed 
catastrophic.11 
Relative to this definition, Figure 3 shows: 
 There has been a dramatic rise in 
catastrophic losses in the last 
decade in Canada 
While insurable payouts averaged 
$400 million per year over the period 
of 1980 to 2008, for the last eight of 
nine years leading up to and including 
2017, insurance payouts exceeded $1 
billion in Canada. 
 The insurance gap in Canada is 
significant 
Canadians have faced substantial 
uninsured losses, especially from the 
floods of 2013. 
CASE 
STUDY 
Southern Alberta Floods and 
Toronto Flood of 2013 
Losses from the 2013 floods illustrate the 
insurance gap  
Although the year 2013 did not have the 
highest catastrophic insured losses, 
Canadians were faced with the highest 
uninsured losses in this year following two 
major flooding events. In June 2013, 
Southern Alberta was inundated by flood 
waters; three people lost their lives and over 
a hundred thousand people were forced to 
leave their homes.12 A few weeks later, 
Toronto experienced severe flooding, which 
resulted in over 4,700 people submitting 
complaints regarding basement flooding.13

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 
Canada’s federal government plays an 
important role in alleviating the financial 
impacts of natural disasters by providing 
compensation through the Disaster 
Financial Assistance Arrangements 
(DFAA) program.  
Since the program’s inception in 1970, 
several notable trends have occurred. 
There has been an increase in the number 
of natural disasters for which provinces 
and territories required assistance under 
DFAA14 (Figure 4). Total compensation for 
disaster relief from 2009 to 2015 was 
greater than that of the previous 39 fiscal 
years combined.15 Of DFAA’s total 
estimated weather-related payouts, 75 
percent are attributable to flooding.16 
Although the federal government plays a 
critical role in providing compensation for 
flood damage, provinces and 
municipalities can also provide relief 
funding. 
LEGAL IMPLICATIONS 
Flood-related lawsuits are on the rise 
across Canada17 and they can involve 
homeowners, developers, local 
governments, conservation authorities, 
First Nations and Indigenous peoples, 
provinces, as well as private businesses.  
Below are some recent examples: 
 Anderson et al v Manitoba et al, 2017 
MBCA 14 (CanLII) (ongoing) 
 Wight v Peel Insurance, 2016 ONSC 
6904 (CanLII) 
 Muskoka Class Action, 2016 
(ongoing) 
Details on these cases and other cases 
are provided in Appendix A. 
PROVINCIAL / TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENTS 
Canadian provinces and territories are responsible for submitting 
claims to the DFAA program, as the federal government does not 
deal with individual claimants within the jurisdictions.18 
Provinces and territories have required and will likely continue to 
require federal assistance through DFAA to recover from natural 
disasters. However, if people are unaware of new changes in the 
availability of flood insurance, there may be serious implications. 
As stated by Public Safety Canada in their Guidelines for the DFAA, 
the following category is ineligible under the program: 
Costs of restoring or replacing items that were insured or 
insurable. Under the DFAA, insurable means that insurance 
coverage for a specific hazard for the individual, family, small 
business owner or farmer was available in the area at 
reasonable cost. Reasonable cost and availability are 
determined jointly by the province and the Public Safety 
Canada RD, with professional advice as required (e.g., 
Insurance Bureau of Canada, regional insurance broker)19 
With Canada’s flood insurance landscape in a state of flux, 
provinces and territories may enforce similar rules relative to their 
own programs. In 2016, Emergency Management British Columbia 
warned residents about expected changes to the availability of 
overland flood insurance, emphasizing a rule under their Disaster 
Financial Assistance (DFA) program: 
If a flooding disaster occurs and DFA is authorized for a 
disaster event, an applicant who could reasonably and readily 
have purchased overland flood insurance would NOT be 
eligible for DFA.20 
Although rules may vary from program to program21, all levels of 
government should work together to ensure shared understanding. 
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS 
In Canada, flood risk mitigation is typically a 
responsibility of local governments. They 
review/approve new developments and 
maintain stormwater management systems.22 
Local governments can leverage land-use 
regulations to guide development away from 
high flood risk areas and can encourage the 
adoption of flood-resilient residential 
community design standards. A combination of 
these efforts can help reduce lawsuits, if a local 
government can demonstrate actions were 
taken consistent with what courts might deem 
as an appropriate standard of care.  
 
Local government inaction to address flood risk may have serious 
financial implications. Credit rating agencies are beginning to 
examine climate change risks and potential impacts on ratings of 
tradeable assets, including municipal bonds. Insurers are also 
taking these matters more seriously, which has been recognized by 
the Association of Municipalities of Ontario (AMO):  
The insurance premiums paid by municipalities reflect the legal 
reality that municipalities are ‘deep pocket’ defendants, often 
targeted for litigation because the law has established such a 
low threshold of responsibility. Just a fraction of fault can cost 
a municipality millions of dollars. The premiums charged by 
insurance companies, non-profit insurance reciprocals and 
pools reflect, in part, this legal risk. 23

While the substantial and rising economic costs of flooding illustrate the imperative for flood risk reduction in 
Canada, the factors that are causing the flooding in the first place further demonstrate the urgency to act now. It is 
important to note that it is not one factor alone that affects flood risk but rather a combination of factors.  
 
 
UNDERSTANDING FLOOD RISK 
 
Flooding can affect urban, rural or 
coastal communities. Flooding events 
can be broadly categorized as sewer 
backup or overland, with several sub-types 
under the latter category (Table 1). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CATEGORY 
TYPE(S) OF FLOODING 
Sewer 
Backup 
Sewer backup flooding occurs when an excess 
volume of flow backs up through sewer pipes into a 
building. 
Overland 
Overland flooding occurs when water flows across 
land and enters a building. It can happen anywhere in 
a community, independent of an overflowing water 
body. Overland flooding can be caused by one or a 
combination of the following flood types: 
 Pluvial flooding: occurs when stormwater cannot 
be drained properly due to overburdened 
stormwater infrastructure or frozen ground over a 
natural drainage system. 
 Riverine flooding: occurs when there is an 
excess of steam flow in a watercourse such that 
adjacent land is submerged or inundated. Riverine 
flooding can be caused by extreme rainfall or 
snowmelt, or physical conditions (such as ice jams 
and undersized watercourse crossings) 
associated with a watercourse.  
 Lake flooding: occurs when a defined land area 
along a lake is flooded due to high water levels, 
waves, or storm surges. 
 Coastal flooding: occurs when a defined land 
area along an ocean is flooded due to high tides, 
storm surges, waves, or rising sea levels.  
Table 1: Types of Flooding 
TOO SMALL TO FAIL: Protecting Canadian Communities from Floods | 11 
There are many factors that contribute to flood risk: 
 
 
Increased urbanization 
There is a strong link between 
urbanization and flooding. Increased 
urbanization results in more 
impervious surfaces, decreasing the 
absorption capacity of the ground. 
Less permeability leads to an increase 
in the volume and rate of surface water 
runoff, as shown in Figure 5.24  
 
As over 80% of Canadians live in 
urban areas, 25 flood risk is an issue of 
significant concern across the country. 
Densely populated areas, especially 
those concentrated with high value 
assets, may be faced with substantial 
losses when a flood hits. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Climate Change 
The Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) projects 
substantial warming and increased 
frequency of heavy precipitation events 
globally in the 21st century.26 In line 
with this projection but specific to 
Canada, findings of Vincent et al. 
demonstrate an increasing trend in 
annual total precipitation in southern 
Canada from 1900 to 2012, with the 
latter 50 years showing significantly 
higher than average rainfall (Figure 
6).27  
 
While changes in climate have been 
attributed to atmospheric and oceanic 
oscillations, these factors alone do not 
explain observed trends.28 The 
changes have also been attributed to 
elevations in atmospheric greenhouse 
gas emissions through anthropogenic 
forcing, prompting global commitments 
and action in emissions reduction. 
However, according to the International Energy Association, “while countries are generally on track to achieve 
many of the targets set in their Paris Agreement pledges to reduce global warming, this is not nearly enough to limit 
warming to less than 2°C.”29 
 
Regardless of global commitments to reduce emissions, the fact remains that climate change has happened, is 
happening, and will continue to happen; the associated extreme weather catastrophes, such as floods, will ensue.

1.1 CANADA’S ACTION TO ADDRESS FLOOD RISK 
 
Recognizing the pressing need to adapt to a changing climate, the Government of Canada 
established the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change. Chapter 
four of the framework is entirely dedicated to climate adaptation and improving Canada’s 
climate resiliency. Specifically, the Government of Canada made commitments to invest in 
infrastructure that strengthens resilience and to develop climate-resilient codes and 
standards:  
 
Federal, provincial, and territorial governments will work collaboratively to 
integrate climate resilience into building design guides and codes. The 
development of revised national building codes for residential, institutional, 
commercial, and industrial facilities and guidance for the design and rehabilitation 
of climate-resilient public infrastructure by 2020 will be supported by federal 
investments.30 
 
The National Research Council of Canada (NRC), which sets “model codes” for buildings, announced its commitment to 
update most of its codes to reflect climate change and extreme weather impacts. The NRC also funded the development 
of a Guideline on Flood Proofing and Flood Prevention Measures to Protect Basement Flooding by the Canadian 
Standards Association Group (CSA Group).31 This is one of six projects launched by CSA Group to incorporate climate 
change into standards development processes. These include the development of climate change adaptation solutions 
within the framework of the Canadian Electrical Codes 1, 2 and 3, climate change adaptation provisions for the Canadian 
Highway Bridge Design Code and creation of new standards for green infrastructure to support flood mitigation and 
surface water protection.32 Concurrently, the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) identified existing standards referenced 
in National Model Construction Codes, Provincial and Territorial Regulations and Master Building Specification that 
require updating to include climate change considerations. 
 
In addition to the actions to address flood risk nationally, locally focused projects deployed en masse have the potential to 
mitigate an otherwise debilitating and pervasive Pan-Canadian risk. The following section profiles examples of locally 
deployed flood risk initiatives.

FLOOD RISK MITIGATION PROJECTS 
 
Under the direction of the Climate Change Adaptation Project (CCAP), 11 project proposals were selected from 75 
submissions made by conservation authorities and non-governmental organizations from across the country. These 11 
project proposals were chosen based on how well they aligned with the mandate of the CCAP initiative, which was to 
showcase practical adaptation solutions that could be replicated in communities across Canada to limit flood risk at a local 
level. 
 
The projects were implemented between 2012 and 2017, and they were grouped into the following categories:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Whether empowering landowners to better understand flood risk, implementing bioretention measures and permeable 
pavement, or restoring banks and shorelines, all eleven projects demonstrated collaborative approaches to tackling the 
negative impacts of flooding at a local level. While the two projects under the Empowering Landowners category were 
educational, the projects under the other two categories involved actual implementation of flood risk mitigation measures. 
 
The implementation of these projects revealed factors that influence the success of flood risk mitigation efforts, which are 
outlined in Section 3 of the report. 
 
 
EMPOWERING LANDOWNERS 
A landowner can more effectively reduce flood risk on their property if they are equipped with the right knowledge 
and tools. Specific to residential properties, there are 50 potential ways that water might enter a home and cause 
flood damage;33 thus deciding which actions are most appropriate is critical. 
 
Two projects were focused on educating and empowering landowners:  
1) Across Canada Workshop Series: Showcasing British Columbia’s “Water Balance Model Express for Landowners” 
2) RAIN Home Visit Program 
 
RAIN GARDENS, BIORETENTION SYSTEMS, AND PERMEABLE PAVEMENT 
Rain gardens, bioretention systems, and permeable pavement can be effective in reducing flood risk.  
 
Rain gardens and bioretention systems capture and treat stormwater runoff through a combination of soil 
and plant material.34 Not only do these projects vary in scale, they can either replace impervious surfaces 
or they can be incorporated into existing green space (with 30% higher absorbency relative to a patch of 
grass35).  Engineered filter media may be used to enhance the treatment function. 
 
Permeable pavement is a pavement design in which uniformly graded stones are spread across a pervious 
paving material.36 
 
Five projects were focused on implementing rain gardens, bioretention systems or permeable pavement: 
1) Leaders for Clean Water ‐ Community Resilience Campaign 
2) Green Alley of Saint-Leonard 
3) Depave Paradise 
4) City of Beloeil Dionis–Désilets Retention Basin 
5) Bioretention System for Flood Risk Mitigation 
 
RESTORATION OF BANKS AND SHORELINES 
Ecological restoration seeks to recover degraded, damaged, or destroyed ecosystems.37 Protecting and restoring 
banks and shorelines from erosion is important in reducing flood risk. The rate of erosion is dependent on both 
natural and anthropogenic processes, such as riverine sediment supply and shoreline protection respectively.38 
Planting native species in erosion-prone areas can help in stabilizing the soil39, lowering the rate of erosion and 
limiting flood risk.  
 
Four projects were focused on restoration activities:  
1) Alfred Kuehne Natural Channel Design Project: Pre- and Post-Restoration Stream Monitoring  
2) Living Shorelines: Climate Change Adaptation Along Urban Coasts 
3) Seymour Estuary Restoration Project 
4) Spring Creek Channel Restoration Project

2.1 Across Canada Workshop Series: Showcasing British Columbia’s “Water Balance Model 
Express for Landowners” 
 
Background 
In 2002, the Province of British Columbia adopted the Water Balance 
Methodology, a performance target approach for managing rainwater runoff.40 
Operationalizing this methodology, several online tools have been developed 
through inter-governmental collaboration and funding. These tools as well as 
other resources are available on the website of the Partnership for Water 
Sustainability in BC.  
 
Project Description 
In 2014, the Partnership for Water Sustainability in BC led the Across Canada 
Workshop Series on Adapting to a Changing Climate. There were five 
workshops, one in each of the following cities: Calgary, Toronto, Ottawa, 
Montreal, and Halifax. A total of 266 people participated, of which 90% were 
members of local government.  
 
The series showcased British Columbia’s Water Balance Model Express for 
Landowners (WBM Express), an online tool that helps landowners identify what 
actions can be taken to address water flow on their property, ultimately making a 
property more resilient to flooding. Two other tools were presented: 1) the 
Drainage Infrastructure Screening Tool for assessing impacts of land use 
densification and climate change on piped systems, and 2) the Irrigation 
Scheduling Calculator for improving water use.  
 
British Columbia’s collaborative and science-based approach to protecting and 
restoring watershed health could be replicated in communities across the country.

2.2 RAIN Home Visit Program 
 
Background 
Developed by Green Communities Canada (GCC) with technical assistance from 
the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction (ICLR), the RAIN Home Visit 
Program helps homeowners understand and solve stormwater issues on their 
properties. More specifically, it helps them prevent water damage caused by 
basement infiltration or sanitary sewer system backups. The program also 
addresses water conservation through rainwater harvesting and can bring 
aesthetic benefits to a property through implementation of a rain garden. These 
actions may contribute to the community’s environmental priorities, such as 
securing groundwater recharge and preventing stormwater pollution. 
 
In 2012, REEP Green Solutions led the first home visits in Kitchener-Waterloo, 
Ontario. Program delivery has continued in Kitchener-Waterloo (by REEP with 
city funding) and has expanded into Hamilton, Ontario (by Green Venture with 
funding from Natural Resources Canada) as well as into Calgary, Alberta (by 
Green Calgary, with funding from Intact Financial Corporation). To date, GCC and 
its local partners have completed 651 RAIN home visits across Canada. 
 
Project Description 
In 2014, Green Calgary led the RAIN Home Visit Program in Calgary. The project 
was aimed at empowering Calgary homeowners in taking action to de-risk their 
properties from flooding.  
 
One hundred home visits were completed by certified RAIN guides. Not only did 
the RAIN guides bring advanced technical knowledge, they have been trained as 
the “ideal homeowner” in order to effectively engage people in the identification of 
property-specific problem areas as well as in the planning and prioritization of 
appropriate actions.  
 
In November 2014, the homeowners were invited to participate in an online survey. There were 38 respondents and the 
results showed: 
 
91% of homeowners visited would recommend the service to other homeowners; 
 
87% of homeowners visited could correctly identify things they could do to reduce risk of basement infiltration; 
 
77% responded that they had already passed the knowledge they learned during the visit to others (average 
eight other people per homeowner visited). This suggests a multiplier effect that for every 100 homeowners 
visited more than 600 homeowners are reached with key messages; 
 
69% remembered they needed to re-grade around the foundation to ensure water runs away from the house; 
 
60% remembered that they should redirect downspouts 2.4m (8’) away and downslope; and 
 
57% of homeowners visited reported needing professional help in implementing recommendations. 32% said 
they had contracted service providers. Half of these (6 people) spent less than $500. 17% of these (2 people) 
spent more than $5000. One re-graded an area paved with concrete and the other re-graded and installed a 
permeable patio.

2.3 Leaders for Clean Water ‐ Community Resilience Campaign 
 
Background 
Between 2012 and 2015, Credit Valley 
Conservation (CVC) led the implementation of 
three low impact development (LID) 
demonstration projects. Whether creating rain 
gardens or implementing permeable driveways 
and boulevard bio-retention units, all projects 
were executed with a high degree of 
community involvement. 
 
Project Descriptions 
Alton Public School 
In September 2014, a rain garden project was 
launched at Alton Public School in Caledon, 
Ontario. CVC worked with students of Alton 
Public School to design and construct the 
garden, using input from the Alton Design 
Charrette. Not only did the collaborative 
design approach provide students with 
educational opportunities, it allowed them to 
form a deeper connection and sense of 
ownership with the rain garden. 
 
Kenollie Public School 
In June 2015, the Kenollie Public School rain 
garden project was launched, engaging 
students, teachers, and sponsors. As Peel 
District School Board had identified Kenollie 
Public School as a location that experiences 
chronic drainage and winter ice issues, a rain 
garden was constructed. CVC has described 
the rain garden as “part of an outdoor 
classroom”, as it is an educational resource for 
students and teachers. Monitoring equipment 
was installed allowing the school to assess the 
amount of water the garden can retain. The 
monitoring program started in 2016 and will run 
until 2019. 
 
Lakeview 
Completed in August 2012, 
the Lakeview project 
involved upgrading older 
residential roads with 
permeable paver driveways 
and boulevard bioretention 
units. Although the LID 
features are intended to 
mimic natural processes, 
regular inspection and 
maintenance is required, 
which in this case is a 
responsibility of the local 
residents. Through hosting 
an event, CVC educated 
property owners on how to 
properly maintain the 
permeable driveways and 
boulevard bioretention units.

Initiation and Planning
Using a heat map developed by the 
Institut national de santé publique du 
Québec, the site was selected. The 
project was designed to lower air and 
surface temperatures and to reduce 
flood risk through implementation of 
the following measures:
• replacing impervious asphalt in the 
middle of the alley with paving stone 
and applying new asphalt strips on the 
sides to help slow down water runoff 
and enhance water infiltration
• planting and maintaining urban 
green areas to help lower temperature 
of air and surfaces
Implementation
From May to August 2015, the Saint-
Leonard Green Alley project was 
implemented.
Post-Implementation
In October 2015, people living in the 
neighbourhood of the Saint-Leonard’s 
Green Alley were invited to participate 
in a survey. The survey results 
indicated that people were happy with 
the project.
Following the project’s completion in 
2016, a 2-year maintenance and 
monitoring program began. Led by 
Écoquartier Saint-Leonard, a local 
organization managed by NAQ, the 
program measures the alley’s 
cleanliness level, car circulation, the 
proportion of surviving plants, and the 
number of citizens involved.
2.4 Green Alley of Saint-Leonard 
 
Background 
Dating back to pre-20th century, alleyways have played an important role in the 
lives of people living in Montreal, Quebec.41 Starting as routes between farmlands 
then turning into social spaces for merchants to trade and children to play, the 
alleyways still bring people together. 
Recognizing a deficiency in green space, the Ruelles Vertes (or Green Alleys) 
program was developed. With the city first providing funding in 1997, the 
government and community groups have worked together on this initiative, 
converting over 250 blocks of alleys across 19 boroughs into green space.42  
 
Project Description 
In 2015, Nature-Action Québec (NAQ) led the implementation of a green alley 
project in the borough of Saint-Leonard, reducing impervious surfaces and 
creating a plantation zone for gardening. As Saint-Leonard has a high population 
density and a low tree canopy index, it has encountered some problems with 
stormwater accumulation and discharge of sewage. The project was aimed at 
addressing these issues, creating the first green alley of the borough.

2.5 Depave Paradise 
 
Background 
In 2012, Green Communities Canada 
(GCC) started Depave Paradise, a 
project aimed at removing impervious 
paved surfaces and planting native 
shrubs and trees in their place.43  
 
The initiative was inspired by the 
success of Depave, an organization 
based in Portland, Oregon. Since 
2007, Depave has replaced more than 
60,000 square feet of paved 
surfaces.44  
 
 
Project Description 
Between 2012 and 2017, GCC led 30 Depave projects, including the following 
below in Ontario and Alberta with CCAP between 2013 and 2015:  
While one Depave Paradise site alone may reduce the impervious cover of a city 
by only a marginal amount, the additive benefits of the projects may be 
significant. Not only have the projects helped in reducing stormwater pollution, 
decreasing runoff rates, and increasing plant biodiversity, they have engaged 
communities in understanding problems affecting the water cycle and inspired 
them to take action.

Initiation and Planning
The project was initiated to 
increase water retention 
capacity, improve water quality, 
limit the growth of invasive plant 
species, and  improve basin 
aesthetics. The design process 
involved developing plans and 
getting them approved by the 
district.
Pre-planting maintenance work 
was performed to remove 
invasive plant species.
Implementation
Between August 2014 and June 
2016, planting activities were 
completed. Initially, shrubs were 
only planted on the slopes as 
that area was not included the 
city's planned excavation work. 
In 2015, herbaceous plants and 
grasses were planted in the 
lower level of the basin.
In total, over 50 trees, 1,600 
shrubs, and 20,000 herbaceous 
plants were planted on the site.
Post-Implementation
A three-year integrated 
maintenance and monitoring 
program was approved by 
Beloeil (2016–2018). The 
program includes three to four 
site visits per year, where both 
maintenance  (i.e. weeding) and 
monitoring activities (i.e. 
measuring temperature) are 
completed.
The community is now enjoying 
this small park for both 
educational and recreational 
purposes.

2.7 Bioretention System for Flood Risk Mitigation   
 
Project Description 
In late spring of 2016, the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) led 
the installation of a bioretention system at the Kortright Centre in Woodbridge, 
Ontario. The system replaced a degraded roadside ditch along the visitor’s 
parking lot. Unlike conventional curb and gutter drainage systems that simply 
convey runoff directly to receiving waters, the bioretention system was designed 
to reduce flow volumes, holding back runoff and draining at rates similar to that in 
natural landscapes. 
 
 
 
 
Draining an area of approximately 1,150 m2, the system allows for a surface 
ponding depth of 200 mm with sufficient storage to fully capture the 25-mm event 
without overflowing. When water levels rise above the ponding depth, flows are 
conveyed through an overflow pipe directly to the outlet of the system where water drains across a splash pad and 
energy dissipater into a natural forested area on the banks of the Humber River.  
 
The bioretention system was designed to maintain predevelopment hydrologic regime, providing the storage, infiltration 
and detention functions required to attenuate the impacts of flooding on the built infrastructure. The system was also 
designed to capture and remove phosphorous from the stormwater runoff using engineered filter media. 
 
Following installation, a two year performance monitoring program was conducted, which included measurements of 
outflow temperature, water quality and flow volumes both at the outlet of the bioretention cell and at a neighbouring 
asphalt control site.  Relative to the control, results from the monitoring program showed over 70% lower runoff 
volumes,  80% lower peak flows, and the two sections of the bioretention cell with engineered filter media had effluent 
concentrations of phosphorus that were 68% less than that of the section with standard filter media.

In 2010, the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) collected 
baseline data and established measurable ecological indicators to 
effectively evaluate success in the post-restoration stage. Following the 
Ontario Stream Assessment Protocol (OSAP), TRCA collected general 
site information as well as data on physical habitat, water chemistry, and 
fish community sampling. Benthic macro invertebrates were sampled in 
conjunction with the OSAP data collection process, using the Ontario 
Benthos Biomonitoring Network (OBBN) protocol. 
 
Restoration began in 2012. Meanders and riffle-pool sequences with 
vortex rock weirs were added to reduce the energy required for water 
flow, increase overall habitat complexity and promote natural sediment 
transport. The project also aimed to improve fish and benthic macro 
invertebrate habitat, enhancing the integrity of the trophic structure. 
Multiple wetlands were created adjacent to the stream to improve water 
and sediment retention. Streambanks were stabilized using hardened 
natural substrate, embedded/pinned logs, and bioengineering 
techniques.  
Failing concrete channel in pre-restoration stage 
Restoration process 
Following project completion in 2013, TRCA led a five-year post-
restoration monitoring initiative to determine how effective the 
implemented measures were at changing the hydrologic conditions and, 
consequently, at enhancing the retention of sediment. The results from 
monitoring for three years (based on data collected in 2013, 2014 and 
2015) showed reductions in flow velocity, increases in habitat quality and 
cover, and increases in fish, benthic macroinvertebrate and aquatic 
vegetation richness, relative to the pre-restoration conditions.  
22 | TOO SMALL TO FAIL: Protecting Canadian Communities from Floods 
Initiation and Planning
The site was chosen based on the presence of significant coastal erosion, 
most of which was on the upland embankment and was caused by both 
overland stormwater runoff and ocean waves from the Northwest Arm. In 
addition, SMBC (owned by the City of Halifax) is often used by schools and 
universities for educational and recreational purposes, making it an ideal 
demonstration site in terms of opportunities for community engagement. 
Prior to restoration, three workshops were held, educating community 
members on ecology-based climate adaptation approaches while also seeking 
their input on the project plan and selection of plants. 
Implementation
In May 2015, about 70 people joined 
in the implementation of the project, 
following the Living Shorelines 
approach and building a rain garden.
Post-Implementation
In partnership with Saint Mary's 
University and Dalhousie University as 
well as Bird Studies Canada, volunteer-
based monitoring programs were 
developed to track changes in erosion 
patterns and in habitat use by bird 
species.

Initiation and Planning
The project was designed to improve the resilience of the entire estuary. 
Planned activities included: 
• contouring and reinforcement of a previously denuded shipping area,
• reintroduction of intertidal and riparian zone vegetation, and 
• the restoration of habitat conditions for salmon and other species. 
Implementation
In March 2015, project 
implementation began with a bank 
stabilization workshop that 
involved BCIT and SFU students . 
The project stablized an actively 
eroding bank about 70 metres long 
with a combination of rock, wood, 
and bioengineered materials. 
There were 8,250 plugs of seven 
native seagrass species planted in 
the intertidal zone, and 1,000 
specimens of 16 species of 
grasses, shrubs, and trees in the 
riparian zone. After the removal of 
invasive species was complete, 
logs were installed to provide 
structure.
Post-Implementation
Following the completion of the Seymour Estuary restoration project in 2015, an ongoing monitoring program has 
been designed to be conducted in upcoming years to assess the conditions of the ecosystem.
2.10 Seymour Estuary Restoration Project 
 
Background 
In 2012, Habitat Conservation Trust Foundation started the Burrard Inlet 
Restoration Pilot Program. The program was aimed at mitigating the damage 
caused by the 2007 Burnaby oil spill, which affected approximately 1,200 metres 
of the shoreline.45  Investing court-awarded funds, several projects were 
implemented, one of which was the Seymour Estuary Restoration Project.  
 
Although the spill did cause significant damage to the estuary’s fish and wildlife,46 
the estuary was in a vulnerable position to begin with. According to a 2013 report 
of the Gwa’sala-‘Nakwaxda’xw First Nation and Government of British Columbia, 
“the entire estuary is ranked as having very high shoreline sensitivity to sea 
level rise, due to the susceptibility of the estuarine sediments to erosion. 
Substantial re-arrangement of intertidal habitats and loss of trees along the 
shoreline can be expected as high sea levels and storm events coincide.”47 
 
Project Description 
In 2015, the Adaptation to Climate Change Team (ACT) supported the 
implementation of the Seymour Estuary Restoration Project. The project was 
designed to address the following issues: 1) Sensitivity to Sea Level Rise and 
Coastal Storm Surge, 2) Shoreline Erosion, and 3) Habitat Degradation.

2.11 Spring Creek Channel Restoration Project 
 
Background 
Spring Creek is a sub-watershed of the Etobicoke Creek, located in the 
Brampton, Ontario. The watercourse of the creek does not flow in a natural path. 
The watercourse has been both straightened and engineered using concrete as 
part of past efforts to address flooding. 48 Not only can this approach result in 
erosion, it can significantly damage the overall health of the creek.49 
 
Project Description 
Since 2012, Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) has been 
leading the design of the Spring Creek Channel Restoration Project. While the 
project aims to reduce the risks of flooding and erosion, it will also improve 
channel habitat.  
 
Reconnecting the creek back to the floodplain will assist in dissipating the stress 
to the channel during high flows, allowing it to spill into associated wetlands with 
the added benefit of a healthier riparian corridor and terrestrial habitats. The 
natural channel design approach develops a functional, self-sustaining stream 
system that provides valuable hydraulic (water transport), geomorphic (sediment 
erosion and transport) and ecological functions.  
 
The project plan includes the following actions: 
 
The removal of approximately 500 to 800 meters of the impervious 
concrete channel; 
 
The restoration of 12,000 square meters of adjacent valley lands; 
 
The creation of floodplain wetlands alongside the site to help manage 
local water quality and quantity during high flows; and 
 
The naturalization of the riparian zone throughout the project site. 
 
Since the TRCA must conduct its remedial flood and erosion control projects in accordance with the Environmental 
Assessment Act (EAA), the project is currently awaiting approval of the environmental assessment.  Implementation is 
expected to begin in 2019.

KEY CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF FLOOD RISK 
MITIGATION PROJECTS 
 
The eleven projects revealed broadly applicable factors that can influence the success of flood risk mitigation efforts. 
Although it can be difficult to determine the full extent to which risk has been reduced until multiple significant precipitation 
events occur, taking into consideration the best practices and lessons learned of these projects can ensure future ones are 
executed smoothly. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As the majority of the projects involved actual implementation of flood risk mitigation measures, the findings are presented 
in the context of a project lifecycle (Figure 7). While the Empowering Landowners projects were educational, key insights 
from these projects are included in the assessment below.  
 
A comprehensive analysis of the projects revealed two key success drivers that often are important throughout the entire 
project lifecycle: 
 
 
 
Partnerships and Community Engagement 
Partnerships and community engagement can 
significantly contribute to the success of a project. 
There are many ways in which a partner could add 
value to a project, such as through providing scientific 
expertise or having a significant level of influence and 
leadership in a community. Engaging local 
stakeholders is critical as they are the ones who are 
directly impacted by floods in the area. Continual 
engagement of stakeholders can result in greater 
widespread support, which could last well beyond the 
first few years following a project’s implementation. 
 
 
Monitoring and Adjusting 
Monitoring and adjusting are critical to the success of a project. Systematic collection of data can provide insight on 
changes in conditions of a project area, indicating progress towards achieving the goals and objectives. If monitoring 
results indicate deviations from the predicted path of a project, timely adjustments should be made. 
 
 
The following subsections of the report outline best practices and lessons learned under each of the three stages of a flood 
risk mitigation project.

3.1 INITIATION AND PLANNING 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The value of careful preparation and planning cannot be underestimated for a flood risk mitigation project of any scale.  
A variety of solutions exist for addressing flood risk. However, many factors must be considered when deciding on the 
best approach for a particular site. Prohibitive baseline conditions, budgetary limitations, and permitting challenges are 
amongst the many factors that could make a project unsuitable for implementation.  
 
Key findings relating to the Initiation and Planning Stage are outlined below relative to seven themes:  
1) Stakeholder Identification and 
Engagement 
2) Research and Technical Assessment 
3) Baseline information 
4) Goals and Objectives 
5) Maintenance and Monitoring Program 
6) Feasibility Study 
7) “Before” and “After” Photography 
 
 
3.1.1 
Stakeholder Identification and Engagement 
Effective identification and engagement of stakeholders can be critical to the success of a flood risk mitigation project. 
Stakeholders can affect or be affected by a project in both a positive or negative way. Stakeholders can be local or non-
local. In terms of stakeholders in supportive roles, level of involvement may vary. Depending on the type of project and 
the needs to the project team, stakeholders may include residents, schools, universities, government (local and other 
levels), conservation authorities, local businesses, utility companies, insurance companies, and industry associations. 
The following points should be considered when identifying and engaging stakeholders: 
 
 Consideration of Stakeholder Interests and Concerns 
Understanding how different stakeholder groups could affect or be affected by a project is a critical first step in the 
identification of stakeholders.  
 
 Different Levels of Government 
Through conducting research and 
communicating with government authorities, 
a project team should understand what 
needs to be done to be in compliance with 
applicable laws and regulations. Projects 
that may impact existing physical and 
ecological conditions are often subject to 
regulatory review by federal or provincial / 
territorial authorities. To avoid delays and 
additional costs, a project team should 
determine early on whether any permits are 
required. If permits are required, the team 
should estimate the time and effort needed 
to complete the permit applications. Both 
the Depave Paradise project and the Spring 
Creek Channel Restoration project were 
faced with challenges regarding compliance 
to laws and regulations. 
 
 Local Stakeholders 
Local stakeholders (i.e. residents, schools, government, community groups) play a vital role in a flood risk 
mitigation project as they are directly impacted by flooding in the area. Understanding their perceptions of flood 
risk and incorporating their interests and concerns in the design and implementation of a project is critical.

In Calgary, the project received initial positive support from the city that gave 
permission to use a city-owned park as a site for the Depave Paradise project. 
However, the original project did not identify the need for relatively expensive 
soil testing.. The project was designed to include food gardens. The testing 
requirements delayed the project beyond the feasible timeline and caused the 
local site re-design to include only non-edible plants, although upon further 
investigation there was no evidence of soil contamination.

 Participation of Local Stakeholders in Decision Making 
Not only is it important to understand and incorporate the interests and concerns of local stakeholders, having them 
participate in decision making can be beneficial. When local stakeholders participate in decision-making regarding 
targets, goals and required actions, they are more likely to dedicate their time to the project. Active and continual 
engagement can help to ensure that support goes well beyond the few first years following a project’s 
implementation.  
 
 Strategic Involvement of Supporting 
Stakeholders 
In considering potential partnerships and who 
to engage in the project, a project team should 
think about what areas they may be lacking 
knowledge and skills and how different 
stakeholders could help in addressing those 
gaps. Some stakeholders may have a 
significant level of influence and leadership in 
the community while others may have solid 
scientific knowledge and expertise. The 
Leaders for Clean Water ‐ Community 
Resilience Campaign project is one that 
benefitted from the scientific expertise of a 
partnering organization. 
 
Involving a variety of stakeholders can be helpful in both securing widespread support as well as in cutting costs and 
avoiding delays in project implementation. However, effective stakeholder engagement requires strong 
communication and coordination strategies to build and maintain strong relationships throughout the project 
lifecycle, especially when several parties are involved. 
 
 Alignment of Expectations 
Throughout the project lifecycle, especially at early stages, a project 
team should ensure continual alignment of expectations with supporting 
stakeholders. Developing a solid communication strategy early on can 
help in ensuring everyone is on the same page. Misalignment of 
expectations may lead to delays in project planning and implementation, 
which was a key lesson learned from the Depave Paradise project. 
 
 
3.1.2 
Research and Technical Assessment 
Whether done by the project team or a partnering organization, conducting 
research and assessing the conditions of a site(s) under consideration can 
be critical to the success of a project. Although the process may be time-
consuming, especially when many organizations are involved (as was the 
case in the Depave Paradise project), the information gathered can be 
helpful in both identifying opportunities and limiting the potential of an 
unsuccessful project. 
 
The following are amongst many available tools and resources that can be used, separately or in combination, to 
assess site-specific conditions: 
 
 GIS software 
Geographic Information System (GIS) software is used for storing, manipulating, and analyzing geographic data. 
Although GIS software can be quite expensive, free geospatial data is often available on many government 
websites. Natural Resources Canada provides free elevation and topographic data through their GeoGratis 
platform.50  
 
 Partnership for Water Sustainability in BC – Water Balance Tools 
The Partnership for Water Sustainability in British Columbia has many online tools for assessing site-specific 
conditions which are available for free or available through a free trial. Whether a project team is interested in setting 
watershed-specific performance targets or a homeowner would like to learn about water flow on their property, there 
are tools for various types of projects which may be helpful at different stages of a project lifecycle.

Site selection proved to be a more time-
consuming process than anticipated. Although 
there was a great deal of interest, in several of 
the communities initial site selections fell 
through or caused inordinate delays. To secure 
an appropriate project site, local member 
organizations need a lead time of several 
months in order to put out a call for potential 
sites, assess the sites and decide which 
approaches best meet the criteria, as well as to 
develop partnerships, and align expectations. 
28 | TOO SMALL TO FAIL: Protecting Canadian Communities from Floods 
Showcased in the Across Canada Workshop Series, the Water Balance Model Express for Landowners (WBM 
Express) tool helps landowners identify what actions can be taken to address water flow on their property. Through 
the slowing, sinking, and spreading of rainwater, homeowners can achieve “water balance”, making their property 
more resilient to flooding.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After making an informed decision on the selection of a site, a project team can begin planning and design. Tools and 
resources that help in site selection may also be useful in project design, particularly in collection of baseline information 
which is necessary for effective monitoring.  
 
 
3.1.3 
Baseline Information 
A project team should not begin design and 
implementation of a project without baseline 
information.  
Whether the data is collected manually on-site (as 
was the case for the Bioretention System for Flood 
Risk Mitigation project) or is obtained from external 
sources, baseline information should accurately 
reflect pre-development conditions. In cases where 
a project team is unable to collect sufficient data for 
baseline analysis, they can refer to previously 
completed projects in which similar issues were 
resolved.  
 
Baseline information serves many purposes: 
 
Supports permit applications 
 
Informs the planning, development, and implementation of monitoring programs 
 
Provides a basis for setting goals and objectives 
 
Once baseline information is collected, a project team can then use the data to set goals and objectives and to develop 
a monitoring program.

Geotechnical investigations were performed to characterize the native soil, 
water table elevation, and subsurface geological conditions beneath the 
parking lot (a development site). Selected samples of soil were analyzed to 
determine water content and grain size. The borehole data showed native 
soil conditions below the existing pavement structure to consist primarily of 
silt to silty clay soils underlain by clayey silt till material at 1.8 to 2.4 m below 
the surface.  
 
Clay content in the samples ranged between 7 and 30%. The hydraulic 
conductivity of silty clay till materials typically ranges between 10-4 and 10-6 
cm/s. The water table beneath the parking lot and across the Kortright 
property lies several meters below the surface. 
Note: 
Many of the flood risk mitigation projects 
were initiated as a response to existing local 
problems for which baseline information 
was already gathered. 
TOO SMALL TO FAIL: Protecting Canadian Communities from Floods | 29 
3.1.4 
Goals and Objectives 
After identifying stakeholders, conducting research, 
and gathering baseline data, a project team is ready to 
set goals and objectives. Involving stakeholders in this 
process can be very helpful, both informatively through 
different perspectives and in ensuring shared 
understanding. After coming to an agreement on what 
a project intends to achieve, a project team should 
define a set of actions that must be completed to reach 
the desired results. There may be several potential 
solutions that could work in achieving established goals 
and objectives, in which each solution should be 
carefully evaluated. After establishing what a project 
intends to achieve and through what actions, indicators 
for assessing progress should be established. 
 
3.1.5 
Monitoring Program 
Developing a robust monitoring program with 
explicitly defined indicators is critical to effectively 
evaluating a project. A monitoring program plan 
should include a detailed schedule of what indicators 
are to be measured, when, and for how long 
throughout the project lifecycle. Indicators should be 
scientifically-based, measurable, and statistically 
valid.  Involving key stakeholders in development of 
the program can be very helpful in obtaining support, 
as was demonstrated in the Living Shorelines project. 
 
 
3.1.6 
Maintenance Program 
Maintenance work can be critical to the success of a 
project; thus, a program plan similar to that for 
monitoring should be created. Maintenance work may 
begin prior to implementation, as was the case for the 
City of Beloeil Dionis-Désilets Retention Basin project 
3.1.7 
Feasibility Study 
Prior to implementation, a project should be 
evaluated in terms of its technical, legal, and 
economic feasibility. Although technical and legal 
aspects are often addressed in the early stages of 
planning (i.e. in site selection), it is important to re-
evaluate a project based on these factors once 
project design is complete. Similarly, economic 
feasibility should be considered and assessed both 
during initiation and in evaluating project design.  
 
When evaluating the economic feasibility of potential 
project designs, the following factors should be 
considered: 
 
 Lifecycle Cost 
Conducting a lifecycle cost assessment is a 
critical step in evaluating project design. Not only 
does a project team need to consider the costs of 
construction in their assessment, they must also 
include estimated costs of annual maintenance 
and monitoring programs.  
 
The project’s intended lifespan should be 
considered when assessing costs. Many flood risk 
mitigation projects require long-term maintenance 
and monitoring programs which sometimes are 
not feasible due to financial constraints. 
Volunteers can significantly reduce the financial 
burden of ongoing maintenance and monitoring. 
With this approach, responsibilities regarding 
monitoring and maintenance should be 
established early to avoid problems following 
project implementation. 
 
Although costs may be estimated based on those 
of previously completed projects, a project team 
should exercise caution when taking this 
approach as there are many underlying factors 
that could affect costs. While costs of materials, 
equipment, and labour may vary by location (i.e. 
region or province/territory), other factors such as 
design characteristics (i.e. length, depth, and 
width of a bioretention system) and site-specific 
baseline conditions (i.e. results of soil survey) 
may also affect costs. As documentation of 
previous completed projects may exclude 
important details affecting cost, the data should 
be carefully assessed before it is used for future 
cost estimation. 
 
 Funding 
Consistent, realistic, and auditable cost estimates 
provide a basis for establishing project budgets, 
which are needed to support the allocation of 
funding. To secure funding effectively, a project 
team should create a detailed plan of how funds 
will be used.

“Before” and “After” Photography 
Taking both pre-implementation and post-implementation photos can be very helpful in evaluating project success. 
Depending on how long implementation will take, it may be helpful to take photos during project construction as well. 
 
In taking these “before” and “after” photos, it is critical to establish reference points to allow for more effective 
comparison. Reference points may include trees, houses, power lines, etc.

3.2 IMPLEMENTATION 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Following careful planning and design evaluation, a project is ready to be executed. Generally, the better a project has 
been planned, the more smoothly it will be implemented. However, a project team could be faced with circumstances 
outside of their control that could affect the implementation and operation of the project. Having effective communication 
strategies in place while maintaining strong relationships with key stakeholders can significantly help a project team in 
facing these unforeseeable circumstances. While implementation may seem quite straightforward and far less time-
consuming than planning for most projects, there are many factors that should be considered to ensure smooth 
execution. 
 
Key findings relating to the Implementation Stage are outlined below through the following two themes:  
1) Stakeholder Involvement 
2) Adjustments  
 
 
3.2.1 
Stakeholder Involvement  
Making the best use of 
implementation tools and 
resources can help a 
project team in achieving 
their goals and objectives 
effectively and efficiently. A 
project team can exercise 
creativity in finding ways to 
engage key stakeholders in 
the implementation 
process, even if they are 
not directly involved in 
construction activities. In 
the Leaders for Clean 
Water – Community 
Resilience Campaign 
project, Alton Public School 
students painted logs which 
were incorporated into a 
frame. Not only did the 
activity contribute to the 
aesthetics of the project, it 
also allowed students to 
develop a sense of 
connection and ownership 
with the rain garden. 
 
The construction stage 
usually receives substantial 
public attention as 
community members often 
volunteer their time. Well 
developed construction 
plans can help market 
projects, raising awareness 
in nearby communities.

The Seymour Estuary 
Restoration Project is 
another project which 
benefitted from the 
participation of local 
stakeholders during 
implementation. Not only 
did they involve British 
Columbia Institute of 
Technology (BCIT) and 
Simon Fraser University 
(SFU) students through 
holding a bank stabilization 
workshop, restoration work 
involving the planting of 
native species was 
completed through a community-based planting event. 
 
 
Although involving key stakeholders and engaging with wider audiences is important during implementation, a project 
team should be prepared to deal with potential challenges.   
 
 
3.2.2 
Adjustments 
Sometimes even the most comprehensive project plans may have gaps which might only become evident during (or 
after) implementation. In such cases, appropriate action must be taken to address the issues. 
 
Below are two examples of situations that would 
require adjustments to a project plan, both based on 
lessons learned from the Living Shorelines: Climate 
Change Adaptation Along Urban Coasts project: 
 
 Unintended consequences of actions of 
stakeholders unaware of the project 
A project may be negatively affected by people 
who were not aware of it. Whether these people 
were missed in stakeholder identification or they 
are new members of a stakeholder group who 
were just not informed, it is important to address 
the problem as early as possible. Fostering 
ongoing relationships with such stakeholder 
groups can help prevent unintentional 
consequences.  
 
 Unforeseeable Circumstances 
No matter how well a project has been planned, 
there can be unforeseeable circumstances that 
could cause delays in implementation. For 
instance, harsh weather conditions and a 
partner’s departmental re-organization could 
negatively affect both the level of stakeholder 
engagement and support provided. Careful 
scheduling and ongoing communication with 
supporting organizations can help effectively 
carry out project construction, keeping it on time 
and on budget. 
 
The stronger the communication with stakeholders, 
the sooner these unintended and unforeseeable 
challenges can be identified and addressed.

PROJECT:  
Seymour Estuary Restoration Project 
In March 2015, project construction began with a bank stabilization workshop for BCIT and SFU students 
and involved stabilizing an actively eroding bank about 70 metres long with a combination of rock, wood, 
and bioengineering. The approach used semi‐natural techniques to stop erosion of the bank; reduce the 
amount and quantity of dredging required by the local shipbuilder to maintain draught for ships, which 
causes erosion due to over‐steepening; create cover habitat for aquatic species (mostly juvenile 
salmonids); and keep the access road to the estuary location intact.  
The stabilization work was followed by rehabilitation of the mouth of the estuary through habitat 
restoration achieved through flattening of the area and placement of large logs brought in to provide 
grounding for habitat, with native plants installed in June 2015 in a community‐based planting event.

PROJECT:

Adaptation Along Urban Coasts 
 Communication with grounds keeping contractors who do maintenance 
of property (lawn mowing, etc.) is important as the success of the living 
shoreline depends on its ability to grow wild and not be mowed or 
trimmed as a typical garden would. This communication challenge is 
caused by the many degrees of separation between the EAC project 
coordinator and the individuals who do the lawn care at the site. 
Fostering an ongoing relationship with the lawn care workers is 
important to ensuring the health and growth of the living shoreline and 
is an ongoing task for the project coordinator. Contractors are 
frequently changed every year, so it is often required to re-establish 
relationships.  
 
 Working with the Halifax Regional Municipality was challenging due to 
the departmental reorganization occurring during this project. In 2014, 
the city had agreed to the project and had done much of the necessary 
groundwork, but when staff changes occurred, much of that 
groundwork needed to be repeated so the new employees were up to 
date. As many employees were new to their positions or their 
department, it was difficult to bring them on board with this project and 
to cultivate enthusiasm and interest. The completion and 
implementation of the interpretive signage and the maintenance of the 
site took a considerable amount of time and effort. 
 
 The harsh winter weather caused the rescheduling of workshops 
several times, which made ensuring participation of key stakeholders 
and engaged citizens difficult.

3.3 POST-IMPLEMENTATION 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The long-term success of a flood risk mitigation project very often depends on adequate maintenance and monitoring 
activities following the project’s implementation. Depending on the type of project, maintenance and monitoring may 
begin several weeks or even months after construction. If members of the local community are responsible for these 
activities and the leading organization is interested in receiving updates regarding progress and any issues, there 
should be a solid communication strategy in place. For instance, if members of the local community are responsible for 
maintenance and monitoring work and local priorities shift, a project may be left with little or no support. The volunteer 
involvement of local stakeholders may be a cost-effective approach but may require some extra work in checking if 
monitoring and maintenance activities are taking place and whether they are being carried out properly. Without the 
proper maintenance and monitoring, a project may be less successful at reducing flood risk. 
 
In addition to maintenance and monitoring of the project site, there are several other post-implementation activities that 
can take place. With reference to the ‘Partnerships and Community Engagement’ key success driver, a project team 
may engage in activities that educate and inspire others to take on similar projects. With reference to the ‘Monitoring 
and Adjusting’ key success driver, a project team may be interested in evaluating success in terms of the return on 
investment (ROI), which could inform adjustments that need to be made for future projects. 
 
Key findings relating to the Post-Implementation Stage are outlined below through the following three themes:  
1) Maintenance; 
2) Monitoring; and 
3) Other Post-Implementation Activities. 
 
3.3.1 
Maintenance 
Following project construction, ongoing maintenance 
activities should take place to ensure the implemented 
measures are (or will be) successful in meeting the 
project’s goals and objectives.  
 
Those responsible for conducting maintenance activities 
should be equipped with the necessary knowledge and 
tools required to do the work properly. Any potential 
deficiencies in knowledge should be addressed early and 
there are many ways in which this can be done. For 
example, the Leaders for Clean Water – Community 
Resilience Campaign project held an event to educate 
property owners on how to maintain permeable 
driveways.   
 
Although the RAIN Home Visit Program project did not 
follow a typical project lifecycle, the project team was 
able to identify resources which stakeholders were 
missing to implement adaptation measures. A similar 
approach could be taken when communicating with 
people involved in maintenance activities, gauging their 
level of readiness. 
 
Some projects may combine maintenance and monitoring activities. The City of Beloeil Dionis-Désilets Retention Basin 
project is an example of a project that carried out maintenance and monitoring activities at the same time.

Monitoring 
While monitoring and adjusting is critical throughout the entire project lifecycle, monitoring in the post-implementation

Risk Mitigation project, and Alfred Kuehne Natural Channel Design project all had robust monitoring programs:

PROJECT:  
City of Beloeil Dionis-Désilets Retention Basin 
 
A three-year maintenance program was 
approved by the City of Beloeil (2016–2018). 
The maintenance program includes three to four 
visits to the site per year between May and 
October. Maintenance work consists of weeding 
plant beds, pruning shrubs and trees, controlling 
of exotic invasive plants, and adding chipped 
wood in planted areas. The temperature at 
various spots in the project location is recorded 
on each visit. The methodology for these 
records is described below. 
 
To measure the project’s impact on the heat 
island phenomena, temperatures at the 
site, taken during each site maintenance visit, 
will be recorded over a two-year period 
(2017–2018).

KEY SUCCESS DRIVER #2: MONITORING AND ADJUSTING 
PROJECT:  
City of Beloeil Dionis-Désilets Retention Basin 
The methodology will be to take the temperature at nine locations on the site using an infrared thermometer. The recording sites were 
determined using various criteria that can affect temperature, such as soil height, soil humidity, and shade level. At the end of 2017, we had 
made three temperature recordings; three or four further recordings will be performed in 2018. It should be noted that the basin’s water 
retention capacity and water quality have not been 
measured with scientific instruments; however, we 
perform site visits to ensure that retention capacity is 
sufficient, that the basin does not leak, and that plants 
and soil are still filtering water adequately.  
 
Thus far, the temperature records show that: 
 the warmest location is point 1, while the coolest 
location is point 3. We can therefore deduce that 
temperatures increase as a function of altitude. 
 the temperature difference between the street (point 
1) and all the other points in the basin (points 2 to 
9) varies from 12.4 to 32.2 degrees Celsius, for an 
average of 7.1 degrees. We can therefore say that 
the higher the soil’s mineral content, the more 
temperatures increase. 
 In general, temperature increases as a function of 
soil humidity: the higher the soil humidity, the lower 
the temperature.

PROJECT:  
Bioretention System for Flood Risk Mitigation 
 
The 2-year monitoring program assessing water retention and stormwater control 
was developed to include the following measurements: 
 precipitation;  
 flow rates and volumes; and 
 water quality, temperature, and water level.  
 
A tipping bucket rain gauge installed within 500 m of the study site will be used to 
monitor precipitation. Outflow rates, volumes, and water quality will be monitored in 
a surface sampling hut installed down gradient of the site. Tipping bucket flow 
meters will record data every 5 minutes and flow restrictors will be used to ensure 
the outflow rates do not exceed the equipment maximum flow rate threshold 
(60L/min).  
 
ISCO portable water samplers will collect samples over the duration of each event. Discrete samples collected at 15-minute intervals will be 
weighted according to flow, and combined to form volume weighted composites, from which event mean concentrations can be determined. 
Influent sample concentrations will be determined from flow weighted samples collected from the asphalt control section. Samples will be 
submitted to the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks Laboratory in Etobicoke for analysis following MOECP lab 
preparation and submission protocols. The variables that will be analyzed are based on typical stormwater runoff contaminants in runoff from 
both parking lots and urban centres. 
 
Results of the monitoring project will be assessed in relation to the original design objectives and targets for the project. The monitoring data 
will also be used to calibrate a hydrologic model that will be used to assess performance of the system during flood flow conditions (5-100 year 
events).

3.3.3 
Other Post-Implementation Activities 
In addition to monitoring and maintenance, there are other post-implementation activities which a project team could 
engage in: 
 
 Surveys 
Surveys can be used to gain 
useful insight from stakeholders, 
either from those responsible for 
maintenance and monitoring 
activities or those who may be 
directly impacted by the project. 
Through conducting a survey, the 
RAIN Home Visit Program found 
that the time when a survey is sent 
is important. In the Green Alley of 
Saint-Leonard project, a survey 
was conducted which showed that 
the initiative has improved the 
quality of life of people in the 
neighbourhood. 
 
 
 Education on Project Site 
To further educate members of the 
local community, a project team 
may create informative boards and 
put them on site, which was a plan 
set out in the City of Beloeil 
Dionis–Désilets Retention Basin 
project. Informative boards may 
include information on the 
implemented flood risk mitigation 
measures as well as details on the 
historical significance of the site.  
 
 Media Attention 
To attract attention to a project, 
various forms of media may be 
used, such as news papers, radio, 
television, Facebook, and Twitter. 
The Depave Paradise project is 
one project that received 
considerable media attention. 
Hosting local events can help 
attract attention and can be 
effective in terms of bringing 
together a variety of stakeholders. 
 
 Online Resources 
Project documentation may be 
made publicly available to help 
people interested in replicating 
similar projects, which was done in

 Calculating return on 
investment (ROI)  
Calculating the return on investment 
is a very important post-
implementation activity. Although 
sometimes it may be difficult to 
quantify the monetary value of 
ecosystem services, a project team 
can estimate such value based on 
previously completed studies. This

make sense to replicate the 
project in other areas. This was 
done in the City of Beloeil Dionis-

City of Beloeil Dionis-Désilets Retention Basin 
According to Environment Canada,1 floods cost Canadians millions of dollars in property 
damage, lost production and wages, and trade deficits. 
 
For Quebec alone, federal payments related to floods have totalled $301,179,846 since 
1970. According to the Insurance Bureau of Canada, Canadian insurance companies 
pay out over $1.3 billion annually in indemnities due to flooding.2 
 
Urban heat islands also have significant economic consequences. First, energy 
demands in affected areas are extremely high (e.g., air conditioning). Trees help keep 
the sun off building walls and windows in summer; they also block winds during winter, 
which reduces heating costs. It is estimated that a mature tree can take up as much as 
450 liters of water from the soil and release it through evapotranspiration; the cooling 
effect of this cycle is equivalent to five air conditioners running for 20 hours per day. In 
one Montréal borough, it is estimated that trees can save up to $0.28 per year per tree in 
electricity costs.3 Urban heat islands also impact health and mortality rates. 
 
In the Dionis-Désilets retention basin, there are 25 buildings directly adjacent to the site. 
The project’s total cost was $178,200, for a per-building average cost of $7,128. Given 
all the benefits mentioned above, we assume that the return on investment is positive, 
even though we cannot quantify it.

CONCLUSION 
 
This report presents tangible examples of practical flood risk mitigation projects that can be deployed in communities 
across Canada. Based on key findings of these projects, the report describes numerous factors that can influence the 
success of local flood risk mitigation efforts, each factor being specific to a stage of the project lifecycle (Initiation and 
Planning, Implementation, and Post-Implementation). In particular, the report highlights two characteristics common to all 
successfully deployed projects: 1) Partnerships and Community Engagement, and 2) Monitoring and Adjusting. Not 
only are the success drivers important throughout an entire project lifecycle, they are frequently interdependent. Stronger 
relationships with key stakeholders often lead to more effective monitoring and adjusting, ultimately increasing the 
likelihood of successful flood risk reduction. 
 
Whether empowering landowners to better understand flood risk, implementing bioretention measures and permeable 
pavement, or restoring banks and shorelines, all eleven projects demonstrated collaborative approaches to reducing flood 
risk which can be easily replicated – thus they are scalable – in communities across the country. If future projects are 
deployed on scale, the additive benefits could materially reduce the costs of flooding at the provincial and federal level.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“Climate systems, like economic systems, are complicated: 
the forces at work can interact in unforeseen ways, so there 
are some significant unknowns. But these unknowns are all 
the more reason to act, especially if they imply even a small 
risk of a truly catastrophic outcome.”51

CASE NAME 
(YEAR) 
DESCRIPTION 
(damages, cost and settlement amounts included where identified) 
DEFENDANTS 
Anderson et al v 
Manitoba et al, 2017 
MBCA 14 (CanLII) 
(ongoing)  
Manitoba 
A $950 M class action lawsuit was brought forward by 4,000 residents of four First Nations following 
severe flooding in the spring of 2011. A flood resulted in damage to property and the evacuation of 
many people from their homes. Plaintiffs brought claims of negligence, nuisance and breach of treaty 
rights, alleging that the Government of Manitoba contributed to the flooding through its operation of 
flood control measures and water control works that affected the water levels around the four First 
Nations. The class action lawsuit was certified in January 2017 and is moving forward. 
Province, Manitoba 
Association of Native 
Fire Fighters Inc. 
Wight v Peel 
Insurance, 2016 
ONSC 6904 (CanLII) 
Ontario 
A plaintiff sued their insurance company in contract for denying her coverage after a section of a 
nearby dam burst on a neighbour’s property, causing a flash flood and damage to the plaintiff’s home. 
The insurer initially denied the plaintiff’s claim, but in a decision on the plaintiff’s motion for summary 
judgment, the court found that the dam was a “water management system” and that the plaintiff’s policy 
provided coverage for the accidental escape of water from a sewer or drain. 
Insurance company 
Muskoka Class Action, 
2016 (ongoing) 
Ontario 
A $900 M class action was launched by Muskoka residents, cottage owners and business owners 
against the Province of Ontario after damages were caused by flooding and high water levels. Plaintiffs 
allege that the Ministry of Natural Resources was negligent for failure to draw down the water levels 
and/or effectively manage the water levels. The claim is ongoing. 
Province 
Cerra et al. v. The 
Corporation of the City 
of Thunder Bay, 2012 
(ongoing)  
Ontario 
Floods in May 2012 resulted in severe damage in Thunder Bay. Plaintiffs allege negligence in repair, 
inspection and maintenance of the water pollution control plant, as well as lack of diligent operation and 
supervision at the time of the flood (including an allegation that alarms were ignored). The $300M claim 
is ongoing. The court certified action on consent in 2013. 
Municipality 
Vancouver Public 
Library Lawsuit, 2012 
(ongoing)  
British Columbia 
The City of Vancouver sued the developer, construction company, professional services/ design 
consulting firm and contractor company for damage caused by an October 2010 flood at the 
Kensington branch of Vancouver Public Library. The City claims that the catch basins were not 
constructed in accordance with the construction design details prepared by the civil engineer, that 
defendants were aware the library entrance was prone to flooding, and that defendants failed to take 
action even after the plaintiff notified them of the issue. This action is ongoing. 
Developer, 
construction company, 
professional 
services/design

Maple Ridge Class 
Action. 2010 (ongoing) 
British Columbia 
Fifteen households filed a class action lawsuit against a developer and contractor, two engineering 
firms, and the City of Maple Ridge after a 2010 flood. Plaintiffs allege that defendants were negligent, 
arguing construction failure, faulty workmanship and design, failure to inspect basements for leaks and 
failure to repair leaks as requested. Plaintiffs also argue that the houses were not waterproofed to 
code, despite the municipality’s inspection, review and issuance of permits. The trial was scheduled to 
begin in 2016. The claim is ongoing.

Panza et al v. The 
Corporation of the City 
of Mississauga et al., 
2012  
Ontario 
Upper and lower tier municipalities, the province and the conservation authority were all named as 
defendants in a negligence claim related to systemic flooding over several years in the Lisgar area of 
Mississauga. The $200M action was withdrawn before trial. However, this case shows the potential for 
systemic flooding to give rise to class action lawsuits.

Dankiewicz v. 
Sullivan, 2011 ONSC 
3485 (CanLII)  
Ontario 
A property owner sued her neighbour, alleging negligence and nuisance after her neighbour’s 
alteration of land caused a reversal of drainage flow and subsequent flooding. The court held that the 
flooding resulting from the defendant neighbour’s actions constituted a nuisance. The court awarded 
the plaintiff $5,000 in recognition of the distress, inconvenience and interference with her enjoyment of 
her land, caused by the flooding, as well as $4,257 for replacement trees, a sump pump installation 
and other expenses related to the damage in her yard. 
Homeowner 
Dicaire v. Chambly, 
2008 (QueCA) 
Quebec 
The Quebec Court of Appeal dismissed a class action by owners of 1,723 homes that flooded in 1997 
when sewers backed up following heavy rains. The court ruled that the sewers were designed, as 
provincial guidelines required; to cope with a “5-year storm,” and the town was not obliged to do more. 
However, the court noted that current design standards might not protect municipalities in future 
lawsuits, in light of “recent climate phenomena” and other scientific advances. 
Municipality 
Lissack v Toronto, 
2008 OJ No 5563 
Ontario 
The City of Toronto’s storm sewer backed up following a heavy storm and flooded the plaintiff’s 
basement. The plaintiff brought an action in negligence for damages against the city. The court found 
that the city breached its duty of care by failing to maintain and improve stormwater management 
systems. 
Municipality 
McLaren v. Stratford 
(City), 2005 CanLII 
19801  
Ontario 
A major flood in the City of Stratford after severe rainfall in 2002 left many with sewage in their 
basement. Plaintiffs claimed negligence in design, construction operation and maintenance of the 
system. The class was certified by the court in 2005, and the case was settled in 2010, eight years 
after the flood. Stratford settled for $7.7M after already spending $1.3M in emergency relief and costly 
improvements to its system thereafter. 
Municipality 
Ingles v Tutkaluk 
Construction Ltd., 
2000 1 SCR 298, 
2000 SCC 12  
Ontario 
The appellant hired a contractor to renovate his basement. The required building permit was not 
obtained prior to construction. The inspector relied on the contractor’s assurances that the 
underpinnings were properly constructed, without properly verifying this information, except for an 
examination of the concrete. The appellant began to experience flooding and hired another contractor, 
who determined that the underpinnings were completely inadequate and failed to meet the standard 
prescribed in the Building Code Act. The appellant sued the first contractor for a contractual breach 
and the city for negligence. Even though the owner consented to the construction without a permit, the 
City was also found negligent for failing to conduct an adequate inspection and ended up paying 
$185,000 in costs and rewards. 
Municipality, contractor 
Oosthoek v. Thunder 
Bay (1996) 1996 
CanLII 1530 (ONCA) 
Ontario 
After a storm in Thunder Bay, multiple homeowners’ basements flooded. The plaintiffs brought an 
action alleging that the city knew of problems and acted negligently. The City was found liable for the 
flooding caused by the overloaded combined sewers. The city’s negligence was based on its failure to 
enforce the by-law it passed requiring downspout disconnection from the sewage system.
