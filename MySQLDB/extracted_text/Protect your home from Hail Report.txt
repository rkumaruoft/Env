About the Institute
for Catastrophic Loss Reduction
The Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction (ICLR), established in 1997, 
is a world-class centre for multidisciplinary disaster prevention research 
and communication. ICLR is an independent, not-for-profit research 
institute founded by the insurance industry and affiliated with 	
Western University.
The Institute’s mission is to reduce the loss of life and property caused 
by severe weather and earthquakes through the identification and 
support of sustained actions that improve society’s capacity to adapt to, 
anticipate, mitigate, withstand and recover from natural disasters.
ICLR’s mandate is to confront the alarming increase in disaster losses 
caused by natural disasters and to work to reduce disaster deaths, 
injuries and property damage. Disaster damage has been doubling 
every five to seven years since the 1960s, an alarming trend. The 
greatest tragedy is that many disaster losses are preventable. ICLR 
is committed to the development and communication of disaster 
prevention knowledge. For the individual homeowner, this translates 
into the identification of natural hazards that threaten them and their 
home. The Institute further informs individual homeowners about 	
steps that can be taken to better protect your family and your home.
The purpose of this handbook is to outline actions that homeowners 
can take to protect their homes from hail damage. Some of these 
measures are simple and free; others cost money. All contribute to 
reducing the risk of hail damage.

Hail damage
The need to address the problem of mounting hail-related damage in 
Canada could not be more acute, as property owners and insurers have 
experienced hundreds of millions of dollars in hail damage in recent 
years and will likely see more hail damage in Canada going forward. 
This, not necessarily because of any projected increase in the number 	
of hailstorms, but due to the increased concentration of assets in 
Canadian cities and suburban housing developments, and the 	
ever-growing costs of replacing damaged and destroyed property.
From an insurance perspective, most of the largest hail damage 	
events recorded in Canada have occurred in the province of Alberta. 
Indeed, the top three most expensive hailers took place in that 
province. But this can lead to a false sense of security, as hail can affect 
every province and territory in Canada and, historically, has to some 
degree or another. Indeed, as the map indicates, the majority of hail 
days in Canada occur in British Columbia, Alberta, the Prairies and 
southern Ontario.

Hailstones generally become destructive when they are about the size 
of a quarter or larger. Once they reach that size, they have the 
capability to cause extensive damage to industrial and commercial 
assets; public infrastructure; trees, vegetation, crops and livestock; 
homes and other structures; and vehicles.
An analysis of the data available on recent hailstorms in Alberta 	
indicates that while the number of damaged vehicles is substantial 
when large hail falls, damage to houses is equally as frequent. Data 	
also indicate that the average hail claim is roughly twice as much for a 
home than for a vehicle. 
This publication is designed to assist homeowners whose residences are 
at risk of damage from hail.
It provides an overview of key areas in and around the house that may 
require attention in order to reduce the risk of hail damage.

How hail forms
Hail too large
for cloud to hold
falls to earth
causing strong
cold downdraft
Freezing level
Rain drops being sucked
into the updraft
Hail growing in circulating
convection currents
Hail is a form of precipitation that is made up of (sometimes odd) 
formations of ice and snow. Hail forms in cumulonimbus clouds due to 
the violent convection (rising and falling) currents that are present in 
the storm cloud (as indicated by the blue and red arrows). Particles of 
rain or snow are drawn vertically up through the cloud and collide with 
supercooled water and other particles, such as dust. These collisions 
lead to the particles sticking together. If the updrafts in a thunder cloud 
are strong enough, the hail stones can rise and fall several times, 
getting quite large before they become too heavy to remain aloft. 	
Hail stones can range from pea size to golf ball size, and up.

First steps
Understand your home’s vulnerabilities
Depending on the size of the hailstones, wind speed and the duration 
of a storm, hail can cause a great deal of damage to a home’s roof, 
exterior walls, and doors and windows, among other components. It is 
important to be aware and educated about your home’s vulnerabilities 
to the threat of severe hail and other hazards.
      Talk to your insurance provider
It is critical that homeowners talk to their insurance provider to 
understand what types of damage are covered under their policy. 
Sometimes specific types of damage can be excluded depending on 
your policy, or policy deductibles may vary depending on the cause of 
damage. Insurers can also identify common sources of damage that 	
you should watch for and may be able to direct you to educational 
resources on hail damage reduction.
      Have a private building inspector evaluate your home
Because every home is different, private building inspectors can offer 
important insights into the age of your home and your home’s capacity 
to withstand hail and other hazards.

Taking action on your own
These actions cannot guarantee the safety and security of any home 
but, if addressed, will help to minimize the risk of hail damage.
Hail and your home
Hail-related insurance claims involving homes are often to repair 	 	
visible damage only. However, large hail events result in claims for 
replacement of damaged roofs, shredded and missing siding, and 
broken windows and skylights – all of which can allow water into a 
home, leading to even more damage.
Some of the measures that can 
be taken to protect homes 
against hail have become 
clearer and better understood 
in recent years, thanks greatly 
to larger and more in-depth 
forensic damage studies and 
insurance claims surveys 
conducted immediately after 
major hail events, and through 
more advanced laboratory 
testing, conducted by such 
groups as the Tampa-based 
Institute for Business and 
Home Safety (IBHS). 
Roofing
The vast majority of homes in Canada (more than 90 per cent by some 
estimates) have asphalt shingle roofs.
Two main resiliency standards have been developed by standards 
setting agencies for shingle manufacturers.
The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has developed 
testing protocols and standards for both fibreglass and organic asphalt 
shingles. Fibreglass shingles with an ASTM D 3462 certification and 
organic shingles with an ASTM D 225 certification comply with ASTM

Home Safety (IBHS) conducts an analysis of a freshly fallen 
hailstone before it begins to melt and its properties change.

standards. To meet these 
standards, shingles must 
pass nail-withdrawing and 
tear strength tests.
Underwriters Laboratory 
(UL) has developed testing 
protocols and standards 	
for both wind and impact. 	
Only on withstanding 	
60 mile-per-hour 	 	
(~97 km/h) winds for two 
hours will shingles win 	
the UL wind certification. 
As for hail, the shingles 
have to remain unscathed 
under a barrage of steel 
balls simulating the energy 
hailstones could have. 
Consumers can check 
product brochures and 
shingle packaging for 	
the ASTM and UL labels. 
However, ASTM standards 
are not typically used by 
Canadian shingle 
manufacturers whose 
products are not exported 
to the U.S. Generally, they 
are only used for shingles 
that are manufactured in 
the U.S. or manufactured 
in Canada and imported 	
to the U.S.

Quick facts about the Class 4 UL 2218 impact test
The UL test drops 	
a steel ball from 	
20 ft. to see if the 
material will crack.
On a standard 
shingle, cracks and 
ruptures will appear 
after the ball is 
dropped.
On a Class 4 rated 
shingle, no evidence 
of cracking or tearing 
will be seen after 	
the test.
Impact resistance testing
7
For an impact resistant (IR) roofing standard that 
is used by both U.S. and Canadian shingle 
manufacturers one must look to Underwriters 
Laboratories standard UL 2218 Impact resistance 
of roofing systems, which is the recognized 	
norm for asphalt roofing regularly used in both 
the U.S. and Canada.
According to the Institute for Business & Home 
Safety (IBHS) “UL 2218 is a test that is 
administered by Underwriters Laboratories and 
involves dropping steel balls of varying sizes from 
heights designed to simulate the energy of 
falling hailstones. Class 4 indicates that the 
product was still functional after being struck 
twice in the same spot by 2” steel balls.” IBHS 
notes that this standard is appropriate for flexible 
roofing products like asphalt shingles, and metal 
roofing products.
Researchers have noted that a Class 4 rated new shingle manufactured 
under the UL standard will hold up very well against most hailstorms 
experienced.
ICLR advocates for the installation of Class 4 impact resistant roofing 
that meets UL 2218 for all homes located in regions of moderate or high 
risk of hail. The moderately higher cost over installation of a Class 1 
shingle is small given the potential savings.
Homeowners re-roofing their homes and builders conducting major 
renovations or constructing new homes should use Class 4 shingles 
whenever a home is being built in a moderate to high-risk hail zone, 
such as in southern Alberta and southern Saskatchewan. Other 
considerations include use of roof systems other than asphalt, such as 
rubber, metal or plastic.
Homeowners, builders, 
insurers and others should 
not confuse shingle 
warranties with resiliency 
standards. Warranties 	
are simply marketing 
devices created by the 
shingle manufacturer for 
business purposes. 	
A longer warranty 	
(such as with a ‘25-year 
shingle’) does not directly 
equate to strength or 
resilience of the product 
or its ability to withstand 
extreme wind or hail.
8
Roof slope is an important 
factor when considering 
damage from hail. A steeply-
sloped roof can reduce overall 
hail damage in two ways. 
First, if the hail falls in a 
relatively straight path, a 
steep roof can limit damage 
as it is usually direct – and 	
not glancing – impacts from 
hailstones that cause roof 
damage in hail storms 	
(steep roofs limit direct hits 
and increase glancing or 
ricocheted of hailstones). 
Second, if the hail falls on an 
angle, while the part of the 
roof facing the wind will 
likely experience damage, 	
the wind-shaded side may 	
get less or no damage, 
depending on the angle 	
of impact and steepness of 
the roof.
It is important to note that while several types of roofing materials have 
passed the UL 2218 test and, therefore, are considered impact resistant; 
many of these materials (such as ceramic tile, slate, concrete and metal) 
are still subject to cosmetic damage from hail resulting in potential 
insurance claims and higher insurance premiums for homeowners. 
These materials tend to be considerably costlier to replace than 	
asphalt shingles.
Figure 1a
Figure 1b
The home on the left would sustain greater roof damage 
because of the more direct impact from hailstones. 	
The home on the right would experience less roof damage 
because of the less direct glancing blows.
Wind conditions can distort damage to a home. The home 
on the left has more glancing blows to the roof from 	
the wind, while the windward wall comes under attack 
from direct hail impact. The right wall is protected and 
undamaged from the hail. The home on the right will 	
more likely sustain roof damage on the windward side 
because of the more direct impact.

The Institute suggests that full roof underlayment be installed over 	
the entire roof deck prior to installation of the final roof cover. Such 
underlayment can provide a good secondary line of defence against 
water penetration and ice buildup, particularly if the primary cover is 
damaged by wind or hail. In addition to basic underlayment, the seams 
in the roof decking can also be sealed using several different products.
While there are several underlayment products available on the market, 
from asphalt-saturated felts to synthetic underlayments, ICLR suggests 
that homeowners consider the comprehensive protection offered by 
self-adhering waterproofing underlayment (commonly referred to as 
ice-and-water shield). The use of these components can significantly 
protect against immediate water entry in the event the roof cover is 
damaged by extreme hail.
Other components of a home
In moderate hailstorms, it is often just the roof of a home that is 
damaged. However in larger, very destructive storms, the experience is 
that while roughly half the damage is related to the roof, the other half 
is related to siding, vents, soffits, fascia, skylights and fenestration 	
(i.e. windows and doors). To-date, while a significant amount of research 
has been conducted on roofing 
systems, little has been done on these 
other items, which can prove to be 
significant sources of damage. 
But while there is a void in the science 
and testing, and virtually no impact 
resistance standards exist for siding, 
vents, soffits, fascia and fenestration, 
some early work has been done that 
may potentially point to promising 
solutions to prevent such damage to 
private homes. 
Cement fibre siding, such as Hardie board, 	
	
stands up much better to hail impact than does 
aluminum or vinyl siding and also adds more 	
resistance to fire, making it well suited to areas that 
are exposed to hail, wildfire and high winds.

Siding
One important consideration to minimize major hail damage to houses 
is to encourage use of cement board (a.k.a. fibre or Hardie Board) 
where aluminum or vinyl siding would otherwise be used, particularly in 
high-risk hail zones. While cement board is more resilient to hail than 
vinyl and aluminum, an additional benefit is its higher resistance to fire, 
which makes it suitable for use in the wildland urban interface (WUI) 
where risk of damage/loss from wildfire is greatest.
An early objection to cement board from homeowners was that the 
product did not come in designer colours and, therefore, had to be 
painted every few years. In recent years, however, manufacturers have 
begun to offer cement board in several designer colours.
Skylights, windows and doors
While there are no impact resistance requirements for skylights, 
windows and doors in the country, some Canadian manufacturers 
produce these items for sale in the domestic market and for export 	
to U.S. hurricane-prone states. Miami-Dade County in Florida does 	
have an impact resistance requirement for such items, but it is not 
immediately clear if these products are 
readily available in the 	
Canadian market.
Homeowners, renovators and builders 
are encouraged to make inquiries to 
domestic manufacturers (many of 
which are small, local companies) and 
sellers of skylights, windows and 
doors to determine if impact resistant 
products are readily available in the 
Canadian market.
In mild to moderate hail storms, damage to homes is 
usually limited to roofs. However, in larger hail storms, 
extensive damage can be done to siding, skylights, 
windows and doors.

It is important to mention that window safety films are readily 	
available at most home renovation stores in Canada. Such films usually 
do not make window glass unbreakable, but do make it harder to 
break (providing added security against break-and-enter and theft). 
Further, these films ensure that glass does not shatter into tiny 
fragments and enter a home with enough force to injure occupants. 
These films often have the added bonus of providing energy 	
efficiency-improving UV protection. Moreover, safety films can also 
reduce the risk of water entering the home through broken windows, 	
a major source of damage.
Vehicles
Vehicle-related hail damage often costs Canadians (and their insurers) a 
significant amount of money. Further, most homeowners in the country 
own at least one vehicle.
When it comes to protection of vehicles against hailstorms, the 
simplest, most common and most effective form of mitigation is to get 
vehicles under cover prior to a storm. Such cover can be permanent – 
as with carports and garages; or temporary, as with commercial fabric 
shade systems used to shelter open lot vehicle inventories like those 
found at car rental lots and auto dealerships in the southern U.S. 
When use of permanent or temporary structures is not possible, 	
custom car covers or blankets, such as the type used by owners of 
vintage cars, may be considered as alternatives. Though there are 
several manufacturers and sellers of car covers/blankets purported to be 
‘hail resistant’, it is not immediately clear if any have been subjected to 
rigorous scientific hail testing, and currently no standards bodies have 
published standards for such products. Therefore, consumers are 
warned that they use such products at their own risk. 
These products require the owner to deploy them ahead of a 
thunderstorm. While forecasting and warnings for severe weather 
continue to improve, a person should never jeopardize their own 
life-safety when attempting to use such a product.
12
Another way insurers are working to prevent hail damage
The Alberta Severe Weather 
Management Society (ASWMS) is a 
private, non-profit organization 	
that was established by the property 
and casualty insurance companies 	
of Alberta to reduce the risk of 	
hail damage.
Cloud seeding is a form of 
intentional weather modification that 
involves the process of dispersing a 
substance such as silver iodide into 
developing clouds. The intention is 	
to alter the cloud’s micro-physical 
properties which results in a change 
of the type of precipitation that 	
will fall. Cloud seeding does not 
eliminate hail, but it does seek to 
reduce the size of hailstones which 
would result in less damage.
Cloud seeding seeks to reduce the 
size/frequency of hailstones, which 	
in turn reduces damage to people’s 
gardens, crops, homes, cars and 
businesses. Cloud seeding also helps 
to control insurance company losses, 
which in turn helps to stabilize 
insurance rates.
Aircraft seed clouds with 
            silver iodide particles
Silver iodide particles cause cloud moisture 
to freeze and create ice crystals
Ice crystals grow and fall 
as rain/snow

Protecting your home and 
vehicles from severe hail
A	 Purchase a home with a steeper 
sloped roof as flatter roofs are more 
vulnerable to hail damage.
B	 When re-roofing, install full roof 
underlayment, preferably self-
adhering waterproofing underlayment 
(a.k.a. ice-and-water shield).
C	 Use roofing products with the 
Underwriters Laboratories UL 2218 
Class 4 impact resistance rating.
D	 Use brick cladding or cement board 
(a.k.a. fibre or Hardie Board) siding in 
place of aluminum or vinyl.
E	 For skylights, windows and doors, 	
use products made to withstand 		
high debris impact such as those 		
with a ‘Miami-Dade’ impact 	
resistance rating.
F	
An alternative are window safety 	
films which are readily available at 
most home renovation stores.
G	 Whenever possible, keep your vehicle 
parked under permanent cover 
(garage or carport).
