Background: The current and future harms caused by climate change are highly distressing. Different theoret-
ical models suggest diverse impacts of distress on behavior. We examined how psychological distress, cli-
mate change distress, and social norms may foster or impede climate change activism.
Methods: As part of an ongoing online longitudinal study in the US beginning in March 2020, respondents
were assessed on their depressive symptoms (CES-D 10), climate change distress, climate change mitigation
social norms, and six outcomes of the climate change activism behaviors of writing letters, e-mailing, or
phoning government ofﬁcials; voting for candidates who support measures to reduce climate change; sign-
ing petitions; volunteering with organizations; donating money to organizations; and attending protests.
Results: Of the 775 respondents, 53% were female, 72% white, 12% Black, 7% Hispanic, and 6% Asian. Climate
change social norms predicted all six climate change actions in the bivariate and multivariable cross-sec-
tional logistic regression models. A similar ﬁnding was observed with the brief climate change distress scale
(BCCDS), except it was not associated with volunteering in the multivariable model. Depressive symptoms
were associated with greater odds of contacting government ofﬁcials and signing petitions in the bivariate
models but did not retain signiﬁcance in the multivariable models. Longitudinal models indicated a weak
association between depressive symptoms and climate change activism.
Conclusions: Climate change distress and social norms are positively associated with climate change activism.
Although climate change distress may not usually impede climate change activism, organizations addressing
climate change should consider providing social support to members and assisting those with high levels of
psychological and climate change distress. Social norms around climate change activism should be fostered.

Introduction
Climate change mitigation is an enormous undertaking. It requires
moving a global economy off fossil fuels. Massive amounts of capital,
political organization, and well-functioning governments are needed
to limit global warming to reach the goals outlined in the Paris Agree-
ment [1]. There are also entrenched business interests and political
parties opposed to meaningful climate mitigations. Developing and
implementing policies to address climate change will require exten-
sive and sustained collective action. Collective action can provide the
co-beneﬁts of social cohesion, a sense of community, and social
support, which can, in turn, foster sustainable collective action. This
manuscript examines engagement in advocacy actions to address cli-
mate change and mental health and social predictors of climate
change activism.
At the individual level, climate change is causing concern or worry
for many Americans. The Yale Climate Change in the American Mind
project documented an increase in worry about climate change in
the last decade. By 2021, 70% of Americans reported that they were
at least “somewhat worried,” and 35% of respondents reported that
they were “very worried” about global warming [2]. The burgeoning
ﬁeld of mental health and climate change research has produced
detailed measures of and identiﬁed different types of climate change-
related psychological distress [3]. There is an emerging body of
research on “eco-anxiety,” which is an experience of fear about

environmental damage or disaster. A systematic scoping review in
2021 identiﬁed nine studies on eco-anxiety [4]. This research domain
has linked anxiety about climate change to poor mental health [5].
The percentage of Americans who reported that climate change
“probably” or “deﬁnitely” affects their mental health rose from 47%
in 2019 to 68% in 2020 [6], after a season of devastating wildﬁres and
tropical storms. Given that the impact of climate change is increas-
ingly felt by many, more research investigating associations between
eco-anxiety and mental health is needed.
Climate change mitigation and adaptation require system-level
change, yet there is a critical lack of “political will” for climate action
[7]. This situation necessitates the mobilization of citizens advocating
for policymakers to enact meaningful climate change policies. There-
fore, it is essential to know if distress about climate change impedes
or facilitates behaviors to address climate change when fostering cli-
mate change activism. However, the relationship between psycho-
logical distress and engagement in climate change action is not well
understood.
Some theories of behavior change suggest that psychological dis-
tress may impede action. For example, social cognitive theories of
behavior change hypothesize that anxiety and depression can reduce
self-efﬁcacy and hence reduce the probability of effective behavior
change [8]. Additionally, the theory of learned helplessness would
suggest that experiences of helplessness, which could be caused by
an individual-level inability to address climate change, may lead to
lower motivation levels to engage in climate change action [9]. In a
study of Canadian college students, Landrey et al. found that learned
helplessness moderated the relationship between environmental
concern and pro-environmental behavior [10]. Anxiety and depres-
sion may also lead to burnout [11] and reduce climate change actions.
In distinction from the perspective that negative mood states may
impede climate change action is the perspective that negative mood
states may impel action. If people are overloaded with demands on
their time, energy, and attention, they are more likely to attend to
highly salient information with strong emotional valance [12]. Fur-
thermore, evidence suggests that negative as compared to positive
events are more memorable; hence, it may be that negative emotions
are more likely than positive mood states to lead people to act on cli-
mate change [12]. In contrast to these hypothesized and observed
relationships between psychological distress and climate change
action, Clayton and Karazsia reported that climate anxiety was not
correlated with individual-level pro-environmental behavior in an
online sample [13]. Previous research has produced conﬂicting ﬁnd-
ings on the potential relationship between psychological distress and
climate change action, and additional studies are needed to elucidate
these associations.
While working to understand the directionality of the relationship
between mental health and climate change action, it is also essential
to examine the relationship between climate change-related distress
and potentially pathological states, such as depression. Often nega-
tive mood states and cognitions such as depression, anxiety, worry,
and feelings of helplessness are highly correlated. Yet, depression
and climate-speciﬁc distress may play different roles in engagement
in climate change action. For example, an Australian study found that
eco-anger was negatively associated with anxiety and depression, as
measured by the DASS-21 [14], and greater engagement in pro-cli-
mate activism [15]. However, the study also found that eco-anxiety
was associated with higher general anxiety levels and a lower likeli-
hood of collective climate action. In the present analysis, we assess
the relationship between depressive symptoms and climate change
distress as well as examine the independent and adjusted association
of climate-change distress and depressive symptoms on climate
change actions.
Climate change activism is also impacted by factors other than
psychological well-being, and it is important to understand the social
dynamics that may foster it. Social network norms may impact
engagement in climate change activism. When faced with complex
issues, such as climate change mitigation, social inﬂuence often plays
a role in behavioral responses [16]. How others act can motivate
engagement in similar behaviors. Additionally, peers can serve as
heuristics or models of climate change action behaviors [16]. Doherty
and Webler’s study of Vermont residents found that social norms
impacted engagement in climate change political activism, including
contacting government ofﬁcials, voting for “green” candidates, and
protesting [17]. A greater understanding of social inﬂuence processes
may be helpful in designing programs to promote climate change
activism. Social norm interventions have successfully promoted
energy conservation and are linked to a range of pro-environmental
behaviors [18]. These same social dynamics likely inﬂuence climate
change activism.
This study assesses climate change activism behaviors, such as
contacting elected representatives, supporting organizations working
on the issue, and attending climate change rallies [19]. We examine
three questions: (1) How are social norms associated with engage-
ment in climate change actions? (2) What is the relationship between
climate change distress and climate change actions? (3) What is the
relationship between depressive symptoms, climate change distress,
and climate change action?
Methods
Procedures and participants
Study participants were from the online longitudinal COVID-19
and Well-Being Study, which started in March 2020 [20]. This study
examines individual, social, and societal-level ﬂuctuations amid the
rapidly changing landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic. Questions
about climate change were included in the study, as climate change
impacts health and well-being in the current era [21]. Study assess-
ments occurred every few months and aimed to capture changes in
COVID-19-related information, behaviors, and health status. Partici-
pants were recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk).
MTurk is a crowdsourcing platform for recruiting individuals from
over 40 countries to work on different tasks. Researchers can gener-
ate a HIT (Human Intelligence Task) that gives MTurk users a descrip-
tion of the online task, compensation, and anticipated time to
complete the task. Although MTurk is open to anyone age 18 or older
with internet access, study-speciﬁed qualiﬁcation requirements can
restrict potential participants to those who are eligible. For example,
qualiﬁcation requirements can restrict the audience based on geo-
graphic location, number of HITs completed, quality of prior work,
and age. This platform is regularly used by health, social, and behav-
ioral researchers, as it allows for diverse samples to be collected rap-
idly and in a timely manner [22]. Previous research suggests that
MTurk provides better-quality data in less time than other conve-
nience samples [23]. Study populations recruited through MTurk are
not nationally representative but outperform other samples on sev-
eral dimensions [24]. Studies using MTurk have demonstrated good
reliability [25]. Moreover, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the demo-
graphic characteristics of MTurk respondents have been stable [26].
The study protocols followed MTurk’s best practices, including
ensuring participant conﬁdentiality, protecting study integrity, gen-
erating unique completion codes, integrating attention and validity
checks throughout the survey, repeating study-speciﬁc qualiﬁcation
questions,
and
removing
ineligible
participants
[23,27,28].
To
enhance data quality, the study enrollment criteria were embedded
in a screener that did not explicitly delineate the study criteria. This
method reduces the bias to over-report speciﬁc attributes to enroll in
the study. Individuals were paid for the screener and those who were
eligible were invited to join the study. Eligibility criteria included
being age 18 or older, living in the United States, being able to speak
and read English, having heard of the coronavirus or COVID-19, and

providing written informed consent. Additionally, to enhance reli-
ability, eligible participants were required to pass attention and
validity checks embedded in the survey [29]. These checks included
survey questions with exceedingly low probabilities, such as deep-
sea ﬁshing in Alaska and having several appendages removed.
We also repeated questions to ensure consistency. Finally, we
examined participants’ time to complete the survey and veriﬁed data
completeness.
In the current study, we utilized data from wave 1 (baseline,
March 24th-27th, 2020), wave 4 (November 18th-29th, 2020), and
wave 7 (November 16th-29th, 2021). We chose these waves to exam-
ine whether the association might differ by phase of the pandemic
and to have a longitudinal analysis component. Depressive symptoms
were assessed at each study wave, while climate change activism,
distress, and social norms were only assessed at wave 7. Participants
were compensated $2.50 for wave 1 and $4.25 for wave 4 and wave
7. This amount was equivalent to approximately $12 per hour. The
study protocols were approved by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg
School of Public Health Institutional Review Board.
Measures
Climate change actions
The six climate change activism behaviors were derived from
Doherty and Webler [17]. These items asked about participation (yes/
no) in the following actions in the last year: “Wrote letters, e-mailed,
or phoned government ofﬁcials to urge them to take action to reduce
climate change,” “Voted for candidates who support measures to
reduce climate change,” “Signed a petition to curb climate,” “Volun-
teered with organizations working to curb climate change,” “Donated
money to organizations working to reduce climate,” and “Attended
protests or rallies to reduce climate change.” These items were indi-
vidually modeled as it was hypothesized that variables associated
with each item might differ. The six climate activism behavior items
were also added together for a composite measure of the level of
climate change action [17]. Engagement in climate change activism
behaviors was assessed at wave 7.
Climate change distress
The brief climate change distress scale (BCCDS) assessed depres-
sion, anxiety, worry, and feelings of helplessness and hopelessness
associated with thinking about climate change. The ﬁve questions
included “News about climate change tends to depress me,” “Think-
ing about climate change makes me anxious,” “I worry about the
future because of climate change,” “I sometimes feel hopeless about
the future because of climate change,” and “I feel helpless to do any-
thing about climate change.” The response categories were “Strongly
agree,” “Agree,” “Neither agree nor disagree,” “Disagree,” and
“Strongly disagree.” A Principal Component Analysis revealed one
factor that accounted for 70.1% of the variance and an Eigenvalue of
3.5 (Cronbach’s alpha 0.89, range 5-25). Climate change distress was
assessed at wave 7.
Depressive symptoms
Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 10-item Center for
Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D 10), which has been
well validated [30, 31,32]. The questionnaire asks respondents to
indicate how often they experienced 10 possible symptoms of
depression during the past week. The response categories were:
Rarely or none of the time (1=less than 1 day), Some or a little of the
time (2=1-2 days), Occasionally or a moderate amount of the time
(3=3-4 days), and All of the time (4=5-7 days) (Cronbach’s alpha 0.90,
range 10-40). The 10 items were summed after reverse coding the
two positively worded items. The CES-D 10 was assessed at each
study wave.
Climate change mitigation social norms
Social norms were assessed at wave 7 on 5-point scales with the
items “Most of my friends are trying to act in ways that reduce cli-
mate change,” “My family and friends think it is important that I take
action to reduce climate change,” and “How much of an effort do
your family and friends make to reduce climate change?” The three
questions were summed to create a scale (Cronbach’s alpha 0.83,
range 3-15) with higher scores indicating greater pro-climate change
mitigation social norms.
Sociodemographics
Demographic variables were analyzed and included age and sex,
assessed as biological sex at birth. The categories for race/ethnicity
were White, Non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, Asian, Mixed, and Other.
Due to small sample sizes, multiracial and “other” categories were
collapsed into one category. Political party afﬁliation was assessed
with the question, "Do you consider yourself Republican, Democrat,
Independent, Libertarian or Other?" Due to the small cell size, the
Libertarian and the “Other” groups were collapsed into the “Other”
group. Educational attainment was dichotomized as a bachelor’s
degree and higher versus an associate degree or less. Family income
was assessed and dichotomized, based on the median, at less than
$60,000 versus $60,000 or more.
Analyses
Descriptive statistics of means, standard deviations, and percen-
tages were ﬁrst calculated, and a correlation matrix was used to
examine the relationship among the ﬁve climate change distress
items. Then logistic regression models were used to examine associa-
tions between sociodemographic factors, climate change mitigation
social norms, level of climate change distress, depressive symptoms
and the six dichotomous climate change actions outcomes. Scale
items were converted to z-scores to facilitate comparisons between
the scales. For the multivariable logistic regression models, all socio-
demographic variables (age, sex, income, race/ethnicity, and educa-
tion) were included as potential confounds, and other variables with
a p-value of <0.20 in the bivariate models were also included in the
adjusted model. This approach allows for both the measurement and
the control of potential confounds. We also graphically assessed the
relationship between the mean number of climate change actions
and climate change mitigation social norms, brief climate change
distress scale scores, and depressive symptoms (CES-D 10 scores) to
better understand the whole distribution. In a ﬁnal analysis, we
examined the correlations among the waves 1, 4, and 7 depressive
symptoms (CES-D 10 scores), climate change distress at wave 7, and
the number of different types of climate change actions at wave 7.
Climate change distress scale scores were controlled to examine the
unique contribution of the level of depressive symptoms to the num-
ber of climate change actions in the prior year. The sample size was
not determined for the speciﬁc analyses; instead, the goal was to
obtain a sample for the longitudinal study and have sufﬁcient power
to detect a 15% difference with 500 respondents.
Results
The mean age of subjects in the sample was 41, and slightly more
than half (53%) were female (Table 1). There was a substantial distri-
bution by race/ethnicity in the sample, with 72% white, 12% Black, 7%
Hispanic, and 6% Asian. There was also a distribution of political afﬁli-
ation with 23% Republican, 46% Democrat, 27% Independent, and 4%
other. The sample was well educated, with 60% reporting a bachelor’s
degree or higher, and 44% reporting an annual household income of
more than $60,000. The sample also reported a high level of climate
change action participation in the prior year, with 51% voting for a
candidate who supported measures to address climate change, 24%

signing a petition, and 25% donating money to organizations working
to reduce climate change. Other activities were less frequently
reported, with 11% reporting that they volunteered with organiza-
tions working to curb climate change, 11% wrote letters, e-mailed, or
phoned government ofﬁcials to urge them to take action to reduce
climate change, and 7% attended protests or rallies to reduce climate
change. Participation in no climate change actions was reported by
42% of the sample; 24% reported one, 15% reported two, 10% reported
three, 5% reported four, 2% reported ﬁve, and 3% reported all six
actions. The mean score on the CES-D 10 was 17.86 (Range: 10-40) at
wave 7. The ﬁve items on the brief climate change distress scale were
all statistically signiﬁcantly correlated (p<.01), with Spearman’s cor-
relations ranging from 0.41 to 0.75 (Table 2).
In the multivariable logistic regression models of the six climate
change actions (Table 3), age was positively associated with voting
and negatively associated with volunteering and attending rallies or
protests. Sex was not associated with any of the outcomes. There was
a consistent ﬁnding of Democratic political party afﬁliation linked to
all climate change action outcomes in the bivariate models and con-
tacting governmental ofﬁcials, voting, and donating in the multivari-
able models. A higher level of education was also associated with all
outcomes except petition signing in the bivariate models and four of
the six outcomes in the multivariable models (not petition signing or
donating). Lower income was associated with two outcomes (con-
tacting governmental ofﬁcials and attending protests or rallies) in the
bivariate and multivariable models.
In all the bivariate and multivariable models, climate change miti-
gation social norms were associated with all six climate change
actions. A similar ﬁnding was observed with climate change distress,
except it was not signiﬁcantly associated with volunteering in the
multivariable model. The level of depressive symptoms was only
associated with greater odds of contacting government ofﬁcials and
signing petitions in the bivariate models. These associations did not
retain signiﬁcance in the multivariable models.
The subsequent analyses graphically examined the association
between depressive symptoms, climate change distress, climate
change social norms, and the number of different types of climate
change actions in the prior year. As seen in Fig. 1, there is a linear
association between climate change distress and the number of
different types of climate change actions. However, at the right
end of the climate change distress distribution, there appears to
be a drop-off in the number of different types of climate change
actions.
In
comparison,
there
is
a
clear
linear
relationship
between the level of climate change mitigation social norms and
the number of different types of climate change actions. The rela-
tionship between the level of depressive symptoms and the num-
ber of types of climate change actions is modest and curvilinear,
with those reporting very high levels of depressive symptoms
less likely to be engaged in climate change actions. The measure
of depressive symptoms and the climate change distress distribu-
tion (Fig. 2) also demonstrates a deviation from linearity at the
right end.
The ﬁnal analyses examined the relationship between prior levels
of depressive symptoms (baseline and wave 4), climate change dis-
tress (wave 7), and the number of climate change actions reported
(wave 7) among the 414 participants who completed all three waves
(Table 4). Level of climate change distress was strongly associated
with the number of climate change actions in the prior year (p<.01,
r=.46). Wave 1 and wave 4 CES-D 10 scores predicted the number of
climate change actions in the prior year in wave 7 (r=.17, p<.01,
r=.11, p<.05). However, after adjusting for climate change distress at
wave 7, neither wave 1 nor wave 4 CES-D 10 scores predicted the
level of climate change action at wave 7.

Discussion
This study identiﬁed climate change distress and social norms
about climate change mitigation as strong and independent factors
associated with engaging in climate change activism behaviors. How-
ever, Clayton and Karazsia reported that their measure of climate
change anxiety was not associated with pro-environmental behav-
iors [13]. Yet, their measures of behaviors were individual pro-envi-
ronmental such as recycling and turning off lights, while the current
study assessed climate change activism behaviors. One key question
to further explore is whether depression, anxiety, and climate change
distress have similar inﬂuences on individual-level pro-environmen-
tal behaviors. Future research should also examine the relationship
between individual-level pro-environmental behaviors and collective
actions and assess if promoting individual-level pro-environmental
behaviors leads to collective actions.
The current analysis expands on Doherty and Webler’s ﬁndings
that identiﬁed climate change mitigation social norms as a predictor
of engagement in climate change action [17]. Doherty and Webler’s
analysis included Vermont residents who were highly concerned
about climate change. The current analysis generalizes these ﬁndings
using a US population sample with diverse views about climate
change mitigation.
Another key ﬁnding from this study is that climate change distress
and depressive symptoms have a differential impact on climate
change activism behaviors. The measure of climate change distress
included items that assessed depression, anxiety, worry, hopeless-
ness, and helplessness. These ﬁve items were all signiﬁcantly associ-
ated, with correlations ranging from 0.41 to 0.75, with anxiety and
depression having the highest correlation. These strong associations
suggest that we are measuring the construct of climate change dis-
tress which, albeit correlated, is distinct from clinical depression and
anxiety. One advantage of the current study was that the brief mea-
sure of climate change distress was strongly associated with several
climate change activism behaviors. We encourage other researchers
to use this brief measure in studies of other populations.
The relationship between depressive symptoms and climate
change distress was slightly linear. However, it demonstrated a devi-
ation from linearity at the right end, suggesting that this relationship
may plateau at high levels. Despite the correlation between the level

of climate change distress and depressive symptoms, depressive
symptoms were not independently associated with engagement in
climate change action. In contrast, scores on the brief climate change
distress scale were consistently and independently associated with
climate change activism behaviors. This study also identiﬁed a non-
linear relationship between climate change distress and engagement
in climate change action. A drop-off was evident at the extreme right-
hand tail of the plot of climate change distress and climate change
action. These ﬁndings suggest that severe levels of climate change
distress and depressive symptoms may impede climate change
actions.
Study ﬁndings suggest that it is important to acknowledge climate
change distress and promote methods of channeling it into climate
change activism behaviors and ensuring that it does not lead to psy-
chopathology or deleterious coping mechanisms. Providing social
support by climate action organizations may be beneﬁcial. This sup-
port can be accomplished by structuring climate change action activi-
ties in small groups, providing personal feedback and support to
members, and providing opportunities for activists to get to know
each other and support each other. It may also be beneﬁcial to
acknowledge in forums with climate change activists that climate
change distress is an appropriate reaction to the current situation
and that climate change distress is not pathological or irrational.
Leaders of climate change action organizations should also be trained
to recognize signs of clinical depression and obtain professional sup-
port for those who have high levels of anxiety and depression

symptomology. Moreover, since the relationship between high levels
of climate change distress and climate change actions may become
negatively correlated, it is also important that climate change action
organizations monitor and address high levels of climate change dis-
tress. Finally, as the study was cross-sectional, we do not know if
heightening climate change distress will lead to increased actions.
Consequently, future research should longitudinally examine these
associations.
The empirical literature suggests that social norms interventions
can promote pro-environmental behaviors [18]. These types of inter-
ventions could be expanded to include climate change actions. Poten-
tial strategies include communication campaigns that promote
positive climate change mitigation social norms, mechanisms and
strategies for managing climate change distress, and educating indi-
viduals to be peer educators about climate change and mitigation
strategies. As climate change mitigation requires collective action,
individuals who engage in climate change activism can notify their
friends of these actions to heighten social norms about climate
change activism. Moreover, given the association between climate
change distress and climate change activism behaviors, support from
friends to engage in climate change action can buffer stress while
heightening climate change activism social norms.
In line with other research, Democrats were more likely than
Republicans to report voting for a candidate who supported address-
ing climate change [33]. We also found that Democrats were more
likely than Republicans to donate to organizations working to reduce
climate change. Organizations that address climate change may want
to consider greater outreach to Republicans. Democrats tend to per-
ceive Republicans as less concerned about climate change than they
actually are [34, 35]. This dynamic may impede outreach to Republi-
cans, who may be an essential constituency for groups promoting
climate change activism since Republicans may have more contacts
with Republican legislators and, hence, well-positioned to lobby
them.
Study limitations should be noted. The survey was not completed
by a random or representative sample, which limited the generaliz-
ability of the ﬁndings. However, attrition was low for an online sam-
ple, and wave 7 had substantial diversity in race/ethnicity and
political party afﬁliation. The measure of social norms has not been
validated, and the cross-sectional analyses limit causal inferences.
Although we used a validated climate activism measure, there is no
standard deﬁnition of these behaviors. Hence key behaviors may
have been omitted, and future studies should systematically delin-
eate these activities. This longitudinal study was initiated early in the
COVID-19 pandemic, and we did not assess climate change actions or
climate change distress in the early waves since the pandemic was
overshadowing other important issues. It is also likely that the pan-
demic increased levels of depression and anxiety [36, 37]. In addition,
due to the strong correlation between depression and anxiety symp-
toms, separate measurements of the two conditions were not
included as that can lead to multicollinearity if both are included in
one statistical model [33, 38]. As the sample was comprised only of
adults, the ﬁndings cannot be generalized to children. The sample
size also was not determined a priori due to the longitudinal nature
of the study and unknown effect sizes. We encourage other research-
ers to replicate the ﬁndings in other populations, given the study lim-
itations. As many racial minorities and ethnic groups are at increased
risk from climate change, we also encourage researchers to work
with these populations to study climate change distress, mental
health, and climate activism.
There are many avenues of research that warrant further atten-
tion. Future research should examine those with very low levels of
climate change distress, both those engaged in climate change action
and those who are not. This will allow for a greater understanding of
the role of psychological distress in engaging in climate change
action. Moreover, future research should validate ﬁndings with other
online platforms that have documented high-quality data, such as
Proliﬁc [39]. Organizations that work towards addressing climate
change should monitor and address high levels of depressive symp-
toms and climate change distress. However, they should not patholo-
gize climate change distress. Future research should examine the role
of both depression and climate change distress in burnout from cli-
mate change activism. It is also important to examine how people
felt about their climate change actions or psychosocial factors that
helped them maintain climate change action.
Climate change distress can be viewed as a normal and appropri-
ate reaction to the current climate change emergency. Although there
is a substantial level of concern among the general population in
many countries about global warming, there is far too little action to
ensure that the temperature of the earth’s atmosphere does not rise
to a level that will cause massive destruction and adverse consequen-
ces for all life on the planet. Key questions for the community of cli-
mate change researchers and practitioners are how to support
individuals who report climate change distress and psychological
