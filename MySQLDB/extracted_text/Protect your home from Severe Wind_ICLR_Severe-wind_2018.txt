About the Institute
for Catastrophic Loss Reduction
The Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction (ICLR), established in 1997, 
is a world-class centre for multidisciplinary disaster prevention research 
and communication. ICLR is an independent, not-for-profit research 
institute founded by the insurance industry and affiliated with 	
Western University.
The Institute’s mission is to reduce the loss of life and property caused 
by severe weather and earthquakes through the identification and 
support of sustained actions that improve society’s capacity to adapt to, 
anticipate, mitigate, withstand and recover from natural disasters.
ICLR’s mandate is to confront the alarming increase in disaster 	
losses caused by natural disasters and to work to reduce disaster 
deaths, injuries and property damage. Disaster damage has been 
doubling every five to seven years since the 1960s, an alarming trend. 
The greatest tragedy is that many disaster losses are preventable. 
ICLR is committed to the development and communication of disaster 
prevention knowledge. For the individual homeowner, this translates 
into the identification of natural hazards that threaten them and their 
home. The Institute further informs individual homeowners about steps 
that can be taken to better protect your family and your home.
The purpose of this handbook is to outline actions that homeowners 
can take to protect their homes from tornadoes and severe wind 
damage. Some of these measures are simple and free; others cost 
money. All contribute to reducing the risk of severe wind damage.

Tornado damage
Tornadoes appear in many shapes and sizes, but are typically in the form 
of violent rotating columns of air extending from a thunderstorm with a 
narrow end touching the ground. Most tornadoes have wind speeds of 
less than 170 km/h and a width of 75m across. They typically travel several 
kilometers before dissipating. Extreme tornadoes can easily uproot trees, 
flip cars and demolish houses with wind speeds of more than 480 km/h. 
They can stretch more than three kilometres across and travel more than 
100 km.
Canada experiences more tornadoes than any other country (80 on 
average) with the exception of the United States. Tornadoes are relatively 
common in certain regions in Canada, including: the British Columbia 
interior, southern areas of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and 
Quebec, and western New 
Brunswick. They can occur at 
any time of the year but are 
most prevalent from April to 
September with peak months 
in June and July.
Hospitals and public buildings 
are typically “fully engineered” 
and perform well in high 
winds because of the 
attention given to construction connections (joints, fasteners) and load 
paths (the path that seismic forces pass through to the foundation of the 
structure). Historically, less engineering oversight has been applied to 
residential construction, making it especially vulnerable to severe 		
wind damage.
With population and development increasing in at-risk areas, tornado and 
severe wind activity has serious implications for homeowners across 
Canada. While homeowners cannot predict violent wind activity, they can 
take steps to protect themselves and minimize damage to their homes. 
This handbook is designed to assist homeowners who are at risk of 
tornadoes and severe winds. It identifies several steps homeowners can 
take to protect their homes from severe wind damage and provides a 
scorecard that can help evaluate potential vulnerability.

Some key questions worth asking
What advice do they offer?
Are there engineering studies on your subdivision?
How do you report damage from extreme winds and storms?
What does your local government suggest you do?
Is there any disaster-relief assistance you can apply for?
Do they recommend any contractors with expertise in severe wind protection?
What permits are required to strengthen your home’s defenses?

First steps
Understand your home’s vulnerabilities
While tornadoes and severe winds can easily destroy homes, most often 
the result is damage to the home’s roof, exterior walls and windows. 	
It is important to be aware and educated about your home’s 
vulnerabilities to the threat of severe winds.
      Talk to your local government
Local government’s often offer important advice for homeowners on 
how to protect their home from severe winds. Municipal government 
websites, public works, utilities and the building department are all 
useful sources. Towns and cities located in severe wind regions can offer 
a great deal of expertise on how to protect your home.
      Talk to your insurance agent or broker
It is critical that homeowner’s talk to insurance agents and brokers to 
understand what types of damage are covered under their policy. 
Sometimes specific types of damage can be excluded depending 
on your policy. Insurers can also identify common sources of 
damage in your subdivision that you should watch out for.
      Have a building inspector evaluate your home
Because each home is different, building inspectors can offer 
important insights into your home’s capacity to withstand 
storm-force winds. Inspectors can provide important information 
on the age of your home, and its capacity to resist extreme 
winds. Contacting your municipality is the easiest way to find a 
good home inspector with knowledge on your area.
Home inspectors can 
help assess a home’s 
capacity to withstand 
storm-force winds.

Taking action on your own
These initiatives cannot guarantee the safety and security of any home 
but, if addressed, will help to minimize tornado and severe wind damage.
Storm-proof the roof
Tornado damage is usually most significant for a home’s roof. Strong 
winds generate uplift as they divide and flow around a structure. 		
The wind stream following the longest path (usually over the roof) 
speeds up to rejoin the stream 
following the shorter distance 
(usually around the walls). 
According to Bernoulli’s 
principle, as the wind speeds 
up across the roof the pressure 
drops. This generates uplift. 
The roof, in effect, acts 
somewhat like a wing and 
attempts to “take off” from 
the remainder of the building.
If the roof is old or showing 
signs of damage or decay, 
re-roofing can significantly 
strengthen a home against 
strong winds. The roof cover 
should be removed down to 
the sheathing. Sheathing 
should be checked for any 
damage and replaced as 
needed.
Choose a high-wind rated roof 
cover and make sure ridge 	
and off-ridge vents are also 
rated for high winds. If a 
homeowner is not ready to 
re-roof, check vents to be sure they will stay in place and are of the 
proper type and strength to resist high winds and wind-driven rain. 
Roof sheathing must be securely fastened to prevent 
wind damage.
High winds are a major cause of roof damage.
4
Shutter any vents before a storm strikes or replace them with products 
rated for resistance to wind-driven rain intrusion. If water accumulates in 
the attic, homeowners could soon find themselves facing problems with 
mildew, mold and rot.
Strengthen the fastening of the roof sheathing to the roof structure and 
provide a secondary water 
barrier by having a closed cell 
urethane-based adhesive spray 
foam applied from inside your 
attic. Gable end roofs are more 
susceptible to damage from 
high winds than hip roofs or 
flat roofs because they slope in 
only two directions (and not 
four). The gable end presents a 
large obstacle to the wind and 
receives its full force. If the 
framing of the gable end and 
the rest of the roof is not 
adequately braced to resist the wind, the 
roof can fail. Roof failures, especially in 
unbraced gable roofs, are a common cause 
of major damage to houses and their 
contents in high winds. 
A gable roof can be strengthened by 
installing additional braces in the trusses 
and/or at the gable ends. A qualified builder 
can also install galvanized metal hurricane 
straps. These help to secure the roof to the walls. Large gable end walls 
should be braced and tied into the roof and ceiling structure to keep 
them from being damaged during a violent storm.
Entry doors
If a home’s doors fail under significant pressure, they will allow wind to 
enter the house which can cause even more damage and possibly injure 
Roof uplift and failure is a common source of damage linked 
with high winds and tornadoes.
Some examples of metal hurricane straps.

homeowners and members of their family. Doors should be pressure- 
and impact-rated or shuttered with a pressure- and impact-rated 
product. Keep at least one protected entry door operable from inside 
the home. Most doors do not have bolts or pins strong enough to 
withstand tornadoes and severe winds. Many houses are equipped with 
double entry doors. These doors typically consist of an “active” door 
(which is used when only one door is needed) and an “inactive” door 
(which usually remains closed but can be opened when necessary). 
While these doors are convenient because they span a wider opening 
than a single door, they are usually not as strong as a single door and 
are therefore more susceptible to wind damage. Double-entry doors 
can be reinforced by adding a heavy-duty dead bolt, slide bolts at the 
top and bottom of the inactive door and longer hinge attachment 
screws into the doors and frame.
Windows and sliding glass doors
Although tornadoes and severe winds can exert tremendous pressure 
against homes, a significant portion of property damage is not from the 
wind itself but from airborne 
materials. Items such as tree 
limbs and branches, signs and 
sign posts, roof tiles and 
shingles, metal siding and 
other pieces of buildings 
(including entire roofs in major 
storms) can easily penetrate 
unprotected windows and 
sliding doors. This wind-borne 
debris can cause significant 
damage to interior walls and 
ceilings not designed to 
withstand such forces. As well, 
wind penetration results in the 
uncontrolled build-up of 
internal air pressure which can 
weaken the structure.
Flying debris from severe winds can easily penetrate 
unprotected windows.
6
The easiest and most effective way to protect windows and glass doors 
is to install storm shutters. Building supply stores sell many kinds of 
storm shutters, but homeowners can also make their own shutters out 
of plywood. Use 5/8” marine plywood, cut to fit and ready to install.
Porches and overhangs
Porches and overhangs are obvious targets for storm-force wind 
damage. They protrude from homes and are typically constructed with 
lighter materials (wood vs. bricks). Porches and overhangs are 
frequently the initial points for structural damage in a violent storm. 
Many of the columns that support porch roofs or overhangs provide 
adequate support for the weight of the roof but offer little resistance to 
uplift forces. In a violent storm, these forces can actually be much larger 
than the weight of the roof it is expected to support. Make sure that 
the columns are adequately connected so that they hold the roof down, 
as well as holding it up.
Garage Doors
While garage doors may be the largest and weakest opening of a 
home, they are often forgotten when storm-proofing. If the garage 
door fails during a storm, the 
full fury of the storm may enter 
the home and blow off the 
roof and destroy the home. 
Homeowners should look for a 
sticker indicating pressure 
rating suitable for their 
location. If there is no sticker, 
consider three options:
Install a garage door 	
with one that is pressure-
rated or pressure- and 
impact-rated.
Garage doors can be the weakest opening of a home in a 
severe wind storm.
t
7
Install aftermarket vertical braces that are building code approved 
and available at a local home improvement store.
Check with the garage door manufacturer for a kit to strengthen 
the door and its track so that it has the properties found in new 
wind-rated doors appropriate for your location. Garage doors can 
be strengthened by installing horizontal bracing in each panel. 
Bracing kits can often be purchased from garage door 
manufacturers. Homeowners may also need to add stronger 
supports and heavier hinges for their garage doors.
Ridge and off-ridge vents
Faulty ridge vents can result in significant water intrusion in high winds. 
Driven by storm-force winds, water can enter homes through usually 
rain-tight openings and completely devastate a home’s interior and 
contents. Ridge vents should be rated for water intrusion resistance. 
Given that they are the last item installed, ridge vents can be easily 
replaced. Look for a baffle or trip that keeps water from being pushed 
up into the vent so that the rain is pulled away. The vent should be 
adequately fastened to the roof deck. Consider replacing any off-ridge 
vents that are not rated for high-wind applications and wind-driven rain 
resistance. Consult a reputable roofer in such cases.
Soffits
During a storm, the eaves of a 
home can expose the structure 
to the ravages of wind-driven 
rain on two fronts. The most 
obvious danger comes when 
soffits are blown out during a 
storm. Water intrusion can also 
occur when strong winds drive 
water through vented soffits. 
Homeowners should check the 
condition of their soffit covers

(the plastic or aluminum cover underneath the roof edge in between 
the eave and wall). If the soffit is damaged, it should be replaced. 
Replace corroded material covers. Check the attachment to the wall 
and eaves. Panels 12 inches or longer perpendicular to the wall should 
have a wood support near the middle of the panel. To help anchor the 
soffits of a home, apply a bead of polyurethane sealant between the 
wall and the trim into which the soffit panels are inserted. A homeowner 
can also apply a dollop of caulk in the V-shaped hole where the joint 
between two soffit panels meets the trim.
Outdoor objects
Loose items can become a fire hazard when they accumulate near a 
home. They can also pose a significant danger around a home if picked 
up by high winds during a violent storm. Be sure to trim any trees and 
shrubs around the home. Remove any dead or rotted trees, branches, 
or bushes, as well as other debris from around the yard.
Turn off propane tanks. Make sure all items in the yard (e.g., storage 
sheds, lawn furniture, garbage cans and grills) are secure and heavy 
enough to stay put under normal conditions. Never leave a patio 
umbrella up when not in use as it can easily be picked up by the 		
wind and turned into a missile. Consider replacing gravel or rock 
landscaping materials with shredded bark. Store vehicles in a garage or 
other enclosure.
Moor boats securely. If the boat is ashore on a jack stand, strap the 
boat down where possible. If there is a pool on the property, cover 	
the pump filter.
