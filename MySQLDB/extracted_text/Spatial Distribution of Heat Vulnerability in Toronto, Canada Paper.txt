Abstract
The frequency, intensity and duration of heatwaves are expected to increase in Toronto,
Canada due to both climate change and urban heat island, which will result in enhanced
heat vulnerability among a population of almost three million. Therefore, designing ap-
propriate heat management plans requires information about how heat vulnerability is
distributed across the city. To fill the knowledge gap, two distinct methods are examined
in this study to quantitatively measure the heat vulnerability at the dissemination area
level. Both HVIs consist of three dimensions, exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity,
that are aggregated from remotely sensed land surface temperature and socio-economic
features collected from census data.The first method uses principal component analysis
to derive a heat vulnerability index (HVI), and the second, simpler method assigns equal
weight to each input feature to derive an HVI. Both HVIs display a similar U-shaped
pattern of high heat vulnerability across Toronto, with low heat vulnerability areas pri-
marily located along the Lake Ontario shoreline and red throughout the fluvial ravine
system.
Further cluster analysis reinforces this spatial pattern.
Notably, this study
highlights that low-income tower block communities are significantly more vulnerable to
heat than the city average. The qualitative consistency between the two HVI methods
allows for ease of adoption for future use or regular operational updates. Integration of
HVI updates into municipal operations can allow city planners and managers to mea-
sure, analyze and visualize the heat vulnerability consistently over time and can provide
decision-support for heat emergency preparedness and response in Toronto.
1. Introduction

Anthropogenic climate change is causing global warming and altered the temperature

patterns across Canada and around the world (Vincent et al., 2018; Bush and Lemmen,

wave that resulted in a public health emergency(Henderson et al., 2021; White et al.,

2023). The Coroners Service in the Canadian province of British Columbia has attributed
6
619 deaths to this event, with many of the victims being elderly, living with pre-existing
7
health conditions and experiencing social isolation (Egilson, 2022). Although there have
8
been previous extreme heat events across Canada (e.g., the Montreal heat wave of 2010),
9
the PNW event has underscored under-preparedness of Canadian municipalities and
10
health authorities to mitigate and manage events of this magnitude (Berry and Schnitter,
11
2022; Warren and Lulham, 2021).
12
Canada’s largest urban center, Toronto, is located in the province of Ontario on
13
the north western shore of Lake Ontario. Climate models project that by 2050-2080,
14
summertime average maximum daily temperature in Toronto will to increase to around
15
38◦C, and the number of days exceeding 30◦C will rise from a late twentieth century
16
frequency of about 12 days per summer up to approximately 31-80 per summer depending
17
on the emissions scenario1.
Toronto is home to almost three million people and the
18
Greater Toronto Area to over six million people.
Thus, in addition to the warming
19
caused by anthropogenic climate change, Toronto experiences a significant urban heat
20
island (UHI) effect (Anderson et al., 2018). The UHI effect is caused by a variety of
21
factors associated with urbanization and can act to reinforce and sometimes amplify
22
anthropogenic warming in urban regions (Masson et al., 2020). Cities, like Toronto, are
23
therefore particularly vulnerable to cascading climate change impacts associated with
24
increasingly intense and frequent heat waves (Cheng et al., 2012; Vincent et al., 2018; Li
25
et al., 2018).
26
The combination of climate change and UHI emphasizes the importance for decision-
27
makers to design and implement appropriate climate change mitigation and adaptation
28
strategies based on local heat vulnerabilities. But, vulnerability is not simply the expo-
29
sure to a climate hazard, like heat (Raju et al., 2022). The Intergovernmental Panel on
30
Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report from Working Group II defines vul-
31
nerability as ”the propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected” and consists of
32
two dimensions, sensitivity and adaptive capacity (Ara Begum et al., 2022). Sensitivity
33
measures the susceptibility to potential harm from climate change hazards, and adap-
34
tive capacity describes the ability to adjust to potential climate change hazards, take
35
advantage of opportunities, or respond to consequences (M¨oller et al., 2022; Schmeltz
36
and Marcotullio, 2019; Thomas et al., 2019). Thus, heat vulnerability occurs when vul-
37
nerability is combined with a third dimension, heat exposure.
38
These three dimensions are not uniformly distributed across a city. For instance,
39
heat exposure represented by near-surface air temperature can be significantly differ-
40
ent between cool and warm areas inside a city, and this difference can often be greater
41
than the urban-rural temperature difference (Ziter et al., 2019). Factors such as surface
42
material, surface albedo, canopy coverage and sky view factor can alter the temper-
43
ature distribution across a city (Rinner and Hussain, 2011; Zheng et al., 2020).
For
44
instance, surface albedo modifies the amount of absorbed radiation, which influences the
45
surface temperature (Jandaghian and Akbari, 2021) and canopy coverage acts to cool
46
the surface through evapotranspiration (Loughner et al., 2012). Sky view factor, which
47
is defined as the fraction of visible sky, also influences the surface temperature by reg-
48
ulating shortwave radiation reaching surface and longwave radiation emitted upwards

(Chen et al., 2012). Moreover, sensitivity and adaptive capacity, which are determined
50
by demographic, socio-economic and landcover parameters, also exhibit heterogeneous
51
spatial distributions across a city (Benz and Burney, 2021). Hence, Heat Vulnerability
52
Indices (HVIs), which measure these factors quantitively and reflect how heat vulnera-
53
bility varies across different locations, can assist decision-makers to identify communities
54
and neighborhoods that are more vulnerable during heatwaves and proactively develop
55
appropriate mitigation and adaptation strategies.
56
This study aims to establish an updated HVI for Toronto, which quantifies and vi-
57
sualizes the spatial distribution of heat vulnerability across the city. Several previous
58
studies of heat vulnerability in Toronto are now over ten years old and tended to focus
59
on only one or two dimensions of vulnerability (e.g., exposure or sensitivity and adaptive
60
capacity Kershaw and Millward, 2012; Gower et al., 2011), but here, the aim is to in-
61
clude all three dimensions. In addition, several of these studies also lacked transparency
62
or reproducibility in their methodologies (Gower et al., 2011). Thus, our secondary aim
63
is to establish a reproducible approach to HVI generation using open data that will allow
64
for ease of adoption by city managers. Specifically, we examine the robustness of HVIs
65
in Toronto to the methodology used by comparing two different approaches of varying
66
complexity with the simpler of the two being easily reproducible and updated with new
67
data over time. The spatial unit that we focus on is the dissemination area, a spatial unit
68
of the Canadian census system, which is defined by Statistics Canada as a small area
69
composed of one or more neighbouring dissemination blocks, with a population of 400
70
to 700 persons. Dissemination area is the smallest spatial scale which contains publicly
71
accessible demographic and socio-economic features such as age, income, and education
72
background. These data become publicly unavailable when zooming at finer spatial scales
73
such as dissemination blocks to protect personal privacy. Hence, in order to visualize the
74
distribution of HVI in Toronto as precisely as possible, while making use of open data,
75
this study will operate at the dissemination area level rather than at a greater spatial
76
scale such as census tract and census subdivisions.
77
As described in more detail in Section 2, remotely sensed land surface temperature
78
(LST) data are processed to measure heat exposure, while multiple demographic, socio-
79
economic and land surface features related to heat vulnerability are retrieved from the
80
Toronto census profile, and further categorized to form the sensitivity and adaptive capac-
81
ity dimensions. Here, we update a previous assessment of heat vulnerability for Toronto
82
(Rinner et al., 2010; Gower et al., 2011) using two distinct methodologies to construct
83
the sensitivity, adaptive capacity and the ultimate heat vulnerability indices. The first
84
method, the equal weight method, assigns each input feature with identical weights to
85
formulate each categorical index and the final HVI (Maragno et al., 2020; Tomlinson
86
et al., 2011).
The second method, the principal component analysis (PCA) method,
87
assigns each feature with various weights determined by the eigenvectors (Conlon et al.,
88
2020; Jagarnath et al., 2020; Inostroza et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2021). As a result, two
89
sensitivity and adaptive capacity indices are derived, and two final HVIs are established.
90
In Section 3, the spatial distribution of heat vulnerability across the city of Toronto is
91
visualized, and the differences between two derived HVIs are examined. In addition, the
92
relationship between vulnerability and the various input features is established to assist
93
with future municipal adaptation strategy design. In Section 4, further spatial analy-
94
sis methods, such as clustering, are applied to explore the heat vulnerability patterns
95
further. Finally, Section 4 addresses the limitations of this work and proposes future

2. Data Preparation and Methods
98
2.1. Study Area
99
The City of Toronto, which is the capital of the province Ontario, Canada, is selected
100
as the study site for this research (Fig. 1a). The latest census profile shows Toronto has
101
2,794,356 residents, making it the most populated metropolis in Canada, and the fourth
102
largest city in North America (Statistics Canada 2021).
Toronto has a mid-latitude
103
humid continental climate with distinctive winter and summer seasons (Rohli et al.,
104
2015). For example, the 1991-2020 January daily mean temperature was -3.5◦C, the
105
July daily mean temperature was 22.5◦C and the annual mean precipitation is 822.7 mm
106
(Environment and Climate Change Canada). On the local scale, Toronto is located on
107
the Northwest shore of Lake Ontario, which characterizes the micro-climate of Toronto
108
(Scott and Huff, 1996). The elevation gradually increases while moving away from the
109
lake from 76.5 meters to 209 meters above sea level. In addition, several rivers, such
110
as the Don River, Humber River, and Rouge River run through the city in the North-
111
South direction, flowing into Lake Ontario. These geographic features together shape
112
the physical environment and climate of Toronto.
113
In addition, to the large population of Toronto, several other factors make Toronto an
114
important urban center to assess from a heat vulnerability perspective. Firstly, as with
115
many cities across the globe, studies based on historical surface air temperature records
116
show a significant warming trend in the Toronto region (Mohsin and Gough, 2010).
117
Furthermore, this rising trend continues in GCM future projections under moderate and
118
high carbon emissions scenarios, indicating that more intensive and frequent heatwaves
119
are expected in the future (Li et al., 2018). In addition, since the magnitude of UHI is
120
positively correlated with the extent of urban regions (Takebayashi and Senoo, 2018), the
121
combined impact of climate change and UHI will be notable in large urban regions like
122
4
Toronto relative to other smaller cities (Anderson et al., 2018). Taken together, the high
123
population density of Toronto, its prominent UHI and ongoing climate change-induced
124
warming trends underscore the importance of quantifying and visualizing the distribution
125
of heat vulnerability in the City of Toronto from a public health perspective.
126
In addition to conducting analysis at the dissemination area scale, we examine the
127
heat vulnerability of 924 tower buildings across Toronto. The City’s first resilience strat-
128
egy identified ageing high-rise apartment buildings as being at higher risk from climate
129
impacts (City of Toronto, 2019). These tower buildings are of particular interest from
130
a heat vulnerability perspective due to their relatively high population density, the pro-
131
portion of lower-income and racialized households and the lack of air conditioning. The
132
locations of these towers are shown in Fig. 1b. After deriving the HVIs for Toronto at
133
the dissemination area level, the areas with the presence of towers are compared with
134
the city average to investigate if a significant difference exists. In this way, the relative
135
vulnerability of these tower buildings is established.
136
2.2. Heat Exposure: Remotely Sensed Land Surface Temperature Data
137
2.2.1. Retrieving Remote Sensing Data
138
Here, we use remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) to quantify heat expo-
139
sure. Thermal infrared sensors mounted on satellites enable surface temperature mea-
140
surements at a large geographic scale. The corresponding satellite images have a rela-
141
tively high spatial resolution capturing the variability in micro-climates that exist inside
142
the city. Hence, the use of remote sensing products such as Landsat and MODIS to de-
143
tect spatial patterns of LST within urban regions has been frequently adopted in many
144
studies (Benz and Burney, 2021; Rinner and Hussain, 2011; Tomlinson et al., 2011). In
145
this study, the MODIS product MOD11A1 is acquired from the Level-1 and Atmosphere
146
Archive & Distribution System (LAADS) to measure the distribution of LST in Toronto.
147
The MODIS product MOD11A1 is one type of level 3 pre-processed data (gridded vari-
148
ables in derived spatial and/or temporal resolutions) derived from the “Terra” satellite,
149
which provides daily daytime and nighttime LST and emissivity with 1-km spatial res-
150
olution. Furthermore, since heatwaves primarily happen during summer, daytime LST
151
is collected for June, July, and August (JJA). Unlike previous studies for Toronto that
152
use only a few daily snap shots of LST (Rinner et al., 2010; Rinner and Hussain, 2011;
153
Gower et al., 2011), in this study LST for JJA is retrieved and analyzed for the extended
154
time period to 2010-2019 in order to establish a robust spatial pattern of heat exposure.
155
2.2.2. Data Pre-processing
156
Several extra steps are taken to acquire remote sensing data during the study period.
157
Firstly, the downloaded images are clipped based on the geographic extent of Toronto.
158
Next, by referring to the quality assurance data accompanying the LST data, pixels
159
with an average error greater than 2K are masked as NaN (not a number) to ensure the
160
accuracy of the collected data. In addition, the missing measurements due to cloud cover
161
are also categorized as NaN and are not included in further analysis.
162
After excluding these pixels, the available count of measurements for each pixel lo-
163
cated inside Toronto is checked to ensure that each pixel location has a sufficient number
164
of LST measurements for further processing. During the ten-year study period, 920 im-
165
ages are retrieved in total to represent the daytime LST during JJA each year. After
166
5
excluding pixels as outlined above, the minimum percentage of measurements retained is
167
39.35% (362 measurements per pixel) among all the pixels, while the average percentage
168
of measurements retained is 47.01% (432 measurements per pixel; see Fig. A.1).
169
Another issue that needs to be investigated is whether missing data due to cloud cover
170
could introduce bias to the overall LST measurement. To investigate this, weather station
171
data collected at “Toronto City” (Station ID: 6158355) is acquired from the Government
172
of Canada Historical Climate Data website.
The entire study period is divided into
173
two categories based on the cloud cover status at the pixel where the weather station is
174
located at. The weather station surface air temperature is then categorized according to
175
the cloud cover status. The cloud free days are approximately 0.5◦C warmer than the
176
cloudy days at “Toronto City” station indicating that there is likely a warm bias in our
177
LST data, but that it is relatively small (see Fig. A.2).
178
After these pre-processing steps, the heat exposure can be determined.
In order
179
to represent heat exposure from a cumulative perspective, a degree-day type index is
180
developed which is simply called heat degree-day in what follows. Heat degree-days are
181
defined as the sum of the degrees above 20◦C for each pixel and divided by the count of
182
available measurements for that pixel. In this way, the cumulative heat exposure during
183
the study period can be quantitatively represented. Finally, the average heat degree-
184
day is transformed from the 1-km raster format to each dissemination area based on
185
their relative spatial relationship using zonal statistics tools in ArcGIS. Fig. 2a shows
186
the MODIS average LST for each pixel located in Toronto. Fig. 2b shows the spatial
187
pattern of heat exposure in heat degree-days across Toronto at the dissemination area
188
level; the exposure dimension used to construct the HVIs. Note that the spatial pattern
189
of heat exposure is not sensitive to the choice of temperature threshold (see Fig. B.1).

Table 1: List of socio-economic and landcover data applied in this study with their short abbreviations.
Features are divided into three main categories and further characterized into several sub-categories.
2.3. Sensitivity and Adaptive Capacity: Census and Landcover Data
191
In order to construct the sensitivity and adaptive capacity dimensions of the HVIs,
192
multiple socio-economic, demographic and landcover features need to be taken into con-
193
sideration. Features related to landcover types and population ages (Benmarhnia et al.,
194
2015) are categorized under the sensitivity dimension since heat is correlated with these
195
features by direct physical or physiological means. In contrast, the socio-economic and
196
demographic features which affect heat vulnerability indirectly are categorized under the
197
adaptive capacity dimension. In other words, the adaptive capacity features relate to a
198
household’s ability to access resources, such as air conditioning. The ability to access re-
199
sources can be affected by income, educational background (Benz and Burney, 2021), etc.
200
but also by racism (e.g., visible minority), possible language barriers (e.g., non-Canadian
201
citizens), and the integrity or extent of social networks (e.g., Indigenous populations).
202
Here we use census data and landcover data to establish how sensitive or how capable of
203
adapting to heat households are within a given dissemination area. Census data at the
204
dissemination area level collected in 2016 are acquired from the Computing in the Hu-
205
manities and Social Sciences Census Analyzer (CHASS) and listed in Table 1 to establish
206
the sensitivity and adaptive capacity indices.
207
In addition to the socio-economic and demographic features collected from the census
208
data, several other features, which impact the distribution of sensitivity and adaptive
209
capacity, are included: canopy coverage, impervious surface coverage and the accessibility
210
to medical services and cooling centers. Canopy cover has been shown to have a cooling
211
effect on surroundings through evapotranspiration and by providing shade, while the
212
impervious surfaces result in a warming effect by absorbing and re-emitting infrared
213
heat and altering surface albedo (Ziter et al., 2019). These surface material features
214
can amplify or reduce the degree of heat exposure received by the residents and are not
215
easily adjusted by individual households at spatial or temporal scales that are relevant
216
for immediate or near-term adaptation. We therefore categorize these features under
217
7
the heat sensitivity dimension. The canopy data are retrieved from the Toronto Open
218
Data Portal2, which was produced by a Forest and Land Cover survey in the year 2008.
219
This dataset is further processed in ArcGIS to derive the canopy cover percentage for
220
each dissemination area. Similarly, the impervious surface data is also acquired from
221
the Toronto Open Data Portal in raster format with 0.5m spatial resolution3, which is
222
transformed into impervious surface coverage at the dissemination area level by ArcGIS
223
through zonal statistics.
224
On the other hand, data such as accessibility to medical services and cooling centers
225
are features representing the heat adaptive capacity. The location of cooling centers is
226
retrieved from the Toronto Public Health Heat Relief Network4, while the location of
227
hospitals across Toronto is accessed from DMTI spatial Inc5. The accessibility to these
228
locations for each dissemination area is quantitatively measured by taking the average
229
over a Euclidean distance surface constructed by ArcGIS. (Details regarding the spatial
230
distribution of these features are shown in Appendix B)
231
These selected sensitivity and adaptive capacity features have been shown to cor-
232
relate with heat vulnerability in past studies. For instance, the relationship between
233
different landcover types and measured heat is demonstrated by (Rinner and Hussain,
234
2011), while the implicit mechanisms behind this phenomenon are revealed by (Ziter
235
et al., 2019), which describes the cooling effect of canopy coverage and warming effect
236
of impervious surfaces. Hence, the landcover data are acquired and included as input
237
features. Moreover, several studies focusing on demographics indicate the relationship
238
between these feature and heat vulnerability.
For instance, elders are found to have
239
a higher mortality rate during extreme heat events compared to other population age
240
groups (Benmarhnia et al., 2015; Laaidi et al., 2012).
Similar evidence is found for
241
populations younger than five years old (Basaga˜na et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2014).
242
In addition, socio-economic features including education, income, race and popula-
243
tion density have been shown to be correlated with the LST, underscoring that certain
244
communities are more vulnerable to heat than others (Benz and Burney, 2021). Hence,
245
features such as median income, low-income percentage, visible minority and indigenous
246
populations are acquired from the census analyzer to construct the HVI. Moreover, other
247
supplementary features such as housing status, unemployment rate and accessibility to
248
public cooling centers and medical services are included since these features have been
249
frequently identified in past heat vulnerability studies (Gronlund, 2014; Inostroza et al.,
250
2016; Nayak et al., 2018; Seong and Jiao, 2022; Yu et al., 2021). Finally, since access to
251
household air-conditioning was not previously collected by census data, proxy features
252
such as the percentage of houses built before the 1960s and the percentage of unsuitable
253
housing are used6 (Wolf and McGregor, 2013; Ho et al., 2015, 2018). A previous survey
254
by Toronto Public Health in 2010 indicated that approximately 85% of Toronto residents
255
have air conditioning in their home (Gower et al., 2011). Two-thirds of those have central

257
In summary, key socio-economic, demographic and landcover features which are as-
258
sociated with heat vulnerability are included in the construction of the HVIs. As shown
259
in Table 1, the sensitivity and adaptive capacity indices can be constructed based on the
260
selected features, which will be illustrated in the next section.
261
2.4. Methods to Construct Sensitivity, Adaptive Capacity and Heat Vulnerability Indices
262
After completing the data preparation steps and categorizing different features (Table
263
1), indices for the three dimensions of HVI, exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity
264
indices, can be constructed. It should be noted that the heat degree-day distribution is
265
the only feature of heat exposure used here. Thus, only the procedures for establishing
266
sensitivity and adaptive capacity indices will be discussed in this section. In this study,
267
two methods are used to derive these two indices of HVI. The first method assigns each
268
input feature with equal weight, while the second method uses Principal Component
269
Analysis (PCA) to determine the weighting (Fig. 3).
270
2.4.1. Equal Weight Method
271
In the equal weight method (Maragno et al., 2020), the contribution of all input fea-
272
tures is identical, while the direction of the contribution for each feature is determined
273
manually based on statistical analysis and literature review. For instance, the canopy
274
coverage is set to negatively contribute to the sensitivity index due to its cooling func-
275
tionality, while the elder population percentage and impervious surface coverage are set
276
to contribute to the result positively. After determining the polarity of its relationship
277
with sensitivity, all features are standardized with mean equal to zero and standard de-
278
viation equal to one. In addition, these standardized features are summed together and
279
divided by the number of input features to get the resulting index. Similar operations
280
are taken when computing the adaptive capacity index. Moreover, the complete process
281
of deriving ultimate equal weight HVI can be expressed as Eq. 1:
282
HV I = Rescale[(S/n1 −AC/n2), (0, 1)] ∗E
(1)
Where S stands for the summed sensitivity features, AC stands for the summed adap-
283
tive capacity features, and E stands for exposure index. In addition, n1 represents the
284

nerability index. Steps involving PCA and equal weight methods are shaded with blue and red color,
respectively.
10
number of features used to derive sensitivity, and n2 represents the number of features
285
used to derive adaptive capacity. Hence, S/n1 and AC/n2 stands for the resulting sen-
286
sitivity and adaptive capacity indices, respectively. The results generated by sensitivity
287
minus adaptive capacity are rescaled to the range 0 to 1 through the min-max normal-
288
ization method. The role of the exposure index is to act as a scaling factor, amplifying
289
or diminishing the vulnerability caused by socio-economic factors and the surrounding
290
environment (the sensitivity index minus adaptive capacity index). In this way, the spa-
291
tial distribution of equal weight HVI at the dissemination area level across Toronto can
292
be visualized and compared with the PCA generated HVI.
293
2.4.2. PCA Weighting Method
294
The limitations of the equal weight method are apparent: the weighting of each input
295
feature is not identical in reality. In addition, the collinearity between the chosen socio-
296
economic features may also confound the results. Thus, using PCA to avoid collinearity
297
issues while reducing the dimensionality of input features is a common approach (Conlon
298
et al., 2020; Jagarnath et al., 2020; Inostroza et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2021). Here, we follow
299
the method of Yu et al. (2021), conducting two rounds of PCA analyses in succession
300
to derive the ultimate HVI. During the first PCA round, the sensitivity and adaptive
301
capacity indices are determined independently using the standardized features as inputs
302
(Fig. 3). Next, the principal components with eigenvalues greater than one are retained,
303
and a Scree plot is generated to help visualize the separation of the eigenvalues. The
304
input dataset is transformed based on the selected principal components and the total
305
variance explained for both sensitivity and adaptive capacity are demonstrated in Table
306
3. In addition, the weights for each input feature are also shown in this table. The weights
307
are calculated by multiplying the retained eigenvalues by the square of eigenvectors and
308
dividing by the sum of all eigenvalues, i.e, the total variance. For each column of the
309
transformed dataset, the sum of the variance equals its corresponding eigenvalue, which
310
indicates that the transformed data is weighted appropriately during this procedure.
311
Hence, in the end, the sensitivity and adaptive capacity indices are derived for each
312
dissemination area by summing the transformed dataset.
313
For the second round of PCA analysis, the input includes the standardized sensitivity,
314
adaptive capacity and exposure indices, where the exposure index is represented by heat
315
degree-days. All three principal components are retained and aggregated into the final
316
HVI. Finally, as for the equal weight HVI, the PCA HVI is rescaled to range from 0 to
317
1.
318
2.5. Cluster Analysis
319
To further interpret the spatial pattern of the derived HVIs, a cluster analysis is
320
conducted for indices generated by both methods.
The clustering method, “Anselin
321
Local Moran’s I”, is selected to detect the existence of spatial autocorrelation across
322
Toronto. This method calculated the Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) for
323
each dissemination area and clusters the significant polygons into four types to represent
324
hot spots, cold spots and spatial outliers (Anselin, 1995). This clustering is performed
325
in ArcGIS using the function “Cluster and Outlier Analysis” with the significance level
326
is set to 0.05 to ensure robustness.

3. Results
328
3.1. Spatial Distribution of Heat Exposure
329
As shown in Fig. 2b, the spatial distribution of heat exposure in Toronto has a
330
distinctive pattern.
The areas with lower heat exposure are concentrated along the
331
shoreline, which corresponds to the cooling effect of Lake Ontario. In addition, the Don
332
River, Humber River and Rouge River valleys typically have lower exposure than their
333
surrounding areas due to evaporative cooling, high canopy coverage and fewer human
334
activities in these areas (Fig. C.1). On the contrary, areas including Toronto Centre,
335
York Centre and Scarborough Centre on average, have the highest degree of exposure
336
across the study area due to the high percentage of impervious surfaces, fewer green
337
spaces and intensive human activities (Fig. C.1). To summarize, the spatial pattern
338
of heat exposure is consistent with the physical mechanisms behind the generation and
339
distribution of heat and is also consistent with previous assessments of heat in Toronto
340
(Kershaw and Millward, 2012; Rinner and Hussain, 2011).
341
3.2. Spatial Distribution of the Sensitivity Index
342
Two sensitivity indices are computed based on the equal weight and PCA methods
343
separately and their spatial patterns are shown in Fig. 4. Both sensitivity indices are
344
rescaled into the range between 0 to 1 and grouped into quintiles (”very low”, ”low”,
345
”moderate”, ”high” and ”very high”). When deriving the sensitivity index with equal
346
12
weights assigned to each input feature, canopy cover percentage is assigned a negative
347
polarity in the sum. The reason for this step is that the canopy cover has been shown to
348
have a cooling effect and is expected to negatively correlate with heat sensitivity (Ziter
349
et al., 2019). In terms of the sensitivity index derived from the PCA method, the first
350
two principal components, which explain 76.83% of the total variance, are retained, and
351
the breakdown of the weights for each input feature are shown in Table 3. Although
352
the four input features are assigned with distinct weights in the two different methods,
353
the distributions of the sensitivity indices are similar across the study area. A U-shaped
354
pattern, which starts from the Northwest and Northeast corner converging at the Toronto
355
Harbor area, with areas categorized as high and very high sensitivity, is evident in both
356
maps. On the other hand, the Don River valley, Etobicoke Centre, High Park and the
357
Scarborough-Rouge area are classified as low and very low sensitivity areas. This U-
358
shaped pattern is similar to the spatial patterns of the distribution of canopy cover and
359
impervious surfaces (Fig. C.1) and is consistent with previous work for Toronto showing
360
a U-shaped pattern in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a proxy for
361
vegetation cover (Anderson et al., 2022).
362
The correlations between each input feature and the two sensitivity indices are pre-
363
sented in Table 4 to assist the interpretation of the patterns of the sensitivity indices.
364
For the equal weight derived sensitivity index, only the canopy cover, which has been
365
manually reversed before the calculation, is negatively correlated with the result. How-
366
ever, in the PCA-derived sensitivity index, both percentages of population greater than
367
65 years old and canopy coverage are negatively correlated with the result, which par-
368
tially explains the difference in spatial patterns between the two sensitivity indices. This
369
difference arises because the percentage of the population greater than 65 years old is
370
positively correlated with the canopy cover percentage, which results in both components
371
being negatively correlated with the sensitivity index. This suggests that the assump-
372
tions made about the polarity of the features for the equal weight method may not always
373
be supported by the data and highlights the benefits of using a PCA HVI method to
374
complement other simpler HVI methods, such as the equal weight method, when possible
375
(Conlon et al., 2020). Further work is required to assess the extent to which the positive
376
correlation between those greater than 65 years of age and canopy cover reflects an un-
377
derlying correlation between income and canopy cover as seen in other North American
378
cities (Schwarz et al., 2015; Locke et al., 2021).
379
3.3. Spatial Distribution of the Adaptive Capacity Index
380
Similar to the sensitivity indices, the adaptive capacity indices are established using
381
both methods, the equal weight and PCA methods, and are shown in Fig. 5. In terms of
382
the equal weight method, since higher adaptive capacity is associated with more resilience
383
during extreme heat events, the polarity of the input feature median income is reversed,
384
while the polarity of the other features remains the same. For the PCA method, among
385
all fourteen principal components, only the first four components with eigenvalues greater
386
than one are retained, explaining 63.37% of the total variance. The details of how the
387
total explained variance breaks down into each input feature are presented in Table 3.
388
The spatial pattern shown in Fig. 5 broadly resembles the ”Material Resources Di-
389
mension” pattern of the Ontario Marginalization Index7 (Matheson et al., 2012; van Ingen
390

and Matheson, 2022). The Ontario Marginalization Index is an area-based tool based
391
on census data that has been used to examine health inequalities across the province of
392
Ontario. It consists of four dimensions with the ”Material Resources Dimension” being
393
closely related to poverty.
394
Comparing the spatial pattern of adaptive capacity indices between the two methods,
395
similarities and differences are evident. For instance, most of the dissemination areas
396
located in areas such as Don River valley and Etobicoke center are categorized into the
397
highest quintile. Dissemination areas with low and very low adaptive capacity scores are
398
concentrated around areas including Davenport, Toronto Centre, York South-Weston and
399
Scarborough Centre in both maps. The primary differences between these two adaptive
400
capacity indices are located along the northern boundary of Toronto.
The adaptive
401
capacity index derived from the PCA method assigns high and very high values to these
402
dissemination areas, while the equal weight adaptive capacity index assigns very low and
403
low categories to these districts.
404
To further interpret the differences and similarities between these two methods, the
405
correlation between the adaptive capacity index and each input feature is indicated in Ta-
406
ble 4. For the equal weight-derived adaptive capacity index, median income is positively
407
correlated with the adaptive capacity, while the percentage of houses built before the
408
1960s also demonstrates a positive correlation. The latter suggests that although the age
409
of a residence may reflect the presence of indoor air conditioning (Wolf and McGregor,
410
2013; Ho et al., 2015, 2018), it does not appear to be a good indicator of overall adaptive
411
capacity. For the PCA-derived adaptive capacity index, due to different weights being
412
assigned for each feature, unlike the equal weight method, and the fact that only the
413
first four components are retained, the correlations between features and indices are dis-
414
tinctive. For instance, the accessibility to medical services and cooling centers, which are
415
represented by distance to these facilities, become positively correlated with the index.
416
This may be related to a negative correlation between these distances and population

context of optimizing the cooling centre network.

3.4. Distribution of Heat Vulnerability Index
420
After finalizing the sensitivity and adaptive capacity indices using both methods, two
421
heat vulnerability indices are generated based on the results shown in the previous sec-
422
tion. Here, the equal weight HVI uses the equal-weight sensitivity and adaptive capacity
423
indices following Eq. 1 to generate the result shown in Fig. 6. The PCA-derived HVI is
424
established using a final round of PCA with the standardized exposure, sensitivity and
425
adaptive capacity indices as input features. All three principal components are retained,
426
explaining 100% of the variance. Adaptive capacity loaded most highly for PC1, which
427
explains 44.1% of the variance, exposure loaded most highly for PC2, which explains
428
33.6% of the variance and sensitivity loaded most highly for PC3, which explains 22.3%.
429
In both maps in Fig. 6, a similar U-shaped pattern consisting of high and very high

15

(b) the equal weight method. The adaptive capacity index for all dissemination areas is divided into
quintiles.
heat vulnerability areas is observed. This pattern of heat vulnerability has been pre-
431
viously identified for Toronto (Rinner et al., 2010). On the left side of each map, this
432
pattern covers districts starting from Humber River-Black Creek and moving southeast
433
until reaching University-Rosedale and Toronto Centre. On the right side of each map,
434
this pattern covers districts starting from Scarborough North and moving toward the
435
southeast, with the two sides of the “U” converging in downtown Toronto. Surround-
436
ing the high vulnerability U-shaped pattern in both maps are very low and low heat
437
vulnerability dissemination areas including Etobicoke Centre, Parkdale-High Park, Don
438
River Valley and Scarborough-Rouge Park. In addition, the dissemination areas along
439
the shoreline, including Toronto harbour and Toronto Island, are typically classified as
440
very low vulnerability areas by both HVIs. Noticeable differences between the two HVIs
441
occur over the Scarborough-Agincourt and Scarborough North districts, which are cate-
442
gorized as moderate to low heat vulnerability by PCA-derived HVI but characterized as
443
high vulnerability areas by the equal weight method.
444
To further explore the differences between the two methods, the correlation between
445
the HVIs and their input features, the exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity indices
446
are shown in Table 5. The correlation between each HVI and its three input features
447
indicates a similar relationship; adaptive capacity is negatively correlated with HVI,
448
while exposure and sensitivity are positively correlated.
However, due to distinctive
449
weighting methods, the exact correlation coefficient and the spatial distribution of HVI
450
are not entirely identical. By observing the spatial relationship between HVI and input
451
indices (Figs. 4, 5), it is notable that the low heat vulnerability around the Don River
452
valley and High Park areas are primarily associated with high adaptive capacity and
453
low sensitivity. On the contrary, the low heat vulnerability areas along the shoreline are
454
mainly associated with lower exposure - the sensitivity and adaptive capacity indices for
455
these dissemination areas are approximately the city average. To summarize, both HVIs
456
demonstrate a U-shaped pattern across the study area which will be further discussed and
457
analyzed in the next section through cluster analysis and highest quintile comparison.

4. Discussion
459
4.1. Comparison of PCA and Equal Weight Methods
460
We have presented two HVIs using two different methods of varying complexity. These
461
two methods produce very similar qualitative patterns, demonstrating that the equal
462
weight method provides an accessible and reproducible approach that could potentially
463
be adopted, updated and/or operationalized by city managers in Toronto. Given that
464
there are so many different approaches to generating urban HVIs (Conlon et al., 2020;
465
Jagarnath et al., 2020; Inostroza et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2021; Maragno et al., 2020;
466
Tomlinson et al., 2011; Rinner et al., 2010; Gower et al., 2011), this is an important
467
finding. Nevertheless, there are differences between the two methods that we highlight
468
below.
469
First, we employ a cluster analysis technique to investigate the spatial relationships
470
between dissemination areas. As shown in Fig. 7, the areas of continuously high heat
471
vulnerability are represented as High-High clusters and the areas of continuously low
472
heat vulnerability are represented as Low-Low clusters on the maps. These two types of
473
clusters identify the locations of hot spot and cold spot throughout the map. In addition,
474
the High-Low and Low-High clusters, which indicate the anomalies around the hot and
475
cold spots, are also labelled. The High-Low cluster appears when an area with relatively
476
high scores is surrounded by low value regions. On the contrary, the Low-High cluster
477
appears when an area with relatively low scores is surrounded by high value regions.
478
These two types of clusters identify the locations of outliers which break the spatial
479
homogeneity among dissemination areas.
480
The cluster analysis of heat vulnerability further reinforces the observation made
481
in previous sections regarding the areas with higher vulnerability and areas with lower
482
vulnerability.
For instance, areas such as Don Valley North, Don Valley East, Don
483
Valley West, Etobicoke Centre, Parkdale-High Park and most areas along the shoreline
484
are primarily occupied by the Low-Low clusters in both derived HVIs, which indicate
485
the residents there are more capable during potential extreme heat events.
On the
486
contrary, areas starting from Humber River-Black Creek and moving south-eastward until
487
17
Toronto Centre is primarily occupied by the High-High clusters, which demonstrates the
488
vulnerability to heat is more intense in these areas than the city average.
489
As noted above, the HVIs are qualitatively very similar; however, their differences
490
are highlighted by the cluster analysis. Among all 3702 dissemination areas inside the
491
City of Toronto, 75.20% of dissemination areas are determined as significant clusters in
492
equal weight HVI. However, only 52.35% of total dissemination areas are significant in
493
PCA-derived HVI, due to the smaller extent of both the High-High clusters and Low-Low
494
clusters. For instance, the Low-Low cluster along the shoreline of Lake Ontario moves
495
further inland in the equal weight HVI compared with the PCA-derived HVI. Similarly,
496
the extent of another considerable Low-Low cluster that covers Don River Valley also de-
497
creases in the PCA-derived HVI. For the High-High cluster, the Scarborough-Agincourt
498
and Scarborough North areas are only characterized as part of the High-High cluster in
499
equal weight HVI scenario. Hence, although the two HVIs have a similar degree of disper-
500
sion, represented by their standard deviations (0.132 for equal weight-derived HVI and
501
0.115 for PCA-derived HVI), the HVI derived from equal weight method demonstrates
502
a higher degree of clustering.
503
Figure 7: (a) The spatial distribution of HVI clusters derived from the PCA method, and (b) the equal
weight method. All dissemination areas are divided into five categories based on five quintiles. Only
clusters that are statistically significant at the 95% level are shown.
In addition to using clustering to visualize the differences between two derived HVIs,
504
extracting one quintile from each dataset and comparing their spatial differences is also
505
informative. For this comparison, the highest quintile is selected because dissemination
506
areas with the ”very high” heat vulnerability are of particular concern. As shown in
507
Fig. 8, the dissemination areas classified as “very high” vulnerability are highlighted.
508
Among the 740 dissemination areas which are classified as ”very high” vulnerability for
509
at least one of the HVIs, 55.33% of these areas are classified as ”very high” by both
510
indices. For the remaining 44.67%, the two HVIs differ in their classification. Most of
511
the dissemination areas that disagree in their classification are located in Humber River-
512
Black Creek, Scarborough-Agincourt and Scarborough North and are only characterized
513
as ”very high” vulnerability in the equal weight-derived HVI. Conversely, some of the
514
dissemination areas located in Toronto Centre and Beaches-East York appear as ”very
515
high” vulnerability only in PCA-derived HVI.
516
18
Overall the cluster analysis and highest quintile comparison validates the broad sim-
517
ilarities between the two HVIs (Fig. 6) and, thus, provides an approach to identify the
518
areas that need immediate heat mitigation and adaptation actions. However, this anal-
519
ysis also highlights that the methodology used to compute and HVI can introduce some
520
uncertainty into the identification of high priority areas and these types of indices based
521
on proxy data require validation.
522
Figure 8: This figure illustrates the difference in the highest quintile between the two HVIs. All extracted
dissemination areas (DA) are categorized and shaded according to these three groups: (yellow) DA is in
the top quintile for both HVIs, (blue) DA is in top quintile only for the equal weight-derived HVI, (red)
DA is in top quintile only for PCA-derived HVI.
4.2. Heat Vulnerability of Tower Communities
523
Finally, we apply the HVIs to assess the relative heat vulnerability of tower com-
524
munities. For each feature and index, the percentage difference between the average of
525
dissemination areas containing tower buildings and the average of all dissemination ar-
526
eas is computed. Results greater than zero indicate the tower communities have higher
527
values than the city average, while results less than zero indicate the opposite.
528
As shown in Fig. 9a, in terms of socio-economic and physical features, the relative
529
differences are not statistically significant for percentage of population less than 5 years
530
old, percentage of Indigenous population and the canopy cover percentage. However, the
531
relative differences for all other features are significant, with tower communities having a
532
greater percentage of unsuitable housing and low income households and higher popula-
533
tion density than the Toronto average. Features such as median income are significantly
534
lower for tower communities compared to the city average. The relative differences for
535
19
each feature contribute to the differences between tower communities and the city av-
536
erage for the sensitivity, adaptive capacity and heat vulnerability indices as shown in
537
Fig. 9a. Heat exposure is significantly greater for tower communities, while the tower
538
communities have significantly lower adaptive capacity (for both methods) than the city
539
average. These two factors ultimately lead to the tower communities having significantly
540
greater heat vulnerability than the Toronto average for both methods.
541
This disparity between adaptive capacity and heat vulnerability exists beyond the
542
percentage, impacting tower residents’ daily lives as there is growing uncertainty of the
543
capacity for city wide policies, such as the Heat Relief Strategy, to adequately address
544
Toronto’s most vulnerable communities (Roy, 2022).
545
The relationship between heat vulnerability and tower buildings is understood through
546
a spatial equity lens, taking into consideration the unique and eclectic landscapes that
547
make up tower communities.
Built as post-modern suburban landscapes, these com-
548
munities are now home to approximately 1.8 million people living across the Greater
549
Toronto Area (McClellan et al., 2011). A majority of people living in these high-rise
550
buildings identify visible minorities, as attested in 2011 and 2016 census data. Tower
551
residents face increased issues related to segregation and discrimination, socio-economic
552
stigmatization, and social and fiscal disinvestment (March and Lehrer, 2019). As told by
553
local tower residents during 2020 participatory knowledge exchanges, vertical commu-
554
nities have limited mobility due to constrained access to transportation networks, face
555
increased barriers in accessing open, green and cool spaces and are typically comprised
556
of lower income households. The combination of heat vulnerability and marginalized
557
populations creates amplified risk for communities living in tower buildings.

4.3. Limitations and Future Improvements
559
This study applies two methods to establish heat vulnerability indices based on land
560
surface temperature measurements and socio-economic features identified in the litera-
561
ture as contributing to heat vulnerability (Benz and Burney, 2021; Rinner and Hussain,
562
2011; Yu et al., 2021; Ziter et al., 2019). However, there are important limitations to
563
this work. In this section, several limitations are identified and discussed and potential
564
improvements for future studies are suggested.
565
4.3.1. Limitations Regarding Remote Sensing Images
566
In this study, MODIS remote sensing products are used to quantitatively measure
567
the distribution of land surface temperature across Toronto on a daily basis. Although
568
remote sensing technology provides a reliable means of monitoring the LST during clear-
569
sky conditions at the relevant spatial and temporal resolution, LST products can contain
570
large uncertainties (Li et al., 2023; Ghent et al., 2019) and there are specific limitations
571
when employing remotely sensed LST in heat vulnerability studies. These limitations,
572
summarized by Kershaw and Millward (2012), include:
573
1. The land surface temperatures captured by remote sensing images may not be
574
linearly correlated with surface air temperatures, which is a more precise parameter
575
representing heat exposure to humans.
576
2. The land surface temperatures measured by satellites usually do not reflect the
577
daily maximum or minimum temperatures. Hence, challenges exist in converting
578
the recorded surface temperature into interpretable climate indicators.
579
3. The complex geometry of urban structures introduces uncertainties to satellite
580
measurements.
For example, the surface temperature on the rooftop might be
581
identified as the land surface temperature in a heavily built-up area.
582
4. Insufficient information about surface emissivity introduces uncertainties when con-
583
verting retrieved radiances into LST and the complexity of urban surface coverage
584
amplifies this impact.
585
In addition, there are many other sources of uncertainty in LST measurements, in-
586
cluding those related to atmospheric attenuation due to the imperfect knowledge of
587
atmospheric water vapor and aerosols, the aggregation of heterogeneous land cover types
588
within a pixel, the misclassification of clear-sky pixels and instrumentation and radiative
589
transfer code (Ghent et al., 2019). Moreover, an additional limitation is the lack of LST
590
data under cloudy-sky conditions, which can prevent coherent spatio-temporal analysis
591
(Li et al., 2023). To avoid these issues, constructing statistical surfaces based on weather
592
station SAT records has been proposed as an alternative method. Weather stations pro-
593
vide surface air temperature records on an hourly basis with the corresponding humidity
594
data. The combination of SAT and humidity, which form the wet bulb temperature, is
595
a more appropriate index to measure the health impacts of heat exposure to individu-
596
als (Coffel et al., 2018). However, this approach requires a dense network of weather
597
stations to ensure accuracy, which is not the case for the Toronto region, where the
598
count of publicly available weather stations shrunk when manual stations were replaced
599
with automated stations around 2003 (Milewska and Vincent, 2016). To overcome this
600
limitation, the concept of crowd-sourcing has been applied, in which the temperatures
601
are collected from private weather stations owned by individuals (Fenner et al., 2017)
602
21
or sensors mounted on smartphones (Overeem et al., 2013). However, the accuracy and
603
continuity of the crowd-sourced data requires substantial quality control before further
604
analysis.
605
Finally, reanalysis data products or the output from global climate models (GCMs)
606
or Earth system models (ESMs) is another data source for heat vulnerability research.
607
The outputs from reanalysis, GCMs/ESMs and regional climate models (RCMs) can be
608
applied to construct various climate indicators and quantify the frequency and intensity
609
of heatwaves (Casati et al., 2013). However, the most pronounced disadvantage of using
610
GCM/ESMs/RCMs is that the spatial resolution of these models limits the capability of
611
detecting micro-climate patterns at the city scale. On the other hand, climate models
612
such as SOLWEIG (Solar and Longwave Environmental Irradiance Geometry) model (Li,
613
2021), Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) (Mortezazadeh et al., 2021),
614
and InVEST urban cooling model (Bosch et al., 2021) which are specifically designed
615
for city-level temperature distribution analysis can avoid this disadvantage. This type
616
of model considers the distribution of canopy cover, impervious surfaces and sky-view
617
factor to predict the temperature distribution based on developed algorithms at the city
618
scale (Masson et al., 2020). Thus, these high spatial resolution climate models provide
619
an alternative approach to visualizing temperature distribution and constructing heat
620
exposure indices at the city scale. However, these models typically have inherent biases
621
and require accurate input data and considerable computational resources, which impede
622
their application in heat vulnerability related research. In general, remote sensing images
623
and weather station records are the primary data sources used to assess the heat exposure
624
distribution at the city scale, with each source having its advantages and disadvantages.
625
How to integrate and improve on these data sources and avoid the limitations is an area
626
of active research.
627
4.3.2. Limitations Regarding Census Profile
628
Besides the limitations related to heat exposure, the lack of health-related demo-
629
graphic data is another limitation of this study. When establishing the sensitivity and
630
adaptive capacity indices, multiple factors are extracted from the census profile, including
631
age, education, and income. However, since health data are not included in the census
632
profile made by Statistics Canada, they are not considered in this study. Pre-existing
633
health conditions such as cardiovascular, respiratory and renal diseases have been shown
634
to have a significant impact on an individual’s heat sensitivity during heatwaves (Car-
635
doza et al., 2020). Moreover, pre-existing mental health problems affect an individual’s
636
heat sensitivity and it has been suggested that high temperatures are associated with
637
higher suicide risk (Thompson et al., 2018). Thus, pre-existing health conditions are an
638
important element of heat vulnerability and should be taken into account, if possible,
639
when creating a universal heat vulnerability index. In addition, other socio-economic
640
features, such as the availability of a municipal or neighbourhood heat response plan (Yu
641
et al., 2021) and households access to air conditioning (Cardoza et al., 2020) should also
642
be included in an HVI, if possible.
643
4.3.3. Limitations Regarding Study Area
644
Another limitation of this study is related to the extent of the study area, which only
645
covers the city of Toronto but not the entire Greater Toronto Area (GTA). As shown
646
in Fig. 1, Toronto and surrounding municipalities, such as Markham, Richmond Hill
647
22
and Mississauga, form the GTA, which is the largest metropolitan area in Canada. The
648
density of economic and industrial activities in the GTA result in frequent movement of
649
people across the region. In terms of the physical environment, the urban nature of the
650
GTA leads to pronounced UHI across the region(Takebayashi and Senoo, 2018). Hence,
651
when studying the UHI and heat vulnerability, it may be more appropriate to treat the
652
entire GTA as one study area rather than focusing on each region separately. However,
653
most of the data that was retrieved from the Toronto Open Data Portal, such as the
654
canopy and impervious coverage, only covers the city of Toronto, while available data
655
for other municipalities are collected and stored separately. In addition, not all features
656
selected in Table 1 are available for all municipalities within the GTA. Hence, this study
657
was restricted to the city of Toronto, while future heat vulnerability studies focusing on
658
the same geographic area should also consider including neighbouring municipalities.
659
5. Conclusion
660
This study has assessed the spatial distribution of heat vulnerability in Toronto,
661
Canada by constructing two heat vulnerability indices (HVIs) at the dissemination area
662
scale. The HVIs are generated by considering three dimensions of vulnerability: exposure,
663
sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Heat exposure across Toronto is represented by the
664
MODIS LST remote sensing product. In addition, multiple socio-economic and land-
665
cover datasets are retrieved and categorized to form the sensitivity and adaptive capacity
666
indices. Two distinct methods are used to compute the HVIs, the first method uses
667
principal component analysis, while the second uses an equal weight method that sums
668
features using identical weights. The spatial pattern of heat vulnerability in Toronto is
669
grouped into quintiles (”very low”, ”low”, ”moderate”, ”high” and ”very high”). The
670
two methods give qualitatively similar results, suggesting that sophisticated statistical
671
approaches are not necessary to capture the broad patterns of heat vulnerability in
672
Toronto. This is an important finding because methodological complexity and/or lack of
673
transparency or reproducibility can limit the practical utility of heat vulnerability tools
674
for city managers. The equal weight method is simple to compute and conceptualize
675
making it accessible to many users.
However, it is important to note that there are
676
differences between the two HVIs that we constructed and these differences may have
677
policy and resource implications.
678
By constructing the HVIs across Toronto at the dissemination area level, areas with
679
the greatest heat vulnerability are identified. Further studies should continue to inves-
680
tigate the specific reasons for the broad spatial patterns, and integrate this information
681
with existing adaptation strategies such as the city of Toronto heat relief strategy pub-
682
lished in 20228. As an example, the presented HVIs can help to inform the optimal
683
locations for adding cooling centers which can help to reduce overall heat vulnerability
684
and improve the efficiency and equity of the heat relief network. In addition, the distribu-
685
tion of the HVIs can also be integrated with the Toronto’s Strategic Forest Management
686
Plan9, which aims to increase canopy coverage. Adaptation and mitigation measures

23
such as conserving and expanding green spaces, replacing impervious surfaces with green
688
spaces, walls and roofs can be prioritized in high vulnerability areas to increase resilience
689
to heatwaves and reduce heat-related emergency room visits(Geneletti and Zardo, 2016;
690
Graham et al., 2016).
691
As the climate continues to warm and the socio-demographics of the city shift and
692
evolve, the methods used in this study can be reused with updated data to monitor how
693
heat vulnerability changes with time and the effectiveness of implemented heat mitigation
694
and adaptation strategies (Ho et al., 2018). Growing urban centers such as Toronto must
695
navigate climate mitigation and adaptation solutions in tandem with addressing social
696
vulnerability and equity concerns (Matin et al., 2018). The nexus of housing upgrades
697
and provision with climate mitigation and adaptation will require proactive polices to
698
circumvent climate induced “green gentrification” (Anguelovski et al., 2016; Freixas,
699
2016); where the burden of costs to upgrade and retrofit private buildings as well as
700
the public realm to address urban heat does not trickle down to the most vulnerable
701
populations, unintentionally resulting in climate gentrification. ‘Equitable resilience’ as
702
a goal is more likely to be achieved when transformation takes into account differential
703
access to power, knowledge, and resources; it is thus “able to support the development of
704
social-ecological systems that are contextually rooted, responsive to changes and socially
705
just, and thus relevant to sustainability challenges.” (Matin et al., 2018, see also the
706
fourth theme of the Norman B. Leventhal Center for Advanced Urbanism 10).
707
In summary, the HVIs generated in this study can provide essential information for
708
urban designers, city managers, and local decision-makers to inform their heat man-
709
agement plans. Feedback from these stake-holders is essential to effectively understand,
710
visualize and address urban heat vulnerability and communicate heat-related risks to the
711
public.

Appendix A. Remote Sensing Measurements
717
Appendix A.1. Available Measurements Across Toronto
718
Throughout the entire study period, it is critical to ensure that for each pixel located
719
inside the study area, there is a sufficient count of available LST measurements to ensure
720
the robustness of heat exposure. In order to check the number of available measurements
721
for each pixel, the spatial distribution is visualized in ArcGIS and presented in Fig. A.1.
722
The results indicate that these pixels contain at least 362 LST measurements, while the
723
average sample size of these pixels is 450. Regions along the shoreline of Lake Ontario
724
tend to have a higher number of available measurements than the Northwest part of the
725
study area, suggesting more frequent summertime cloud cover in the Northwest of the
726
city.
Figure A.1: This map demonstrates the distribution of available measurements for each dissemination
area located inside Toronto. During ten years study period, there are 920 images retrieved in total.
727
Appendix A.2. Comparison between Remote Sensing Measurements and Weather Sta-
728
tion Data
729
As mentioned in the MODIS data pre-processing section, the weather station records
730
in downtown Toronto (Station ID: 6158355) are retrieved to validate the effect of cloud
731
cover on LST collected by satellites. The acquired records contain measurements from
732
2010 to 2019 for every summer (JJA) on a daily basis. These measurements are divided
733
into two categories based on whether there are available LST measurements made by
734
MODIS for each day at the pixel where the selected weather station is located, i.e.,
735
whether it is a clear-sky or cloudy day. The average temperature for days with MODIS
736
25
data collected during the selected period (clear-sky) is 21.906 ◦C while the average tem-
737
perature for days without valid LST measurements (cloudy) is 21.470 ◦C. Bootstrap
738
resampling is applied and repeated 500 times, while each sample contains 100 records
739
randomly drawn from each category. The average of each sample in both groups is syn-
740
thesized and presented in bar plot, as shown in Fig. A.2. A t-test is also performed, and
741
the result indicates that the two categories are significantly different from each other.
742
This phenomenon indicates that the presence of cloud cover, which is the primary reason
743
for non-available measurements, may introduce a warm bias in the LST measurements.
744
However, since the absolute difference between two average temperatures is relatively
745
small.
746
Figure A.2: Histograms of daily surface air temperature for clear-sky (blue) and cloudy days (red) for
the Toronto City weather station data. The clear-sky (cloudy) days correspond to days when MODIS
data is available (not available) in the pixel co-located with the Toronto City weather station. The mean
and 95th percentile of each category is demonstrated as well.
Appendix B. Threshold for Heat Degree-Days
747
As mentioned in the main context, the exposure component is represented by the
748
heat degree days with a threshold equal to 20◦C to demonstrate the heat exposure
749
from a cumulative perspective. In this section, the reason for selecting this threshold
750
during the heat degree day calculation will be further explained.
While establishing
751
the heat degree day index, several thresholds are tested and their spatial distribution
752
is visualized respectively, as shown in Fig. B.1. The spatial pattern of the heat degree-
753
day distribution does not vary much for different threshold values. Dissemination areas
754
located along the shoreline and Don River valley typically have the lowest heat exposure
755
in all scenarios, while the highest quintile is mostly located in downtown Toronto. Thus,
756
selecting a different threshold will not induce substantial changes to the ultimate pattern
757
of heat vulnerability index. The absolute value of land surface temperatures is taken into
758
consideration when deciding the threshold. When choosing a higher threshold, the pixels
759
26
around the shoreline will have a similar average heat degree-day result approximating
760
zero since the chance of measurements passing that threshold is rare. Thus, to avoid
761
the spatial homogeneity caused by this circumstance, 20◦C is eventually chosen as the
762
threshold for heat degree day calculation in this study.
763
Figure B.1: Spatial distribution of average heat degree-days across Toronto at dissemination area level
with threshold at (a) 18◦C, (b) 20◦C, (c) 25◦C, (d) 30◦C, respectively.
Appendix C. Spatial Distribution of Some Input Features
764
In this appendix, the spatial patterns of multiple input features, which are acquired
765
to compute the sensitivity and adaptive capacity indices, are visualized using ArcGIS.
766
As shown in Fig. C.1, the sequence is: canopy cover percentage, impervious surface per-
767
centage, access to medical services and distance to cooling centers. For canopy coverage
768
and impervious surface coverage, which are derived from landcover survey data in raster
769
format, the total area in each dissemination area is derived using zonal statistics tools
770
provided by ArcGIS. The results are further divided by the area of each dissemination
771
area to get the result in percentage format. For access to medical services and cooling
772
centers, statistical surfaces are generated by calculating the Euclidean distance for each
773
1m pixel to its closest medical sites or cooling centers. These statistical surfaces are fur-
774
ther aggregated into the dissemination areas based on zonal statistics, which calculates
775
the average distance to each facility.

impervious surface percentage of Toronto at the dissemination area level. (c) The accessibility to medical
services is represented by the average distance to the closest medical sites for each dissemination area.

centers for each dissemination area.
