Abstract 
Coral reefs, the most sensitive ecosystem to high temperature, are on the precipice of mass extinction from global warming [1, 2]. 2023 was 
the hottest year in recorded history on land and in the sea, with dramatic and unexpected temperature increases [3, 4]. Coral Reef Bleaching 
HotSpot maps provide unique insight into global ocean circulation changes in response to greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing that caused dra­
matic global temperature rises [1, 2]. The highest excess daily air temperatures recorded in 175 countries, as well as the most prolonged ex­
cessive sea surface temperatures, were centered around Jamaica. 2023 marked the worst coral reef bleaching yet in the Northern 
Hemisphere, with the Southern Hemisphere poised to follow in early 2024. The HotSpot maps strongly suggest accelerated ocean poleward 
heat transport, slowdown in upwelling, and decreased deep water formation linked to sharply increased 2023 anomalous sea surface and 
air temperatures. The 2023 distribution of severe heat and bleaching follows both spatial patterns and temporal trends first shown from a 
baseline 1982–2001 global SST trend analysis [5]. Increased warming of both hot and cold ocean currents shows that horizontal mixing of 
tropical heat to the poles is accelerating, and that vertical mixing with cold deep water is slowing down, leading to increased ocean stratifi­
cation, which will cause sea temperature to increase more rapidly and CO2 mixing with the deep ocean to decrease.

Introduction: extreme 2023 high temperatures
2023, an El Ni~no year [6], was the hottest year in recorded Earth 
history [3, 4] (Fig. 1). Jamaica had the highest increase of air tem­
peratures out of 175 countries measured in 2023 [7]. We show 
here that Jamaica was also in the center of the highest excess sea 
surface temperatures (SSTs) in coral reef regions in the world 
during 2023, which resulted in the worst high temperature reef 
bleaching and coral mortality ever seen across the entire 
Caribbean Region since the first mass bleaching event in 1987 [8].
Severe bleaching and mortality also happened in Kiribati, Fiji, 
Papua New Guinea, and other places. As 2024 starts, the El Ni~no 
that began in mid-2023 will affect the southern hemisphere. 
During the first weeks of 2024, New Guinea, Solomon Islands, 
and the Great Barrier Reef reached bleaching threshold tempera­
tures, and are expected to rise as the El Ni~no intensifies during 
the Southern Hemisphere summer bleaching season, and may 
also affect Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga.
Satellite sensors only measure the ocean surface skin milli­
meters thick, not what happens deeper in the water column. The 
present oceanographic database is insufficiently dense in space 
and time to determine if global ocean circulation is changing, 
and will take several decades to tell, but could be determined 
sooner with greatly increased expenditure using remotely oper­
ated oceanographic instrumentation [6].
Here we examine the spatial patterns and temporal trends of 
excessive SST Coral Reef Bleaching HotSpot heat waves during 
2023 in light of long-term changes in order to gain insight into 
changes in general ocean circulation and heat transport not eas­
ily shown by other methods.
Results: 2023 coral bleaching HotSpot 
spatial patterns
The 2023 global patterns of maximum Coral Reef Bleaching 
HotSpot values are shown in Fig. 2 and their durations in Fig. 3. 
We define HotSpots as surface waters with excess temperature 
more than one degree C above the average temperature during 
the warmest month at that site as a predictor of coral reef 
bleaching [1–2, 10–17].
The Coral Reef Bleaching HotSpot is also a general indicator of 
extreme heat waves in all parts of the surface ocean, with biolog­
ical stress proportional to the product of excess temperature 
times its duration [18–21]. HotSpot intensity and duration (degree 
heating weeks above the temperature threshold, DHW) allows 
mapping areas warming most rapidly and identifying changes in 
ocean current heat transport.
Areas of high 2023 coral reef bleaching mortality, shown in 
white circles and ovals (Fig. 4), represent coral reefs that under­
went high cumulative heat stress. These included the entire

Caribbean region, the east and west coasts of Mexico and Central 
America, Kiribati, Fiji, and Eastern New Guinea, which are 
reported by local observers to have near total bleaching and severe 
coral mortality (and probably Hainan, China, which could not be 
confirmed). More places were affected than were reported, 
but most tourism dive operations no longer report bleaching 
because it is “bad for business”. Comprehensive mapping of 
bleaching is impossible because no international scientific 
bleaching monitoring network has been established in developing 
countries, 
despite 
urgent 
pleas 
from 
Caribbean 
coral 
scientists after the first high temperature bleaching events in the 
1980s [10, 11, 22].
Results: Caribbean bleaching
The entire Caribbean region, both islands and continental coasts, 
was affected by severe excess temperature (Fig. 5), with the lon­
gest duration of abnormal heating in the Haiti-Jamaica- 
Nicaragua-Honduras-Costa Rica area (Fig. 6), along with the west 
coasts of Mexico and Central America. Severe bleaching began in 
Florida and moved steadily southward across the region, ending 
in the southern Caribbean. The authors have seen every bleach­
ing event in the Caribbean, and the mortality is the worst yet 
seen in the Caribbean region, even though each time there are 
fewer living corals left to bleach.
In Jamaica almost all hard corals bleached completely and 
many died, while bleaching of soft corals and anemones was 
much less, with little mortality. Coral fragmentation nurseries 
costing millions of dollars are reported to have lost all their cor­
als, even those removed from the ocean to indoor refrigerated 
aquariums in Florida. Some surviving Acropora palmata and 
Acropora cervicornis have been found, but these are widely sepa­
rated by about a kilometer [23] and are all colonies that are too 
small to reproduce and invest energy in reproductive organ 
growth, generally found in marginal habitats with high turbidity 
or shaded under larger corals [24].
At this time, it is still too soon to know how many bleached 
corals will recover or will die from heat stroke stress. Some are

regaining their color, but others will fail to recover, or will be 
killed by disease, pollution, algae overgrowth, or grazing by snails 
and polychaete bristleworms. Even though some corals 
may regain their colors, they will stop depositing a skeleton 
and reproducing for around a year [25]. Intensive efforts are un­
derway in Jamaica and other places to find surviving Acroporas 
and to culture fragments in nurseries in Marine Protected 
Areas [23].

Results: comparison of 2023 pattern with 
long-term ocean warming and ocean 
circulation trends
Satellite sea surface temperatures (SST) are based on infrared 
emission from the top millimeters of the sea surface. Changes in 
sea surface temperature result from alterations in (i) heat trans­
port from the atmosphere due to modified winds and waves, 
(ii) horizontal transport in surface ocean currents, and (iii) 
vertical transport due to mixing of surface and deep water [6]. 
Although SST measurements provide instantaneous images only 
of two-dimensional surface heat distribution, regional changes in 
SST can provide insight into shifts in global heat circulation pat­
terns. In the case of possible changes in vertical heat exchange, 
they provide unique insights that cannot be obtained from sub­
surface oceanographic measurements (Fig. 7), which are too 
sparse in time and space to document large-scale or long-term 
changes adequately.
All major warm currents show extreme warming during 2023, 
suggesting that heat transport from the tropics to the polar 
regions has accelerated, causing the most extreme HotSpots of 
all to be in the axis of the Kuro Shio and Gulf Stream currents. 
Increasing equatorial to polar heat transport is keeping the 
tropics relatively cool, making the heating greatest in subpolar 
oceans, acting as positive feedbacks that accelerate polar ice 
melting, albedo feedbacks, and increasing ocean stratification, 
all major global warming feedbacks that have been underesti­
mated and are inadequately modelled in IPCC climate change 
projections.
All major cold currents also show extreme warming during 
2023, suggesting strongly that heat transport in the cold current 
regions is slowing down, causing decreased upwelling and verti­
cal mixing, and increasing vertical stratification.
The large-scale global patterns seen in all warm and cold cur­
rents almost perfectly match the spatial pattern of trends in 
global sea surface temperatures between 1983 and 2001 [5] 
(Fig. 8). 2023 marks a strong continuation of the spatial patterns 
in global warming noted since the start of the NOAA Satellite SST 
database. The main areas warming more slowly than average are 
seen to be largely confined to the interiors of the large ocean 
basins, the deserts of the oceans, which are downwelling gyres, 
Figure 7. The major warm currents are shown as white arrows and cold currents as black arrows. All major surface currents and upwelling zones are 
warming up more rapidly than average, showing strong HotSpots during 2023.

warming, 1983–2001, with long-term hot spots (red dots), from Goreau, 
Hayes, and McAllister, 2005 [5]. Note higher than average warming 
(yellow) in all hot and cold ocean currents, and lowest rate of warming 
(pale) in the mid-ocean gyres and around Antarctica. The 2023 Hot Spot 
anomaly continues and intensifies these trends, which have now 
continued for over the last 40 years.

and the regions of most intense upwelling, waves, and currents 
in the South East Pacific portion of the Circum-Antarctic Current.
These major spatial patterns and temporal trends have been 
surprisingly stable over the last four decades. The main excep­
tion seen in 2023 is in the diagonal band of very hot water south­
east from Fiji to Chile, an area that has been anomalously warm 
for a few years. 2023, therefore, does not mark an anomaly, but is 
the continuation of a trend that is at least 4 decades old, the en­
tire period during which global satellite-measured sea surface 
temperature data have been collected.
Conclusions: large scale ocean circulation 
change is underway
Coral reef bleaching mortality has greatly accelerated since the 
first mass bleaching events in the 1980s, indicating that we are 
on the precipice of a coral reef mass extinction event caused by 
extreme temperatures [26]. Coral Reef Bleaching HotSpot data 
from 2023 imply significant changes in global ocean circulation 
and climate change outside of tropical coral reef regions, espe­
cially in flow of heat from the equator to the poles. This is not 
easily determined from oceanographic data, and changing ocean 
circulation is not considered in IPCC model projections.
Due to failure in the 1980s to set up coral reef bleaching moni­
toring in developing countries where almost all coral reefs are 
found, there are almost no data available to estimate coral 
bleaching mortality or economic impact by comparing before 
and after monitoring, except for a handful of very rich and 
unrepresentative countries [27]. This is a classic example of envi­
ronmental insensitivity and inequity, because those who most 
need the information for their economic benefit, fisheries, pro­
tection, and climate change adaptation have been systematically 
denied funding to develop monitoring. Most local coral health 
monitoring programs in developing countries collapsed during 
the Covid-19 pandemic.
Coral Reef Bleaching Satellite Sea Surface Temperature 
HotSpot analysis in the record hot year of 2023 explains the 
global distribution of coral reef bleaching, and reveals dramatic 
increases in heat transport by the Gulf Stream and Kuro Shio, in­
creasing ocean vertical stratification, while decreasing atmo­
sphere horizontal equator to pole gradients. This tends to 
weaken the global Hadley Atmospheric Circulation of heat via at­
mospheric winds from equator to poles, and makes the Jet 
Stream more variable, leading to increased weather variability 
and extreme climatic fluctuations.
Decreased vertical exchange in cold surface currents and in 
upwelling zones increases thermal stratification and slows down 
the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), retains 
heat longer in the surface ocean, and reduces CO2 exchange 
among the atmosphere, surface ocean, and the deep sea. The 
HotSpot maps from year to year suggest that upwelling systems 
can abruptly shut off, causing sudden sharp rises in regional air 
temperatures, and reducing air-ocean exchange of temperature 
and CO2. Decreased upwelling is causing bottom-up collapse of 
fisheries in all of the world’s most important upwelling zones, 
while overfishing is simultaneously causing their top-down col­
lapse. This strongly suggests that most major currents are chang­
ing, and some could collapse entirely, which might add to 
potential collapse of the global AMOC deep water circulation [28] 
causing longer residence times for deep ocean water, greater 
heat accumulation at the surface [29], and lower ocean upwell­
ing, primary production and fisheries catches.
