INTRODUCTION
This resource, Introducing Indicators, is
part of a series of resources developed
for the Advancing Adaptation - Climate
Change Resilience Training for Ontario
Communities project, supported by
Environment and Climate Change
Canada and the Ontario Ministry of
Environment, Conservation and Parks, as
part of the Canada Ontario Agreement -
Respecting the Quality of the Great
Lakes. The aim of the project is to build
climate change adaptation capacity and
to support new adaptation initiatives in
communities across Ontario and in the
Great Lakes watershed with the purpose
of increasing the ability to plan and
prepare for the impacts from a changing
climate. The project seeks to increase
the integration of climate change impact
information into community decision-
making and implementation to build the
capacity of local decision-makers to
undertake adaptation planning.

actions to understand the impact an
action has had, and if it has been
successful or not. This resource
demonstrates why indicators are
important and the challenges in
measuring progress while also
introducing the type of indicators, tips for
selecting indicators, as well as the
benefits and challenges of using
indicators. It is intended to support
communities who are advancing
implementation and are looking for ways
of measuring progress and demonstrating
success.
Using adaptation indicators can help
support adaptation work in many ways,
including:
 1
2.0 WHY
MEASURE
You cannot manage what you have not
measured - an old management adage
that remains accurate and relevant to
adaptation indicator work today. The
purpose of an indicator is to measure
change. It can offer an understanding of
where you are, where you are going and
how far you are from your desired
outcome. A good indicator helps to show
the success of an action, while it can
also alert you to possible problems and
helps you recognize what needs to be
done to correct it. 
Indicators are used across a variety of
disciplines to improve understanding of
a particular situation, to assess
progress towards a set of goals or
objectives, and to make predictions
regarding future performance. 
“Indicators can also be useful as
proxies or substitutes for measuring
conditions that are so complex that
there is no direct measurement. 
For instance, it is hard to measure the
‘quality of life in my town’ because there
are many different things that make up
quality of life and people may have
different opinions on which conditions
count most. A very simple substitute
indicator is the ‘number of people moving
into the town compared to the number
moving out". [1] It may also be useful to
think of indicators as evidence, which
demonstrate or prove the existence or
success of an action or objective. For
example, if the objective is to reduce
energy consumption in buildings, then the
amount of energy consumed (kw/h) in a
building prior to the implementation of a
mitigation measure and after
implementation would provide evidence
of the success of that measure.
Indicators are often used to track
progress internally; however, they can
also be used to gather, record, and
communicate meaningful information to a
wider audience. Indicators also provide
an opportunity to collect data that can be
aggregated to a city-wide level which
enables comparisons with other similar
communities across the country and
internationally.

This can facilitate adaptation learning
between stakeholders and broader
communities – practitioners can use
lessons learned in similar contexts to aid
in the development of adaptation actions
and indicators to measure the success of
those actions. Indicators can also ensure
accountability and transparency by
enabling the monitoring of resource use
and communicating progress to
residents, partners, and other
stakeholders. [2] Moreover, the case can
be made for adaptation actions by
developing a system that effectively
communicates the results of adaptation
actions to date and that clearly
demonstrates the benefits of these
actions. Together, this can set the stage
to opening a budget for adaptation. [3] 
Considering and including indicators as
part of the adaptation planning stage can
help save resources during the
implementation phase. It is important to
consider how to integrate measurement
into the development of adaptation
actions, plans, or policies. The planning
process involves the development of
baseline and indicator data for
measuring the implementation of
adaptation actions or for measuring the
effectiveness of adaptation actions,
plans, or policies. Identifying appropriate
baseline indicator data is part of
developing implementation schedules for
the implementation of adaptation actions
and is one of the final stages of the
Milestone 3 planning process.

WHAT 
MEASUREMENT 
CAN SUPPORT
3.0 BENEFITS 
AND CHALLENGES
IN MEASURING
PROGRESS
Establish a baseline for future
comparison;
Track the progress of adaptation
actions;
Be used as part of a broader
reporting structure;
Help departments measure their
progress and performance; and
Provide information to the public.
Indicators can be used to measure the
progress and effectiveness of
independent adaptation actions as well
as those measures being implemented
as part of proposed or existing
adaptation plans. The remaining
sections of this paper will discuss the
use and application of indicators to
measure progress on adaptation. There
are both benefits and challenges
involved in the use and application of
adaptation indicators. 
Benefits include the ability to: 
 
Adaptation is not an objective in
itself. Adaptation requires continual
and ongoing adjustments,
representing an ‘adaptive
management’ framework. Wherein,
actions are continually being
monitored and adjusted based on
feedback and experience. But there is
no single benchmark that determines
“successful” adaptation. [5] This lack
of a clear objective, goal, or end state
(unlike GHG reduction or energy
transition for mitigation) can be a
challenge.
To measure adaptation, practitioners
must draw from a variety of fields, such
as natural resource management, public
health, or risk management, and select an
appropriate suite of indicators which can
be used. [4] However, due to the
complexity of climate change adaptation
and the emergent nature of adaptation
research and practice, there are some
distinct challenges associated with
measuring progress. These challenges
include:

[5] ICLEI. n.d. "Characteristics of Good Indicators."
Measuring 'avoided impacts' in
adaptation is difficult. Adaptation
actions are intended to reduce
climatic impacts – however, in the
absence of that risk occurring, it is
challenging to measure how much
worse off the event would have been
in the absence of intervention. 
Inherent uncertainties associated
with adaptation interventions.
Uncertainty is intrinsic to climate
science and understanding future
impacts. And beyond uncertainties
regarding specific climatic impacts
(e.g., the extent of sea level rise),
there will be significant variability
across regions, communities, and
economies. Uncertainty is particularly
acute for those indicators that are not
easily quantified or if the probability
of an associated climatic event is
unknown. [6]
Adaptation occurs over multiple
scales and sectors. There is a
particular misalignment between the
long timescales over which climate
change unfolds and the relatively
short duration of policy and program
drivers for adaptation. Shifting
political priorities can frequently alter
the prominence of adaptation as a
priority. Furthermore, there are
difficulties in comparing results
across the varying sectors,
populations, programming strategies,
and locations in which adaptation
measurement takes place. What is
appropriate in one location may not
be suitable in another. [7]
There are a diversity of indicators
and monitoring and evaluation
approaches. This challenge
intersects with the above challenge
related to the multi-scalar and
sector nature of adaptation – there
is no single set of indicators that
fit these differing settings.
Indicators need to be tailored to
the unique local context and
adaptation intervention. [8]
Human, temporal, financial, and
technical resource constraints.
These constraints can impair a
municipality’s ability to collect
adequate data or maintain a
consistent monitoring program
which may lead to unreliable or
incomplete measurement.

4.0 INDICATORS
OVERVIEW
Initiate course corrections;
Change the timing of implementation;
Create mechanisms for alerting
stakeholders to emerging climate
change data and risk information; and
Help give warning to stakeholders of
certain “tipping points” and illuminate
points at which alternative adaptation
paths should be pursued. [9]
Although there are inherent challenges
related to using adaptation indicators,
adaptation actions require the ongoing
and consistent monitoring of a set of
indicators to: 
The kind of indicator used will depend on
the context of your adaptation work, what
you are trying to measure, and the
information that is available. 
There are a few different categories of
indicators that should be considered,
including: measures of awareness,
knowledge, and engagement; measures
of changing exposure; and measures of
changes in actual impacts. [10]
Measures of awareness, knowledge, and
engagement are used to track progress
toward achieving certain communication
and awareness raising objectives. These
indicators can be helpful in gauging
community interest and uptake in
particular initiatives and can be tracked
over time. Indicators which measure
changing exposure are important in
understanding the hazards and risks
facing a community, and how those are
changing over time. They require a
detailed understanding of the hazards
and risks facing a community to reduce
vulnerability (e.g., comprehensive hazard
and exposure mapping). Measures of
changes in actual impacts are important
in understanding how potential medium
and long-term impacts of climate change
hazards across municipal services and
areas are changing over time (e.g.,
comprehensive hazard risk assessments
that incorporate climatic impacts).

Keep in mind when measuring the
changes of actual impacts to
differentiate between the effectiveness
of adaptation actions and the actual
climatic changes and weather events
occurring that will affect how you are
being impacted.
When selecting an indicator, it is also
important to decide how it will be used.
There are two main types of indicators
relevant to adaptation: process-based
and outcome-based indicators. 
 7
4.1 Process-based Indicators
In some cases, indicators can be used to
measure or track the progress towards
achieving a specific target or objective.
These indicators can be particularly
valuable in the short- and medium-term
time horizons as they can report on the
progress that has been made towards
achieving an adaptation objective and
can be part of an ongoing process of
understanding and addressing risks and
vulnerabilities. Process-based indicators
often alert you to potential problems or
opportunities with regards to the
implementation of an action or objective,
giving you the chance to introduce new
information or activities into your
adaptation planning as needed. An
example of a process-based indicator
might be the number of cooling centers,
or the amount of shaded area in the city.
 8
4.2 Outcome-based Indicators
Indicators can also be used to measure
the success or effectiveness of actions.
This type of indicator can be helpful in
supporting accountability; however,
they are generally used for longer time
frames and require implementation to
be at a minimum partially completed as
the outcome or success of an action
can only be measured once it has been
implemented or completed. [11] 
Reducing deaths caused by extreme
heat is an example of an adaptation
objective. Heatwave mortality or the
number of people who died from heat-
related illness each year are both
outcome-based indicators that would
tell you whether the implemented
measures (such as the number of
cooling centers opened or percentage
increase in tree canopy cover) have
been effective.
Identifying indicators that are robust
enough to give a clear picture of the
effectiveness of your adaptation
actions is fundamental to effective
monitoring and should be revised as the
planning process enters successive
cycles. [12]
When developing your suite of
indicators try to include a variety of
both process-based and outcome-based
indicators as each are useful in
different contexts when reporting on
the implementation of adaptation
actions. The following diagram (Figure
1) illustrates when process-based and
outcome-based indicators can be used. 
Process-based indicators should
generally be used when implementing
adaptation plans, policies, or projects
(e.g., a flood protection plan), whereas
outcome-based indicators should be
used after a measure or plan has been
implemented to determine whether
those actions were effective (e.g.,
reduction in economic losses due to
floods). Using outcome-based
indicators will help you assess
whether the plans, policies and actions
that have been put in place are
improving your community’s adaptive
capacity and whether an adaptation
objective has been achieved. This way
of categorizing indicators can be
helpful in selecting which ones would
be most useful in your planning
efforts.

Figure 1
In addition to process-based and outcome-based indicators, there will also be contextual
information which may be relevant and should be recorded. This is information that
provides the context for an adaptation action or objective, such as the age and type of
your community’s housing stock or your community's demographic breakdown. These
datasets are often required to track other adaptation indicators. For example, an
adaptation objective might be to reduce heat related mortality in vulnerable populations.
To determine whether you have achieved this objective, you would need to know the
demographic breakdown of that population, as well as the geographic distribution of
your community’s vulnerable population and how that may have changed over the course
of implementation. This information is needed in addition to process and outcome-based
indicators, which would tell you how many cooling centres have been opened, or how
many more, or less, emergency room visits occurred during a heat wave.

INDICATORS
Helps determine whether an action is
increasing the adaptive capacity or
decreasing the sensitivity to a given
climate change impact;
Focuses on the objective of the
measure; or
Can be used to measure progress
towards achieving a specific objective
Generally, it is unlikely that progress on
climate adaptation can be measured
using a small number of indicators. This
is because climate change is a systemic
issue that crosses many scales,
departments, and jurisdictions, thus
requiring comprehensive monitoring and
evaluation processes to evaluate the
effectiveness of adaptation interventions.
Therefore, to adequately measure climate
adaptation progress, many indicators will
be required. While there is no limit as to
how many indicators can be used, an
indicator should be chosen because it:
The kind of indicators you choose will
depend on what exactly you are trying to
measure and whether that information is  
available. Each possible indicator will need
to be vetted to assess its feasibility and
whether it can provide useful information.
Consider the nature of your objective or
adaptation action when selecting an
indicator or whether you have a
quantitative goal (e.g., reducing the
number of hospitalizations during extreme
heat events by 50%) or a qualitative one
(e.g., improving awareness of climate
change impacts among business owners).
Having determined what you would like an
indicator to tell you, you should then look
at whether to use quantitative or
qualitative indicators. See Figure 2 (below)
for more information. 
As you select your indicators make sure to
also consider information that is already
being tracked or recorded (e.g., an
inventory of greenhouse gas emissions).
Be certain that this information is
collected with an appropriate level of
frequency. [13] This can help you
determine which indicators are best suited
to your local capacity and resources.
Ideally, you should review and refine your
set of indicators on a continuing basis to
ensure appropriate and accurate reporting.
Similarly, it may be the case that over time
certain indicators are no longer useful for
measuring progress and can be discarded. 
 10
[13] Figueiredo, et al. (2018).
QUANTITATIVE INDICATORS
Those which rely on numerical data or official statistics.
Examples of quantitative indicators include: population
living in identified "hot spots"; amount of protected
natural area; or amount of GHGs generated by the
transportation sector.
QUALITATIVE INDICATORS
Often used in the absence of numerical data and instead
use constructive scales (i.e., high, medium, low, 1
through 10, etc.). The data required for a constructive
scale can be gathered through surveys or structured
through interviews with experts. For example, you can
assess the adequacy of government emergency response
plans (high, medium, low) based on a survey of
municipal staff. Constructed scales can often benefit
from expert judgement or proxy measurements, such as
time scales or demographic information.
Figure 2
They are RELEVANT and VALID – they
measure a change or something about
a system that you need to know;
They are CLEAR and EASY TO
UNDERSTAND – a non-expert should
be able to understand the indicator;
They are RELIABLE – an indicator
should be able to consistently
measure against a baseline and
should provide information that can
be trusted;
They are based on ACCESSIBLE
DATA–the indicator is based on
information that is readily available
and relatively easy to collect and
analyze;
They are OBJECTIVE - If two people
measure the same indicator using the
same tool, they should get the same
result. The indicator should be based
on fact, rather than feelings or
impressions (another way to say this
is to say that it should be
Measurable);
They are REALISTIC - It should not be
too difficult or too expensive to
collect the information (related to the
next one in the list);
They are SPECIFIC - The measured
changes should be attributable to the
project, and they should be expressed
in precise terms.
While indicators themselves can vary
significantly, effective indicators
generally share a few key characteristics.

6.0 USING
ADAPTATION
INDICATORS
Justifying and monitoring adaptation
plans, actions and programs;
Comparing adaptation achievements
across regions and countries;
Communicating adaptation to the
general public;
Informing the development of future
adaptation plans, policies and actions;
Facilitating the sharing of best
practices between stakeholders; and,
Measuring effectiveness and progress
of resource commitments (e.g.,
investments in infrastructure).
Adaptation indicators can be used for a
variety of reasons, which have been
outlined throughout this resource already,
including: 
While indicators can often speak for
themselves, once you have defined a set
to be used locally, you may also want to
consider including narrative reporting
alongside the indicators to provide
context and explanation. The following
subsections outline the importance of
setting a baseline and specific
information regarding baseline data
collection. 
To effectively use indicators to track
progress or measure effectiveness, a
baseline must be set. A baseline is a
point of reference which allows for
comparison between past and future
conditions. An adaptation baseline is a
useful step in the development of a local
action plan and provides a valuable
reference point that can be used to track
one’s progress. Once you have identified
which indicators can be used, you can
then go about establishing an adaptation
baseline. An adaptation baseline can be
used to help describe how a system
responds to tailored adaptation efforts.
Keep in mind, if your team is not able to
establish a comprehensive baseline prior
to the creation of an adaptation plan, you
may have a less accurate picture of the
progress and effectiveness of individual
actions or your overall action plan. By
identifying indicators and using them to
establish a baseline, municipalities are
better equipped to share experiences,
successes and best practices with both
council and the wider community. 
  
13
6.1 Setting a Baseline
 14
6.2 Data Collection
Frequency of data collection: It is
important to establish a data
reporting plan to track trends over
time however excessive reporting
may lead to reporting fatigue
Sources of information/data:
Sources of data may be pre-existing,
stem from surveys, or be based on
interviews with experts. [17]
Additional information sources
could include federally collected
statistics, information from relevant
provincial [18] or regional bodies,
external consultations or
municipally led initiatives. [19]
Disaggregation of data: Separating
data by variables such as income,
sex, age, geographic location etc.
may help to identify vulnerable
populations or expose hidden
trends. [20] Municipalities may find
it helpful to disaggregate location
sensitive data at the scale of
previously established
administrative boundaries such as
neighbourhood or postal code area.
[21]
Without established baseline data the
reliability and therefore usefulness of
the entire indicator may be
compromised. Even commonly
accepted baseline data can contain
major errors. [16] Therefore, baseline
data should be critically examined
before utilizing it as a foundational
piece of your indicator. Below is a list
of important factors to consider when
developing a plan for data collection to
ensure accurate and valuable
information, including: 
Data Collection methods: Data
collection methods may vary based
on need and available resources
(capital, human technological). [22]
Data may be collected by third
party experts or internal staff. [23]
Various methods could include
interviews, focus groups, surveys,
or existing data. [24]

In Canada, communities are familiar
with the establishment of baselines as
part of the Partners for Climate
Protection (PCP) program. In the PCP,
greenhouse gas inventories bring
together data on community and
municipal energy use and solid waste
generation to calculate greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions each year. In the
context of the PCP, a baseline acts as
a basis for setting an emissions
reduction target and as a point of
comparison for all future mitigation
work. By identifying significant
sources of GHG emissions,
municipalities can implement
appropriate emissions reduction
measures and develop a local
mitigation action plan (for more
information on the PCP, visit
www.fcm.ca/pcp)
6.3 Communicating Indicators
External reporting or progress against a
set of indicators enables accountability
and helps to increase confidence in
each action or plan. This strategy
enables knowledge-sharing and
comparisons. [25] Internal reporting
allows for cross-departmental
communication which could lead to:
knowledge exchange, collaboration,
and/or institutional learning and
improvement. [26] Internal reporting
displays the progress and output of
budgetary expenses. There are various
methods to communicate indicators to
stakeholders and/or constituents –
preferred methods of communication
are generally context- and
goal/objective-dependent. Furthermore,
communication methods will depend on
the type of reporting being used to
measure and report on the indicator
(i.e., internal versus external). 
Ensure risks and issues are clearly
communicated allowing for early
identification and course
correction; [29]
Promote evidence-based decision
making. [30]
Sustainability Dashboards
The use of a Dashboard is an effective
way to visually display the efforts of a
municipality using various tools such
as interactive maps and charts.
Dashboards also allow for a summary
of the project in question as well to
communicate the projects progress
and performance. [27] While the
dashboard has many, outward facing
uses it can also provide clear
information to internal stakeholders
which enable timely adjustments and
improvements. [28]

Reports to Council
Local government staff are familiar
with reporting to council on
departmental workplans, objectives,
and goals. Presenting indicators via
reports to council can help to
communicate the progress of
adaptation actions to date and highlight
areas that may need more work (which
could lay the groundwork for necessary
funding requirements). It also informs
other city departments, which can
facilitate cross-departmental learning
and collaboration. [31]
Reporting indicators to council:
Newsletters
Another communication tool that can
be used in communicating the progress
of adaptation interventions are
newsletters; newsletters are a useful
tool in reporting the outcome of
adaptation actions to the public and
other interested parties. They maintain
a more casual and upbeat tone and can
be presented in a more visually
pleasing format (i.e., using
infographics/images).
Using newsletters to report indicators:
Offers a more digestible
communication medium; and
Engages with audiences that might
not otherwise receive the message. 
Facilitate cross-city knowledge-
sharing and collaboration; 
Allow comparisons across cities
over different timeframes; 
Increase investor confidence/buy-in.  
Annual Reports
Annual reports are another way of
communicating the progress of
adaptation actions and initiatives – this
communication tool is more formal and
will likely be part of existing reporting
frameworks. Annual reports are
communicated both internally but also
externally as well – the external
reporting can aid in achieving increased
investor confidence in adaptation work
and it can also allow for knowledge-
sharing across cities [32]
Annual reporting can:

7.0 CLOSING THOUGHTS
Introducing indicators is part of a series of resources developed for the
Community Climate Change Adaptation Action project, which is
supported by Environment and Climate Change Canada and the Ontario
Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks, as part of the Canada
Ontario Agreement - Respecting the Quality of the Great Lakes. This
guidance document is meant to provide a basic overview of indicators
and to communicate the importance of ensuring your adaptation project
is measurable and supported by locally defined performance metrics.
This resource has outlined key factors inherent in developing indicators
including motivation, barriers, and choice. Better navigating these factors
will help to strengthen adaptation initiatives in communities in Ontario
and across Canada.
