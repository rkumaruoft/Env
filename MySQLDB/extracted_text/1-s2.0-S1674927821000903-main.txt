Abstract
Understanding historical wildﬁre variations and their environmental driving mechanisms is key to predicting and mitigating wildﬁres.
However, current knowledge of climatic responses and regional contributions to the interannual variability (IAV) of global burned area remains
limited. Using recent satellite-derived wildﬁre products and simulations from version v1.0 of the land component of the U.S. Department of
Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM land model [ELM] v1) driven by three different climate forcings, we investigated the
burned area IAVand its climatic sensitivity globally and across nine biomes from 1997 to 2018. We found that 1) the ELM simulations generally
agreed with the satellite observations in terms of the burned area IAV magnitudes, regional contributions, and covariations with climate factors,
conﬁrming the robustness of the ELM to the usage of different climate forcing sources; 2) tropical savannas, tropical forests, and semi-arid
grasslands near deserts were primary contributors to the global burned area IAV, collectively accounting for 71.7%e99.7% of the global
wildﬁre IAV estimated by both the satellite observations and ELM simulations; 3) precipitation was a major ﬁre suppressing factor and
dominated the global and regional burned area IAVs, and temperature and shortwave solar radiation were mostly positively related with burned
area IAVs; and 4) noticeable local discrepancies between the ELM and remote-sensing results occurred in semi-arid grasslands, croplands, boreal
forests, and wetlands, likely caused by uncertainties in the current ELM ﬁre scheme and the imperfectly derived satellite observations. Our
ﬁndings revealed the spatiotemporal diversity of wildﬁre variations, regional contributions and climatic responses, and provided new metrics for
wildﬁre modeling, facilitating the wildﬁre prediction and management.

1. Introduction
An average of 400 million hm2, or about 3% of the global
land area, is burned annually by wildﬁres (Chuvieco et al.,
2016; Giglio et al., 2013). Such widespread wildﬁres have
direct impacts on the global carbon cycle, ecosystem dynamics,
atmospheric chemistry, and human society sustainability
(Bowman et al., 2009; Page et al., 2002; Shakesby, 2011). In
the context of climate warming and increased human activities,
ﬁre regimes have shifted dramatically in many regions, such as
the Mediterranean area (Mouillot et al., 2002), boreal area
(Kasischke et al., 1995), Australia (Cary and Banks, 2000), and
the western USA (Abatzoglou and Williams, 2016; Flannigan
et al., 2009; McKenzie and Littell, 2017). The interannual
variability (IAV) of wildﬁres is a key ﬁre characteristic that
affects the terrestrial carbon cycle and atmospheric composi-
tion (e.g., CO2 and aerosol concentrations) (Patra et al., 2005).

High year-to-year wildﬁre changes also make wildﬁre analysis
and simulation challenging (Beck et al., 2002), adding
complexity to relevant policy decisions, planning, and execu-
tion (Monzon-Alvarado et al., 2014; van Wilgen, 2009).
Improving the understanding of wildﬁre IAV and associated
environmental determinants is critical for wildﬁre prediction
and management, facilitating the mitigation of adverse wildﬁre
effects on human health and ecological stability.
Our knowledge of global wildﬁre IAVand its climatic drivers
remains limited. Although a number of studies, using observa-
tional or modeling approaches, have explored the relationships
between wildﬁre IAVand climate at regional scales (e.g., Africa,
Mediterranean area, Siberia), the wildﬁre-climate relationships
are still poorly characterized at the global scale (Abatzoglou
et al., 2018; Archibald et al., 2010; Goss et al., 2020; Jolly
et al., 2015; Urbieta et al., 2015). Although possible impacts
of major climatic factors (e.g., temperature, precipitation, solar
radiation) on wildﬁre IAV have been examined, their relative
contributions and corresponding uncertainties still need to be
quantiﬁed (Crockett and Leroy Westerling, 2018; Fasullo et al.,
2018; Holden et al., 2007; Lafon and Quiring, 2012; Wei et al.,
2020). Satellite-retrieved wildﬁre products (e.g., burned area)
provide unique opportunities to investigate wildﬁre dynamics
and their climatic determinants across different scales. However,
remote-sensing wildﬁre observations are produced only for
recent time periods (e.g., starting from 1997), and the data
quality is subject to sensor aging, cloud and smoke disturbances,
and the performance of detection algorithms (Giglio et al., 2016;
Randerson et al., 2012). Moreover, satellite wildﬁre datasets are
not derived based on physical mechanisms and therefore cannot
be directly used to predict future ﬁre behaviors. Process-oriented
ﬁre models, designed at different complexity levels, have been
developed to simulate historical and future wildﬁres responding
to prescribed or prognostic environmental conditions (Li et al.,
2012; 2013; Rabin et al., 2017; Thonicke et al., 2010). However,
it is necessary to comprehensively benchmark existing wildﬁre
models against various sources of satellite and ground obser-
vations (Korontzi et al., 2006; Ramankutty et al., 2008). Hence,
the combined use of remote-sensing and model results would
integrate the strengths of both approaches and improve the
understanding and mechanistic modeling of global wildﬁre IAV.
Having a comprehensive understanding of global wildﬁre
IAV and its major climatic drivers would enhance the capa-
bility of wildﬁre prediction and preparedness of wildﬁre risk
management. To achieve this overarching goal, in this study,
we focused on addressing the following questions: 1) What
were the spatial and temporal structures of global burned area
IAV for the 1997e2018 period? 2) What were the biome-level
regional contributions to global wildﬁre IAV? 3) What were
the covariations between wildﬁre IAV and main climate fac-
tors? 4) How different were the IAV estimations between ELM
and remote-sensing wildﬁre products? We assessed these
changes
and
performed
relevant
intercomparisons
using
different global satellite-based burned area products and off-
line simulations from version 1.0 of the land component of the
U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System
Model (E3SM land model [ELM] v1).
2. Data and methodologies
2.1. Data
2.1.1. Remote-sensing wildﬁre products
Two satellite-based wildﬁre datasets were applied, including
the burned area fraction of the Global Fire Emission Database
(GFED) version 4.1s (Randerson et al., 2015) and the FireCCI
version 5.1 from the European Space Agency Climate Change
Initiative (CCI) project (Chuvieco et al., 2018; Lizundia-Loiola
et al., 2020). The monthly GFED4.1s burned area fraction
spanning from 1997 to 2016 with a spatial resolution of
0.25   0.25  was derived from a combination of multiple
data sources that include images from the Visible and Infrared
Scanner on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite,
multi-channel images of the Along Track Scanning Radiome-
ters on the European Space Agency's Earth-observing satellite,
and burned area and thermal products from the Moderate
Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra
and Aqua satellites (Giglio et al., 2013). When compared with
GFED version 4, the version 4.1s dataset accounts for small
ﬁres. The FireCCI5.1 burned area dataset was generated from
250 m resolution MODIS red and near-infrared reﬂectance
information, with a combination of thermal anomaly data from
the MODIS active ﬁres product (Chuvieco et al., 2018; Giglio
et al., 2016; Lizundia-Loiola et al., 2020) and has monthly and
biweekly temporal resolutions from 2001 to present.
Both GFED4.1s and FireCCI5.1 dataset were aggregated to
0.5
  0.5
 resolution with yearly intervals covering
1997e2016 and 2001e2018, respectively. Because GFED4.1s
provides a burned area fraction in each grid, we multiplied it by
the land area of each 0.5 grid to derive actual burned areas.
Only pixels with annual mean Normalized Difference Vege-
tation Index greater than 0.125 were considered to ensure
available combustive biomass and spatial consistency among
different data sources (Pinzon and Tucker, 2014). A similar
vegetation classiﬁcation scheme like (Ahlstr€om et al., 2015)
was
adopted
and
includes
tropical
rainforests
(TRFs),
temperate forests (TEFs), boreal forests (BFs), tropical savan-
nahs (TRS), temperate grasslands and shrublands (TGRSs),
semi-arid grasslands (SAGs), tundra (TUD), croplands (CRPs),
and wetlands (WETs) (Fig. A1).
2.1.2. ELM wildﬁre simulations
Built
on
the
Community
Land
Model
Version
4.5
(CLM4.5), the ELM embeds the CLM-Li ﬁre scheme (Li et al.,
2012, 2013) as the default ﬁre component. CLM-Li contains
four sub-modules: process-based non-peat ﬁres, empirical
agricultural ﬁres, deforestation ﬁres, and peat ﬁres. The simu-
lated ﬁre-burned area, mainly the non-peat burned area, is
estimated as a function of ﬁre counts and an average ﬁre spread
area driven by ignition sources, fuel load, fuel combustibility,
and anthropogenic suppression processes. For this study, the
global burned area simulations were produced by three ofﬂine
ELM
experiments
driven
by
different
climate
forcings,
including CRUNCEP version 8 (1901e2016), GSWP version 2
(1901e2014), and PRINCETON (1901e2012) (van Den Hurk
687
TANG R. et al. / Advances in Climate Change Research 12 (2021) 686e695
et al., 2016). Accordingly, these three historical simulations at
0.5 spatial resolution were denoted as ELM-CRU, ELM-
GSWP,
and
ELM-PRIN,
respectively.
A
more
detailed
description of the experimental setup and driver information
for ELM historical transient runs can be found in Chen et al.
(2020), Forbes et al. (2018, 2019), and Haarsma et al. (2016).
2.2. Methodologies
2.2.1. IAV
Similar to previous studies (Anderegg et al., 2015; Fu
et al., 2017; Piao et al., 2020), we deﬁned the detrended
annual anomalies of wildﬁre or climate variables as their
interannual variability (IAV). Speciﬁcally, the IAV of variable
Y is denoted as:
I ¼Y  bY
ð1Þ
where Y is the original time series and bY is the ﬁtting line from
a least squares regression.
The magnitude of IAV is characterized using the coefﬁcient
variations (CV) (Chuvieco et al., 2021):
CV ¼ s
m;
ð2Þ
where s and m stand for the standard deviation and mean.
2.2.2. Regional contribution index
An IAV contribution partitioning index (Ahlstr€om et al.,
2015) was used to calculate the contribution of each biome
type to global burned area IAV. The contribution index fj is
deﬁned as
fj ¼
P
t
bjtjBtj
Bt
P
t
jBtj
ð3Þ
where bjt is the detrended burned area for biome region j in
year t and Bt is the detrended global burned area, where Bt ¼
P
j
bjt. This deﬁnition implies P
j
fj ¼ 1. The resulting index fj
represents region j’s contribution to global variation. A region
with higher index means it contributes more to the global
variation, and a negative index dampens global variation. Each
regional contribution index was multiplied by 100 to convert
fractions to percentages.
Partial correlation analysis was employed at grid, biome,
and global scales to explore sensitivities of burned area IAV to
various climate factors (i.e., temperature, precipitation, and
solar downward radiation). Long-term linear trends were
removed before conducting partial correlations.
3. Results
The ELM global burned area IAV ranged from 44.0 to 57.6
Mhm2 (e.g., 36.7e36.8 Mhm2 for ELM-CRU, 44.0e57.6
Mhm2 for ELM-GSWP, and 34.6e43.1 Mhm2 for ELM-
PRIN),
generally consistent
with
satellite-derived results,
especially with the GFED4.1s (i.e., 45.242.2 Mhm2 for
GFED4.1s and 93.0e48.0 Mhm2 for the FireCCI5.1) (Fig. 1;
Table A1). Global wildﬁre IAV magnitudes from different ELM
simulations, represented by CV, also agreed closely with that of
satellite-derived results in the period of 1997e2012 (i.e., 0.1 for
ELM-CRU, 0.1 for ELM-GSWP, 0.1 for ELM-PRIN, and 0.1
for GFED4.1s). The IAV of FireCCI5.1 global burned area was
abnormally low in 2001, which was mainly contributed by the
low IAV values from the TRF and TRS biomes (Fig. A2a and
d). Such underestimation was likely caused by the absence of
MODIS Aqua Hotspots data between 2001/01 and 2002/07
(Chuvieco et al., 2018; Lizundia-Loiola et al., 2020). Consid-
ering the relatively short temporal overlap of FireCCI5.1 with
other datasets (starting from 2001), GFED4.1s will thus here-
after be primarily used to compare with the ELM simulations.
Geographically,
a
relatively
high
IAV
variation
of
GFED4.1s occurred mainly in the boreal area and semi-arid
region (e.g., Australia), while tropical and subtropical re-
gions showed relatively low ﬁre variations (Fig. 2a). The
weakest wildﬁre variations existed in African subtropical
savannah systems and were consistent with previous studies
(Archibald et al., 2013; Chuvieco et al., 2008). Such a remote-
sensing-derived spatial pattern was generally reproduced by
the ELM simulations, especially the ELM-GSWP and ELM-
PRIN, which were mostly consistent with one another
(Fig. 2bed). However, some regional discrepancies between
the ELM and GFED4.1s variation magnitudes were note-
worthy. For example, the ELM underestimated the IAV mag-
nitudes in the boreal area, especially the ELM-CRU, and the
ELM overestimated the IAV over Africa.
The ELM simulations driven by different climate forcings
consistently produced the highest IAV variation in the Boreal
Forests (BF) (0.5 ± 0.2), the second highest variation in the
Tundra (TUD) (0.4 ± 0.1), and the lowest variation in the
temperate grasslands and shrubland (TGRS) (0.1 ± 0.0)
(Fig. 3a). GFED4.1s showed the highest wildﬁre variation in
the TUD (1.5), followed by BF (1.1), while the Tropical Sa-
vannas (TRS) had the lowest variation (0.1). For the regional

contribution, both types of products estimated that TRSs
contributed most to the global IAV (58.0% for ELM-CRU,
42.0% for ELM-GSWP, 58.3% for ELM-PRIN, and 58.4%
for GFED4.1s). The second leading contribution was from
TRFs for the ELM simulations (14.7% for ELM-CRU, 22.0%
for ELM-GSWP, and 18.2% for ELM-PRIN), and from SAGs
(31.8%) for the GFED retrieval.
Both GFED4.1s and ELM simulations showed that the
burned area IAV correlated positively with temperature and
shortwave radiation but correlated negatively with precipita-
tion for most of the globe (Fig. 4). One noticeable exception,
however, existed in northern Australia, where the GFED
wildﬁre generally showed negative temperature responses
while ELM wildﬁre simulations demonstrated slightly positive
temperature responses (Fig. 4aeb, Figs. A4 and A6). In this
area, high temperature and associated droughts tend to limit
the vegetation growth, resulting in less available fuel for
burning (Bradstock, 2010; Sun et al., 2019; Madani et al.,
2020). But detailed climatic and anthropogenic driving
mechanisms (e.g., the traditional Indigenous ﬁre management)
underlying the wildﬁre IAV in this local region are still un-
certain and require further investigation (Bowman et al.,
2020). Compared with the GFED4.1s, the ELM simulated
burned area IAVs were more sensitive to precipitation, espe-
cially in North America and northern Eurasia (Fig. 4d), and
were more sensitive to temperature and shortwave radiation,
mainly in North America (Fig. 4a, b, e, and f). Different
sources of climate forcings had minor impacts on their cor-
relations with burned area IAV for either wildﬁre product
(Fig. 4, and Fig. A4). Additionally, the spatial patterns for
climate sensitivities of ELM wildﬁre IAVs were broadly
consistent among the simulations driven by different climate
forcings (Fig. 4, and Fig. A4).
Regional summaries of both GFED4.1s and ELM sensi-
tivity results, shown in Fig. 5, conﬁrmed positive responses of
burned area IAV to temperature and shortwave radiation but
negative responses to precipitation across the globe and most
biome regions. Moreover, precipitation mainly controlled the
burned area IAV, especially for the three ELM simulations.
Major response differences between the ELM and observa-
tions were found in the BF, SAG, and WET biomes in terms of
the sensitivity magnitude, sign, or both.
4. Discussion
Using the latest satellite and ELM-simulated wildﬁre
products, we investigated global and regional wildﬁre IAVs
and their climatic sensitivities. The ﬁndings of regional con-
tributions to the global burned area IAV and the impacts of
major climatic factors on the changes of burned area IAVs are
generally
consistent
with
previous
wildﬁre
assessments
(Randerson et al., 2012; van der Werf et al., 2006; 2008a;
2008b,; Yin et al., 2016). Next, we will discuss the burned
area IAV and its underling mechanisms for each biome,
starting with the TRS because of its largest contribution to
global IAV.
TRSs, featured with high ﬁre intensity but low IAV varia-
tion magnitude, were the largest contributor to the global
burned area IAV. TRSs, such as the African TRS systems, are
characterized by the codominance of C3 woody plants and C4
grasses. During wet seasons or years, grasses prevail and form
a dense herbaceous layer, which then dries quickly in dry
seasons or years. Such seasonal or interannual variation of
grass fuel availability, mainly driven by rainfall patterns, fa-
vors biomass combustion all year round and leads to the
largest regional contribution to global burned area variation

TANG R. et al. / Advances in Climate Change Research 12 (2021) 686e695
(Archibald et al., 2010; Hao and Liu, 1994; Romero-Ruiz
et al., 2010).
Next to TRSs, TRFs also showed a large contribution to the
global burned area IAV. These high wildﬁre numbers of TRFs,
especially those in tropical Asia, were likely associated with
irregular peatland drainage and deforestation that are partially
caused by political and economic incentives (Cochrane, 2001;
Laurance and Williamson, 2001; Morton et al., 2006;
Murdiyarso et al., 2004; Shea et al., 1996). The draining of
peatlands and consequently lowered water-table levels would
not only induce a higher peat decomposition rate but also
make peat areas more ﬁre-prone (Hirano et al., 2014; Konecny
et al., 2016; Miettinen et al., 2012). Tropical deforestation,
forest thinning, or removing the forest canopy would allow
greater insolation to the soil surface, resulting in a more
ﬂammable environment with dryer fuel, higher air tempera-
ture and wind speed, lower relative humidity, and less pre-
cipitation (Christopher and Kauffman, 1990; Hoffmann, 2003;
Xu et al., 2020).
The global SAG biome, covering the desert grasslands, was
found to make a large contribution to the global burned area
IAV, especially for the GFED4.1s (Fig. 3b). Over recent de-
cades, more mega-ﬁres have occurred in its corresponding
geographical locations, such as those in western Australia
(Haydon et al., 2000) and the western USA (Abatzoglou and
Kolden, 2011). Such wildﬁre increases in SAGs were likely
linked to the rain-related growth of domestic grasses and
expansion of plant invasions such as the red brome and
cheatgrass invasion in North America, gamba grass and buf-
felgrass in northern and central Australia (Clarke et al., 2005),
and buffelgrass invasion in the southwestern USA (Mack,
1981; Marshall et al., 2012; Setterﬁeld et al., 2010). The in-
crease of exotic grasses and associated loss of native shrubbery
or woody vegetation signiﬁcantly changes fuel characteristics,
such as a growing fuel continuity and fuel load (Brooks et al.,
2004; Horn et al., 2015; Horn and St. Clair, 2017; McLaughlin
and Bowers, 1982; Wright, 1980). For example, buffelgrass in
Australia, is highly drought-tolerant and thus more ﬂammable
than domestic grasses by providing more biomass and higher
spatial connectivity (Clarke et al., 2005). No matter what types
of grass exist in the SAG, precipitation was widely reported to
have a positive correlation with ﬁre events since it dominants

grassland (SAG), tundra (TUD), cropland (CRP), and wetlands (WET) biomes.

grass growth and provides fuel for combustions in the dry
season (Bradstock, 2010).
The wildﬁre IAV showed vast spatial variation, being
dominated or co-dominated by different climatic factors over
different geographical regions (Figs. 4 and 5 and Fig. A5). In
accordance with previous results, temperature was identiﬁed to
mostly determine the wildﬁre IAVs in high-latitude areas with
positive partial correlations. Local warming could increase
tree mortality in those areas, enhance evapotranspiration,
lower relative humidity, and thus lead to more ﬂammable
biomass fuel and drier weather, favoring the ignition and
spreading of wildﬁres (Allen et al., 2010; Anderegg et al.,
2013; Breshears et al., 2005). Both the ELM and satellite re-
sults
roughly

suppressing factor for global wildﬁre IAVs (Fig. 4c, d,
Fig. A4b, e, h, k, and Fig. 5). Precipitation patterns have been
widely conﬁrmed to govern wildﬁre variations by changing the
fuel load and fuel moisture (Andela and van der Werf, 2014;
Archibald et al., 2009). For example, the burned area variation
in TEFs of the western USA was strongly associated with the
vegetation condition and soil wetness, which were directly or
indirectly affected by the summer precipitation changes
(Holden et al., 2018). In TGRSs, many studies have revealed
that precipitation stimulates plant photosynthesis, favors
biomass accumulation, and thus may increase ﬁre probability
(Pilliod et al., 2017; Song et al., 2016; Vargas et al., 2012).
However, the ignition of wildﬁres in TGRSs also relies on the
alternating pattern of wet and dry years for a ﬂammable
environment with enough dry fuel and fuel continuity. Thus,
for this research, the identiﬁed annual constraining effects of
precipitation on TGRS wildﬁre variation (Fig. 5) were likely
more controlled by the precipitation-induced high fuel mois-
ture than the precedented precipitation-stimulated high fuel
availability.
This study demonstrates that the ELM generally captured
the IAV variation magnitudes of remote-sensing burned areas
at the global scale (Fig. 2). Furthermore, ELM simulations
driven by different climate forcings (i.e., the ELM-CRU,
ELM-GSWP, and ELM-PRIN) produced similar sensitivities
of burned area IAVs to climate factors, reﬂecting the model's
steady performance and robustness in simulating the wildﬁre-
climate feedback (Fig. 4 and Fig. A4). However, when
comparing the burned area IAVs derived from satellite ob-
servations and model simulations, we also found discrepancies
in the SAG biome around deserts for its IAV variation
magnitude, global contribution, and responses to climate fac-
tors. Moderate inconsistencies were also identiﬁed in BFs,
CRPs, and WETs, and the ELM simulations tended to be more
sensitive to climatic factors than GFED4.1s, especially in
North America. Such disparities between the two products
could be caused for various reasons such as imperfect
modeling representations and defective satellite-extracted ob-
servations. Because the interactions between burned areas and
their environmental drivers are complex and nonlinear, the
statistical assumption of the climate-ﬁre relationship as a
linear system in this study may lead to considerable un-
certainties (Archibald et al., 2010; Hantson et al., 2016;
Kloster and Lasslop, 2017). Although in the current ELM-Li
ﬁre scheme, population density and gross domestic product
are used to characterize human impacts on wildﬁre dynamics,
the monotonically increasing or decreasing expressions of
these two factors may induce performance degradation. The
default ﬁre scheme also ignores anthropogenic impacts on the
seasonality of wildﬁres, especially over agricultural regions
and heavily deforested areas. In CRPs where rice is grown, for
example, the ﬁre season timing and the number of peak
months may vary signiﬁcantly because of different agricultural
cultivating modes. The oversimpliﬁed representation of land
use and land cover change in the ELM model and possible
classiﬁcation errors, especially between peatland and WETs,
also lead to a modeling limitation of the time-varying burned
areas. Additionally, the current ﬁre model assumes that fuel
load, which is mainly the above-ground biomass, is constant
within one particular year and does not change over seasons
with the climates, human activities, and even wildﬁre feed-
back. This could be a major reason why the model under-
estimated burned area IAVs in SAG areas, where wildﬁre
occurrences largely depend on the seasonal fuel accumulation,
especially during wet seasons (Gremer et al., 2015; Rao and
Allen, 2010). The IAV magnitudes in BFs and TUDs were
much different between simulations and satellite observations
(Fig. 3a). Peatland covers about 25%e30% of the BF region,
and forested peatland is vulnerable to wildﬁres (Gorham,
1991; Gremer et al., 2015; Wieder and Vitt, 2006). Although
the parameterization of ELM peatland ﬁres may be further
improved by using more accurate peat maps and considering
time-depending burning depth, ELM produced similar wildﬁre
IAVs to those from the satellite-derived FireCCI5.1, while
GFED4.1s yielded low IAVs over the BFs and TUDs
(Fig. A2c, and g). Burned areas in the GFED4.1s were derived
by an algorithm that applied a burn-sensitive vegetation index
with a threshold of active ﬁres. Smoldering peatland wildﬁres
could be too difﬁcult to detect because of the mixture of
peatlands with upland BFs, which may have resulted in the
underestimated wildﬁre IAVs for GFED4.1s.
5. Conclusions
Using satellite-derived wildﬁre products and process-
oriented ELM simulations, this study explored the spatio-
temporal dynamics of burned area IAVs and their possible
responses to major climatic factors. The wildﬁre activities in
tropical savannas, tropical forests, and SAGs around deserts
were found to dominate the global burned area IAV and were
mainly associated with the precipitation variations, espe-
cially for the ELM outputs. Both temperature and downward
shortwave radiation positively modulated the burned area
IAV, whereas precipitation showed signiﬁcant suppressing
effects across most regions for both types of ﬁre products.
Satellite and ELM IAVs and their covariations with climate
factors were mostly consistent at the global scale, and the
ELM simulations were robust even when driven by different
climate inputs. However, some discrepancies regarding sign,
magnitude, or both were identiﬁed in SAG, BF, TUD, CRP,
and WET areas. Both the ELM uncertainties and observa-
tional biases in the satellite products may lead to such dis-
crepancies. A need exists to improve the ELM ﬁre processes
and capture the effects of different land surface conditions,
climate change, and human activities, especially for the
CRP, SAG and peatland ﬁres. Such detailed global quanti-
ﬁcation of wildﬁre IAVs and associated driving mechanisms
offers important insights into the wildﬁre prediction, man-
agement, and sustainable maintenance, especially across
ﬁre-prone regions.
