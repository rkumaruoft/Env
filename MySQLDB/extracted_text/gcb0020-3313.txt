Abstract
The focus of the great majority of climate change impact studies is on changes in mean climate. In terms of climate
model output, these changes are more robust than changes in climate variability. By concentrating on changes in cli-
mate means, the full impacts of climate change on biological and human systems are probably being seriously under-
estimated. Here, we brieﬂy review the possible impacts of changes in climate variability and the frequency of
extreme events on biological and food systems, with a focus on the developing world. We present new analysis that
tentatively links increases in climate variability with increasing food insecurity in the future. We consider the ways in
which people deal with climate variability and extremes and how they may adapt in the future. Key knowledge and
data gaps are highlighted. These include the timing and interactions of different climatic stresses on plant growth
and development, particularly at higher temperatures, and the impacts on crops, livestock and farming systems of
changes in climate variability and extreme events on pest-weed-disease complexes. We highlight the need to reframe
research questions in such a way that they can provide decision makers throughout the food system with actionable
answers, and the need for investment in climate and environmental monitoring. Improved understanding of the full
range of impacts of climate change on biological and food systems is a critical step in being able to address effectively
the effects of climate variability and extreme events on human vulnerability and food security, particularly in agricul-
turally based developing countries facing the challenge of having to feed rapidly growing populations in the coming
decades.

Introduction
Climate change has many elements, affecting biological
and human systems in different ways. The considerable
spatial heterogeneity of climate change impacts has
been
widely
studied;
global
average
temperature
increases mask considerable differences in temperature
rise between land and sea and between high latitudes
and low; precipitation increases are very likely in high
latitudes, while decreases are likely in most of the tro-
pics and subtropical land regions (IPCC, 2007). It is
widely projected that as the planet warms, climate and
weather variability will increase. Changes in the fre-
quency and severity of extreme climate events and in the
variability of weather patterns will have signiﬁcant con-
sequences for human and natural systems. Increasing
frequencies of heat stress, drought and ﬂooding events
are projected for the rest of this century, and these are
expected to have many adverse effects over and above
the impacts due to changes in mean variables alone
(IPCC, 2012).
In this review, we consider the possible impacts of
changes in climate variability on biological and food
systems, with a focus on the tropical and subtropical
developing world, where the deleterious impacts of
anthropogenic climate change are generally projected
to be greatest. These less developed regions of the
world already face an enormous food security chal-
lenge,
with
human
populations
rising
unabated
throughout the present century (UNDESA, 2013). We
start with a short consideration of the global impor-
tance and costs of climate variability and extreme
events. We then brieﬂy review some of the major
impacts of climate variability and extremes on biologi-
cal and agricultural systems at a range of scales, and on

human health and nutrition. We then present some
new analysis that seeks to link increases in climate vari-
ability with increasing food insecurity in the future,
before considering the ways in which people deal with
climate variability and extremes and how they may
adapt in the coming decades. We conclude with a dis-
cussion of research gaps in relation to both the biophys-
ical and the socioeconomic arenas and what needs to be
done to better understand the impacts of climate vari-
ability on human vulnerability and food security, ulti-
mately to increase the capacity of farmers in the tropics
and subtropics to address climate variability and
extreme events.
Climate change, climate variability and extreme
events
Climate change is inevitably resulting in changes in cli-
mate variability and in the frequency, intensity, spatial
extent, duration, and timing of extreme weather and
climate events (IPCC, 2012). Changes in climate vari-
ability and extremes can be visualized in relation to
changes in probability distributions, shown in Fig. 1
(IPCC, 2012). The top panel shows a shift of the entire
distribution towards a warmer climate (a change in the
mean), a situation in which more hot (and record hot)
weather would be expected, along with less cold (and
record cold) weather. The middle panel shows a change
in the probability distribution of temperature that pre-
serves the mean value, but involves an increase in the
variance of the distribution: on average, the tempera-
ture is the same, but in the future, there would be more
hot and cold (and record hot and cold) weather. The
bottom panel shows the situation in which the tempera-
ture probability distribution preserves its mean, but the
variability evolves through a change in asymmetry
towards the hotter part of the distribution; here, we
would
see
near
constant
cold
(and
record
cold)
weather, but increases in hot (and record hot weather).
Climate variability already has substantial impacts
on biological systems and on the smallholders, commu-
nities and countries which depend on them. The impor-
tance of rainfall variability at the national level, for
example, is illustrated in Fig. 2, which shows the rela-
tionship
between
annual
rainfall
variability
and
changes in the gross domestic product and agricultural
gross domestic product for three countries of sub-Saha-
ran Africa. In Fig. 2, interannual rainfall variability is
expressed as the 12-month Weighted Anomaly of
Standardized Precipitation (WASP), calculated from
overlapping multimonth sums of standardized precipi-
tation anomalies weighted according to the fraction of
mean annual precipitation at the given time of year
(from the data library of the International Research
Institute for Climate and Society, iridl.ldeo.colum-
bia.edu). This kind of close relationship is likely to be
found for many tropical countries that depend heavily
on agriculture as an engine for economic development.
Changes in extremes have been observed since 1950,
and there is evidence that some of these changes are a
result of anthropogenic inﬂuences, although attribution
of single extreme events to these inﬂuences remains
challenging (IPCC, 2012). Global aridity has increased
substantially since the 1970s due to recent drying over
Africa, southern Europe, East and South Asia, and

CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND VULNERABILITY

eastern Australia – the percentage of global land
(between 60°S and 75°N) deﬁned as dry areas has
increased from 17% in the 1950s to about 27% in the
2000s (Dai, 2011). There is considerable uncertainty
regarding projected changes in extremes to the end of
the current century, and conﬁdence in projecting
changes in the direction and magnitude of climate
extremes is generally low, although as the IPCC (2012)
points out, low conﬁdence in projections of changes in
extremes does not mean that such changes are necessar-
ily unlikely. Similarly, given current limits of under-
standing of the underlying processes regarding climate
in many regions, it may be that low-probability, high-
impact changes in extremes will occur. A partial
summary of observed changes in some extremes, their
attribution and their future projection, is shown in
Table 1, extracted from table 3.1 in IPCC (2012).
A summary analysis of the numbers of people
affected by environmentally related disasters is given
in Raleigh & Jordan (2010) based on data compiled by
the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disas-
ters (CRED, 2008). A disaster is entered into the CRED
database if at least one of the following criteria is ful-
ﬁlled: 10 or more people reported killed, 100 or more
people reported affected, a declaration of a state of
emergency and a call issued for international assis-
tance. An aggregated summary of these data is shown
in Table 2. Chronic environmental hazards such as
drought are not the most common, but they do affect
the most people, with impacts on an average across all
years of 10 per cent of a country’s population (in low-
income states, this increases to 13 per cent of a coun-
try’s population). Raleigh & Jordan (2010) note that
only in the case of drought is a signiﬁcant proportion of
a state affected. Floods tend to be more localized (for
obvious reasons), but may still affect millions of people.
The total number of disaster events in each region since
1970 is particularly noteworthy; and since 2000, the
average number of events per year is running at more
than 380 (Raleigh & Jordan, 2010).
There is a considerable literature on the economic
costs of climate variability and extremes. Globally,
annual damage from large weather and climate events
increased eightfold between the 1960s and the 1990s;
between 1980 and 2004, the costs of extreme weather
events amounted to US 1.4 trillion (Mills, 2005). Since
1980, annual costs have ranged from a few US billion to
above US $200 billion (in 2010 dollars) for 2005, the year
of Hurricane Katrina (IPCC, 2012). While there is con-
siderable regional variation, the relative economic bur-
den of climate extremes as a proportion of GDP is
substantially higher in developing countries than it is
in developed countries – up to 8% in the most extreme
cases. A strong upward trend in overall losses due to
climate extremes is indicated since 1980 (Munich Re,
2011), although how these will play out during the
course of the current century is highly uncertain; and
as yet, there is no evidence to link this trend to anthro-
pogenic climate change (Bouwer, 2011). Extreme events
may have considerable impacts on sectors that have
close links with climate, such as water, agriculture and
food security, forestry, health, and tourism, and con-
comitantly in countries whose economies depend more
heavily on such sectors (IPCC, 2012).
Impacts of climate variability and extremes
Biological systems
Warmer climates will generally accelerate the growth
and development of plants, but overly cool or hot
weather will also affect productivity. Earlier ﬂowering
and maturity of several crops have been documented in
recent decades, often associated with higher tempera-
tures (Craufurd & Wheeler, 2009). Increases in maxi-
mum temperatures (as climate or weather) can lead to
severe yield reductions and reproductive failure in
many crops. In maize, each degree day spent above
30 °C can reduce yield by 1.7% under drought condi-
tions (Lobell et al., 2011). Impacts of temperature
extremes may also be felt at night, with rice yields
reduced by 90% with night temperatures of 32 com-
pared with 27 °C (Mohammed & Tarpley, 2009). In con-
trast to the effects of temperature and photoperiod at
optimum
and
suboptimum
temperatures,
crop
response to temperature and photoperiod at supraopti-
mal temperatures is not well understood (Craufurd &
Wheeler, 2009).
Climate variability and extreme events can also be
important for yield quality. Protein content of wheat
grain has been shown to respond to changes in the
mean and variability of temperature and rainfall (Porter
&
Semenov,
2005);
speciﬁcally,
high-temperature
extremes during grain ﬁlling can affect the protein con-
tent of wheat grain (Hurkman et al., 2009).
At aggregated level as well as at the plot level, rain-
fall variability is a principal cause of interannual yield
variability. For example, Hlavinka et al. (2009) found a
statistically signiﬁcant correlation between a monthly
drought index and district-level yields in the Czech
Republic for several winter- and spring-sown crops,
each of which has a different sensitivity to drought.
Both intra- and interseasonal changes in temperature
and precipitation have been shown to inﬂuence cereal
yields in Tanzania (Rowhani et al., 2011). The increases
in rainfall variability expected in the future will have
substantial impacts on primary productivity and on the
ecosystem provisioning services provided by forests

Precipitation
Likely statistically signiﬁcant increases in the
number of heavy precipitation events in more
regions than those with statistically signiﬁcant
decreases, but strong regional and subregional
variations in the trends.
Medium conﬁdence that anthropogenic
inﬂuences have contributed to intensiﬁcation of
extreme precipitation at the global scale
Likely increase in frequency of heavy
precipitation events or increase in proportion of
total rainfall from heavy falls over many areas
of the globe, in particular in the high latitudes
and tropical regions, and in winter in the
northern midlatitudes.
El Ni~no and
other modes of
variability
Medium conﬁdence in past trends towards more
frequent central equatorial Paciﬁc El Ni~no-
Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Insufﬁcient
evidence for more speciﬁc statements on ENSO
trends.
Anthropogenic inﬂuence on trends in North
Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is about as likely as
not. No attribution of changes in ENSO.
Low conﬁdence in projections of changes in
behaviour of ENSO and other modes of
variability because of insufﬁcient agreement of
model projections.
Droughts
Medium conﬁdence that some regions of the world
have experienced more intense and longer
droughts, in particular in southern Europe and
West Africa, but opposite trends also exist.
Medium conﬁdence that anthropogenic inﬂuence
has contributed to some observed changes in
drought patterns. Low conﬁdence in attribution
of changes in drought at the level of single
regions due to inconsistent or insufﬁcient
evidence.
Medium conﬁdence in projected increase in
duration and intensity of droughts in some
regions of the world, including southern
Europe and the Mediterranean region, central
Europe, central North America, Central
America and Mexico, northeast Brazil and
southern Africa. Overall low conﬁdence
elsewhere because of insufﬁcient agreement of
projections.
Floods
Limited to medium evidence available to assess
climate-driven observed changes in the magnitude
and frequency of ﬂoods at regional scale. There is
low agreement in this evidence, and so low
conﬁdence at the global scale regarding even the
sign of these changes. High conﬁdence in trend
towards earlier occurrence of spring peak river
ﬂows in snow melt- and glacier-fed rivers.
Low conﬁdence that anthropogenic warming has
affected the magnitude or frequency of ﬂoods.
Medium to high conﬁdence in anthropogenic
inﬂuence on changes in some components of
the water cycle (precipitation, snow melt)
affecting ﬂoods.
Low conﬁdence in global projections of changes
in ﬂood magnitude and frequency because of
insufﬁcient evidence. Medium conﬁdence that
projected increases in heavy precipitation
would contribute to rain-generated local
ﬂooding in some catchments or regions. Very
likely earlier spring peak ﬂows in snow melt-
and glacier-fed rivers.

and agroforestry systems. Despite the uncertainty sur-
rounding the precise changes, climate variability needs
to be taken into account. For example, the impacts of
climate change to the middle of this century on crop
yields in parts of East Africa may be underestimated by
between 4% and 27%, depending on the crop, if only
changes in climatic means are taken into account and
climate variability is ignored (Rowhani et al., 2011).
Changes in temperature and rainfall patterns and
amounts will combine to bring about shifts in the onset
and length of growing seasons in the future. Projected
changes in length of the growing period for Africa to
the 2090s were estimated by Thornton et al. (2011) for
an ensemble of 14 GCMs. A large proportion of the
cropping and rangeland area of sub-Saharan Africa is
projected to see a decrease in growing season length,
and most of Africa in the southern latitudes may see
losses of at least 20 per cent. At the same time, the prob-
ability of season failure is projected to increase for all of
sub-Saharan Africa, except for central Africa; in south-
ern Africa, nearly all rain-fed agriculture below latitude
15°S is likely to fail one year out of two (Thornton et al.,
2011). The robustness of these estimates, in terms of in-
tramodel variability, is particularly low in the Sahel
region and in parts of south-western Africa, however
(Thornton et al., 2011). In terms of timing of growing
season onset, Crespo et al. (2011) demonstrate that it
may be possible to adapt to projected climate shifts to
at least the 2050s in maize production systems in parts
of southern Africa by changing planting dates.
In situations where changes in climate and climate
variability may be larger, more fundamental changes
may occur, particularly if critical thresholds in tempera-
ture and/or rainfall are reached (Gornall et al., 2010).
Changes in the nature and timing of the growing sea-
son may induce smallholders to grow shorter duration
and/or more heat- and drought-tolerant varieties and
crops, for example.
Most domesticated livestock species have comfort
zones between 10 and 30 °C; at temperatures below
this, maintenance requirements for food may increase
by up to 50%, and at temperatures above this, animals
reduce their feed intake 3–5% per additional degree of
temperature (NRC, 1981). In many livestock systems,
changes in temperature and rainfall and rainfall vari-
ability affect feed quantity most directly. Droughts and
extreme rainfall variability can trigger periods of severe
feed scarcity, especially in dryland areas, which can
have devastating effects on livestock populations. In
the recent past, the pastoral lands of East Africa have
experienced droughts about one year in ﬁve, and even
under these conditions it is generally possible to main-
tain relatively constant cattle herd sizes, but increases
in drought frequency from one year in ﬁve to one year
in three would set herd sizes on a rapid and unrecover-
able decline (Thornton & Herrero, 2009). In Kenya,
some 1.8 million extra cattle could be lost by 2030
because of increased drought frequency, the value of
the lost animals and production foregone amounting to
US $630 million (Ericksen et al., 2012).
Craine et al. (2012) found that in a temperate grass-
land, the effects of drought and high temperatures
decline over the season, to the point where climate vari-
ability may have minimal impact later in the growing
season. Key ecosystem processes are seasonally sensi-
tive to climate variability, and increased understanding
of plant productivity will need to recognize that the
timing of climate variability may be just as important
as its magnitude (Craine et al., 2012). In both temperate
and tropical grasslands, species composition is a key
determinant of livestock productivity. As temperature,
rainfall patterns and CO2 levels change, so will the
composition of mixed grasslands change. Small climatic
changes may affect the dynamics and balance of differ-
ent grasslands species, and these may result in changes
in livestock productivity (IPCC, 2007). The overall

effects of changes in temperature and rainfall and their
variability on species composition and grassland qual-
ity, however, are still far from clear and remain to be
elucidated (IPCC, 2007).
Droughts in grasslands can also be a predisposing
factor for ﬁre occurrence in many regions (IPCC, 2012),
and intensiﬁed droughts could exacerbate the problem.
There is some evidence that recent years have already
seen an increase in grassland ﬁre disasters in parts of
China and tropical Asia. In the future, wildﬁres may be
60 per cent more frequent in much of South America
for a temperature increase of 3 °C, and in parts of Aus-
tralia, the frequency of very high and extreme ﬁre dan-
ger days could rise by up to 70 per cent by 2050 (IPCC,
2012).
Mixed crop–livestock systems are prevalent in much
of the developing world (Herrero et al., 2010), and cli-
mate change and changing climate variability in the
future may affect the relationship between crops and
livestock in the landscape in many places. In places that
will become increasingly marginal for crop production,
livestock may provide an alternative to cropping. Such
transitions could occur in up to 3% of the total area of
Africa, largely as a result of increases in the probability
of season failure in the drier mixed crop–livestock sys-
tems of the continent; these are projected to increase
from the current rate of approximately one year in ﬁve
to one year in four or three, depending on the combina-
tion of emissions scenario and climate model used
(Jones & Thornton, 2009).
Changes in climate variability and in the frequency
of extreme events may have substantial impacts on the
prevalence and distribution of pests, weeds, and crop
and livestock diseases.
For example, in the past, combinations of drought
followed by high rainfall have led to wide-spread out-
breaks of diseases such as Rift Valley fever and blue-
tongue in East Africa and of African horse sickness in
South Africa (Baylis & Githeko, 2006). Future increases
in the frequency of extreme weather events could allow
the expansion of Rift Valley fever northwards into Eur-
ope, for example (Martin et al., 2008). In general, the
effects of future changes in climate variability on pests,
weeds and diseases are not well understood (Gornall
et al., 2010).
Evidence of vegetation shifts resulting from increas-
ingly frequent extreme climatic events is still compara-
tively
rare,
although
what
there
is
supports
the
existence of stabilizing processes which tend to mini-
mize
and
counteract
the
effects
of
these
events,
reinforcing community resilience (Lloret et al., 2012).
Better understanding of these stabilizing processes and
the community inertia that is frequently observed in
vegetation under extreme events, are crucial for the
establishment of sound management strategies that can
improve ecosystem resilience under climate change
(Lloret et al., 2012).
Globally, the negative effects of climate change on
freshwater systems, in terms of changes in quantity and
distribution, are expected to outweigh the beneﬁts of
overall increases in global precipitation due to a warm-
ing planet; several parts of the tropics and subtropics,
including parts of Central-West Asia, North Africa,
Asia and North America, are likely to be particularly
affected by reduced freshwater availability (Rosegrant
et al., 2009). It is expected that more than half the
world’s population will live in countries with severe
water constraints by 2050 (Rockstr€om et al., 2009).
Climate models project increased aridity during the
current century over most of Africa, southern Europe
and the Middle East, most of the Americas, Australia
and Southeast Asia. There is considerable uncertainty
in such results, but the projections are alarming because
a very large population may be severely affected in the
coming decades. At the same time, precipitation may
become more intense but less frequent (i.e. longer dry
spells). This has the potential to increase ﬂash ﬂoods
and runoff, and as a result increase soil erosion, dimin-
ish soil moisture and increase the risk of agricultural
drought (Dai, 2011), as well as increasing the potential
for crop losses due to ﬂooding and affecting the
dynamics of livestock diseases and their vectors, for
example.
Food systems, health and nutrition
There is little literature on the effects of climate variabil-
ity and extreme climatic events on food systems as
opposed to food production. Of nearly 600 pages in the
SREX report (IPCC, 2012), for example, there is only
one page on the impacts of climate extremes on food
systems and food security.
At the local level, Codjoe & Owusu (2011) studied
communities in Ghana and showed how extreme cli-
matic events affect rural food production, transporta-
tion, processing and storage. Food security in this
region could be enhanced by increasing farm-based
storage facilities; improving the transportation system,
especially feeder roads that link food production areas
and major markets; providing farmers with early warn-
ing systems; extending credit to farmers; and the use of
supplementary irrigation. Some cultural practices, par-
ticularly those that prohibit the consumption of certain
foods, may reduce the resilience of some individuals
and ethnic groups to food system disruptions.
Climate variability has both direct and indirect
impacts on human health. Extreme heat affects health,
especially among the elderly (McMichael et al., 2006).

Other direct impacts are largely expressed through the
interaction of infectious and vector-borne diseases with
temperature and precipitation. Malaria, dengue and
cholera, for example, are all highly affected by changes
in seasonal distribution of precipitation, including
changes in ﬂood and drought patterns (McMichael &
Kovats, 2000; Costello et al., 2009). Although changes in
malaria vectors will occur due to the gradual increase
in temperature, the incidence of disease is also quite
sensitive to changes in precipitation. If changes in cli-
mate variability lead to changes in spatial and temporal
variation in vegetation and water distribution, we
could see more epidemics as the vector moves to new
areas (McMichael et al., 2006). Both malaria and dengue
fever have associations with La Ni~na and El Ni~no
cycles (McMichael et al., 2006). Human displacement
from extreme events, especially ﬂoods, could become
more frequent with an increase in climate variability.
This also often has negative consequences for human
health, not least because of crowded conditions with
poor sanitation. Diarrhoeal disease is regularly a prob-
lem in such situations (Haines et al., 2006). In addition,
as inadequate access to health services is already a lead-
ing cause of poor health in developing countries, dis-
placement and infrastructure damage from extreme
events, especially ﬂoods, can exacerbate this (although
people also often move in response to prolonged
drought). If water scarcity increases, this also has an
impact on sanitation and health outcomes if clean water
is less available (Few, 2007).
Nutrition is correlated with positive health outcomes,
and both adequate amount of calories as well as sufﬁ-
cient nutritional diversity and proteins are important.
As outlined above, overall availability of food shows
some correlation with climate variability. The study by
Lloyd et al. (2011) builds upon previous work of Nelson
(2009)
to
show
clearly
that
climate
change
and
increased climate variability, through their impact on
food production, will have a negative impact on the
prevalence of undernutrition, increasing severe stun-
ting by 62% in South Asia and 55% in East and south-
ern
Africa
by
the
2050s.
Although
nutrition
is
determined not only by food availability, but also
access to food as well as nutritional and child care prac-
tices, there are almost no studies on these other aspects
of nutrition determinants (Tirado et al., 2010).
Some more detailed work has been done at national
level. For example, a dynamic economy-wide model of
Bangladesh has been used to estimate economic dam-
ages from historical climate variability and future
anthropogenic climate change. Using a combination of
historical yield variability and 10 climate projections,
future anthropogenic climate change damages are esti-
mated to reduce national rice production in Bangladesh
by about 9 per cent to midcentury, and most of these
losses are attributed in the analysis to ﬂooding damage
and climate variability (Thurlow et al., 2011). Another
example is the work of Ahmed et al. (2011), who used a
modelling approach to estimate how changes in climate
variability might affect crop yields and thence poverty
rates in Tanzania to the early 2030s. They found that
future climate scenarios with the largest increases in cli-
mate volatility rendered Tanzanians increasingly vul-
nerable
to
poverty
through
its
impact
on
the
production of staple grains.
At the global level, one of the few studies so far to
model climate shocks and their impacts on commodity
prices in different regions is Willenbockel (2012).
Results are indicative only but interesting nevertheless.
For example, a drought in North America in 2030 of a
similar scale to the historical drought of 1988 would
have a dramatic temporary impact on world market
export prices for maize and a strong impact on world
market price for wheat. These impacts would feed
through to domestic consumer prices, with particularly
profound effects in parts of sub-Saharan Africa. For
instance, Nigeria depends almost entirely on imports of
wheat, and under such a scenario the average domestic
price for wheat in the country would spike by 50%
above the baseline 2030 price, with potentially substan-
tial impacts on households. The treatment of the
impacts of climate variability as opposed to the impacts
of slow-onset climate change in global economic mod-
els is a heavily underresearched area, particularly how
harvest failures in one continent may inﬂuence food
security outcomes in others.
How may changes in climate variability and
extremes affect food security in the future?
Human populations are vulnerable to the impacts of
climate change largely because of the socioeconomic
and political context in which they live. Thus, vulnera-
bility to climate change is highly differentiated (O’Brien
et al., 2007) across geography, income levels, type of
livelihood and governance arrangements, among other
things. Human vulnerability can be evaluated in terms
of a range of different outcomes such as food security
or household income. Thus, areas vulnerable to disas-
ters are not necessarily the same as those whose food
availability is likely to be negatively affected by
changes in climate variability. A major challenge in
viewing human vulnerability as the result of multiple
and dynamic factors is the need to take a synthetic
approach to translate the sectoral impacts of changes in
climate and climate variability into consequences for
people. Food security is a particularly important devel-
opmental outcome that is highly vulnerable to climate

change. This vulnerability is a product of climate
change impacts on biological systems, affecting food
availability, as well as economic and social impacts that
affect food utilization, access to food and the stability of
food security (Ericksen, 2008).
As noted above, there is only limited information on
the potential impacts of climate variability on food
availability at broad scales such as national and regio-
nal. For economies that are agriculturally based, Fig. 2
suggests that rainfall variability can have substantial
effects on agricultural growth at the national level,
although that relationship will be modiﬁed by many
other factors. Links from climate variability to poverty
indicators are also not that straightforward to demon-
strate. We undertook some new analysis using recent
global data sets to try to throw some light on the possi-
ble links between climate variability and food security.
Herrero et al. (2013) recently generated maps showing
global kilocalorie production per capita from edible
animal products, including milk and meat from rumi-
nant species (bovines, sheep and goats) and meat and
eggs from monogastric species (pigs and poultry). To
estimate total kilocalorie production from crops, we
used data on crop yields and harvested areas from the
Spatial Production Allocation Model (SPAM) of You
et al. (2012). SPAM contains data for the year 2000 and
includes 14 food crops or crop groups: banana and
plantain, barley, beans, cassava, groundnut, maize, mil-
let, other pulses such as chickpea, cowpeas, pigeon
peas, and lentils), potato, rice, sorghum, soybean, sweet
potato and yam, and wheat. We calculated the total
food production from these 14 crops and crop groups
using calorie contents as given in FAO (2001). The
SPAM data set matches FAOSTAT country totals for
2000 and details crops grown in three types of system
(irrigated, rain-fed commercial and rain-fed subsis-
tence). Multiple cropping is also taken into account. We
then calculated total kilocalorie production from both
livestock and the 14 crops at a resolution of 5 arcmin
(gridcells of side about 9 km at the equator). Each grid
cell was then stratiﬁed on the basis of rainfall variabil-
ity. To do this, we utilized a weather generator, Mark-
Sim, and methods outlined in Jones & Thornton (2013)
to estimate the coefﬁcient of variation (CV) of annual
rainfall for the globe, from 100 years of generated daily
rainfall data. We estimated the human population in
each stratum (CIESIN Center for International Earth
Science Information Network Columbia University &
Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT),
2005a). To relate climate variability to some proxy of
food insecurity, we used the subnational data set of
CIESIN (2005b) on the proportion of children under
ﬁve who are underweight for their age, and again esti-
mated the average proportion for each stratum. The
human population and children underweight data sets
are both for the year 2000. Results are shown in Table 3,
split between developing and developed countries.
Here, we deﬁned the developing countries as those in
the Americas between Mexico in the north and Brazil,
Paraguay, Bolivia and Peru in the south, all of Africa,
and in Asia up to 45°N excluding Japan. The remain-
der, we classiﬁed as developed countries.
Several points can be made about Table 3. First, some
5.4 billion people, or just under 90 per cent of the global
population in 2000, live in places that produce at least
some crop and livestock calories. On the basis of this
analysis, the 14 crops or crop groups account for 70 per
cent of all calories produced and livestock 30 per cent
(note that several important crops that provide calories
for human nutrition are not included here, including
sugar and oil crops). Second, it is noteworthy that
developing countries (as deﬁned above) account for 78
per cent of the people, but only 40 per cent of the calo-
ries
available;
conversely,
the
temperate
regions
account for 22 per cent of the people and 60 per cent of
the calories produced. Third, the relationship between
rainfall variability and the average prevalence of under-
weight children seems not to be straightforward: in the
developed regions, the value of the food insecurity
proxy
increases
as
rainfall
variability
increases,
whereas in developing countries, it increases up to a
rainfall CV of 30 per cent and then falls slightly for
further increases in rainfall CV. A possible explanation
for this is that in the higher CV regions, most food is
brought in via imports or food aid, for example. Fourth,
nearly eight times as many people live in areas of high
rainfall variability (with a CV of 30 per cent or more) in
the developing countries as they do in the developed
countries (407 million compared with 54 million); yet,
these areas of high rainfall variability in developing
countries account for only 3 per cent of all the calories
produced, and they also tend to be areas with relatively
high child malnutrition. Clearly, many such areas may
be targets for the provision of food aid and social safety
nets.
We can show that increased rainfall variability will
affect agricultural growth and economic development
in certain types of countries (Fig. 2). The analysis pre-
sented above is highly simpliﬁed, as there are many
other factors and drivers that will interact in complex
ways, but there may also be impacts of increased rain-
fall variability on food security as shown by a proxy
such as the prevalence of child malnutrition (Table 3).
In the absence of information concerning the nature of
increases in rainfall variability in the coming decades,
one question that might be asked is, how sensitive are
the data in Table 3 to shifts in rainfall variability? To
test this, we made several changes across the board to

rainfall CV and then restratiﬁed the data. Results are
shown in Fig. 3, in terms of population by rainfall CV,
for the developing world and the developed world, for
‘current’ conditions and for situations with decreased
(1 per cent) and increased (+1 per cent and +2 per
cent) rainfall variability. While the likelihood of such
changes is essentially unknown, a + 2 percentage point
increase in annual rainfall CV leads to increases in the
population living in areas of high rainfall variability
(CV> 30%) in developing countries of more than 230
million to 643 million people (58 per cent), while in the
developed countries the number more than doubles
from 54 to 112 million.
It is not just rainfall that increases variability in yield.
The temperature-related processes reviewed above also
contribute to this. Few climate change impact studies
report changes in CV; analysis of those that do shows
that increases in CV of more than 50% may not be
uncommon from the 2040s onwards (Challinor et al.,
2014a).
Even though simpliﬁed and with a high degree of
uncertainty, our analysis helps to substantiate the
hypothesis of an increase in child malnutrition rates in
both developed and developing countries in the future
as a result of variability changes, all other things being
equal. These increases could be particularly large in
sub-Saharan Africa as a result of high population
growth rates and relatively large areas with high rain-
fall variability. Sub-Saharan Africa is already by far the
largest recipient of food aid: average annual shipments
amount to about 2 per cent of all food consumed.
Under many scenarios, the number of food-insecure
people in sub-Saharan Africa by 2020 is still likely to be
at least 500 million (USDA, 2010), and this is a chal-
lenge that will clearly not be made any easier by
increases in rainfall and temperature variability.
Responses of vulnerable people
Most of the literature and analysis discussed above
relate to how climate variability will affect exposure or
sensitivity of biological and food systems, and hence
food security outcomes. However, the most important
element of reducing vulnerability is to enhance the

adaptive capacity of people, at various levels of deci-
sion-making from the individual up to the national and
regional. Institutions play a key role in enabling such
adaptation. Increases in variability, which are largely
unpredictable in the short and long term, will force
institutions (deﬁned loosely as social patterns including
organizations) to be more proactive and ﬂexible, quali-
ties that are difﬁcult to foster (Gupta et al., 2010). This
applies not only to the national level; for example
Ncube et al. (2012) discuss the example of local govern-
ment infrastructure in South Africa to provide basic
commodities such as water and energy. They found a
strong relationship between water and energy demand
and rainfall variability, and concluded that local gov-
ernments will increasingly need to be proactive in plan-
ning for adaptation to climate change, because of its
inﬂuence on their operations and budgets (Ncube et al.,
2012).
By focusing on how climate variability might change,
we are trying to better characterize what climate change
means for vulnerability – a better answer to the ques-
tion ‘Vulnerability to what’ (Misselhorn et al., 2010).
Uncertainty or lack of predictability is considered a real
hindrance to planning for adaptation. However, if for
example we can explore how sensitive food availability
in a given location is to a range of increases in precipita-
tion variation, or what the limits of current institutional
arrangements are for dealing with the consequences of
increased frequency of extreme events, we can get a
clearer deﬁnition of the development problem that cli-
mate change might exacerbate. This better prepares
communities and governments to develop robust adap-
tation strategies in spite of uncertainty about the precise
impacts of climate change.
What might vulnerable people who are partially or
wholly dependent on natural resources for their liveli-
hoods do in response to substantially increased climate
variability? There is already a considerable literature on
the ways in which resilience of agricultural production
systems may be increased in the face of climate change,
particular under the ‘climate-smart agriculture’ rubric
(e.g. FAO, 2010; Thornton et al., 2013). Options range
from increasing the efﬁciency of crop and livestock sys-
tems via various components such as soil and nutrient
management, water harvesting and retention, improv-
ing ecosystem management and biodiversity, diversiﬁ-
cation of on-farm activities, use of weather forecasts
and early warning systems, and methods for managing
risk such as index-based insurance and risk transfer
products (Barnett et al., 2008). In relation to options for
the drylands, the literature is not particularly sanguine.
As many have pointed out, particularly in more mar-
ginal areas, farmers have already been substantially
changing their practices. For example, farmers in north-
ern Burkina Faso have adopted many techniques
intended to increase crop yield and reduce yield vari-
ability (Barbier et al., 2009). The drivers of these shifts
are not climate variability but growing land scarcity
and new market opportunities. While improved water
harvesting and storage techniques may be able to
reduce farmers’ dependence on rainfall, they are not
likely to be sufﬁcient to signiﬁcantly reduce vulnerabil-
ity to drought (Barbier et al., 2009). Institutional change
may be critical in enhancing resilience in dryland pasto-
ral systems. In the Kalahari, land privatization policies
have increased the vulnerability of poorer communal
pastoralists, but increasing access to markets and
improving the ability of these farmers to operate in a
market
economy
could
reduce
their
vulnerability
(Dougill et al., 2010). At the same time, alternatives that
make sense from the perspective of current economic
risk or land scarcity, such as the use of higher yielding
crop varieties or improved animal breeds, may not be
robust choices for dealing with climate change if they
do not outperform local varieties under highly variable
conditions (see, for example, Rodrıguez et al., 2011).
This underpins the importance of crop varieties with
increased tolerance to heat and drought stress for man-
aging future climatic variability (Hellin et al., 2012).
There are several ways in which the stability of
food systems can be strengthened. These include
governments investing in smallholder agricultural pro-
duction, particularly in downstream activities such as

storage, trace, processing and retailing; implementing
and scaling up options that help producers to be more
resilient to climate volatility, such as the now wide-
spread use of smallholder crop insurance schemes in
India and certain other countries; and establishing
safety net programmes for the most vulnerable house-
holds, such as has been implemented successfully in
Ethiopia (Lipper, 2011). Insurance may be an increas-
ingly important way to help smallholders become more
resilient, in view of the impacts of climate change on
yield variance and the resulting demand for effective
risk-reducing measures. Using a microeconomic farm
model, Anton et al. (2012) found that area yield and
weather index insurance are robust policy options
across different scenarios and are generally cheaper
than individual yield insurance. They also found that
ex post indemnity payments can be effective in dealing
with extreme systemic risk situations and are similarly
robust across different scenarios, even with frequent
occurrence of extreme events, although they can be
costly to implement (Anton et al., 2012).
One recurring thread in recent discussions concern-
ing responses to increasing climate variability is the
role of indigenous knowledge. Agro-pastoralists in dry-
land Kenya (and probably in many other places too)
rely on indigenous indicators of rainfall variability and
use them as a framework within which to position and
interpret meteorological forecasts (Rao et al., 2011); at
the same time, few are able to adapt their practices
because of a general lack of adaptive capacity (Sper-
anza et al., 2010). Integrating different types of knowl-
edge
and
bringing
different
stakeholder
groups
together pose signiﬁcant challenges, however, and con-
siderable innovation in participatory action research
will be needed (Ziervogel & Opere, 2010). But there
would seem to be a rich area of research in investigat-
ing the reliability and validity of indigenous knowledge
concerning climate variability, and seeing how it can be
better integrated into formal monitoring systems to
enhance its acceptability, thereby increasing smallhold-
ers’ resilience to climate variability.
For some communities in marginal areas, climate
may decreasingly be the primary concern. Nielsen &
Reenberg (2010) present results from northern Burkina
Faso that indicate that villagers there are ‘beyond cli-
mate’: current livelihood strategies are increasingly
independent of climate. There as elsewhere, people
have engaged in livelihood diversiﬁcation in attempts
to ameliorate the negative impacts of climate variability
on agriculture. At some stage, tipping points are
reached such that transformative adaptation alterna-
tives may be the only viable options that remain. There
are many examples of such changes to livelihood sys-
tems, such as substitution of one crop or livestock spe-
cies for another. In many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, a
highly spatially distributed mode of living is prevalent,
and clearly it can be a highly effective way of dealing
with change and variability. This is intriguingly mir-
rored in developed-country situations also, in Austra-
lian farming households over the last few years that
have seen crippling, multi-year drought followed by
record ﬂooding, for example. Many such households
are developing more spatially distributed modes of
farming and living, whereby multiple priorities and
pressures can be accommodated by moving between
widely distributed farm businesses, employment and
children’s activities (Rickards, 2012). Endurance and
accommodating change may be widely valued, but oth-
ers would challenge this world view and emphasize
innovation and the conscious creation of innovative
alternatives (O’Brien, 2012; Rickards, 2012). Many peo-
ple may have no choice, and chronic or sudden-onset
environmental disasters related to climate change may
force
large-scale
migration;
however,
this
is
not
expected to be common in the next two decades
(Raleigh & Jordan, 2010).
Conclusions: reﬁning the research agenda
Most of the climate change impacts work carried out to
date either ignores or downplays variability. On the
one hand, this is somewhat understandable. Regarding
expected changes in rainfall and temperature variabil-
ity in the future, there is high uncertainty: IPCC (2012)
provides
no
assessment
of
projected
changes
in
extremes at spatial scales smaller than for large regions.
Indeed, the prognosis for robust quantiﬁcation in the
foreseeable future of changes in weather and climate
variability over short temporal and high spatial scales
is rather gloomy (Ramirez-Villegas et al., 2013). But on
the other hand, we already know a reasonable amount
about how current levels of climate variability have
considerable impacts on biological systems and health.
While we cannot let limited predictive capability con-
strain adaptive responses, it does suggest that we will
need to become increasingly creative to arrive at action-
able answers in response to questions from a wide
range of decision makers concerning the appropriate
adaptation of biological and food systems. One exam-
ple of a suitable framework is the combination of
impact and capacity approaches (broadly, top down
and bottom up respectively) to adaptation planning;
there is considerable potential in this and other prob-
lem-orientated approaches for producing robust knowl-
edge and actions in the face of uncertainty (Vermeulen
et al., 2013). This is not without its challenges, however:
recent assessments indicate an increased probability of
future tipping events, in part because of positive feed-

backs in the climate system (e.g. Cory et al., 2013), and
the corresponding impacts are estimated to be large,
making them signiﬁcant risks (Lenton, 2011). Below,
we brieﬂy discuss ﬁve areas that warrant considerable
attention if we are to address these challenges.
First, there are still important knowledge and data
gaps in our understanding of the effects of climate vari-
ability and extreme events on biological systems. With
regard to crops, Craufurd & Wheeler (2009) identiﬁed
several areas, including the need for more information
on crop development and temperature by photoperiod
interactions at the higher end of the temperature scale.
There are key knowledge gaps with regard to the ways
in which climate variability and extreme events may
exacerbate multiple stresses for animals and plants,
and how these stresses may interact and combine.
There are also important knowledge gaps regarding the
impacts of climate variability and extreme events on
the prevalence, incidence and severity of crop and live-
stock diseases, and on key agricultural pests and weeds
and how their prevalence may change.
Second, there are substantial limitations in our
impact models, at all scales. This certainly applies to
models of crops and livestock and on the effects of vari-
ability on the quantity and quality of crop and livestock
production. Identiﬁcation of synergies between global,
regional and local studies is a promising avenue for
improvement (Challinor et al., 2014b). Much work is
needed on extending the applicability of current crop
and livestock models to the higher temperature and
more variable climates projected as increasingly likely
under
higher
greenhouse
gas
emission
scenarios.
Equally importantly, such gaps exist in relation to mod-
els of farming systems and the ways in which biophysi-
cal and socioeconomic drivers of change combine in
particular situations (Challinor et al., 2009), and infor-
mation concerning the way in which climate variability
and climate extremes may affect thresholds and tipping
points among different farm enterprises in relation to
different household objectives is largely missing. Gaps
also exist concerning the appropriate incorporation of
risk and dynamics in farming system models. For
smallholders, higher risks usually imply more costs,
directly or indirectly, and so there is a need to link risk
to decision-making proﬁles of farmers and their atti-
tudes to investments and technology adoption. Some
work has been done on this (see, for example, Willock
et al., 1999; Solano et al., 2000), but more in-depth stud-
ies on this topic are needed, because increasing adop-
tion rates of key practices under risk is a signiﬁcant
challenge, and targeting options to risk management
proﬁles is essential. At the national and global scales,
more sophisticated output is needed from global and
regional economic models concerning welfare gains
and losses arising from different policy action, and how
changes in welfare from gradual climate change and
climate shocks are differentially distributed among dif-
ferent groups in society, such as producers and urban
poor, and men and women (Skouﬁas et al., 2011).
Third, there is a great need to improve the monitor-
ing of local conditions, not only to provide data and
information for improving our understanding and our
models, but also to guide effective adaptation (for
example, through downscaling climate model output to
local situations) and to provide information for yield
early warning systems and locally appropriate indices
for
weather-based
crop
and
livestock
insurance
schemes. The situation for climate and weather data
monitoring in many developing countries is poor and
deteriorating. There is considerable research activity in
combining satellite and land-based information to pro-
duce long-term, high-resolution weather data sets (for
example, Maidment et al., 2013). Such hybrid data sets
have considerable potential to ease the weather data
problem in some countries, but they are not a replace-
ment for land-based weather measurement, however,
and considerable investment will be needed to improve
climate and weather monitoring. Improved monitoring
of local food systems (in relation to food production
and accessibility, for example) and of the environment
(in relation to local crop and rangeland conditions, for
example) is also needed to provide readily actionable
information. The tradition of monitoring and surveil-
lance for disease outbreaks within the health commu-
nity, to allow for better early warning and anticipatory
response in relation to food systems, is a promising
model, although it can be costly.
Fourth, enhancing food security for the 9.5 billion
people projected by 2050, more than 86% of whom will
be living in the less developed countries (UNDESA,
2013), will mean adapting biological and food systems
to the increasingly variable climate and to increasingly
frequent extreme events, which in turn will entail con-
siderably enhanced understanding of the complex sys-
tem of production, logistics, utilization of the produce
and the socioeconomic structure of communities (IPCC,
2012). This strongly supports the notion of viewing
adaptation and vulnerability reduction not as discrete
events but as processes through time, from the shorter
term to the longer term. The impacts of climate variabil-
ity and extreme events are often most acutely experi-
enced at the local level (IPCC, 2012), and they also
usually occur over short time scales. At local and short
temporal scales, the uncertainties associated with their
prediction may be at their largest. Food security, health
and nutritional outcomes are all the product of multiple
interacting stressors, not just climate patterns. This
could be one of the reasons the disaster relief commu-

nity and the agricultural research for development
community have not talked much together – the former
has a ‘variability’ orientation, the latter a ‘changing
means’ orientation. There are exceptions – for example,
the story of weather forecasts for emergency aid provi-
sion in West Africa in 2008 (Tall et al., 2012) – but there
do not seem to be many to date. There are surely syner-
gies to be explored between these two communities of
practice, particularly given rapid developments in the
ﬁeld of seamless prediction of weather and climate
(Brown et al., 2012; Meehl et al., 2013). In time, seamless
prediction may provide a bridge between the shorter
term (days, weeks, season) and the longer term (years,
decades) and between risk management and adaptation
planning. Using models to express uncertainty as the
time intervals in which key changes are expected,
rather than focussing on a particular time and express-
ing uncertainty in other ways, may help forge stronger
links between prediction and adaptation (Vermeulen
et al., 2013). The effectiveness of the links between dif-
ferent spatial and temporal scales will depend on
enhanced understanding, models and monitoring of
the impacts of climate change and climate variability
on both biological and socioeconomic systems and the
ways in which they interact within and across scales.
Enhancing food security in the less developed countries
in the coming decades will need balanced, integrated
approaches that encompass changes in variability and
extreme events as well as changes in means in quantify-
ing impacts on, and identifying appropriate adaptation
of, biological and human systems.
Finally, greater and more effective communication is
needed between scientists and decision makers, and
between natural and social scientists. Currently, climate
information is severely underutilized in supporting
decision-making, which Weaver et al. (2013) partially
attribute to a failure to incorporate learning from the
decision and social sciences into climate-related deci-
sion support. There is a great deal that can be done on
the cogeneration of information and its communication
in appropriate ways, and in engaging meaningfully
with decision makers at local and national policy levels,
for example. Participatory scenario development may
be one useful tool for facilitating some of these pro-
cesses (Vervoort et al., 2014), in addition to much stron-
ger
links
between
biological
and
communications
scientists. In general, the top-down and bottom-up
approaches identiﬁed above rarely meet in the form of
integrated
analyses.
Given
what
is
known
about
vulnerability to climate, what foci should environmen-
tal scientists have? Changes in variability are often
more important for communities than changes in mean
quantities; yet, the focus of modelling studies is often
on the latter. The ongoing focus on quantifying uncer-
tainty in impacts studies is important if we are to avoid
errors; however, these analyses can be targeted more
clearly at adaptation (Challinor et al., 2013; Vermeulen
et al., 2013). Systematic intercomparison of impacts
studies, with coordinated cycles of model improvement
and projection, is useful in reducing uncertainty and
synthesizing knowledge (Challinor et al., 2014b). Obser-
vational data to constrain models at a range of scales
are central to these endeavours.
