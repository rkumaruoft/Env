Abstract
Food production is affected by climate change, and, in turn, food pro-
duction is responsible for 20–30% of greenhouse gases. The food system
must increase output as the population increases and must meet nutrition
and health needs while simultaneously assisting in achieving the Sustain-
able Development Goals. Good nutrition is important for combatting in-
fection, reducing child mortality, and controlling obesity and chronic disease
throughout the life course. Dietary guidelines provide advice for a healthy
diet, and the main principles are now well established and compatible with
sustainable development. Climate change will have a significant effect on
food supply; however,with political commitment and substantial investment,
projected improvements will be sufficient to provide food for the healthy

diets needed to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Some changes will need to be made
to food production, nutrient content will need monitoring, and more equitable distribution is
required to meet the dietary guidelines. Increased breastfeeding rates will improve infant and
adult health while helping to reduce greenhouse gases.
1. INTRODUCTION
This article is the third review on nutrition and climate change in the Annual Review of Public
Health (ARPH), which reflects its importance to global health and extends the discussion of food
for population health and changes brought on by climate change (63, 102). A decade ago, the
Lancet Commission concluded that anthropogenic climate change threatened to undermine the
healthy lives of billions and to undo the past 50 years of gains in public health. An effective re-
sponse to climate change could be the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century (36).
Food production is affected by climate change, which in turn is responsible for 20–30% of green-
house gases (GHGs). The food system must increase output as the population increases and must
meet nutrition and health needs while simultaneously assisting in the achievement of the Sustain-
able Development Goals (SDGs) (15, 99, 136). The climate crisis comes from a rapid increase in
human use of natural resources to satisfy rising standards of living, increased energy use, popula-
tion growth, and dietary shifts toward higher consumption of animal products (45). The effects of
climate change on nutrition and health have been discussed for at least six decades (49, 87). Many
of the causes and outcomes identified decades ago have since worsened, with only limited interna-
tional cooperation emerging to change global trajectory. Substantial increases in the production
of CO2 and other GHGs have resulted in overall global warming during the Anthropocene (1).
While a proportion of the CO2 generated is utilized by plants, excess accumulates in the atmo-
sphere or oceans, the latter being the great CO2 sink. The result is increasing ocean acidification,
altering its ecology (35, 116). Water vapor is also a GHG, levels of which increase by rising tem-
peratures and in turn increase rainfall in some areas, contributing to adverse weather events. If
climate change continues unabated, in a generation 1–3 billion people will be attempting to live
in temperatures experienced now by only small populations in the Sahara (154).
Since the publication of the previous ARPH articles on this subject, world events have illus-
trated the fragility of global initiatives against climate change; efforts to reduce the rate of change
stall as major countries withdraw or do not meet commitments outlined in the Paris Accord (85).
The rate of climate change is increasing: 2015–2019 was the hottest five-year period on record,
resulting from ever-increasing CO2 emissions (152). There has been increased crop damage from
storms, droughts, floods, salination, landslides, and wildfires on all continents. The loss of plants
and animals from these events, together with the concentration of cropping on fewer hectares,
reduces biodiversity (62). These changes will increase climate-related strain on food supplies and
nutrition and health, with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic imposing addi-
tional health and economic burdens.
The aim of this review is to consider the ways in which climate change is altering food supply
and how these changes will relate to dietary guidelines in the future.
1.1. Progress and Challenges in Global Health, Food, and Nutrition
Substantial improvements have been made to health and nutrition in recent decades, even though
a number of the Millennium Development Goals targets were not fully met. The global under-5
child mortality rate decreased from 118/1,000 live births in 1980 to 39/1,000 in 2018. In West and
Central Africa, the corresponding values were 217/1,000 down to 97/1,000. Changes in China

are even more dramatic; infant mortality declined from an estimated 300/1,000 (in 1941) to 7
per 1,000 (in 2018), demonstrating concerted efforts to improve nutrition and health (139). The
global prevalence of underweight due to insufficient energy intake has been reduced by nearly
50% since 1990, driven largely by increased yields of the major crops, including wheat, rice, and
maize (53). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has estimated that, since
1961, per capita availability of food has increased by one-third (96). This increase has required
greater use of nitrogen fertilizers (up by 800%) and water resources for irrigation (by at least
double). Despite the improvements in the proportion of the population suffering from nutrition
problems, in absolute numbers an estimated 821 million people are currently undernourished,
150 million children under five are stunted, and 613 million women aged 15–49 suffer from iron
deficiency (96). The world is still faced with the tragedy of nearly 5 million child deaths annually.
Micronutrient deficiencies affect an estimated 2 billion people worldwide, which could increase
in the coming decades as food diversity decreases (133). Improvements in food supply resulted in
a shift to the right of the distribution curve of food consumption, decreasing undernutrition. An
unwanted side effect was an increase in the global prevalence of overweight and obesity.
Climate change and malnutrition in all its forms, including obesity and undernutrition, consti-
tute two of the greatest threats to planetary and human health (44). Risks to human health include
increases in infectious diseases, heat-related chronic disease, allergies, and injuries and stress from
adverse weather events (30, 63, 79, 144). Pollution occurring concurrently with climate change
may affect health (98). The exact impacts will vary with location and national wealth, but most
impact will still fall on children and poorer populations. Children should be the focus of climate
change discussion and implementation of the SDGs (34, 157). This approach is consistent with
the legal obligations to which most countries have committed by their ratification of the Conven-
tion of the Rights of the Child, which includes obligations to protect children’s right to a healthy
food environment (140).
The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study provides a comprehensive description of the im-
pact of suboptimal diets on chronic disease morbidity and mortality, around 60% of the risk of
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and demonstrates the need for improving nutrition in all
regions and at all levels of development to control disease burden (2, 61, 127). Despite the decrease
in world poverty levels and increase in world food production, both in absolute terms and in per
capita availability, dietary inequalities persist, a condition all countries have committed to ending
by 2030 in accord with the SDGs. Overall food energy supply by region, with inequities between
rich and poor populations, is illustrated in Figure 1 (54).
While food production has increased, a large amount of food is wasted, estimated at 35%
(11). Food waste is often underestimated and has a double or even triple effect, as energy is re-
quired for production, by humans in agriculture labor, and in food preparation, all contributing
to GHGs (143). Wastage occurs at many stages of food production, including mechanical damage
and spillage during harvest, sorting, handling, storage, transportation, processing, retailing, and
home use (14, 58). Wastage at final consumption varies, depending on economic level; for fruit and
vegetables, it is estimated to be 2–5% in Africa, Asia, and Latin America compared with 12–17%
in Europe, North America, Oceania, and industrialized parts of Asia (51, 55).
1.2. Food Security and the United Nations Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs)
The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) lists four dimensions of food security (50):
■Sufficient food is available.
■Everyone has access to it.

■The food supply is well utilized.
■All three of these dimensions are stable over time.
Sustainable diets are defined as being “protective and respectful of biodiversity and ecosystems,
culturally acceptable, accessible, economically fair and affordable; nutritionally adequate, safe and
healthy; while optimizing natural and human resources” (82, p. 641; 113). To the economist, that
real prices of agricultural products have been trending downward for the past 50 years suggests
that food production is sufficient, but the prevalence of undernutrition, overnutrition (obesity),
and micronutrient deficiency shows that distribution is inequitable. The global food system faces
an ambitious challenge in meeting nutritional needs for all, while reducing GHGs. Goal 2 of the
SDGs emphasizes nutrition, “End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and pro-
mote sustainable agriculture,” but the majority of the SDGs affect food production and nutrition
in some way (19). This is illustrated in Figure 2, using as its basis the UNICEF framework on
nutrition, its antecedents, and outcomes.
1.3. Population Trends Affecting Food Requirements and Production
Additional changes in human ecology are occurring in parallel with climate change. The world
population growth rate has slowed to 1.1%, but the population is still increasing by 83 million
annually. The globe is becoming more urbanized, and vast numbers of migrants and refugees
are changing population structures and water, food, employment, and housing requirements. The
United National Development Program (UNDP) has summarized population trends that will
affect the production of, and requirements for, food (142). The world’s population has grown
from 2.6 billion in 1950 to 7.7 billion in 2019 and will reach 8.5 billion in 2030 and 9.7 billion
in 2050. By 2050, the world will have 9 billion people, and providing them with enough food,
despite climate change and environmental pressures, will be the greatest challenge of the twenty-
first century (40). The population will continue to age (>60 years) from 901 million in 2015 to
1.4 billion in 2030 and will continue to urbanize, with cities (>1 million) increasing from 23%
of the world’s population to 28% in 2030. The rural population will decline from 45% to 40%,
decreasing the workforce for food production (137, 141). While the population of Sub-Saharan
Africa will double by 2050, many higher-income countries (HICs) will continue to have declining

climate change (28, 34, 131).
2. IMPACT OF CHANGES IN CLIMATE ON FOOD PRODUCTION
AND SUPPLY
2.1. Changes to Global Food Supply
In a series of reports over the past 15 years, the IPCC has provided scientific evidence of the effect
of climate change on global food supplies (2, 50–55, 57, 59–71).
■Hotter climates will shift production toward the poles and will also cause faster plant growth
and ripening and decrease nutrient density.
■Areas of dry land will increase, while some regions will have increased rainfall (80). The
amount of arable land in use is almost at a maximum. Increasing environmental degrada-
tion, desertification, soil depletion, overgrazing, rising sea levels, urban development, roads,

and industrial use may reduce land further. Saltwater encroachment will affect some partic-
ularly low-lying, but highly productive rice-growing areas of Asia. As a result, agricultural
productivity will have to increase.
■Adverse weather events including storms,hurricanes,droughts,flooding,landslides,and ero-
sion will increase in frequency and severity, which will damage crops and disrupt harvesting,
transportation, and storage.
■Transport will be disrupted owing to adverse weather events, increased fuel costs, conflict,
and political issues.
■Spoilage and bacterial damage, including Listeria, Salmonella, and mycotoxin contamina-
tion, increase with rising temperatures and increased numbers of extreme heat days (100).
Mitigating this damage will require improved agricultural practices and better processing,
packaging, and storage.
■Agricultural yields depend on crop protection measures.The main purpose of pesticide use is
to increase food security by controlling pests and weeds, and these will increase with climate
change. The increased number of insects, including locust plagues, will cause crop damage,
decrease crop yield, and result in greater costs with increased chemical residues (43, 153).
Pesticide use will increase, and higher temperatures and adverse weather may cause faster
dissipation (41).
■Contaminants may enter food at several stages of agriculture, processing, packaging, trans-
port, or storage. New toxic residues (emerging contaminants) in food are increasing as a con-
sequence of changes in industrial processes, intensifying agricultural practices, environmen-
tal pollution, and climate change (57). Chemical contaminants have become a food safety
concern, owing to pesticide residues and environmental contaminants (74).
■Climate change will have a serious negative impact on crop productivity as the level of warm-
ing progresses (80).Productivity of both commercial crops (maize,rice,and wheat) and crops
such as millet and sorghum will be affected. Impacts will vary depending on CO2 concen-
trations, fertility levels, and region (80). A meta-analysis shows that adoption of improved
farming practices and technologies such as improved varieties, planting at optimal times,
and improved water and fertilizer management has the potential to reduce the negative im-
pact on crop yield (3). With this scenario, climate change may not add significantly to the
challenge of food production for the majority of countries except for some potential hot
spots around the world. However, massive investment, policy, and institutional support will
be required to facilitate adoption and scaling-out of such practices and to address climatic
variability (3).
■Food variety will decrease, as measured by the “food diversity index” (47). Diverse food sys-
tems are more resilient in enhancing food security in the face of climate change. They are
important for nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, control of soil erosion, reduction of
GHG emissions, and control of hydrological processes (97). For human nutrition, food di-
versity is important, especially for children, because it increases the likelihood of meeting
nutritional needs, including intakes of phytochemicals, and decreases the impact of contam-
inants and toxicants (83, 123).
■Potable water supplies will decline owing to decreased rainfall, salinization, pollution, in-
creasing population, and industrial use. This decline will affect water-intensive production
systems, and dairying will be the most affected (67, 73). Decreases in milk production will
reduce the availability of an important source of calcium and high-quality protein. At the
same time, osteoporosis will become more prevalent in aging populations, which may re-
quire additional interventions. Decreases in the dairy herd may have a public health benefit
238

by reducing the production and use of infant formula. More irrigation is a strategy to in-
crease food production, but the lack of water will limit its expansion (38).
■The global food system contributes 25% of GHG emissions, with the largest source being
livestock production. The food and agriculture industries project that an increase in demand
for meat is likely to undermine efforts to keep global average warming below a 2°C target
(114). How GHGs are accounted for may differ in the country of production compared with
the country of consumption. For example, the GHG production of Hong Kong is underes-
timated as imports of meat are ignored. GHG emissions hidden in meat and dairy products,
which are all imported into Hong Kong, demonstrate that consumption is about 59% higher
than the city’s total GHG emissions using conventional production-based calculations (155).
■Nuts have important benefits for nutrition, but yields will decrease with climate change (4).
2.2. Oceans, Fish, and Seafood
Fish and seafood, containing protein, a high level of omega-3 fatty acids in fatty fish, and mi-
cronutrients, are important components of a healthy diet (148). Fish provide at least 15% of the
daily average intake of animal protein for 4.5 billion people, and in 2010 it provided more pro-
tein than cattle and poultry combined (13). For some populations in West Africa, island states,
and coastal Asia, fish consumption is over 50% of the total animal protein consumed; small fish,
eaten whole, are also an important source of many micronutrients (76). As ocean health changes,
sustainable production will decrease, requiring more effort to reduce pollution (42). The world’s
oceans are changing because of increasing acidification (dissolved CO2), increased fishing, miner-
als and petroleum extraction, and increasing use for aquaculture (35, 106). Ocean acidification has
the greatest effect on calcifying organisms, including mollusks, corals, and plankton (25), which
affects species higher up the food chain. Acidification can affect the growth and life span of some
fish, such as sea bream, and can reduce plankton size, which decreases the growth of species such
as anchovy and sardines (6, 31).
Catching and consuming fish are generally localized activities. Nine of the top 15 countries for
marine capture are in the Asia-Pacific region, accounting for 87% of the global catch (52, 78). The
EAT-Lancet Commission on healthy diets recommended 28 g per day of fatty fish for the protective
effect of omega-3, but only the East Asia-Pacific region currently achieves this goal. The 2010
dietary guidelines for Americans encourage individuals to double their intake of fish (94), which
would require a doubling of the current production to meet these recommendations (148). The
oceans cannot supply these recommended levels of fish; the maximum sustainable catch has already
been exceeded, with 30% of ocean wild fish stocks overfished and 60% fully fished (52). Wild fish
stocks face compounding pressures from pollution, loss of habitat from coastal developments, and
increased eutrophication. Increasing sea temperatures will result in the migration of stocks toward
the poles (59). Aquaculture is the only method available to increase fish production, and currently
two-thirds of production comes from Asia (excluding China). Changes to fish feeding methods
and growth patterns may alter nutritional content, with reduced lipids, vitamin D, omega-3 fatty
acids, and proteins (59, 81, 103, 134, 148). These changes will need monitoring and research to
reduce the environmental impacts of mariculture (52).
2.3. Interactions Between Climate and Food Production
The global food production system is influenced by climate change, while the system itself
in turn influences GHGs (see Figure 3). As production increases, land use will intensify and
biodiversity will be lost, as fewer cultivars are used to increase yields. Land and sea pollution will
increase, particularly in lower-income countries (LICs), where the majority of farmers have small

holdings and will find it difficult to invest in technological solutions (68, 126). Some proposed
climate mitigation strategies could have adverse side effects on food production; for example,
using land for afforestation may reduce the land available for food production (65). The opposite
effect may occur in some countries, with forests being destroyed to increase agricultural land.
Another important issue for nutrition is a decrease in micronutrient density, as yield increases
require improved monitoring and efforts to increase the nutrient content in food crops (90).
Dietary choices affect food production, which in turn has an effect on the environment. Dietary
guidelines recommend eating fewer animal products. If this guidance is followed, the decrease in
production will lessen GHG emissions (115). Some of the interactions between climate change,
dietary guidelines, and food production are shown in Figure 3.
3. BRINGING TOGETHER CLIMATE CHANGE, FOOD, AND HEALTH
3.1. A Diet That Is Good for the People and the Planet
Recommendations for healthy eating go back millennia to Hippocrates and earlier. Scientific nu-
trition recommendations began with the era of analytical chemistry in the nineteenth century,
which led to the measurement of protein and subsequently energy, vitamins, and micronutrients.
Recommendations were initially made for nutrient deficiencies in vitamin C and thiamin, fol-
lowed by additional micronutrients, including iron and iodine (101, 121). Beginning in the 1950s,
the infectious disease burden of undernutrition was documented,and,more recently,the burden of
chronic disease, including obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, has come to the fore. Other
important areas include the effect of early-life nutrition (the first 1,000 days and developmental
origins of health and disease hypothesis) and the maintenance of a healthy human microbiome for
good health (10, 122, 138). The promotion of sustainable, resilient food systems for healthy diets
is the first principle for action during the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition (86).
3.2. Food-Based Dietary Guidelines
Most food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG) are based on the following principles: address signifi-
cant public health issues, both acute and chronic; be food-based to allow for easier translation into
240
Binns et al.
Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org.  Guest (guest) IP:  142.189.146.117 On: Mon, 26 Aug 2024 21:30:45
practical dietary advice; achieve required nutrients; maintain healthy growth and body weight; and
optimize whole of life health. In addition, guidelines should meet the SDGs and reduce GHGs
(22). A review of food-based dietary guidelines from 34 European countries and their sustain-
ability credentials concluded that shifting from current Western diets to more sustainable dietary
patterns produces benefits. Consuming more plant-based foods (e.g., vegetables, fruit, legumes,
seeds, nuts, whole grains) and fewer animal-based foods (especially red meat), snack foods, and
beverages would improve health and have environmental benefits (12). Recent regional dietary
guidelines recommend similar changes and usually include physical activity, healthy body weight,
breastfeeding, clean water, safe food, less sugar and salt, decreases in saturated fats, and elimi-
nation of trans fats (22). Another example of regional recommendations is the Nordic Nutrition
Guidelines, which would produce health benefits such as a reduction in cardiovascular disease and
cancer and would lessen environmental stress (117). In Table 1, the general recommendations in
dietary guidelines are shown for the major food groups, current production levels, and suggested
changes to implement by 2030.
3.3. Dietary Guidelines and Changes Needed to Ensure Sustainable
Food Production
In a summary of 12 major reviews of DGs and climate change, all the diets optimized for sustain-
ability and nutrition were more plant based, with reductions in meat, particularly ruminant meats
(beef and lamb). Six studies recommended increased fish intake, while the majority suggested
fewer dairy products. Other foods to be reduced included sweet foods (biscuits, cakes, desserts),
savory snacks, white bread, and both alcoholic beverages and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs).
These findings are similar to those in 7 out of 8 recent review articles on the sustainability of diets
(150). Examining the 14 discrete environmental areas of concern identified in the SDGs, most
studies are on GHG emissions and, to a lesser extent, land and water use. In the case of GHG
emissions, changes in land use and soil carbon stocks were seldom considered, which represents a
disconnect between science informing strategic climate action in the agricultural sector and sci-
ence informing public health nutrition. In the case of land and water use, few studies used metrics
that are appropriate in a life-cycle context. The evidence available shows that recommended diets
have lower environmental impacts than do typical diets (112). A consistent scientific approach to
estimating the impact of climate on diet and vice versa is required (68, 71, 72).
Many national DGs already include recommendations related to changes that would improve
health and would be beneficial to the environment and sustainability. For example, Argentina
Australia, China, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States
suggest increasing consumption of whole plant foods, vegetables, fruits, legumes, and fewer animal
foods (7,29,32,48,66,95).Canada is representative of a number of countries who also recommend
reducing SSBs and eliminating trans fats (8).
3.4. Special Population Groups
The special needs of some population groups, including infants, children, pregnant women, and
the elderly, should be considered in planning responses to climate changes and healthy eating. In
many countries, complementary diets given to infants after the age of six months are high volume
and often low nutrient density, limiting nutrient intake (e.g., iron) (18). While nutrient density is
important in infants and young children, a diet high in fiber becomes more important in adults
for the prevention of chronic disease.
Children are the population segment most susceptible to the effects of climate change, bearing
an estimated 88% of the increased burden of disease (108, 110, 128). Food security for infants

and young children is not possible without promoting and achieving high rates of breastfeeding.
Despite endorsements by all international professional organizations, the World Health Organi-
zation (WHO), and governments, breastfeeding targets have never been achieved on a global scale
(118). The health benefits of breastfeeding, both during infancy and throughout life, including

the preservation of a healthy microbiome, have been extensively studied and will provide some
protection against the effects of climate change (16, 17, 149). Even in disaster situations, including
famine, breastfeeding remains the best option for meeting infants’ nutritional needs (23). The
alternative to breastfeeding is infant formula, which is usually based on cow’s milk. While milk
production in the twenty-first century is more efficient than in the past, the total impact is greater
owing to increased production (27). When compared with breastmilk, milk production uses large
amounts of water, which will be in scarce supply with climate change, and has a high carbon
footprint (124, 130).
Vietnam is an example of a low- to middle-income country (LMIC) that will experience wa-
ter stress owing to climate change affecting the Mekong system; at the same time, Vietnam’s milk
production has increased by 12% per annum over the past decade (146). In LMICs, infant formula
is increasingly advertised on the Internet, which is accessible almost everywhere by smartphone
and is driving increased consumption and decreased breastfeeding. In recent years (2006–2011),
imports of infant formula to Vietnam have increased by 150%, and the response of the local indus-
try, with government support, is to boost the formula and dairy industries (125). Breastmilk is the
ideal food for infants, with benefits that last into adulthood, which is important for achieving the
SDGs; however, the global infant formula and dairy industries are formidable opponents (19, 21,
88, 124). Extensive promotion of breastfeeding would provide benefits for infant health, reduce
health costs, and benefit the environment (46). The increase in adverse weather events along with
rising population densities and uncontrolled distribution of infant formula heightens the risk to
breastfeeding in disaster situations (i.e., the possibility of breastfeeding being discontinued) (23).
The elderly are vulnerable to increasing temperatures and require extra fluids and access to nu-
tritious diets. They often move to urban environments away from traditional foods and extended
family support. For them, food traditions are deeply engrained in culture and change is not easy.
Traditional foods may no longer be available owing to agriculture shifts because of climate change,
and meeting their nutrient needs is often compounded by dentition and mobility problems. Spe-
cific nutrients at risk include vitamin D, B12, iron, and protein (105). In a Swedish study, the diets
of the elderly were found to be more GHG intensive (129).
4. IMPLEMENTING CHANGE: WHAT WILL BE NEEDED?
Future objectives for the food and nutrition sector will be to improve the quality of the food supply
for everyone (food and health for all) while navigating the changes expected in food production
over the next several decades. Nutrient deficiencies may increase in LICs and recur in HICs, as
food diversity decreases and changes in nutrient content occur. The changes in crops and farmed
seafood (aquaculture) will require monitoring of nutrient composition and bioavailability, phyto-
chemicals, and dietary content. The predominant guiding philosophy of public health nutrition
has been to meet all nutrient needs through eating a variety of healthy foods. This approach may
no longer be possible and may have to be met by fortification and supplements.
Micronutrient deficiencies, particularly iron, zinc, and vitamins, are of great importance (39).
Issues around interventions are complex because it is difficult to ensure adequate amounts without
a risk of toxicity (84). Biofortification with iron and vitamin A has proved challenging in deliver-
ing consistently safe doses while minimizing side effects, including infections (24). The preferred
option is always to eat a varied diet of nutrient-dense foods.
With improved food production in recent decades, the distribution of food consumption has
shifted to the right. Too little food, the left of the curve, results in undernutrition with a substantial
burden of morbidity and mortality, whereas at the opposite end of the spectrum obesity and its
sequelae cause major health problems for the two billion adults who are now overweight or obese.

India is an example of an LMIC that succeeded in shifting the food distribution curve to the
right, with less undernutrition but more obesity (5, 156). Reduction of both undernutrition and
overconsumption (obesity) simultaneously implies a compression of the food consumption curve
by balancing increased physical activity with energy intake. This approach requires improvements
in food and nutrition equity within and between countries (18, 109, 145). Swinburn et al. (132)
describe an international pandemic of obesity, undernutrition, and climate change causing major
health problems for humanity as a “syndemic.” The obesity epidemic is also affecting infants and
young children, owing at least in part to declines in breastfeeding, increased use of infant formula
and SSBs, and disruption of the microbiome (60, 120) (see Figure 3).
Consumption of food groups such as fruits, berries, nuts, and unsaturated oils should be in-
creased. However, these groups are projected to decrease, and research is required to increase
yields. Ensuring potable water for all (for drinking, food preparation, cleaning, washing) rather
than using it for increased irrigation and other projects will be difficult. The inevitable decrease
in meat supplies (and other animal foods) will cause tension as decisions are made either to dis-
tribute meat more evenly around the world to meet iron and protein deficits or to supply steaks
and hamburgers to wealthy countries. Additional promotion is needed for breastfeeding and for
the reduction of wastage, food contamination (chemical and microbiological), and spoilage. Better
packaging and storage are needed to achieve these aims.
Meeting future food needs (up to 50% more by 2050) is possible and can result in healthier
diets (91). However, improved diets will not just happen from changes made to food production
to moderate climate change. Health promotion will be needed to actively drive changes in eating
practices (75). The strengthening of health promotion and public health programs, aimed at pre-
venting overweight and obesity and treating chronic disease with nutrition interventions, will be
an effective climate change adaptation strategy (127).
Some nutritional needs will be met with fortification or supplementation (e.g., sprinkles) rather
than through an increased variety of foods (37, 111). Aquaculture and mariculture of fish with
monitoring for nutrient content and improved food stocks will be needed. Nutrient content in
and technological modification of cultivars will need ongoing monitoring to maintain and im-
prove nutritional quality. Toxicants may be produced by plants in response to climate change and
must be monitored. Research is needed for improving the production of fruits, nuts, berries, etc.
With the loss of biodiversity, nutritional deficiencies may emerge, and it may be many decades be-
fore all nutrient functions are discovered. Potential interactions with the use of supplements and
fortification should be monitored. Continuing research into the promotion of dietary guidelines
and better food storage, packaging, and preservation is required. There may be a loss of cultural
and culinary traditions. While change has always been a part of human society, the impact of the
relatively rapidly changing climate is unknown.
Generally, the dietary guidelines that already exist are more environmentally friendly than are
existing food consumption patterns, and, if applied uniformly, they will improve health and enable
the SDGs to be met. A carefully selected diet that meets environmental needs can meet all nutrient
requirements (9). Overcoming the barriers will depend on health promotion and motivation to
change, equity in food distribution, and international collaboration to meet the threat to human
life as we know it. Actions needed to improve and apply dietary guidelines in the climate change
era are as follows:
1. Global commitment to international collaboration on environmental action and to carbon-
neutral economies;
2. Education on nutrition and health;
3. Improved monitoring of food production and safety and nutrient content;
244
Binns et al.
Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org.  Guest (guest) IP:  142.189.146.117 On: Mon, 26 Aug 2024 21:30:45
4. Control on the reckless promotion of unhealthy foods by industry (and by governments,
e.g., the US government pressuring countries to accept infant formula);
5. Elimination of government subsidies for the production of unhealthy foods and foods that
are detrimental to the environment;
6. Increases in the production of fruit, nuts, and vegetables (how do we do this when forests
and orchards are disappearing?);
7. Reductions in the use of discretionary foods that are generally high in sugar, fat, or salt;
8. Taxes on sugar, salt, and saturated and trans fats, with incentives for nuts, etc. (107);
9. Breastfeeding promotion, control on infant formula sales, and implementation of WHO
code (107, 147);
10. Improved distribution of food across countries at all levels of development along with a
reduction in food wastage (104); and
11. More research on implementing change, including on determining how to get wealthy na-
tions to reduce excessive intakes of environmentally costly foods.
We recommend that research focuses on the following three considerations. First, nudge theory
may produce gradual change over time (20). Because healthy diets alone may not produce substan-
tial reductions in GHG emissions, DGs need to emphasize recommendations for environmental
sustainability. Minimizing the shift from current foods is likely to make changes more achiev-
able (77). Second, changing populations’ ambitions is a concern; when a country becomes richer,
its population adopts Western diets. Why does this happen when Western diets are less healthy
and have environmental and social disadvantages? Third, why are fat chubby babies perceived as
healthy and desirable in Asia (33, 93)?
4.1. Threats to Progress
A range of responses to the simultaneous climate and COVID-19 crises are possible. Governments
may seek rapid recovery from the COVID-induced economic crisis and use cheap fossil fuels to
pursue economic growth regardless of the environmental costs. An optimistic scenario would see
governments working together with low-carbon technologies to reduce GHGs while reducing
poverty and inequality (135).
4.2. Food Equity
In nutrition, equity implies enough food to grow and develop optimally and to avoid deficiencies,
stunting, obesity, infectious diseases, and excess chronic disease. It will never mean that everyone
will eat exactly the same food prepared in the same way—a monotonous uniformity that ignores
millennia of culinary traditions. It also means adequate amounts of potable water for drinking,
food preparation, and washing.
4.3. Pandemics
Public health workers have been dreading another influenza pandemic. But the risk of other
epidemic infectious diseases (EIDs), including newly emerging diseases, is ever present. Few
recent epidemics have the global significance of COVID-19. Around 70% of EIDs, and almost
all recent pandemics, have originated in animals (the majority in wildlife), and their emergence
stems from complex interactions among wild and/or domestic animals and humans (45). The
COVID-19 epidemic is imposing strains on the world food supply chain, including labor
shortages, transport constraints, and the closure of food processing plants (151). People who
live in areas of food crises have higher rates of malnutrition (acute, chronic, and micronutrient

deficiencies), weakened immune systems, and increased rates of chronic disease. If they contract
COVID-19, the consequences will be more severe. Increased illness and death will create further
food shortages owing to labor shortages, which will exacerbate the effects of climate change on
food production. Individuals with obesity and noncommunicable diseases have an increased risk
of a more severe course of COVID-19 infection, which should give more impetus to governments
to tackle and prevent obesity and related noncommunicable diseases (119).
4.4. Conflict
Shortages of water and/or food have historically been major sources of conflict, and these conflicts
continue to this day (92). Conflict or other security issues were the main cause of food crises in
2019, but weather extremes and economic shocks became increasingly significant compared with
2018. Most of the countries with food insecurity have limited resources to deal with epidemics or
severe adverse weather events. The Global Report on Food Crises documents that during 2019
135 million people were classified as acutely food-insecure (up by 12% from the previous year)
(70). Food insecurity along with water shortages, poor sanitation facilities, and lack of access to
quality health care have contributed to declines in child nutrition. Most instances of severe food
and water shortages in Africa are often related to conflict (64, 70). A long-term association has
been demonstrated between food crises and conflict (26). Rapid increases in food prices in urban
areas can result in social and political unrest and, at a regional level, can be a trigger for conflict.
Changes in climatic conditions, including long-term climate changes, increase the risk of violence
and conflict (26).
4.5. Political Inertia and Short-Term Planning
Both climate change and the emergence of overweight and obesity are slowly evolving issues, and
humans have difficulty in appreciating the need for urgent action in these situations (69). Too
much time has already been lost, and this effort needs to begin now and to be integrated across all
disciplines (68, 72, 132). As consumers become richer, they tend to purchase more varied, higher
priced, and highly processed foods, or they eat out (72). The rich pay higher prices per nutrient
and outbid poorer countries for foods that provide essential nutrients, such as iron from meat.
Food prices, especially of nutritious foods, may increase as a consequence of reduced productivity,
putting further strains on low-income households (56). Policies aimed at reducing poverty and in-
come inequality, while enhancing employment and income-generating activities, are key to raising
people’s incomes and ensuring the affordability of healthy diets.
4.6. Multinational Businesses and Climate Change
The agriculture, transport, food processing, retail, and marketing sectors need to orient their goals
toward improving health and the environment by producing and advertising foods that meet the
SDGs while consuming less energy. There is an increasing need for responsible corporate policy
and investment to contribute toward improving the environment (89). Can the corporate world
change its ways? Can they be encouraged to produce foods that minimize climate impact, are
environmentally friendly, and are health oriented?
5. CONCLUSION
Substantial progress has been made in improving global nutrition. Obesity and chronic disease
now represent new global challenges, even while undernutrition persists in some populations.

Reducing and even reversing anthropogenic climate change have so far proved extremely difficult
or impossible.GHGs,which are environmentally detrimental,are still increasing,driven by higher
standards of living in modern consumer societies. Getting people to change individual habits and
cultures and to share with other nations who are less well-off has not proved possible to date.
Many studies have shown how following dietary guidelines could improve overall health and
reduce obesity and chronic disease if food production, processing, distribution, and consump-
tion follow this advice. Research has offered consistent predictions on how food production will
change in the future and how these changes could be compatible with healthy diets. As the climate
changes, improved technology will be needed to maintain food supplies and ensure that all nutri-
tion requirements are met. If food variety declines, additional research will be needed to improve
micronutrient content to meet nutritional needs.
Some foods that should be made more accessible and are associated with improved health, such
as whole grain cereals, fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, berries, and olive oil, have low environ-
mental impacts. Red meat and dairy products have the largest negative environmental impacts and
are generally associated with a higher disease risk. Increases in supplies of fish are needed, while
ensuring that their nutritional quality is maintained. Increasing breastfeeding rates is important
and achievable for improving health and reducing the environmental impact of alternatives. Di-
etary transitions toward greater consumption of healthier foods would improve environmental
sustainability and health. However, considerable change in the food industry and consumer be-
havior will be required,as,so far,no country has successfully reversed the obesity epidemic because
the systemic and institutional drivers of obesity remain largely unabated.
The evidence, to date, demonstrates that major advances in sustainable food production and
availability can be achieved if all the political efforts and science can be mobilized to apply im-
proved technologies.
SUMMARY POINTS
1. Nutrition improved in the last few decades, but undernutrition is still prevalent in some
regions while obesity is increasing in others.
2. Climate change will affect health and will substantially change food production. For the
medium term, it will be possible to produce enough food to maintain adequate intakes,
using improved farming practices and technology and more equity in distribution.
3. Following dietary guidelines would improve health, help reduce GHGs, and meet the
SDGs.
4. Monitoring of nutrients in food will be essential.
5. Increasing breastfeeding has benefits for health and the environment.
6. The combination of climate change and improvements in the quality of nutrition is the
major public health challenge of this decade and, indeed, this century.
FUTURE ISSUES
1. Ongoing monitoring of and research on food supply (quantity and quality) and nutrient
content are required.
2. Monitor and promote breastfeeding and the marketing of artificial substitutes.

4. Continuing efforts should focus on understanding ways of encouraging populations to
follow DGs. Monitor the DGs in the light of climate and health changes.
