Abstract 
Improved knowledge of glacial-to-interglacial global temperature change yields Charney (fast-feedback) equilibrium climate sensi­
tivity 1.2 ± 0.3C (2r) per W/m2, which is 4.8C ± 1.2C for doubled CO2. Consistent analysis of temperature over the full Cenozoic 
era—including ‘slow’ feedbacks by ice sheets and trace gases—supports this sensitivity and implies that CO2 was 300–350 ppm in the 
Pliocene and about 450 ppm at transition to a nearly ice-free planet, exposing unrealistic lethargy of ice sheet models. Equilibrium 
global warming for today’s GHG amount is 10C, which is reduced to 8C by today’s human-made aerosols. Equilibrium warming is 
not ‘committed’ warming; rapid phaseout of GHG emissions would prevent most equilibrium warming from occurring. However, de­
cline of aerosol emissions since 2010 should increase the 1970–2010 global warming rate of 0.18C per decade to a post-2010 rate of at 
least 0.27C per decade. Thus, under the present geopolitical approach to GHG emissions, global warming will exceed 1.5C in the 
2020s and 2C before 2050. Impacts on people and nature will accelerate as global warming increases hydrologic (weather) extremes. 
The enormity of consequences demands a return to Holocene-level global temperature. Required actions include: (1) a global increas­
ing price on GHG emissions accompanied by development of abundant, affordable, dispatchable clean energy, (2) East-West coopera­
tion in a way that accommodates developing world needs, and (3) intervention with Earth’s radiation imbalance to phase down 
today’s massive human-made ‘geo-transformation’ of Earth’s climate. Current political crises present an opportunity for reset, espe­
cially if young people can grasp their situation.

Background information and structure 
of paper
It has been known since the 1800s that infrared-absorbing 
(greenhouse) gases (GHGs) warm Earth’s surface and that the 
abundance of GHGs changes naturally as well as from human 
actions [1, 2].1 Roger Revelle wrote in 1965 that we are conducting 
a ‘vast geophysical experiment’ by burning fossil fuels that accu­
mulated in Earth’s crust over hundreds of millions of years [3] 
Carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air is now increasing and already has 
reached levels that have not existed for millions of years, with 
consequences that have yet to be determined. Jule Charney led a 
study in 1979 by the United States National Academy of Sciences 
that concluded that doubling of atmospheric CO2 was likely to 
cause global warming of 3 ± 1.5C [4]. Charney added: ‘However, 
we believe it is quite possible that the capacity of the 
intermediate waters of the ocean to absorb heat could delay the 
estimated warming by several decades.’
After U.S. President Jimmy Carter signed the 1980 Energy 
Security Act, which included a focus on unconventional fossil 
fuels such as coal gasification and rock fracturing (‘fracking’) to 
extract shale oil and tight gas, the U.S. Congress asked the 
National Academy of Sciences again to assess potential climate 
effects. Their massive Changing Climate report had a measured 
tone on energy policy—amounting to a call for research [5]. Was 
not enough known to caution lawmakers against taxpayer sub­
sidy of the most carbon-intensive fossil fuels? Perhaps the equa­
nimity was due in part to a major error: the report assumed that 
the delay of global warming caused by the ocean’s thermal iner­
tia is 15 years, independent of climate sensitivity. With that as­
sumption, they concluded that climate sensitivity for 2  CO2 is 
near or below the low end of Charney’s 1.5–4.5C range. If climate

sensitivity was low and the lag between emissions and climate 
response was only 15 years, climate change would not be nearly 
the threat that it is.
Simultaneous with preparation of Changing Climate, climate 
sensitivity was addressed at the 1982 Ewing Symposium at the 
Lamont 
Doherty 
Geophysical 
Observatory 
of 
Columbia 
University on 25–27 October, with papers published in January 
1984 as a monograph of the American Geophysical Union [6]. 
Paleoclimate data and global climate modeling together led to an 
inference that climate sensitivity is in the range 2.5–5C for 2 
CO2 and that climate response time to a forcing is of the order of 
a century, not 15 years [7]. Thus, the concept that a large amount 
of additional human-made warming is already ‘in the pipeline’ 
was introduced. E.E. David, Jr, President of Exxon Research and 
Engineering, in his keynote talk at the symposium insightfully 
noted [8]: ‘The critical problem is that the environmental impacts 
of the CO2 buildup may be so long delayed. A look at the theory 
of feedback systems shows that where there is such a long delay, 
the system breaks down, unless there is anticipation built into 
the loop.’
Thus, the danger caused by climate’s delayed response and 
the need for anticipatory action to alter the course of fossil fuel 
development was apparent to scientists and the fossil fuel indus­
try 40 years ago.2 Yet industry chose to long deny the need to 
change energy course [9], and now, while governments and fi­
nancial interests connive, most industry adopts a ‘greenwash’ 
approach that threatens to lock in perilous consequences for hu­
manity. Scientists will share responsibility if we allow govern­
ments to rely on goals for future global GHG levels, as if targets 
had meaning in the absence of policies required to achieve them.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was 
established in 1988 to provide scientific assessments on the state 
of knowledge about climate change [10] and almost all nations 
agreed to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change [11] with the objective to avert ‘dangerous an­
thropogenic interference with the climate system’. The current 
IPCC Working Group 1 report [12] provides a best estimate of 3C 
for equilibrium global climate sensitivity to 2  CO2 and 
describes shutdown of the overturning ocean circulations and 
large sea level rise on the century time scale as ‘high impact, low 
probability’ even under extreme GHG growth scenarios. This con­
trasts with ‘high impact, high probability’ assessments reached 
in a paper [13]—hereafter abbreviated Ice Melt—that several of 
us published in 2016. Recently, our paper’s first author (JEH) de­
scribed a long-time effort to understand the effect of ocean mix­
ing and aerosols on observed and projected climate change, 
which led to a conclusion that most climate models are unrealis­
tically insensitive to freshwater injected by melting ice and that 
ice sheet models are unrealistically lethargic in the face of rapid, 
large climate change [14].
Eelco Rohling, editor of Oxford Open Climate Change, invited 
a perspective article on these issues. Our principal motivation in 
this paper is concern that IPCC has underestimated climate sen­
sitivity and understated the threat of large sea level rise and 
shutdown of ocean overturning circulations, but these issues, be­
cause of their complexity, must be addressed in two steps. Our 
present paper addresses climate sensitivity and warming in the 
pipeline, concluding that these exceed IPCC’s best estimates. 
Response of ocean circulation and ice sheet dynamics to global 
warming—already outlined in the Ice Melt paper—will be 
addressed further in a later paper.
The structure of our present paper is as follows. Climate sensi­
tivity section makes a fresh evaluation of Charney’s equilibrium 
climate sensitivity (ECS) based on improved paleoclimate data 
and introduces Earth system sensitivity (ESS), which includes the 
feedbacks that Charney held fixed. Climate response time section 
explores the fast-feedback response time of Earth’s temperature 
and energy imbalance to an imposed forcing, concluding that 
cloud feedbacks buffer heat uptake by the ocean, thus increasing 
the delay in surface warming and making Earth’s energy imbal­
ance an underestimate of the forcing reduction required to stabi­
lize climate. Cenozoic era section analyzes temperature change 
of the past 66 million years and infers the Cenozoic history of 
CO2, thus providing insights about climate change. Aerosols sec­
tion addresses the absence of aerosol forcing data via inferences 
from paleo data and modern global temperature change, and we 
point out potential information in ‘the great inadvertent aerosol 
experiment’ provided by recent restrictions on fuels in interna­
tional shipping. Summary section discusses policy implications 
of high climate sensitivity and the delayed response of the cli­
mate system. Warming in the pipeline need not appear. We can 
take actions that slow and reverse global warming; indeed, we 
suggest that such actions are needed to avoid disastrous conse­
quences for humanity and nature. Reduction of greenhouse gas 
emissions as rapidly as practical has highest priority, but that 
policy alone is now inadequate and must be complemented by 
additional actions to affect Earth’s energy balance. The world is 
still early in this ‘vast geophysical experiment’—as far as conse­
quences are concerned—but time has run short for the 
‘anticipation’ that E.E. David recommended.
Climate sensitivity (ECS and ESS)
This section gives a brief overview of the history of ECS estimates 
since the Charney report and uses glacial-to-interglacial climate 
change to infer an improved estimate of ECS. We discuss how 
ECS and the more general Earth system sensitivity (ESS) depend 
on the climate state.
Charney defined ECS as the eventual global temperature 
change caused by doubled CO2 if ice sheets, vegetation and long- 
lived GHGs are fixed (except the specified CO2 doubling). Other 
quantities affecting Earth’s energy balance—clouds, aerosols, 
water vapor, snow cover and sea ice—change rapidly in response 
to climate change. Thus, Charney’s ECS is also called the ‘fast- 
feedback’ climate sensitivity. Feedbacks interact in many ways, 
so their changes are calculated in global climate models (GCMs) 
that simulate such interactions. Charney implicitly assumed that 
change of the ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica—which we 
categorize as a ‘slow feedback’—was not important on time 
scales of most public interest.
ECS defined by Charney is a gedanken concept that helps us 
study the effect of human-made and natural climate forcings. If 
knowledge of ECS were based only on models, it would be diffi­
cult to narrow the range of estimated climate sensitivity—or 
have confidence in any range—because we do not know how well 
feedbacks are modeled or if the models include all significant 
real-world feedbacks. Cloud and aerosol interactions are com­
plex, e.g. and even small cloud changes can have a large effect. 
Thus, data on Earth’s paleoclimate history are essential, allowing 
us to compare different climate states, knowing that all feed­
backs operated.
Climate sensitivity estimated at the 1982 
Ewing Symposium

Symposium monograph using the feedback framework implied

by E.E. David and employed by electrical engineers [15]. The cli­
mate forcing caused by 2  CO2—the imposed perturbation of 
Earth’s energy balance—is 4 W/m2. If there were no climate 
feedbacks and Earth radiated energy to space as a perfect black 
surface, Earth’s temperature would need to increase 1.2C to in­
crease radiation to space 4 W/m2 and restore energy balance. 
However, feedbacks occur in the real world and in GCMs. In our 
GCM the equilibrium response to 2  CO2 was 4C warming of 
Earth’s surface. Thus, the fraction of equilibrium warming due 
directly to the CO2 change was 0.3 (1.2C/4C) and the feedback 
‘gain’, g, was 0.7 (2.8C/4C). Algebraically, ECS and feedback gain 
are related by 
ECS ¼ 1:2C=ð1   gÞ
(1) 
We evaluated contributions of individual feedback processes to g 
by inserting changes of water vapor, clouds, and surface albedo 
(reflectivity, literally whiteness, due to sea ice and snow changes) 
from the 2  CO2 GCM simulation one-by-one into a one- 
dimensional radiative-convective model [16], finding gwv ¼ 0.4, 
gcl ¼ 0.2, gsa ¼ 0.1, where gwv, gcl, and gsa are the water vapor, 
cloud and surface albedo gains. The 0.2 cloud gain was about 
equally from a small increase in cloud top height and a small de­
crease in cloud cover. These feedbacks all seemed reasonable, 
but how could we verify their magnitudes or the net ECS due to 
all feedbacks?
We recognized the potential of emerging paleoclimate data. 
Early data from polar ice cores revealed that atmospheric CO2 
was much less during glacial periods and the CLIMAP project [17] 
used proxy data to reconstruct global surface conditions during 
the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), which peaked about 20 000 
years ago. A powerful constraint was the fact that Earth had to 
be in energy balance averaged over the several millennia of the 
LGM. However, when we employed CLIMAP boundary conditions 
including sea surface temperatures (SSTs), Earth was out of en­
ergy balance, radiating 2.1 W/m2 to space, i.e. Earth was trying to 
cool off with an enormous energy imbalance, equivalent to half 
of 2  CO2 forcing.
Something was wrong with either assumed LGM conditions or 
our climate model. We tried CLIMAP’s maximal land ice—this 
only reduced the energy imbalance from 2.1 to 1.6 W/m2. 
Moreover, we had taken LGM CO2 as 200 ppm and did not know 
that CH4 and N2O were less in the LGM than in the present inter­
glacial period; accurate GHGs and CLIMAP SSTs produce a plane­
tary energy imbalance close to 3 W/m2. Most feedbacks in our 
model were set by CLIMAP. Sea ice is set by CLIMAP. Water vapor 
depends on surface temperature, which is set by CLIMAP SSTs. 
Cloud feedback is uncertain, but ECS smaller than 2.4C for 2 
CO2 would require a negative cloud gain. gcl  0.2 from our GCM 
increases ECS from 2.4C to 4C (Equation 1) and accounts for al­
most the entire difference of sensitivities of our model (4C for 2 
 CO2) and the Manabe and Stouffer model [18] (2C for 2  CO2) 
that had fixed cloud cover and cloud height. Manabe suggested 
[19] that our higher ECS was due to a too-large sea ice and snow 
feedback, but we noted [7] that sea ice in our control run was less 
than observed, so we likely understated sea ice feedback. 
Amplifying feedback due to high clouds increasing in height with 
warming is expected and is found in observations, large-eddy 
simulations and GCMs [20] Sherwood et al. [21] conclude that 
negative low-cloud feedback is ‘neither credibly suggested by any 
model, nor by physical principles, nor by observations.’ Despite a 
wide spread among models, GCMs today show an amplifying 
cloud feedback due to increases in cloud height and decreases in 
cloud amount, despite increases in cloud albedo [22]. These cloud 
changes are found in all observed cloud regimes and locations, 
implying robust thermodynamic control [23].
CLIMAP SSTs were a more likely cause of the planetary energy 
imbalance. Co-author D. Peteet used pollen data to infer LGM 
tropical and subtropical cooling 2–3C greater than in a GCM 
forced by CLIMAP SSTs. D. Rind and Peteet found that montane 
LGM snowlines in the tropics descended 1 km in the LGM, incon­
sistent with climate constrained by CLIMAP SSTs. CLIMAP as­
sumed that tiny shelled marine species migrate to stay in a 
temperature zone they inhabit today. But what if, instead, these 
species partly adapt over millennia to changing temperature? 
Based on the work of Rind and Peteet, later published [24], we 
suspected but could not prove that CLIMAP SSTs were too warm.
Based on GCM simulations for 2  CO2, on our feedback analy­
sis for the LGM, and on observed global warming in the past cen­
tury, we concluded that ECS was in the range 2.5–5C for 2  CO2. 
If CLIMAP SSTs were accurate, ECS was near the low end of that 
range. In contrast, our analysis implied that ECS for 2  CO2 was 
in the upper half of the 2.5–5C range, but our analysis depended 
in part on our GCM, which had sensitivity 4C for 2  CO2. To re­
solve the matter, a paleo thermometer independent of biologic 
adaptation was needed. Several decades later, such a paleo ther­
mometer and advanced analysis techniques exist. We will use re­
cent studies to infer our present best estimates for ECS and ESS. 
First, however, we will comment on other estimates of climate 
sensitivity and clarify the definition of climate forcings that 
we employ.
IPCC and independent climate 
sensitivity estimates
Reviews of climate sensitivity are available, e.g. Rohling et al. [25], 
which focuses on the physics of the climate system, and 
Sherwood et al. [26], which adds emphasis on probabilistic combi­
nation of multiple uncertainties. Progress in narrowing the un­
certainty in climate sensitivity was slow in the first five IPCC 
assessment reports. The fifth assessment report [26] (AR5) in 
2014 concluded only—with 66% probability—that ECS was in the 
range 1.5–4.5C, the same as Charney’s report 35 years earlier. 
The broad spectrum of information on climate change—espe­
cially constraints imposed by paleoclimate data—at last affected 
AR6 [12], which concluded with 66% probability that ECS is 2.5– 
4C, with 3C as their best estimate (Supplementary Fig. TS.6).
Sherwood et al. [21] combine three lines of evidence: climate 
feedback studies, historical climate change, and paleoclimate 
data, inferring S ¼ 2.6–3.9C with 66% probability for 2  CO2, 
where S is an ‘effective sensitivity’ relevant to a 150-year time 
scale. They find ECS only slightly larger: 2.6–4.1C with 66% prob­
ability. Climate feedback studies, inherently, cannot yield a sharp 
definition of ECS, as we showed in the cloud feedback discussion 
above. Earth’s climate system includes amplifying feedbacks that 
push the gain, g, closer to unity than zero, thus making ECS sen­
sitive to uncertainty in any feedback; the resulting sensitivity of 
ECS to g prohibits precise evaluation from feedback analysis. 
Similarly, historical climate change cannot define ECS well be­
cause the aerosol climate forcing is unmeasured. Also, forced 
and unforced ocean dynamics give rise to a pattern effect: [27] 
the geographic pattern of transient and equilibrium temperature 
changes differ, which affects ECS inferred from transient climate 
change. These difficulties help explain how Sherwood et al. [21] 
could estimate ECS as only 6% larger than S, an implausible re­
sult in view of the ocean’s great thermal inertia. An intercompar­
ison of GCMs run for millennial time scales, LongRunMIP [28],

includes 14 simulations of 9 GCMs with runs of 5000 years 
(or close enough for extrapolation to 5000 years). Their global 
warmings at 5000 years range from 30% to 80% larger than their 
150-year responses.
Our approach is to compare glacial and interglacial equilib­
rium climate states. The change of atmospheric and surface forc­
ings can be defined accurately, thus leading to a sharp 
evaluation of ECS for cases in which equilibrium response is as­
sured. With this knowledge in hand, additional information can 
be extracted from historical and paleo climate changes.
Climate forcing definitions
Attention to climate forcing definitions is essential for quantita­
tive analysis of climate change. However, readers uninterested in 
radiative forcings may skip this section with little penalty. We de­
scribe our climate forcing definition and compare our forcings 
with those of IPCC. Our total GHG forcing matches that of IPCC 
within a few percent, but this close fit hides larger differences in 
individual forcings that deserve attention.
Equilibrium global surface temperature change is related to 
ECS by 
DTs  F  ECS ¼ F  k;
(2) 
where k is a widely used abbreviation of ECS, DTS is the global 
mean equilibrium surface temperature change in response to cli­
mate forcing F, which is measured in W/m2 averaged over the en­
tire planetary surface. There are alternative ways to define F, as 
discussed in Chapter 8 [29] of AR5 and in a paper [30] hereafter 
called Efficacy. Objectives are to find a definition of F such that 
different forcing mechanisms of the same magnitude yield a sim­
ilar global temperature change, but also a definition that can be 
computed easily and reliably. The first four IPCC reports used ad­
justed forcing, Fa, which is Earth’s energy imbalance after strato­
spheric temperature adjusts to presence of the forcing agent. Fa 
usually yields a consistent response among different forcing 
agents, but there are exceptions such as black carbon aerosols; Fa 
exaggerates their impact. Also, Fa is awkward to compute and 
depends on definition of the tropopause, which varies among 
models. Fs, the fixed SST forcing (including fixed sea ice), is more 
robust than Fa as a predictor of climate response [30, 31], but a 
GCM is required to compute Fs. In Efficacy, Fs is defined as 
Fs ¼ Fo þ dTo
k ;
(3) 
where Fo is Earth’s energy imbalance after atmosphere and land 
surface adjust to the presence of the forcing agent with SST fixed. 
Fo is not a full measure of the strength of a forcing, because a 
portion (dTo) of the equilibrium warming is already present as Fo 
is computed. A GCM run of about 100 years is needed to accu­
rately define Fo because of unforced atmospheric variability. 
That GCM run also defines dTo, the global mean surface air tem­
perature change caused by the forcing with SST fixed. k is the 
model’s ECS in C per W/m2. dTo/k is the portion of the total forc­
ing (Fs) that is ‘used up’ in causing the dTo warming; radiative 
flux to space increases by dTo/k due to warming of the land sur­
face and global air. The term dTo/k is usually, but not always, less 
than 10% of Fo. Thus, it is better not to neglect dTo/k. IPCC AR5 
and AR6 define effective radiative forcing as ERF ¼ Fo. Omission 
of dTo/k was intentional [29] and is not an issue if the practice is 
followed consistently. However, when the forcing is used to cal­
culate global surface temperature response, the forcing to use is 
Fs, not Fo. It would be useful if both Fo and dTo were reported for 
all climate models.
A further refinement of climate forcing is suggested in Efficacy: 
effective forcing (Fe) defined by a long GCM run with calculated 
ocean temperature. The resulting global surface temperature 
change, relative to that for equal CO2 forcing, defines the forc­
ing’s efficacy. Effective forcings, Fe, were found to be within a few 
percent of Fs for most forcing agents, i.e. the results confirm that 
Fs is a robust forcing. This support is for Fs, not for Fo ¼ ERF, 
which is systematically smaller than Fs. The Goddard Institute 
for Space Studies (GISS) GCM [32, 33] used for CMIP6 [34] studies, 
which we label the GISS (2020) model,3 has higher resolution 
(2  2.5 and 40 atmospheric layers) and other changes that 
yield a moister upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, rela­
tive to the GISS model used in Efficacy. GHG forcings reported for 
the GISS (2020) model [32, 33] are smaller than in prior GISS mod­
els, a change attributed [33] to blanketing by high level water va­
por. However, part of the change is from comparison of Fo in GISS 
(2020) to FS in earlier models. The 2  CO2 fixed SST simulation 
with the GISS (2020) model yields Fo ¼ 3.59 W/m2, dTo ¼ 0.27C 
and k ¼ 0.9C per W/m2. Thus FS ¼ 3.59 þ 0.30 ¼ 3.89 W/m2, 
which is only 5.4% smaller than the FS ¼ 4.11 W/m2 for the GISS 
model used in Efficacy.
Our GHG effective forcing, Fe, was obtained in two steps. 
Adjusted forcings, Fa, were calculated for each gas for a large 
range of gas amount with a global-mean radiative-convective 
model that incorporated the GISS GCM radiation code, which 
uses the correlated k-distribution method [35] and high spectral 
resolution laboratory data [36]. The Fa are converted to effective 
forcings (Fe) via efficacy factors (Ea; Table 1 of Efficacy) based on 
GCM simulations that include the 3-D distribution of each gas. 
The total GHG forcing is 
Fe ¼ Fa CO2

(4) 
The CH4 coefficient (1.45) includes the effect of CH4 on O3 and 
stratospheric H2O, as well as the efficacy (1.10) of CH4 per se. We 
assume that CH4 is responsible for 45% of the O3 change [37]. 
Forcing caused by the remaining 55% of the O3 change is based 
on IPCC AR6 O3 forcing (Fa ¼ 0.47 W/m2 in 2019); we multiply this 
AR6 O3 forcing by 0.55  0.82 ¼ 0.45, where 0.82 is the efficacy of 
O3 forcing from Table 1 of Efficacy. Thus, the non-CH4 portion of 
the O3 forcing is 0.21 W/m2 in 2019. MPTGs and OTGs are 
Montreal Protocol Trace Gases and Other Trace Gases [38]. A list 
of these gases and a table of annual forcings since 1992 are avail 
able as well as the earlier data [39].
The climate forcing from our formulae is slightly larger than 
IPCC AR6 forcings (Fig. 1). In 2019, the final year of AR6 data, our 
GHG forcing is 4.00 W/m2; the AR6 forcing is 3.84 W/m2. Our forc­
ing should be larger, because IPCC forcings are Fo for all gases ex­
cept O3, for which they provide Fa (AR6 section 7.3.2.5). Table 1 in

Efficacy allows accurate comparison: dTo for 2  CO2 for the GISS 
model used in Efficacy is 0.22C, k is 0.67C per W/m2, so dTo/k ¼
0.33 W/m2. Thus, the conversion factor from Fo to Fe (or Fs) is 
4.11/(4.11−0.33). The non-O3 portion of AR6 2019 forcing 
(3.84−0.47 ¼ 3.37) W/m2 increases to 3.664 W/m2. The O3 portion 
of the AR6 2019 forcing (0.47 W/m2) decreases to 0.385 W/m2 be­
cause the efficacy of Fa(O3) is 0.82. The AR6 GHG forcing in 2019 
is thus 4.05 W/m2, expressed as Fe  Fs, which is 1% larger 
than follows from our formulae. This precise agreement is not in­
dicative of the true uncertainty in the GHG forcing, which IPCC 
AR6 estimates as 10%, thus about 0.4 W/m2. We concur with 
their error estimate and employ it in our ECS uncertainty analy­
sis (Equilibrium climate sensitivity section).
We conclude that the GHG increase since 1750 already produ­
ces a climate forcing equivalent to that of 2  CO2 (our formulae 
yield Fe  Fs ¼ 4.08 W/m2 for 2021 and 4.13 W/m2 for 2022; IPCC 
AR6 has Fs ¼ 4.14 W/m2 for 2021). The human-made 2  CO2 cli­
mate forcing imagined by Charney, Tyndall and other green­
house giants is no longer imaginary. Humanity is now taking its 
first steps into the period of consequences. Earth’s paleoclimate 
history helps us assess the potential outcomes.
Glacial-to-interglacial climate oscillations
In this section we describe how ice core data help us assess ECS 
for climate states from glacial conditions to interglacial periods 
such as the Holocene, the interglacial period of the past 12 000 
years. We discuss climate sensitivity in warmer climates in 
Cenozoic era section.
Air bubbles in Antarctic ice cores—trapped as snow piled up 
and compressed into ice—preserve a record of long-lived GHGs 
for at least 800 000 years. Isotopic composition of the ice provides 
a measure of temperature in and near Antarctica [40]. Changes 
of temperature and CO2 are highly correlated (Fig. 2). This does 
not mean that CO2 is the primal cause of the climate oscillations. 
Hays et al. [42] showed that small changes of Earth’s orbit and the 
tilt of Earth’s spin axis are pacemakers of the ice ages. Orbital 
changes alter the seasonal and geographical distribution of inso­
lation, which affects ice sheet size and GHG amount. Long-term 
climate is sensitive because ice sheets and GHGs act as amplify­
ing feedbacks: [43] as Earth warms, ice sheets shrink, expose a 
darker surface, and absorb more sunlight; also, as Earth warms, 
the ocean and continents release GHGs to the air. These amplify­
ing feedbacks work in the opposite sense as Earth cools. Orbital 
forcings oscillate slowly over tens and hundreds of thousands of 
years [44]. The picture of how Earth orbital changes drive millen­
nial climate change was painted in the 1920s by Milutin 
Milankovitch, who built on 19th century hypotheses of James 
Croll and Joseph Adhemar. Paleoclimate changes of ice sheets 
and GHGs are sometimes described as slow feedbacks [45], but 
their slow change is paced by the Earth orbital forcing; their slow 
change does not mean that these feedbacks cannot operate more 
rapidly in response to a rapid climate forcing.
We evaluate ECS by comparing stable climate states before 
and after a glacial-to-interglacial climate transition. GHG 
amounts are known from ice cores and ice sheet sizes are known 
from geologic data. This empirical ECS applies to the range of 
global temperature covered by ice cores, which we will conclude 
is about –7C to þ 1C relative to the Holocene. The Holocene is 
an unusual interglacial. Maximum melt rate was at 13.2 kyBP, as 
expected [45] and GHG amounts began to decline after peaking 
early in the Holocene, as in most interglacials. However, several 
ky later, CO2 and CH4 increased, raising a question of whether 
humans were affecting GHGs. Ruddiman [46] suggests that defor­
estation began to affect CO2 6500 years ago and rice irrigation be­
gan to affect CH4 5000 years ago. Those possibilities complicate 
use of LGM-Holocene warming to estimate ECS. However, sea 
level, and thus the size of the ice sheets, had stabilized by 7000 
years ago (Evidence of aerosol forcing in the Holocene section). 
Thus, the millennium centered on 7 kyBP provides a good period 
to compare with the LGM. Comparison of the Eemian interglacial 
(Fig. 2) with the prior glacial maximum (PGM) has potential for in­
dependent assessment.
LGM-Holocene and PGM-Eemian evaluation 
of ECS
In this section we evaluate ECS by comparing neighboring glacial 
and interglacial periods when Earth was in energy balance within 
less than 0.1 W/m2 averaged over a millennium. Larger imbal­
ance would cause temperature or sea level change that did not 
occur [48].4 Thus, we can assess ECS from knowledge of atmo­
spheric and surface forcings that maintained these climates.
Recent advanced analysis techniques allow improved estimate 
of paleo temperatures. Tierney et al. [49] exclude microbiology fos­
sils whose potential to adapt makes them dubious thermometers. 
Instead, they use a large collection of geochemical (isotope)

proxies for SST in an analysis constrained by climate change pat­
terns defined by GCMs. They find cooling of 6.1C (95% confi­
dence: 
5.7–6.5C) for the interval 23–19 kyBP. A similarly constrained 
global analysis by Osman et al. [50] finds LGM cooling at 21–18 
kyBP of 7.0 ± 1C (95% confidence). Tierney (priv. comm.) attrib­
utes the difference between the two studies to the broader time 
interval of the former study, and concludes that peak LGM cooling 
was near 7C.
Seltzer et al. [51] use the temperature-dependent solubility of 
dissolved noble gases in ancient groundwater to show that land 
areas between 45S and 35N cooled 5.8 ± 0.6C in the LGM. This 
cooling is consistent with 1 km lowering of alpine snowlines 
found by Rind and Peteet [24]. Land response to a forcing exceeds 
ocean response, but polar amplification makes the global re­
sponse as large as the low latitude land response in GCM simula­
tions with fixed ice sheets (Supplementary Material Fig. S3). 
When ice sheet growth is added, cooling amplification at mid 
and high latitudes is greater [7], making 5.8C cooling of low lati­
tude land consistent with global cooling of 7C.
LGM CO2, CH4 and N2O amounts are known accurately with 
the exception of N2O in the PGM when N2O reactions with dust in 
the ice core corrupt the data. We take PGM N2O as the mean of 
the smallest reported PGM amount and the LGM amount; poten­
tial error in the N2O forcing is 0.01 W/m2. We calculate CO2, 
CH4, and N2O forcings using Equation (4) and formulae for each 
gas in Supplementary Material for the periods shown by green 
bars in Fig. 3. The Eemian period avoids early CO2 and tempera­
ture spikes, assuring that Earth was in energy balance. Between 
the LGM (19–21 kyBP) and Holocene (6.5–7.5 kyBP), GHG forcing 
increased 2.25 W/m2 with 77% from CO2. Between the PGM and 
Eemian, GHG forcing increased 2.30 W/m2 with 79% from CO2.
Glacial-interglacial aerosol changes are not included as a forc­
ing. Natural aerosol changes, like clouds, are fast feedbacks. 
Indeed, aerosols and clouds form a continuum and distinction is 
arbitrary as humidity approaches 100%. There are many aerosol 
types, including VOCs (volatile organic compounds) produced by 
trees, sea salt produced by wind and waves, black and organic 
carbon produced by forest and grass fires, dust produced by wind 
and drought, and marine biologic dimethyl sulfide and its sec­
ondary aerosol products, all varying geographically and in re­
sponse to climate change. We do not know, or need to know, 
natural aerosol properties in prior eras because their changes are 
feedbacks included in the climate response. However, human- 
made aerosols are a climate forcing (an imposed perturbation of 
Earth’s energy balance). Humans may have begun to affect gases 
and aerosols in the latter Holocene (Aerosols section), but we 
minimize that issue by using the 6.5–7.5 kyBP window to evaluate 
climate sensitivity.
Earth’s surface change is the other forcing needed to evaluate 
ECS: (1) change of surface albedo (reflectivity) and topography by 
ice sheets, (2) vegetation change, e.g. boreal forests replaced by 
brighter tundra, and (3) continental shelves exposed by lower sea 
level. Forcing by all three can be evaluated at once with a GCM. 
Accuracy requires realistic clouds, which shield the surface. 
Clouds are the most uncertain feedback [52]. Evaluation is ideal 
for CMIP [53] (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) collabora­
tion with PMIP [54] (Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison 
Project); a study of LGM surface forcing could aid GCM develop­
ment and assessment of climate sensitivity. Sherwood et al. [21] 
review studies of LGM ice sheet forcing and settle on 3.2 ± 0.7 W/ 
m2, the same as IPCC AR4 [55]. However, some GCMs yield effica­
cies as low as 0.75 [56] or even 0.5 [57], likely due to cloud 
shielding. We found [7] a forcing of −0.9 W/m2 for LGM vegeta­
tion by using the Koppen [58] scheme to relate vegetation to local 
climate, but we thought the model effect was exaggerated as 
real-world forests tends to shake off snow albedo effects. Kohler 
et al. [59] estimate a continental shelf forcing of −0.67 W/m2. 
Based on an earlier study [60] (hereafter Target CO2), our estimate 
of LGM-Holocene surface forcing is 3.5 ± 1 W/m2. Thus, LGM (18– 
21 kyBP) cooling of 7C relative to mid-Holocene (7 kyBP), GHG 
forcing of 2.25 W/m2, and surface forcing of 3.5 W/m2 yield an 
initial ECS estimate 7/(2.25 þ 3.5) ¼ 1.22C per W/m2. We discuss 
uncertainties in Equilibrium climate sensitivity section.
PGM-Eemian global warming provides a second assessment of 
ECS, one that avoids concern about human influence. PGM- 
Eemian GHG forcing is 2.3 W/m2. We estimate surface albedo 
forcing as 0.3 W/m2 less than in the LGM because sea level was 
about 10 m higher during the PGM [61]. North American and 
Eurasian ice sheet sizes differed between the LGM and PGM [62], 
but division of mass between them has little effect on the net 
forcing (Supplementary Fig. S4 [60]). Thus, our central estimate 
of PGM-Eemian forcing is 5.5 W/m2. Eemian temperature reached 
about þ1C warmer than the Holocene [63], based on Eemian 
SSTs of þ0.5 ± 0.3C relative to 1870–1889 [64], or þ0.65 ± 0.3C 
SST and þ1C global (land plus ocean) relative to 1880–1920. 
However, the PGM was probably warmer than the LGM; it was 
warmer at Dome C (Fig. 2), but cooler at Dronning Maud Land 
[65]. Based on deep ocean temperatures (Cenozoic Era section), 
we estimate PGM-Eemian warming as 0.5C greater than LGM- 
Holocene warming, that is 7.5C. The resulting ECS is 7.5/5.5 ¼
1.36C per W/m2. Although PGM temperature lacks quantifica­
tion comparable to that of Seltzer et al. [51] and Tierney et al. [49] 
for the LGM, the PGM-Eemian warming provides support for the 
high ECS inferred from LGM-Holocene warming.
We conclude that ECS for climate in the Holocene-LGM range 
is 1.2C ± 0.3C per W/m2, where the uncertainty is the 95% confi­
dence range. The uncertainty estimate is inherently subjective, 
as it depends mainly on the ice age surface albedo forcing. The 
GHG forcing and glacial-interglacial temperature change are 
well-defined, but the efficacy of ice age surface forcing varies 
among GCMs. This variability is likely related to cloud shielding

of surface albedo, which reaffirms the need for a focus on precise 
cloud observations and modeling.
State dependence of climate sensitivity
ECS based on glacial-interglacial climate is an average for global 
temperatures −7C to þ1C relative to the Holocene and in gen­
eral differs for other climate states because water vapor, aerosol- 
cloud and sea ice feedbacks depend on the initial climate. 
However, ECS is rather flat between today’s climate and warmer 
climate, based on a study [66] covering a range of 15 CO2 dou­
blings using an efficient GCM developed by Gary Russell [67]. 
Toward colder climate, ice-snow albedo feedback increases non­
linearly, reaching snowball Earth conditions—with snow and ice 
on land reaching sea level in the tropics—when CO2 declines to a 
quarter to an eighth of its 1950 abundance (Fig. 7 of the study) 
[66]. Snowball Earth occurred several times in Earth’s history, 
most recently about 600 million years ago [68] when the Sun was 
6% dimmer [69] than today, a forcing of about –12 W/m2. Toward 
warmer climate, the water vapor feedback increases as the tropo­
pause rises [70], the tropopause cold trap disappearing at 32 
CO2 (Fig. 7) [66]. However, for the range of ECS of practical inter­
est—say from half preindustrial CO2 to 4  CO2 —state depen­
dence of ECS is small compared to state dependence of ESS.
Earth system sensitivity (ESS) includes amplifying feedbacks 
of GHGs and ice sheets [71]. When we consider CO2 change as a 
known forcing, other GHGs provide a feedback that is smaller 
than the ice sheet feedback, but not negligible. Ice core data on 
GHG amounts show that non-CO2 GHGs—including O3 and 
stratospheric H2O produced by changing CH4—provide about 
20% of the total GHG forcing, not only on average for the full 
glacial-interglacial change, but as a function of global tempera­
ture right up to þ1C global temperature relative to the Holocene 
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Atmospheric chemistry modeling sug­
gests that non-CO2 GHG amplification of CO2 forcing by about a 
quarter continues into warmer climate states [72]. Thus, for cli­
mate change in the Cenozoic era, we approximate non-CO2 GHG 
forcing by increasing the CO2 forcing by one-quarter.
Ice sheet feedback, in contrast to non-CO2 GHG feedback, is 
highly nonlinear. Preindustrial climate was at most a few halv­
ings of CO2 from runaway snowball Earth and LGM climate was 
even closer to that climate state. The ice sheet feedback is re­
duced as Earth heads toward warmer climate today because al­
ready two-thirds of LGM ice has been lost. Yet remaining ice on 
Antarctica and Greenland constitutes a powerful feedback, 
which humanity is about to bring into play. We can illuminate 
that feedback and the climate path Earth is now on by examining 
data on the Cenozoic era—which includes CO2 levels comparable 
to today’s amount—but first we must consider climate re­
sponse time.
Climate response time
In this section we define response functions for global tempera­
ture and Earth’s energy imbalance that help reveal the physics of 
climate change. Cloud feedbacks amplify climate sensitivity and 
thus increase eventual heat uptake by the ocean, but cloud feed­
backs also have the potential to buffer the rate at which the 
ocean takes up heat, thus increasing climate response time.
Climate response time was surprisingly long in our climate 
simulations [7] for the 1982 Ewing Symposium. The e-folding 
time—the time for surface temperature to reach 63% of its equi­
librium response—was about a century. The only published 
atmosphere-ocean GCM—that of Bryan and Manabe [73]—had a 
response time of 25 years, while several simplified climate mod­
els referenced in our Ewing paper had even faster responses. The 
longer response time of our climate model was largely a result of 
high climate sensitivity—our model had an ECS of 4C for 2 
CO2 while the Bryan and Manabe model had an ECS of 2C.
The physics is straightforward. If the delay were a result of a 
fixed source of thermal inertia, say the ocean’s well-mixed upper 
layer, response time would increase linearly with ECS because 
most climate feedbacks come into play in response to tempera­
ture change driven by the adjusted forcing, not in direct response 
to the forcing. Thus, a model with ECS of 4C takes twice as long 
to reach full response as a model with ECS of 2C, if the mixed 
layer provides the only heat capacity. However, while the mixed 
layer is warming, there is exchange of water with the deeper 
ocean, which slows the mixed layer warming. The longer re­
sponse time with high ECS allows more of the ocean to come into 
play. If mixing into the deeper ocean is approximated as diffu­
sive, surface temperature response time is proportional to the 
square of climate sensitivity [74].
Slow climate response accentuates need for the ‘anticipation’ 
that E.E. David, Jr spoke about. If ECS is 4.8C (1.2C per W/m2), 
more warming is in the pipeline than widely assumed. GHG forc­
ing today already exceeds 4 W/m2. Aerosols reduce the net forc­
ing to about 3 W/m2, based on IPCC estimates (Aerosols section), 
but warming still in the pipeline for 3 W/m2 forcing is 2.4C, ex­
ceeding warming realized to date (1.2C). Slow feedbacks increase 
the equilibrium response even further (Summary section). Large 
warmings can be avoided via a reasoned policy response, but def­
inition of effective policies will be aided by an understanding of 
climate response time.
Temperature response function
In the Bjerknes lecture [75] at the 2008 American Geophysical 
Union meeting, JEH argued that the ocean in many5 GCMs had 
excessive mixing, and he suggested that GCM groups all report 
the response function of their models—the global temperature 
change versus time in response to instant CO2 doubling with the 
model run long enough to approach equilibrium. The response 
function characterizes a climate model and enables a rapid esti­
mate of the global mean surface temperature change in response 
to any climate forcing scenario: 
TG tð Þ ¼
ð
½dTGðtÞ=dt dt ¼ S k  R tð Þ
dFe=dt


dt:
(5) 
TG is the Green’s function estimate of global temperature at time 
t, k (C per W/m2) the model’s equilibrium sensitivity, R the di­
mensionless temperature response function (% of equilibrium re­
sponse), and dFe the forcing change per unit time, dt. Integration 
over time begins when Earth is in near energy balance, e.g. in pre­
industrial time. The response function yields an accurate esti­
mate of global temperature change for a forcing that does not 
cause reorganization of ocean circulation. Accuracy of this ap­
proximation for temperature for one climate model is shown in 
Chart 15 in the Bjerknes presentation and wider applicability has 
been demonstrated [76].
We study ocean mixing effects by comparing two GCMs: GISS 
(2014) [77] and GISS (2020) [33], both models6 described by Kelley 
et al. [32].Ocean mixing is improved in GISS (2020) by use of a 
high-order advection scheme [78], finer upper-ocean vertical res­
olution (40 layers), updated mesoscale eddy parameterization, 
and correction of errors in the ocean modeling code [32]. The 
GISS (2020) model has improved variability, including the

Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), El Nino Southern Oscillation 
(ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), but the spectrum 
of ENSO-like variability is unrealistic and its amplitude is exces­
sive, as shown by the magnitude of oscillations in Fig. 4a. Ocean 
mixing in GISS (2020) may still be excessive in the North Atlantic, 
where the model’s simulated penetration of CFCs is greater than 
observed [79].
Despite reduced ocean mixing, the GISS (2020) model surface 
temperature response is no faster than in the GISS (2014) model 
(Fig. 4b): it takes 100 years to reach within 1/e of the equilibrium 
response. Slow response is partly explained by the larger ECS of 
the GISS (2020) model, which is 3.5C versus 2.7C for the GISS 
(2014) model, but something more is going on in the newer 
model, as exposed by the response function of Earth’s en­
ergy imbalance.
Earth’s energy imbalance (EEI)
When a forcing perturbs Earth’s energy balance, the imbalance 
drives warming or cooling to restore balance. Observed EEI is 
now of order þ1 W/m2 (more energy coming in than going out) 
[80]. High accuracy of EEI is obtained by tracking ocean warm­
ing—the main repository for excess energy—and adding heat 
stored in warming continents and heat used in net ice melt [80]. 
Heat storage in air adds a small amount. Radiation balance mea­
sured from Earth-orbiting satellites cannot by itself define the 
absolute imbalance, but, when anchored to an in situ EEI value 
for a sufficient interval (e.g. 10 years), satellite Earth radiation 
budget observations [81] provide invaluable EEI data on finer 
temporal and spatial scales than the in situ data.
After a step-function forcing is imposed, EEI and global sur­
face temperature must each approach a new equilibrium, but EEI 
does so more rapidly, especially for the GISS (2020) model (Fig. 5). 
EEI in GISS (2020) needs only a decade to reach within 1/e of full 
response (Fig. 5b), but global surface temperature requires a cen­
tury (Fig. 4b). Rapid decline of EEI—to half the forcing in 5 years 
(Fig. 5a)—has practical implications. First, EEI defines the rate 
heat is pumped into the ocean, so if EEI is reduced, ocean warm­
ing is slowed. Second, rapid EEI decline implies that it is wrong to 
assume that global warming can be stopped by a reduction of cli­
mate forcing by the amount of EEI. Instead, the required reduc­
tion of forcing is larger than EEI. The difficulty in finding 
additional reduction in climate forcing of even a few tenths of a 
W/m2 is substantial [63]. Calculations that help quantify this 
matter are discussed in Supplementary Material section SM8.

What is the physics behind the fast response of EEI? The 2 
CO2 forcing and initial EEI are both nominally 4 W/m2. In the 
GISS (2014) model, the decline of EEI averaged over the first year 
is 0.5 W/m2 (Fig. 5a), a moderate decline that might be largely 
caused by warming continents and thus increased heat radiation 
to space. In contrast, EEI declines 1.3 W/m2 in the GISS (2020) 
model (Fig. 5a). Such a huge, immediate decline of EEI implies ex­
istence of an ultrafast climate feedback. Climate feedbacks are 
the heart of climate change and warrant discussion.
Slow, fast and ultrafast feedbacks
Charney et al. [4] described climate feedbacks without discussing 
time scales. At the 1982 Ewing Symposium, water vapor, clouds 
and sea ice were described as ‘fast’ feedbacks [7] presumed to 
change promptly in response to global temperature change, as 
opposed to ‘slow’ feedbacks or specified boundary conditions 
such as ice sheet size, vegetation cover, and atmospheric CO2 
amount, although it was noted that some specified boundary 
conditions, e.g. vegetation, in reality may be capable of relatively 
rapid change [7].
The immediate EEI response (Fig. 5a) implies a third feedback 
time scale: ultrafast. Ultrafast feedbacks are not a new concept. 
When CO2 is doubled, the added infrared opacity causes the 
stratosphere to cool. Instant EEI upon CO2 doubling is only Fi ¼
þ2.5 W/m2, but stratospheric cooling quickly increases EEI to þ4 
W/m2 [82]. All models calculate a similar radiative effect, so it is 
useful to define an adjusted forcing, Fa, which is superior to Fi as 
a measure of climate forcing. In contrast, if cloud change—the 
likely cause of the present ultrafast change—is lumped into the 
adjusted forcing, each climate model has its own forcing, losing 
the merit of a common forcing.
Kamae et al. [83] review rapid cloud adjustment distinct from 
surface temperature-mediated change. Clouds respond to radia­
tive forcing, e.g. via effects on cloud particle phase, cloud cover, 
cloud albedo and precipitation [84]. The GISS (2020) model alters 
glaciation in stratiform mixed-phase clouds, which increases 
supercooled water in stratus clouds, especially over the Southern 
Ocean [Fig. 1 in the GCM description [32]]. The portion of super­
cooled cloud water drops goes from too little in GISS (2014) to too 
much in GISS (2020). Neither model simulates well stratocumu­
lus clouds, yet the models help expose real-world physics that 
affects climate sensitivity and climate response time. Several 
models in CMIP6 comparisons find high ECS [84]. For the sake of 
revealing the physics, it would be useful if the models defined 
their temperature and EEI response functions. Model runs of 
even a decade can define the important part of Figs 4a and 5a. 
Many short (e.g. 2-year) 2  CO2 climate simulations with each 
run beginning at a different point in the model’s control run, can 
define cloud changes to an arbitrary accuracy.
Cenozoic era
In this section, we use ocean sediment core data to explore climate 
change in the past 66 million years. This allows us to study warmer 
climates that are relevant to human-made climate forcing.
High equilibrium climate sensitivity that we have inferred, 
ECS ¼ 1.2C ± 0.3C per W/m2, may affect interpretation of 
warmer climates. GCMs have difficulty in producing Pliocene 
warmth [85], especially in the Arctic, without large—probably un­
realistic—CO2 amounts. In addition, a coupled GCM/ice sheet 
model needs 700–840 ppm CO2 for transition between glaciated 
and unglaciated Antarctica [86]. Understanding of these climate 
states is hampered by uncertainty in the forcings that maintained 
the climate, as proxy measures of CO2 have large uncertainty.
Theory informs us that CO2 is the principal control knob on 
global temperature [87]. Climate of the past 800 000 years dem­
onstrates (Fig. 2) the tight control. Our aim here is to extract 
Cenozoic surface temperature history from the deep ocean oxy­
gen isotope d18O and infer Cenozoic CO2 history. Oxygen isotope 
data has high temporal resolution for the entire Cenozoic, which 
aids understanding of Cenozoic climate change and resulting 
implications for future climate. Our CO2 analysis is a comple­
ment to proxy CO2 measurements. Despite progress in estimating 
CO2 via carbon isotopes in alkenones and boron isotopes in 
planktic foraminifera [88], there is wide scatter among results 
and fossil plant stomata suggest smaller CO2 amounts [89].
Deep ocean temperature and sea level from d18O
Glacial-interglacial CO2 oscillations (Fig. 2) involve exchange of 
carbon among surface carbon reservoirs: the ocean, atmosphere, 
soil and biosphere. Total CO2 in the reservoirs also can vary, 
mainly on longer time scales, as carbon is exchanged with the 
solid Earth. CO2 then becomes a primary agent of long-term cli­
mate change, leaving orbital effects as ‘noise’ on larger climate 
swings. Oxygen isotopic composition of benthic (deep ocean 
dwelling) foraminifera shells provides a starting point for analy­
sis of Cenozoic temperature. Figure 6 includes the recent high- 
resolution record of Westerhold et al. [90] and data of Zachos 
et al. [44] that have been used for many studies in the past quar­
ter century. When Earth has negligible ice sheets, d18O (18O 
amount relative to a standard), provides an estimate of deep 
ocean temperature (right scale in Fig. 6) [44].

This equation is used for the early Cenozoic, up to the large-scale 
glaciation of Antarctica at 34 MyBP (Oi-1in Fig. 6). At larger d18O 
(colder climate), lighter 16O evaporates preferentially from the 
ocean and accumulates in ice sheets. In Zachos data, d18O 
increases by 3 between Oi-1 and the LGM. Half of this d18O 
change is due to the 6C change of deep ocean temperature be­
tween Oi-1 (5C) and the LGM (–1C) [92]. The other 1.5 of d18O 
change is presumed to be due to the 180 m sea level (SL) change 
between ice-free Earth and the LGM, with 60 m from Antarctic 
ice and 120 m from Northern Hemisphere ice. Thus, as an ap­
proximation to extract both SL and Tdo from d18O, Hansen et al. 
[66] assumed that SL rose linearly by 60 m as d18O increased from 
1.75 to 3.25 and linearly by 120 m as d18O increased from 3.25 
to 4.75.
The Zachos (Z) and Westerhold (W) d18O time series differ 
(Fig. 6) mainly because of different sites of the sediment cores 
and the way multiple sites are stacked to obtain a time series for 
the full Cenozoic. For example, mid-Holocene (6–8 kyBP) values 
of d18O in the Z and W data sets are d18OZ
H ¼ 3.32 and d18OW
H ¼
3.88. Thus, the Z and W d18O time series require separate equa­
tions for sea level (SL) and deep ocean temperature (Tdo) [66]:

Rohling et al. [94]. We focus on the finer resolution W data. 
Differences between the W and Z data and interpretation of 
those differences are discussed in Paleocene Eocene Thermal 
Maximum section.
Cenozoic TS
In this section we combine the rich detail in Tdo provided by 
benthic d18O with constraints on the range of Cenozoic TS from 
surface proxies to produce an estimated history of Cenozoic TS.
We expect Tdo change, which derives from sea surface tempera­
ture (SST) at high latitudes where deepwater forms, to approximate 
TS change when Tdo is not near the freezing point. Global SST 
change understates global TS (land plus ocean) change because 
land temperature response to a forcing exceeds SST response [95], 
e.g. the equilibrium global SST response of the GISS (2020) GCM to 2 
 CO2 is 70.6% of the global (land plus ocean) response. However, 
polar amplification of the SST response tends to compensate for 
SST undershoot of global TS change. Compensation is nearly exact 
at latitudes of North Atlantic deepwater formation for 2  CO2 cli­
mate change in the GISS (2020) climate model (Fig. 7a), but 
Southern Hemisphere polar amplification does not fully cover the 
60–75S latitudes where Antarctic bottom water forms.
As Tdo nears the freezing point, ice forms, adhering to the 
Antarctic continent, extending today to a depth of about 2 km, 
and also forming floating ice shelves. From the Holocene toward 
colder climate, the effect on temperature change is large: TS 
declines 7C between the Holocene and LGM, but Tdo declines only 
2C (from 1C to –1C). From the Holocene toward hotter climate, 
we expect a smaller effect that we quantify by first neglecting the 
effect and finding how far we underestimate EECO temperature. 
Thus, as an initial approximation we assume DTS ¼ DTdo: 
TS  Tdo   TdoH þ 14C ¼ Tdo þ 13C;
ðd18O < d18OHÞ
(15) 
where we take Holocene TS as 14C and TdoH as 1C. In this initial 
approximation, we interpolate linearly for climate colder than 
the Holocene, the LGM being 7C cooler than the Holocene: 
TS ¼ 14C   7C  ðd18O   d18OHÞ
=ðd18OLGM   d18OHÞ
ðd18O > d18OHÞ
(16) 
Resulting EECO (Early Eocene Climatic Optimum) TS is 27C 
(Fig. 8a). As expected, this initial approximation undershoots EECO 
TS, which Zhu et al. [96] infer to be 29C from a proxy-constrained 
full-field analysis using a GCM to account for the pattern of 
Figure 6. Global deep ocean d18O. Black line: Westerhold et al. [90] data in 5 kyr bins until 34 MyBP and subsequently 2 kyr bins. Green line: Zachos et al.

temperature change. Moderate undershoot (DT ¼ 2C) of EECO TS 
is consistent with expectation that global warming of a few 
degrees would remove Antarctic ice shelves and allow polar ampli­
fication to fully cover regions of deepwater formation. Moreover, 
DT of 2C at the Holocene and 5C more between the Holocene 
and LGM are fit well by an exponential function between Antarctic 
glaciation and the LGM, as needed for DT to asymptote at the 
freezing point (Fig. 7b). Thus, we take TS as 
TS ¼ Tdo   DT þ 15C ¼ Tdo   0:35 e0:8X   1
ð
Þ þ 15C;
(17) 
where X ¼ d18O −d18OOi-1 and TS is normalized to 14C in 
the Holocene.
The result is a consistent analysis of global TS for the entire 
Cenozoic (Fig. 8b). Oxygen isotope d18O of deep ocean forami­
nifera reproduces glacial-interglacial temperature change well; 
more detailed agreement is not expected as Antarctic ice core 
data are for a location that moves, especially in altitude. Our 
interest is in warmer global climate and its relevance to up­
coming human-caused climate change. For that purpose, we 
want to know the forcing that drove Cenozoic climate 
change. With the assumption that non-CO2 GHG forcings pro­
vide 20% of the total GHG forcing, it is not difficult to infer 
the CO2 abundance required to cause the Cenozoic tempera­
ture history in Fig. 8b. Considering the large disagreement 
among proxy CO2 
measures, this indirect measure of

CO2 via global TS may provide the most accurate Cenozoic 
CO2 history.
Cenozoic CO2
We obtain the CO2 history required to yield the Cenozoic TS his­
tory from the relation 
DF tð Þ ¼ TS tð Þ   14C
½
=ECS;
(18) 
where DF(t) (0 at 7 kyBP) includes changing solar irradiance and 
amplification of CO2 forcing by non-CO2 GHGs and ice sheets. 
The GHG amplification factor is taken as 1.25 throughout the 
Cenozoic (State dependence of climate sensitivity section). 
The amplification applies to solar forcing as well as CO2 forcing 
because it is caused by temperature change, not by CO2. Solar 
irradiance is increasing 10% per billion years [69]; thus solar forc­
ing (240 W/m2 today) increases 2.4 W/m2 per 100 million 
years. Thus, 
DF tð Þ ¼ 1:25  DFCO2 tð Þ þ DFSol tð Þ

 AS:
ðd18O > d18OHÞ
(19) 
AS, surface albedo amplification, is smaller in moving from the 
Holocene to warmer climate—when the main effect is shrinking 
of Antarctic ice—than toward colder climate. For d18O > d18OH, 
we take AS as its average value over the period from the 
Holocene to the LGM:

All quantities are known except DFCO2(t), which is thus defined. 
Cenozoic CO2 (t) for specified ECS is obtained from TS(t) using the 
CO2 
radiative forcing equation (Table 1, Supplementary 
Material). Resulting CO2 (Fig. 9) is about 1,200 ppm at the EECO, 
450 ppm at Oi-1, and 325 ppm in the Pliocene for ECS ¼ 1.2C per 
W/m2. For ECS ¼ 1C—about as low as we believe plausible— 
Pliocene CO2 is near 350 ppm, rising only to 500 ppm at Oi-1 
and 1500 ppm at EECO.
Assumed Holocene CO2 amount is also a minor factor. We 
tested two cases: 260 and 278 ppm (Fig. 9). These were imple­
mented as the CO2 values at 7 kyBP, but Holocene-mean values 
are similar—a few ppm less than CO2 at 7 kyBP. Holocene ¼ 278 
ppm increases CO2 about 20 ppm between today and Oi-1, and 
about 50 ppm at the EECO. However, Holocene CO2 278 ppm 
causes the amplitude of inferred glacial-interglacial CO2 oscilla­
tions to be less than reality (Fig. 9b), providing support for the 
Holocene 260 ppm level and for the interpretation that high late- 
Holocene CO2 was due to human influence. Proxy measures of 
Cenozoic CO2 yield a notoriously large range. A recent review [88] 
constructs a CO2 history with Loess-smoothed CO2 700–1100

ppm at Oi-1. That high Oi-1 CO2 amount is not plausible without 
overthrowing the concept that global temperature is a response 
to climate forcings. More generally, we conclude that actual CO2 
during the Cenozoic was near the low end of the range of proxy 
measurements.
Interpretation of Cenozoic TS and CO2
In this section we consider Cenozoic TS and CO2 histories, which 
are rich in insights about climate change with implications for 
future climate.
In Target CO2 [60] and elsewhere [98] we argue that the broad 
sweep of Cenozoic temperature is a result of plate tectonic (popu­
larly ‘continental drift’) effects on CO2. Solid Earth sources and 
sinks of CO2 are not balanced at any given time. CO2 is removed 
from surface reservoirs by: (1) chemical weathering of rocks with 
deposition of carbonates on the ocean floor, and (2) burial of or­
ganic matter [99, 100]. CO2 returns via metamorphism and volca­
nic outgassing at locations where oceanic crust is subducted 
beneath moving continental plates. The interpretation in Target 
CO2 was that the main Cenozoic source of CO2 was associated 
with the Indian plate (Fig. 10), which separated from Pangea in 
the Cretaceous [101, 102] and moved through the Tethys (now 
Indian) Ocean at a rate exceeding 10 cm/year until collision with 
the Eurasian plate at circa 50 MyBP. Associated CO2 emissions in­
clude those from formation of the Deccan Traps7 in western 
India (a large igneous province, LIP, formed by repeated deposi­
tion of large-scale flood basalts), the smaller Rajahmundry Traps 
[103] in eastern India, and metamorphism and vulcanism associ­
ated with the moving Indian plate. The Indian plate slowed circa 
60 Mya (inset, Fig. 6) before resuming high speed [91], leaving an 
indelible signature in the Cenozoic d18O history (Fig. 6) that sup­
ports our interpretation of the CO2 source. Since the continental 
collision, subduction and CO2 emissions continue at a diminish­
ing rate as the India plate underthrusts the Asian continent and 
pushes up the Himalayan mountains [104]. We interpret the de­
cline of CO2 over the past 50 million years as, at least in part, a 
decline of the metamorphic source from continued subduction of 
the Indian plate, but burial of organic matter and increased 
weathering due to exposure of fresh rock by Himalayan uplift 
[105] may contribute to CO2 drawdown. Quantitative under­
standing of these processes is limited [106], e.g. weathering is 
both a source and sink of CO2 [107].
This picture for the broad sweep of Cenozoic CO2 is consistent 
with current understanding of the long-term carbon cycle [108], 
but relative contributions of metamorphism [106] and volcanism 
[109] are uncertain. Also, emissions from rift-induced Large 
Igneous Provinces (LIPs) [110, 111] contribute to long-term 
change of atmospheric CO2, with two cases prominent in Fig. 6. 
The Columbia River Flood Basalt at ca. 17–15 MyBP was a princi­
pal cause of the Miocene Climatic Optimum [112], but the pro­
cesses are poorly understood [113]. A more dramatic event 
occurred as Greenland separated from Europe, causing a rift in 
the sea floor; flood basalt covered more than a million square 
kilometers with magma volume 6–7 million cubic kilometers 
[111]—the North Atlantic Igneous Province (NAIP). Flood basalt 
volcanism occurred during 60.5–54.5 MyBP, but at 56.1 ± 0.5 
MyBP melt production increased by more than a factor of 10, con­
tinued at a high level for about a million years, and then subsided 
(Fig. 5 of Storey et al. [114]). The striking Paleocene-Eocene 
Thermal Maximum (PETM) d18O spike (Fig. 6) occurs early in this 
million-year bump-up of d18O. Svensen et al. [115] proposed that 
the PETM was initiated by the massive flood basalt into carbon- 
rich sedimentary strata. Gutjahr et al. [116] developed an isotope 
analysis, concluding that most of PETM carbon emissions were 
volcanic, with climate-driven carbon feedbacks playing a lesser 
role. Yet other evidence [117], while consistent with volcanism as 
a trigger for the PETM, suggests that climate feedback—perhaps 
methane hydrate and peat CO2 release—may have caused more 
than half of the PETM warming. Berndt et al. [118] describe exten­
sive shallow-water vents that likely released CH4 as well as CO2 
during the NAIP activity. We discuss PETM warming and CO2 lev­
els below, but first we must quantify the mechanisms that drove 
Cenozoic climate change and consider where Earth’s climate was 
headed before humanity intervened.

The sum of climate forcings (CO2 and solar) and slow feed­
backs (ice sheets and non-CO2 GHGs) that maintained EECO 
warmth was 12.5 W/m2 (Fig. 11). CO2 forcing of 9.1 W/m2 com­
bined with solar forcing of—1.2 W/m2 to yield a total forcing8 8 
W/m2. Slow feedbacks were 4.5 W/m2 forcing (ice albedo ¼ 2 W/ 
m2 and non-CO2 GHGs ¼ 2.5 W/m2). With today’s solar irradi­
ance, human-made GHG forcing required for Earth to return to 
EECO warmth is 8 W/m2. Present human-made GHG forcing is 
4.6 W/m2 relative to 7 kyBP.9 Equilibrium response to this forcing 
includes the 2 W/m2 ice sheet feedback and 25% amplification (of 
6.6 W/m2) by non-CO2 GHGs, yielding a total forcing plus slow 
feedbacks of 8.25 W/m2. Thus, equilibrium global warming for 
today’s GHGs is 10C.10 If human-made aerosol forcing is −1.5 W/ 
m2 and remains at that level indefinitely, equilibrium warming 
for today’s atmosphere is reduced to 8C. Either 10C or 8C 
dwarfs observed global warming of 1.2C to date. Most of the 
equilibrium warming for today’s atmosphere has not yet oc­
curred and need not occur (Earth’s energy imbalance section).
Prospects for another snowball Earth
We would be remiss if we did not comment on the precipitous de­
cline of Earth’s temperature over the last several million years. 
Was Earth falling off the table into another Snowball Earth?
Global temperature plummeted in the past 50 million years, 
with growing, violent, oscillations (Figs 6 and 7). Glacial- 
interglacial average CO2 declined from about 325 ppm to 225 
ppm in the past five million years in an accelerating decline 
(Fig. 9a). As CO2 fell to 180 ppm during recent glacial maxima, an 
ice sheet covered most of Canada and reached midlatitudes in 
the U.S. Continents in the current supercontinent cycle [101] are 
now dispersed, with movement slowing to 2–3 cm/year. 
Emissions from the last high-speed high-impact tectonic event— 
collision of the Indian plate with Eurasia—are fizzling out. The 
most recent large igneous province (LIP) event—the Columbia 
River Flood Basalt about 15 million years ago (Fig. 6)—is no longer 
a factor, and there is no evidence of another impending LIP. 
Snowball conditions are possible, even though the Sun’s bright­
ness is increasing and is now almost 6% greater [69] than it was 
at the last snowball Earth, almost 600 million years ago [68]. 
Runaway snowball likely requires only 1–2 halvings [66] of CO2 
from the LGM 180 ppm level, i.e. to 45–90 ppm. Although the 
weathering rate declines in colder climate [119], weathering and 
burial of organic matter continue, so decrease of atmospheric 
CO2 could have continued over millions of years, if the source of 
CO2 from metamorphism and vulcanism continued to decline.
Another factor that may have contributed to cooling in the 
Pliocene is uplift and poleward movement of Greenland that ac­
celerated about 5 MyBP [120], which likely enhanced glaciation of 
Greenland and should be accounted for in simulations of 
Pliocene climate change. We conclude that, in the absence of hu­
man activity, Earth may have been headed for snowball Earth 
conditions within the next 10 or 20 million years, but the chance 
of future snowball Earth is now academic. Human-made GHG 
emissions remove that possibility on any time scale of practical 
interest. Instead, GHG emissions are now driving Earth toward 
much warmer climate.
Paleocene eocene thermal maximum (PETM)
The PETM event provides a benchmark for assessing the poten­
tial impact of the human-made climate forcing and the time 
scale for natural recovery of the climate system.
Westerhold [90] data have 10C deep ocean warming at the 
PETM (Figs 8 and 12a), which exceeds proxy-derived surface 
warming. Low latitude SST data have 3–4C PETM warming [121]. 
Tierney et al. [122] obtain PETM global surface warming 5.6C 
(5.4–59C, 95% confidence) via analysis of proxy surface tempera­
ture data that accounts for patterns of temperature change. 
Zachos [44] data have a deep ocean warming similar to the 
proxy-based surface warming. These warming estimates can be 
reconciled, but first let’s note the practical importance of 
the PETM.
Pre-PETM (56–56.4 MyBP) CO2 is 910 ppm in our analysis for 
the most likely ECS (1.2C per W/m2). Peak PETM CO2 required to 
yield the 5.6C global surface warming estimate of Tierney et al. 
[122] is then 1630 ppm if CO2 provides 80% of the GHG forcing, 
thus less than a doubling of CO2. (In the unlikely case that CO2 
caused 100% of the GHG forcing, required CO2 is 1780, not quite a 
doubling.) CO2 amounts for ECS ¼ 1.0 and 1.4C per W/m2 are 
1165 and 760 ppm in the pre-PETM and 2260 and 1270 ppm at 
peak PETM, respectively. In all these ECS cases, the CO2 forcing of 
the PETM is less than or about a CO2 doubling. Our assumed 20% 
contribution by non-CO2 GHGs (amplification factor 1.25,

Climate sensitivity (ECS and ESS) section), is nominal; Hopcroft et 
al., e.g. estimate a 30% contribution from non-CO2 GHGs [123], 
thus an amplification factor 1.43.
Thus, today’s human-made GHG forcing (4.6 W/m2, growing 
0.5 W/m2 per decade) is already at least comparable to the PETM 
forcing, although the net human-made forcing including aerosols 
has probably not reached the PETM forcing. However, there are 
two big differences between the PETM and today. First, there 
were no large ice sheets on Earth in the PETM era. Ice sheets on 
Antarctica and Greenland today make Earth system sensitivity 
(ESS) greater than it was during the PETM. Equilibrium response 
to today’s GHG climate forcing would include deglaciation of 
Antarctica and Greenland, sea level rise of 60 m (200 feet), and 
surface albedo forcing (slow feedback) of 2 W/m2. The second dif­
ference between the PETM and today is the rate of change of the 
climate forcing. Most of today’s climate forcing was introduced 
in a century, which is 10 times or more faster than the PETM forc­
ing growth. Although a bolide impact [124] has been proposed as 
a trigger for the PETM, the issue is the time scale on which the cli­
mate forcing—increased GHGs—occurred. Despite uncertainty in 
the carbon source(s), data and modeling point to duration of a 
millennium or more for PETM emissions [121, 125].
Better understanding of the PETM could inform us on climate 
feedbacks. Gutjahr et al. [116] argue persuasively that PETM emis­
sions were mostly volcanic, yet we know of no other large igne­
ous province that produced such great, temporally-isolated, 
emissions. Further, Cenozoic orbitally-driven hyperthermal 
events [126] testify to large CO2 feedbacks. Northern peatlands 
today contain more than 1000 Gt carbon [127], much of which 
can be mobilized at PETM warming levels [128]. The double peak 
in deep ocean d18O (thus in temperature, cf. Fig. 12, where each 
square is a binning interval of 5000 years) is also found in terres­
trial data [129]. Perhaps the sea floor rift occurred in two bursts, 
or the rift was followed tens of thousands of years later by meth­
ane hydrate release as a feedback to the ocean warming; much of 
today’s methane hydrate is in stratigraphic deposits hundreds of 
meters below the sea floor, where millennia may pass before a 
thermal wave from the surface reaches the deposits [130]. 
Feedback emissions, especially from permafrost, seem to be 
more chronic than catastrophic, but stabilization of climate may 
require cooling that terminates growth of those feedbacks 
(Summary section). The PETM provides perhaps the best empiri­
cal check on understanding of the atmospheric lifetime of fossil 
fuel CO2 [131], but for that purpose we must untangle as well as 
possible the time dependence of the PETM CO2 source and feed­
backs. If continuing magma flow or a slow-release feedback is a 
substantial portion of PETM CO2, the CO2 lifetime inferred from 
post-PETM CO2 recovery may be an exaggeration.
The PETM draws attention to differences between the 
Westerhold (W) and Zachos (Z) d18O data. Zachos attributes the 
larger PETM response in W data to the shallow (less than 1 km) 
depth of the Walvis Ridge core in the Southeast Atlantic that 
anchors the PETM period in the W data (see Supplementary 
Material SM9). Given that the PETM was triggered by a rift in the 
floor of the North Atlantic and massive lava injection, it is not 
surprising that ocean temperature was elevated and circulation 
disrupted during the PETM. Nunes and Norris [132] conclude that 
ocean circulation changed at the start of the PETM with a shift in 
location of deep-water formation that delivered warmer waters 
to the deep sea, a circulation change that persisted at least 
40 000 years. With regard to differences in the early Cenozoic, 
Zachos notes (Supplementary Material SM9) a likely bias in the Z 
data with a heavy weighting of data from Southern Ocean sites 
(Kerguelen Plateau and Maud Rise), which were intended for 
study of climate of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.
Differences between the W and Z data sets have limited effect 
on our paper, as we apply separate scaling (Equations 7–14) to W 
and Z data to match observations at the LGM, mid-Holocene, and 
Oi-1 points. This approach addresses, e.g. the cumulative effect 
in combining data splices noted by Zachos in SM9. Further, we 
set the EECO global temperature relative to the Holocene and the 
PETM temperature relative to pre-PETM based on proxy- 
constrained, full-field, GCM analyses of Tierney et al. [122] and 
Zhu et al. [96] Nevertheless, there is much to learn from more 
precise study of the Cenozoic in general and the PETM 
in particular.
Policy implications require first an understanding of the role 
of aerosols in climate change.
Aerosols
The role of aerosols in climate change is uncertain because aero­
sol properties are not measured well enough to define their cli­
mate forcing. In this section we estimate aerosol climate forcing 
via aerosol effects on Earth’s temperature and Earth’s en­
ergy imbalance.
Aerosol impact is suggested by the gap between observed 
global warming and expected warming due to GHGs based on 
ECS inferred from paleoclimate (Fig. 13). Expected warming is 
from Eq. 5 with the normalized response function of the GISS 
(2020) model. Our best estimate for ECS, 1.2C per W/m2, yields a 
gap of 1.5C between expected and actual warming in 2022. 
Aerosols are the likely cooling source. The other negative forcing 
discussed by IPCC—surface albedo change—is estimated by IPCC 
(Chapter 7, Table 7.8) to be –0.12 ± 0.1 W/m2, an order of magni­
tude smaller than aerosol forcing [12]. Thus, for clarity, we focus 
on GHGs and aerosols.
Absence of global warming over the period 1850–1920 
(Supplementary Fig. S1 of IPCC AR6 WG1 report [12]) is a clue 
about aerosol forcing. GHG forcing increased 0.54 W/m2 in 1850– 
1920, which causes expected warming 0.3–0.4C by 1920 for ECS 
¼ 1.2C per W/m2 (Equation 5). Natural forcings—solar irradiance 
and volcanoes—may contribute to lack of warming, but a persua­
sive case for the required forcing has not been made. Human- 
made aerosols are the likely offset of GHG warming. Such aerosol

cooling is a Faustian bargain [98] because payment in enhanced 
global warming will come due once we can no longer tolerate the 
air pollution. Ambient air pollution causes millions of deaths per 
year, with particulates most responsible [133, 134].
Evidence of aerosol forcing in the Holocene
In this section we infer evidence of human-made aerosols in the 
last half of the Holocene from the absence of global warming. 
Some proxy-based analyses [135] report cooling in the last half of 
the Holocene, but a recent analysis [50] that uses GCMs to over­
come spatial and temporal biases in proxy data finds rising global 
temperature in the first half of the Holocene followed by nearly 
constant temperature in the last 6000 years until the last few 
centuries (Fig. 14). Antarctic, deep ocean, and tropical sea surface 
data all show stable temperature in the last 6000 years 
(Supplementary Fig. S6 of reference [60]). GHG forcing increased 
0.5 W/m2 during those 6000 years (Fig. 15), yet Earth did not 
warm. Fast feedbacks alone should yield at least þ0.5C warming 
and 6000 years is long enough for slow feedbacks to also contrib­
ute. How can we interpret the absence of warming?
Humanity’s growing footprint deserves scrutiny. Ruddiman’s 
suggestion that deforestation and agriculture began to affect CO2 
6500 year ago and rice agriculture began to affect CH4 5000 years 
ago has been criticized [46] mainly because of the size of pro­
posed sources. Ruddiman sought sources sufficient to offset 
declines of CO2 and CH4 in prior interglacial periods, but such 
large sources are not needed to account for Holocene GHG levels. 
Paleoclimate GHG decreases are slow feedbacks that occur in 
concert with global cooling. However, if global cooling did not oc­
cur in the past 6000 years, feedbacks did not occur. Earth orbital 
parameters 6000 years ago kept the Southern Ocean warm, as 
needed to maintain strong overturning ocean circulation [137] 
and minimize carbon sequestration in the deep ocean. Maximum 
insolation at 60S was in late-spring (mid-November); since then, 
maximum insolation at 60S slowly advanced through the year, 
recently reaching mid-summer (mid-January, Fig. 26b of Ice Melt 
[13]). Maximum insolation from late-spring through mid- 
summer is optimum to warm the Southern Ocean and promote 
early warm-season ice melt, which reduces surface albedo and 
magnifies regional warming [45].
GHG forcing of –0.2 W/m2 in 10–6 kyBP (Fig. 15) was exceeded 
by forcing of þ1 W/m2 due to ice sheet shrinkage (Supplementary 
Material in Target CO2 [60]) for a 40 m sea level rise (Fig. 16). Net 
0.8 W/m2 forcing produced expected 1C global warming (Fig. 14). 
The mystery is the absence of warming in the past 6000 years. 
Hansen et al. [45] suggested that aerosol cooling offset GHG 
warming. Growing population, agriculture and land clearance 
produced aerosols and CO2; wood was the main fuel for cooking 
and heating. Nonlinear aerosol forcing is largest in a pristine at­
mosphere, so it is unsurprising that aerosols tended to offset CO2 
warming as civilization developed. Hemispheric differences 
could provide a check. GHG forcing is global, while aerosol forc­
ing is mainly in the Northern Hemisphere. Global offset implies a 
net negative Northern Hemisphere forcing and positive Southern 
Hemisphere forcing. Thus, data and modeling studies (including 
orbital effects) of regional response are warranted but beyond 
the scope of this paper.
Industrial era aerosols
Scientific advances often face early resistance from other scien­
tists [139]. Examples are the snowball Earth hypothesis [140] and 
the role of an asteroid impact in extinction of non-avian dino­
saurs [141], which initially were highly controversial but are now 
more widely accepted. Ruddiman’s hypothesis, right or wrong, is 
still controversial. Thus, we minimize this issue by showing aero­
sol effects with and without preindustrial human-made aerosols.
Global aerosols are not monitored with detail needed to define 
aerosol climate forcing [142, 143]. IPCC12 estimates forcing

(Fig. 17a) from assumed precursor emissions, a herculean task due 
to many aerosol types and complex cloud effects. Aerosol forcing 
uncertainty is comparable to its estimated value (Fig. 17a), which 
is constrained more by observed global temperature change than 
by aerosol measurements [144]. IPCC’s best estimate of aerosol 
forcing (Fig. 17) and GHG history define the percent of GHG forcing 
offset by aerosol cooling—the dark blue area in Fig. 17b. However, 
if human-made aerosol forcing was −0.5 W/m2 by 1750, offsetting 
þ0.5 W/m2 GHG forcing, this forcing should be included. Such 
aerosol forcing—largely via effects of land use and biomass fuels 
on clouds—continues today. Thirty million people in the United 
States use wood for heating [145]. Such fuels are also common in 
Europe [146, 147] and much of the world.
Figure 17b encapsulates two alternative views of aerosol his­
tory. IPCC aerosol forcing slowly becomes important relative to 
GHG forcing. In our view, civilization always produced aerosols as 
well as GHGs. As sea level stabilized, organized societies and popu­
lation grew as coastal biologic productivity increased [148] and ag­
riculture developed. Wood was the main fuel. Aerosols travel great 
distances, as shown by Asian aerosols in North America [149]. 
Humans contributed to both rising GHG and aerosol climate forc­
ings in the past 6000 years. One result is that human-caused aero­
sol climate forcing is at least 0.5 W/m2 more than usually 
assumed. Thus, the Faustian payment that will eventually come 
due is also larger, as discussed in Summary section.
Ambiguity in aerosol climate forcing
In this section we discuss uncertainty in the aerosol forcing. We 
discuss why global warming in the past century—often used to 
infer climate sensitivity—is ill-suited for that purpose.
Recent global warming does not yield a unique ECS because 
warming depends on three major unknowns with only two basic 
constraints. Unknowns are ECS, net climate forcing (aerosol forc­
ing is unmeasured), and ocean mixing (many ocean models are 
too diffusive). Constraints are observed global temperature 
change and Earth’s energy imbalance (EEI) [80]. Knutti [150] and 
Hansen [75] suggest that many climate models compensate for 
excessive ocean mixing (which reduces surface warming) by us­
ing aerosol forcing less negative than the real world, thus achiev­
ing realistic surface warming. This issue is unresolved and 
complicated by the finding that cloud feedbacks can buffer ocean 
heat uptake (Climate response time section), affecting interpreta­
tion of EEI.
IPCC AR6 WG1 best estimate of aerosol forcing (Table AIII.3) 
[12] is near maximum (negative) value by 1975, then nearly con­
stant until rising in the 21st century to –1.09 W/m2 in 2019 
(Fig. 18). We use this IPCC aerosol forcing in climate simulations 
here. We also use an alternative aerosol scenario [151] that 
reaches –1.63 W/m2 in 2010 relative to 1880 and –1.8 W/m2 rela­
tive to 1850 (Fig. 18) based on modeling of Koch [152] that in­
cluded changing technology factors defined by Novakov [153]. 
This alternative scenario11 is comparable to the forcing in some 
current aerosol models (Fig. 18). Human-made aerosol forcing 
relative to several millennia ago may be even more negative, by 
about –0.5 W/m2 as discussed above, but the additional forcing 
was offset by increasing GHGs and thus those additional forcings 
are neglected, with climate assumed to be in approximate equi­
librium in 1850.
Many combinations of climate sensitivity and aerosol forcing 
can fit observed global warming. The GISS (2014) model (ECS ¼
2.6C) with IPCC AR6 aerosol forcing can match observed warm­
ing (Fig. 19) in the last half century (when human-made climate 
forcing overwhelmed natural forcings, unforced climate variabil­
ity, and flaws in observations). However, agreement also can be 
achieved by climate models with high ECS. The GISS (2020) model 
(with ECS ¼ 3.5C) yields greater warming than observed if IPCC

aerosol forcing is used, but less than observed for the alternative 
aerosol scenario (Fig. 19). This latter aerosol scenario achieves 
agreement with observed warming if ECS 4C (green curve in  
Fig. 19).12 Agreement can be achieved with even higher ECS by 
use of a still more negative aerosol forcing.
The issue we raise is the magnitude of the aerosol forcing, 
with implications for future warming when particulate air pollu­
tion is likely to be reduced. We suggest that IPCC reports may 
have gravitated toward climate sensitivity near 3C for 2  CO2 in 
part because of difficulty that models have in realistically simu­
lating amplifying cloud feedbacks and a climate model tendency 
for excessive mixing of heat into the deep ocean. Our finding 
from paleoclimate analysis that ECS is 1.2C ± 0.3C per W/m2 
(4.8C ± 1.2C for 2  CO2) implies that the (unmeasured) aerosol 
forcing must be more negative than IPCC’s best estimate. In 
turn—because aerosol-cloud interactions are the main source of 
uncertainty in aerosol forcing—this finding emphasizes the need 
to measure both global aerosol and cloud particle properties.
The case for monitoring global aerosol climate forcing will 
grow as recognition of the need to slow and reverse climate 
change emerges. Aerosol and cloud particle microphysics must 
be measured with precision adequate to define the forcing [142, 
158]. In the absence of such Keeling-like global monitoring, 
progress can be made via more limited satellite measurements of 
aerosol and cloud properties, field studies, and aerosol and 
cloud modeling. As described next, a great opportunity to 
study aerosol and cloud physics is provided by a recent change in 
the IMO (International Maritime Organization) regulations on 
ship emissions.
The great inadvertent aerosol experiment
Sulfate aerosols are cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), so sulfate 
emissions by ships result in a larger number of smaller cloud par­
ticles, thus affecting cloud albedo and cloud lifetime [144]. Ships 
provide a large percentage of sulfates in the North Pacific and 
North Atlantic regions (Fig. 20). It has been suggested that cooling 
by these clouds is overestimated because of cloud liquid water 
adjustments [159], but Manshausen et al. [160] present evidence 
that liquid water path (LWP) effects are substantial even in 
regions without visible ship-tracks; they estimate a LWP forcing 
−0.76 ± 0.27 W/m2, in stark contrast with the IPCC estimate of 
þ0.2 ± 0.2 W/m2. Wall et al. [161] use satellite observations to 
quantify relationships between sulfates and low-level clouds; 
they estimate a sulfate indirect aerosol forcing of −1.11 ± 0.43 W/ 
m2 over the global ocean. The range of aerosol forcings used in 
CMIP6 and AR6 GCMs (small blue bar in Fig. 18) is not a measure 
of aerosol forcing uncertainty. The larger bar, from Chapter 7 
[162] of AR6, has negative forcing as great as –2 W/m2, but even 
that does not measure the full uncertainty.
Changes of IMO emission regulations provide a great opportu­
nity for insight into aerosol climate forcing. Sulfur content of 
fuels was limited to 1% in 2010 near the coasts of North America

and in the North Sea, Baltic Sea and English Channel, and further 
restricted there to 0.1% in 2015 [163]. In 2020 a limit of 0.5% was 
imposed worldwide. The 1% limit did not have a noticeable effect 
on ship-tracks, but a striking reduction of ship-tracks was found 
after the 2015 IMO regulations, especially in the regions near 
land where emissions were specifically limited [164]. Following 
the additional 2020 regulations [165], global ship-tracks were re­
duced more than 50% [166].
Earth’s albedo (reflectivity) measured by CERES (Clouds and 
Earth’s Radiant Energy System) satellite-borne instruments [81] 
over the 22-years March 2000 to March 2022 reveal a decrease of 
albedo and thus an increase of absorbed solar energy coinciding 
with the 2015 change of IMO emission regulations. Global 
absorbed solar energy is þ 1.05 W/m2 in the period January 2015 
through December 2022 relative to the mean for the first 10 years 
of data (Fig. 21). This increase is 5 times greater than the stan­
dard deviation (0.21 W/m2) of annual absorbed solar energy in 
the first 10 years of data and 4.5 times greater than the standard 
deviation (0.23 W/m2) of CERES data through December 2014. 
The increase of absorbed solar energy is notably larger than esti­
mated potential CERES instrument drift, which is <0.085 W/m2 
per decade [81]. Increased solar energy absorption occurred de­
spite 2015–2020 being the declining phase of the 11-year solar 
irradiance cycle [167]. Nor can increased absorption be attributed 
to correlation of Earth’s albedo (and absorbed solar energy) with 
the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO): the PDO did shift to the 
positive phase in 2014–2017, but it returned to the negative phase 
in 2017–2022 [168].
Given the large increase of absorbed solar energy, cloud 
changes are likely the main cause. Quantitative analysis [168] of 
contributions to the 20-year trend of absorbed solar energy show 
that clouds provide most of the change. Surface albedo decrease 
due to sea ice decline contributes to the 20-year trend in the 
Northern Hemisphere, but that sea ice decline occurred espe­
cially in 2007, with minimum sea ice cover reached in 2012; over 
the past decade as global and hemispheric albedos declined, sea 
ice had little trend [169]. Potential causes of the cloud changes in­
clude: (1) reduced aerosol forcing, (2) cloud feedbacks to global 
warming, (3) natural variability [170]. Absorbed solar energy was 
0.77 W/m2 greater in Jan2015-Dec2022 than in the first decade of 
CERES data at latitudes 20–60S (Fig. 22), a region of relatively lit­
tle ship traffic. This change is an order of magnitude larger than 
the estimate of potential detector degradation [81].
Climate models predict a reduction of cloud albedo in this re­
gion as a feedback effect driven by global warming [12] (Sec. 
7.4.2.4). Continued monitoring of absorbed energy can confirm 
the reality of the change, but without global monitoring of de­
tailed physical properties of aerosols and clouds [142], it will be 
difficult to apportion observed change among candidate causes.
North Pacific and North Atlantic regions of heavy ship traffic 
are ripe for detailed study of cloud changes and their causes, al­
though unforced cloud variability is large in such sub-global 
regions. Both regions have increased absorption of solar radiation 
after 2015 (Fig. 22). The 2014–2017 maximum absorption in the 
North Pacific is likely enhanced by reduced cloud cover during 
the positive PDO, but the more recent high absorption is during 
the negative PDO phase. In the North Atlantic, persistence of in­
creased absorption for several years exceeds prior variability, but 
longer records plus aerosol and cloud microphysical data are 
needed for interpretation.
Summary
Climate change is characterized by delayed response and ampli­
fying feedbacks. Delayed response makes human-made climate 
forcing a threat to today’s public and future generations because 
of the practical difficulty of reversing the forcing once conse­
quences become apparent. Feedbacks determine climate sensi­
tivity to any applied forcing. We find that Earth’s climate is very 
sensitive—more sensitive than the best estimate of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)—which 
implies that there is a great amount of climate change ‘in the 
pipeline.’ Extraordinary actions are needed to reduce the net 
human-made climate forcing, as is required to reduce global

ity and nature.
Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS)
The 1979 Charney study [4] considered an idealized climate sen­
sitivity in which ice sheets and non-CO2 GHGs are fixed. The 
Charney group estimated that the equilibrium response to 2 
CO2, a forcing of 4 W/m2, was 3C, thus an ECS of 0.75C per W/ 
m2, with one standard deviation uncertainty r ¼ 0.375C. 
Charney’s estimate stood as the canonical ECS for more than 40 
years. The current IPCC report [12] concludes that 3C for 2 
CO2 is their best estimate for ECS.
We compare recent glacial and interglacial climates to infer 
ECS with a precision not possible with climate models alone. 
Uncertainty about Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) temperature has 
been resolved independently with consistent results by Tierney 
et al. [49] and Seltzer et al. [51]. The Tierney approach, using a col­
lection of geochemical temperature indicators in a global analy­
sis constrained by climate change patterns defined by a global 
climate model, is used by Osman et al. [50] to find peak LGM cool­
ing 7.0 ± 1C (2r, 95% confidence) at 21–18 kyBP. We show that, 
accounting for polar amplification, these analyses are consistent 
with the 5.8 ± 0.6C LGM cooling of land areas between 45S and 
35N found by Seltzer et al. using the temperature-dependent sol­
ubility of dissolved noble gases in ancient groundwater. The forc­
ing that maintained the 7C LGM cooling was the sum of 2.25 ± 
0.45 W/m2 (2r) from GHGs and 3.5 ± 1.0 W/m2 (2r) from the LGM 
surface albedo, thus 5.75 ± 1.1 W/m2 (2r). ECS implied by the 
LGM is thus 1.22 ± 0.29C (2r) per W/m2, which, at this final step, 
we round to 1.2 ± 0.3C per W/m2. For transparency, we have 
combined uncertainties via simple RMS (root-mean-square). ECS 
as low as 3C for 2  CO2 is excluded at the 3r level, i.e. with 
99.7% confidence.
More sophisticated mathematical analysis, which has merits 
but introduces opportunity for prior bias and obfuscation, is not 
essential; error assessment ultimately involves expert judgment. 
Instead, focus is needed on the largest source of error: LGM sur­
face albedo change, which is uncertain because of the effect of 
cloud shielding on the efficacy of the forcing. As cloud modeling 
is advancing rapidly, this topic is ripe for collaboration of CMIP 
[53] (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) with PMIP [54] 
(Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project). Simulations 
should include at the same time change of surface albedo and to­
pography of ice sheets, vegetation change, and exposure of conti­
nental shelves due to lower sea level.
Knowledge of climate sensitivity can be advanced further via 
analysis of the wide climate range in the Cenozoic era (Earth sys­
tem sensitivity section). However, interpretation of data and 
models, and especially projections of climate change, depend on 
understanding of climate response time.
Climate response time
We expected climate response time—the time for climate to ap­
proach a new equilibrium after imposition of a forcing—to be­
come faster as mixing of heat in ocean models improved [75]. 
That expectation was not met when we compared two genera­
tions of the GISS GCM (global climate model). The GISS (2020) 
GCM is improved [32, 33] in its ocean simulation over the GISS 
(2014) GCM as a result of higher vertical and horizontal resolu­
tion, more realistic parameterization of sub-grid scale motions, 
and correction of errors in the ocean computer program [32]. Yet 
the time for the model to achieve 63% of its equilibrium response 
remained about 100 years. There are two reasons for this: one 
that is obvious and one that is more interesting and informative.
The surface in the newer model warms as fast as in the older 
model, but it must achieve greater warming to reach 63% of equi­
librium because its ECS is higher, which is one reason that the re­
sponse time remains long. The other reason is that Earth’s 
energy imbalance (EEI) in the newer model decreases rapidly. EEI 
defines the rate that heat is pumped into the ocean, so a smaller 
EEI implies a longer time for the ocean to reach its new equilib­
rium temperature. Quick drop of EEI—in the first year after intro­
duction of the forcing—implies existence of ultrafast feedback in 
the GISS (2020) model. For want of an alternative with such a 
large effect on Earth’s energy budget, we infer a rapid cloud feed­
back and we suggest (Slow, fast and ultrafast feedbacks section) 
a set of brief GCM runs that define cloud changes and other diag­
nostic quantities to an arbitrary accuracy.
The Charney report [4] recognized that clouds were a main 
cause of a wide range in ECS estimates. Today, clouds still cast 
uncertainty on climate predictions. Several CMIP6 [34] GCMs 
have ECS of 4–6C for 2CO2 [171, 172] with the high sensitivity 
caused by cloud feedbacks [84]. As cloud modeling progresses, it 
will aid understanding if climate models report their 2  CO2 re­
sponse functions for both temperature and EEI (Earth’s en­
ergy imbalance).
Fast EEI response—faster than global temperature response— 
has a practical effect: observed EEI understates the reduction of 
climate forcing required to stabilize climate. Although the mag­
nitude of this effect is uncertain (see Supplementary Material 
SM6), it makes the task of restoring a hospitable climate and sav­
ing coastal cities more challenging. On the other hand, long cli­
mate response time implies the potential for educated policies to 
affect the climate outcome before the most undesirable conse­
quences occur.
The time required for climate to reach a new equilibrium is 
relevant to policy (Perspective on policy implications section), 
but there is another response time of practical importance. With 
climate in a state of disequilibrium, how much time do we have 
before we pass the point of no return, the point where major cli­
mate impacts are locked in, beyond our ability to control? That’s 
a complex matter; it requires understanding of ‘slow’ feedbacks, 
especially ice sheets. It also depends on how far climate is out of 
equilibrium. Thus, we first consider the full Earth system 
sensitivity.
Earth system sensitivity (ESS)
The Cenozoic era—the past 66 million years—provides an oppor­
tunity to study Earth system sensitivity via a consistent analysis 
for climate ranging from hothouse conditions with Earth 15C 
warmer and sea level 60 m higher than preindustrial climate to 
glacial conditions with Earth 7C cooler and sea level 120 m lower 
than preindustrial. Atmospheric CO2 amount in the past 800 000 
years (Fig. 2), confirms expectation that CO2 is the main control 
knob [87] on global temperature. We can assume this control 
existed when CO2 amount varied due to CO2 emissions caused by 
plate tectonics (continental drift). The two-step [91] that the 
Indian plate executed as it moved through the Tethys (now 
Indian) ocean left a signature in atmospheric CO2 and global tem­
perature. CO2 emissions from subduction of ocean crust were 
greatest when the Indian plate was moving fastest (inset, Fig. 6) 
and peaked at its hard collision with the Eurasian plate at 50 
MyBP. Diminishing metamorphic CO2 emissions continue as the 
Indian plate is subducted beneath the Eurasian plate, pushing up 
the

weathering and burial of organic carbon exceeds emissions. 
Motion of the Indian Plate thus dominates the broad sweep of 
Cenozoic CO2, but igneous provinces play a role. The North 
Atlantic Igneous Province (caused by a rift in the sea floor as 
Greenland pulled away from Europe) that triggered the 
Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) event about 56 
MyBP and the Columbia River Flood Basalt about 15 MyBP (Fig. 6) 
are most notable.
We infer the Cenozoic history of sea surface temperature 
(SST) at sites of deepwater formation from the oxygen isotope 
d18O in shells of deep-ocean-dwelling foraminifera preserved in 
ocean sediments [44, 90]. High latitude SST change—including a 
correction term as SST approaches the freezing point—provides 
an accurate estimate of global surface temperature change. This 
Cenozoic temperature history and climate sensitivity inferred 
from the LGM cooling yield an estimate of Cenozoic CO2 history. 
We suggest that this whole-Cenozoic approach may define the 
CO2 history (Fig. 9a) more accurately than CO2 proxy measure­
ments. We find CO2 about 325 ppm in the early Pliocene and 450 
ppm at transition to glaciated Antarctica. Global climate models 
(GCMs) that isolate on the Pliocene tend to use CO2 levels of order 
400 ppm in attempts to match actual Pliocene warmth and ice 
sheet models use CO2 of order 700 ppm or greater to achieve ice 
sheet disintegration on Antarctica, which suggests that the mod­
els are not realistically capturing amplifying feedback processes 
(see Cenozoic CO2 section).
The Cenozoic provides a perspective on present greenhouse 
gas (GHG) levels. The dashed line in Fig. 23 is the ‘we are here’ 
level of GHG climate forcing. Today’s GHG forcing of 4.6 W/m2 is 
relative to mid-Holocene CO2 of 260 ppm; we present evidence in 
Cenozoic CO2 section that 260 ppm is the natural Holocene CO2 
level. Human-caused GHG forcing today is already above the 
level needed to deglaciate Antarctica, if such forcing is left in 
place long enough. We do not predict full deglaciation of 
Antarctica on a time scale people care about—rather we draw at­
tention to how far today’s climate is out of equilibrium with 
today’s GHG level. This is one measure of how strongly humanity 
is pushing the climate system. Stabilizing climate requires re­
moving the disequilibrium by reducing human-made climate 
forcing. A danger is that it will become difficult or implausible to 
prevent large sea level rise, if deglaciation is allowed to get 
well underway.
GHGs are not the only large human-made climate forcing. 
Understanding of ongoing climate change requires that we also 
include the effect of aerosols (fine airborne particles).
Aerosols
Aerosol climate forcing is larger than the IPCC AR6 estimate and 
has likely been significant for millennia. We know of no other 
persuasive explanation for absence of global warming in the last 
half of the Holocene (Fig. 14) as GHG forcing increased 0.5 W/m2 
(Fig. 15). Climate models without a growing negative aerosol forc­
ing yield notable warming in that period [173], a warming that, in 
fact, did not occur. Negative aerosol forcing, increasing as civili­
zation developed and population grew, is expected. As humans 
burned fuels at a growing rate—wood and other biomass for mil­
lennia and fossil fuels in the industrial era—aerosols as well as 
GHGs were an abundant, growing, biproduct. The aerosol source 
from wood-burning has continued in modern times [146]. GHGs 
are long-lived and accumulate, so their forcing dominates even­
tually, unless aerosol emissions grow higher and higher—the 
Faustian bargain [98].
Multiple lines of evidence show that aerosol forcing peaked 
early this century [174]. Emissions from the largest sources, 
China and India, were increasing in 2000, but by 2010 when the 
first limits on ship emissions were imposed, China’s emissions 
were declining. We estimate peak (negative) aerosol forcing as at 
least 1.5–2 W/m2, with turning point at 2010, consistent with  
Fig. 3 of Bauer et al. [175] GHG plus aerosol forcing grew þ0.3 W/ 
m2 per decade (GHGs: þ0.45, aerosols: –0.15) during 1970–2010, 
which produced warming of 0.18C per decade. With current pol­
icies, we expect climate forcing for a few decades post-2010 to in­
crease 0.5–06 W/m2 per decade and produce global warming of at 
least þ0.27C per decade. In that case, global warming will reach 
1.5C in the 2020s and 2C before 2050 (Fig. 24). Such acceleration 
is dangerous in a climate system that is already far out of equilib­
rium and dominated by multiple amplifying feedbacks.
The sharp change of ship emissions in 2020 (The great inad­
vertent aerosol experiment section) provides an indirect measure 
of aerosol effects. Diamond [176] finds a cloud brightness de­
crease of order 1 W/m2 in a shipping corridor. We find a larger ef­
fect, increased absorption of about 3 W/m2 in regions of heavy 
ship traffic in the North Atlantic and North Pacific (Fig. 22), but a 
longer record is needed to define significance. However, the sin­
gle best sentinel for global climate change is Earth’s en­
ergy imbalance.
Earth’s energy imbalance
Earth’s energy imbalance (EEI) is the net gain (or loss) of energy

about 240 W/m2 averaged over the entire planetary surface), but 
change of EEI can be well-measured from space [81]. Absolute 
calibration is from the change of heat in the heat reservoirs, 
mainly the global ocean, over a period of at least a decade, as 
needed to reduce error due to the finite number of places that 
the ocean is sampled [80]. EEI varies year-to-year (Fig. 25), largely 
because global cloud amount varies with weather and ocean dy­
namics, but averaged over several years EEI helps inform us 
about what is needed to stabilize climate.
The data indicate that EEI has doubled since the first decade 
of this century (Fig. 25). This increase is one basis for our predic­
tion of post-2010 acceleration of the global warming rate. The EEI 
increase may be partly due to restrictions on maritime aerosol 
precursor emissions imposed in 2015 and 2020 (The great inad­
vertent aerosol experiment section), but the growth rate of GHG 
climate forcing also increased in 2015 and since has remained at 
the higher level (Equilibrium warming versus committed warm­
ing section).
Reduction of climate forcing needed to reduce EEI to zero is 
greater than EEI because of ultrafast cloud feedback (Slow, fast 
and ultrafast feedbacks section), but the magnitude of this effect 
is uncertain (SM6). Cloud feedbacks are only beginning to be sim­
ulated well, but climate sensitivity near 1.2C per W/m2 implies 
that the net cloud feedback is large and deserves greater atten­
tion. Precise monitoring of EEI is essential as a sentinel for future 
climate change and to assess efforts to stabilize climate and 
avoid undesirable consequences. Global satellite monitoring of 
geographical and temporal changes of EEI and ocean in situ moni­
toring (especially in polar regions of rapid change) are both 
needed for the sake of understanding ongoing climate change.
Equilibrium warming versus committed warming
Equilibrium warming for today’s climate forcing is the warming re­
quired to restore Earth’s energy balance if atmospheric composi­
tion is fixed at today’s conditions. Equilibrium warming is a 
benchmark that can be evaluated from atmospheric composition 
and paleoclimate data, with little involvement of climate models. 
It is the standard benchmark used in definition of the Charney ECS 
(equilibrium climate sensitivity excluding slow feedbacks) [4] and 
ESS (Earth system sensitivity, which includes slow feedbacks such 
as ice sheet size) [71]. GHG climate forcing now is 4.6 W/m2 relative 
to the mid-Holocene (7 kyBP) or 4.1 W/m2 relative to 1750. There is 
little merit in debating whether GHG forcing is 4.6 or 4.1 W/m2 be­
cause it is still increasing 0.5 W/m2 per decade (Perspective on pol­
icy implications section). ECS response to 4.6 W/m2 forcing for 
climate sensitivity 1.2C per W/m2 is 5.5C. The eventual Earth sys­
tem response (ESS) to sustained 4.6 W/m2 forcing is about 10C 
(Earth system sensitivity section), because that forcing is large 
enough to deglaciate Antarctica (Fig. 23). Net human-made forcing 
today is probably near 3 W/m2 due to negative aerosol forcing. 
Even 3 W/m2 may be sufficient to largely deglaciate Antarctica, if 
the forcing is left in place permanently (Fig. 23).
‘Committed warming’ is less precisely defined; even in the 
current IPCC report [12] (p. 2222) it has multiple definitions. One 
concept is the warming that occurs if human-made GHG emis­
sions cease today, but that definition is ill-posed as well as unre­
alistic. Do aerosol emissions also cease? That would cause a 
sudden leap in Earth’s energy imbalance, a ‘termination shock,’ 
as the cooling effect of human-made aerosols disappears. A more 
useful definition is the warming that will occur with plausibly 
rapid phasedown of GHG emissions, including comparison with 
ongoing reality. However, the required ‘integrated assessment 
models,’ while useful, are complex and contain questionable 
assumptions that can mislead policy (see Perspective on policy 
implications section).
Nature’s capacity for restoration provides hope that future 
warming can be limited, if humanity moves promptly toward 
sustainable energy and climate policies. Earth’s ability to remove 
human-made CO2 emissions from the atmosphere is revealed by  
Fig. 26. Fossil fuel emissions now total more than 10 GtC/year, 
which is almost 5 ppm of CO2, yet CO2 in the air is only increasing 
2.5 ppm/year. The other half is being taken up by the ocean, solid 
land, and biosphere. Indeed, Earth is taking up even more be­
cause deforestation, fires, and poor agricultural and forestry 
practices are additional human-made CO2 sources. If human 
emissions ceased, atmospheric CO2 would initially decline a few

ppm per year, but uptake would soon slow—it would take millen­
nia for CO2 to reach preindustrial levels [131]. This underscores 
the difficulty of restoring Earth’s energy balance via emission 
reductions alone. Furthermore, fossil fuels have raised living 
standards in most of the world and still provide 80% of the 
world’s energy, which contributes to a policy inertia. As the real­
ity of climate change emerges, the delayed response of climate 
and amplifying feedbacks assure that the world has already set 
sail onto even more turbulent climate seas. Scientists must do 
their best to help the public understand policy options that may 
preserve and restore a propitious climate for future generations.
Perspective on policy implications
This section is the first author’s perspective based on more than 
20 years of experience on policy issues that began with a paper 
[179] and two workshops [180] that he organized at the East-West 
Center in Hawaii, followed by meetings and workshops with util­
ity experts and trips to more than a dozen nations for discussions 
with government officials, energy experts, and environmental­
ists. The aim was to find a realistic scenario with a bright energy 
and climate future, with emphasis on cooperation between the 
West and nations with emerging or underdeveloped economies.
Energy, CO2 and the climate threat
The world’s energy and climate path has good reason: fossil fuels 
powered the industrial revolution and raised living standards. 
Fossil fuels still provide most of the world’s energy (Fig. 27a) and 
produce most CO2 emissions (Fig. 27b). Much of the world is still 
in early or middle stages of economic development. Energy is 
needed and fossil fuels are a convenient, affordable source of en­
ergy. One gallon (3.8 l) of gasoline (petrol) provides the work 
equivalent of more than 400 h labor by a healthy adult. These 
benefits are the basic reason for continued high emissions. The 
Covid pandemic dented emissions in 2020, but 2022 global emis­
sions were a record high level. Fossil fuel emissions from mature 
economies are beginning to fall due to increasing energy effi­
ciency, introduction of carbon-free energies, and export of 
manufacturing from mature economies to emerging economies. 
However, at least so far, those reductions have been more than 
offset by increasing emissions in developing nations (Fig. 28).
The potential for rising CO2 to be a serious threat to humanity 
was the reason for the 1979 Charney report, which confirmed 
that climate was likely sensitive to expected CO2 levels in the 
21st century. In the 1980s it emerged that high climate sensitivity 
implied a long delay between changing atmospheric composition 
and the full climate response. Ice core data revealed the impor­
tance of amplifying climate feedbacks. A climate characterized 
by delayed response and amplifying feedbacks is especially dan­
gerous because the public and policymakers are unlikely to make 
fundamental changes in world energy systems until they see visi­
ble evidence of the threat. Thus, it is incumbent on scientists to 
make this situation clear to the public as soon as possible. That 
task is complicated by the phenomenon of scientific reticence.

Scientific reticence
Bernard Barber decried the absence of attention to scientific reti­
cence, a tendency of scientists to resist scientific discovery or 
new ideas [139]. Richard Feynman needled fellow physicists 
about their reticence to challenge authority [181], specifically to 
correct the electron charge that Millikan derived in his famous 
oil drop experiment. Later researchers moved Millikan’s result 
bit by bit—experimental uncertainties allow judgment—reaching 
an accurate result only after years. Their reticence embarrassed 
the physics community but caused no harm to society. A factor 
that may contribute to reticence among climate scientists is 
‘delay discounting:’ preference for immediate over delayed 
rewards [182]. The penalty for ‘crying wolf’ is immediate, while 
the danger of being blamed for ‘fiddling while Rome was burning’ 
is distant. One of us has noted [183] that larding of papers and 
proposals with caveats and uncertainties increases chances of 
obtaining research support. ‘Gradualism’ that results from reti­
cence is comfortable and well-suited for maintaining long-term 
support. Gradualism is apparent in IPCC’s history in evaluating 
climate sensitivity as summarized in our present paper. Barber 
identifies professional specialization—which causes ‘outsiders’ 
to be ignored by ‘insiders’—as one cause of reticence; specializa­
tion is relevant to ocean and ice sheet dynamics, matters upon 
which the future of young people hangs.
Discussion [184] with field glaciologists13 20 years ago revealed 
frustration with IPCC’s ice sheet assessment. One glaciologist 
said—about a photo [185] of a moulin (a vertical shaft that carries 
meltwater to the base of the Greenland ice sheet)—‘the whole ice 
sheet is going down that damned hole!’ Concern was based on 
observed ice sheet changes and paleoclimate evidence of sea 
level rise by several meters in a century, implying that ice sheet 
collapse is an exponential process. Thus, as an alternative to ice 
sheet models, we carried out a study described in Ice Melt [13]. In 
a GCM simulation, we added a growing freshwater flux to the 
ocean surface mixed layer around Greenland and Antarctica, 
with the flux in the early 21st century based on estimates from in 
situ glaciological studies [186] and satellite data on sea level 
trends near Antarctica [187]. Doubling times of 10 and 20 years 
were used for the growth of freshwater flux. One merit of our 
GCM was reduced, more realistic, small-scale ocean mixing, with 
a result that Antarctic Bottom Water formed close to the 
Antarctic coast [13], as in the real world. Growth of meltwater 
and GHG emissions led to shutdown of the North Atlantic and 
Southern Ocean overturning circulations, amplified warming at 
the foot of the ice shelves that buttress the ice sheets, and other 
feedbacks consistent with ‘nonlinearly growing sea level rise, 
reaching several meters in 50–150 years’ [13]. Shutdown of ocean 
overturning circulation occurs this century, as early as midcen­
tury. The 50–150-year time scale for multimeter sea level rise is 
consistent with the 10–20-year range for ice melt doubling time. 
Real-world ice melt will not follow a smooth curve, but its growth 
rate is likely to accelerate in coming years due to increasing heat 
flux into the ocean (Fig. 25).
We submitted Ice Melt to a journal that makes reviews publicly 
available [188]. One reviewer, an IPCC lead author, seemed intent 
on blocking publication, while the other reviewer described the 
paper as a ‘masterwork of scholarly synthesis, modeling virtuos­
ity, and insight, with profound implications’. Thus, the editor 
obtained additional reviewers, who recommended publication. 
Promptly, an indictment was published [189] of our conclusion 
that continued high GHG emissions would cause shutdown of 
the AMOC (Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation) this 
century. The 15 authors, representing leading GCM groups, used 
21 climate projections from eight ‘ … state-of-the-science, IPCC 
class … ’ GCMs to conclude that ‘ … the probability of an AMOC 
collapse is negligible. This is contrary to a recent modeling study 
[Hansen et al., 2016] that used a much larger, and in our assess­
ment unrealistic, Northern Hemisphere freshwater forcing … 
According to our probabilistic assessment, the likelihood of an 
AMOC collapse remains very small (<1% probability) if global 
warming is below  5K … ’[189]. They treated the ensemble of 
their model results as if it were the probability distribution for 
the real world.
In contrast, we used paleoclimate evidence, global modeling, 
and ongoing climate observations. Paleoclimate data [190] 
showed that AMOC shutdown is not unusual and occurred in the 
Eemian (when global temperature was similar to today), and also 
that sea level in the Eemian rose a few meters within a century 
[191] with the likely source being collapse of the West Antarctic 
ice sheet. Although we would not assert that our model corrected 
all excessive ocean mixing, the higher vertical resolution and im­
proved mixing increased the sensitivity to freshwater flux, as 
confirmed in later tests [192]. Modern observations showed and 
continue to add evidence that the overturning Southern Ocean 
[193, 194] and North Atlantic [195] are already slowing. Growth of 
meltwater injection onto the Southern [196] and North Atlantic 
Oceans [197] is consistent with a doubling time of 10–20 years. 
High climate sensitivity inferred in our present paper also implies 
there will be a greater increase of precipitation on polar oceans 
than that in most climate models.
The indictment of Ice Melt by Bakker et al. [189] was accepted 
by the research community. Papers on the same topics ignored 
our paper or referred to it parenthetically with a note that we 
used unrealistic melt rates, even though these were based on 
observations. Ice Melt was blackballed in IPCC’s AR6 report, which 
is a form of censorship [14]. Science usually acknowledges alter­
native views and grants ultimate authority to nature. In the opin­
ion of our first author, IPCC does not want its authority 
challenged and is comfortable with gradualism. Caution has 
merits, but the delayed response and amplifying feedbacks of cli­
mate make excessive reticence a danger. Our present paper—via 
revelation that the equilibrium response to current atmospheric 
composition is a nearly ice-free Antarctica—amplifies concern 
about locking in nonlinearly growing sea level rise. Also, our con­
clusion that CO2 was about 450 ppm at Antarctic glaciation dis­
parages ice sheet models. Portions of the ice sheets may be 
recalcitrant to rapid change, but enough ice is in contact with the 
ocean to provide of the order of 25 m (80 feet) of sea level rise. 
Thus, if we allow a few meters of sea level rise, we may lock in 
much larger sea level rise.
Climate change responsibilities
The industrial revolution began in the U.K., which was the largest 
source of fossil fuel emissions in the 19th century (Fig. 29a), but 
development soon moved to Germany, the rest of Europe, and 
the U.S. Nearly half of global emissions were from the U.S. in the 
early 20th century, and the U.S. is presently the largest source of 
cumulative emissions (Fig. 29b) that drive climate change [198, 
199]. Mature economies, mainly in the West, are responsible for 
most cumulative emissions, especially on a per capita basis 
(Fig. 30). Growth of emissions is now occurring in emerging econ­
omies (Figs 28 and 29a). China’s cumulative emissions will even­
tually pass those of the U.S. in the absence of a successful effort 
to replace coal with carbon-free energy.

Greenhouse gas emissions situation
The United Nations uses a target for maximum global warming 
to cajole progress in limiting climate change. The 2015 Paris 
Agreement [201] aimed to hold ‘the increase in the global average 
temperature to well below 2C above the pre-industrial levels 
and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C 
above the pre-industrial levels.’ The IPCC AR5 report added a cli­
mate forcing scenario, RCP2.6, with a rapid decrease of GHG cli­
mate forcings, as needed to prevent global warming from 
exceeding 2C. Since then, a gap between that scenario and real­
ity opened and is growing (Fig. 31). The 0.03 W/m2 gap in 2022 
could be closed by extracting CO2 from the air. However, required 
negative emissions (CO2 extracted from the air and stored per­
manently) must be larger than the desired atmospheric CO2 re­
duction by a factor of about 1.7 [63]. Thus, the required CO2 
extraction is 2.1 ppm, which is 7.6 GtC. Based on a pilot direct-air 
carbon capture plant, Keith [202] estimates an extraction cost of 
$450–920 per tC, as clarified elsewhere [203]. Keith’s cost range 
yields an extraction cost of $3.4–7.0 trillion. That covers excess 
emissions in 2022 only; it is an annual cost. Given the difficulty 
the UN faced in raising $0.1 trillion for climate purposes and the 
growing emissions gap (Fig. 31), this example shows the need to 
reduce emissions as rapidly as practical and shows that carbon 
capture cannot be viewed as the solution, although it may play a 
role in a portfolio of policies, if its cost is driven down.
IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), the sci­
entific body advising the world on climate, has not bluntly in­
formed the world that the present precatory policy approach 
will not keep warming below 1.5C or even 2C. The ‘tragedy of 
the commons’ [204] is that, as long as fossil fuel pollution can 
be dumped in the air free of charge, agreements such as the 
Kyoto Protocol [205] and Paris Agreement have limited effect on 
global emissions. Political leaders profess ambitions for dubious 
net-zero emissions while fossil fuel extraction expands. IPCC 
scenarios that phase down human-made climate change 
amount to ‘a miracle will occur’. The IPCC scenario that moves 
rapidly to negative global emissions (RCP2.6) has vast biomass- 
burning powerplants that capture and sequester CO2, a nature- 
ravaging, food-security-threatening [206], proposition without 
scientific and engineering credibility and without a realistic 
chance of being deployed at scale and on time to address the cli­
mate threat.

Climate and energy policy
Climate science reveals the threat of being too late. ‘Being too 
late’ refers not only to warning of the climate threat, but also to 
technical advice on policy implications. Are we scientists not 
complicit if we allow reticence and comfort to obfuscate our de­
scription of the climate situation? Does our training, years of 
graduate study and decades of experience, not make us well- 
equipped to advise the public on the climate situation and its pol­
icy implications? As professionals with deep understanding of 
planetary change and as guardians of young people and their fu­
ture, do we not have an obligation, analogous to the code of 
ethics of medical professionals, to render to the public our full 
and unencumbered diagnosis? That is our objective.
The basis for the following opinions of the first author, to the 
extent not covered in this paper, will be described in a book in 
preparation [2]. We are in the early phase of a climate emer­
gency. The present huge planetary energy imbalance assures 
that climate will become less tolerable to humanity, with greater 
climate extremes, before it is feasible to reverse the trend. 
Reversing the trend is essential—we must cool the planet—for 
the sake of preserving shorelines and saving the world’s coastal 
cities. Cooling will also address other major problems caused by 
global warming. We should aim to return to a climate like that in 
which civilization developed, in which the nature that we know 
and love thrived. As far as is known, it is still feasible to do that 
without passing through irreversible disasters such as many- 
meter sea level rise.
Abundant, affordable, carbon-free energy is essential to 
achieve a world with propitious climate, while recognizing the 
rights and aspirations of all people. The staggering magnitude of 
the task is implied by global and national carbon intensities: car­
bon emissions per unit energy use (Fig. 32). Global carbon inten­
sity must decline to near zero over the next several decades. This 
chart—not vaporous promises of net zero future carbon emis­
sions inserted in integrated assessment models—should guide 
realistic assessment of progress toward clean energy. Policy must 
include apolitical targeting of support for development of low- 
cost carbon-free energy. All nations would do well to study stra­
tegic decisions of Sweden, which led past decarbonization efforts 
(Fig. 32) and is likely to lead in the quest for zero or negative car­
bon intensity that will be needed to achieve a bright future for 
today’s young people and future generations.
Given the global situation that we have allowed to develop, 
three actions are now essential.
First, underlying economic incentives must be installed glob­
ally to promote clean energy and discourage CO2 emissions. 
Thus, a rising price on GHG emissions is needed, enforced by bor­
der duties on products from nations without a carbon fee. Public 
buy-in and maximum efficacy require the funds to be distributed 
to the public, which will also address wealth disparity. 
Economists in the U.S. support carbon fee-and-dividend [207]; 
college and high school students join in advocacy [208]. A rising 
carbon price creates a level playing field for energy efficiency, re­
newable energy, nuclear power, and innovations; it would spur 
the thousands of ‘miracles’ needed for energy transition. 
However, instead, fossil fuels and renewable energy are now sub­
sidized. Thus, nuclear energy has been disadvantaged and ex­
cluded as a ‘clean development mechanism’ under the Kyoto 
Protocol, based on myths about nuclear energy unsupported by 
scientific fact [209]. A rising carbon price is crucial for decarbon­
ization, but not enough. Long-term planning is needed. Sweden 
provides an example: 50 years ago, its government decided to re­
place fossil fuel power stations with nuclear energy, which led to 
its extraordinary and rapid decarbonization (Fig. 32).
Second, global cooperation is needed. De facto cooperation be­
tween the West and China drove down the price of renewable en­
ergy. Without greater cooperation, developing nations will be the 
main source of future GHG emissions (Fig. 28). Carbon-free, dis­
patchable electricity is a crucial need. Nations with emerging 
economies are eager to have modern nuclear power because of 
its small environmental footprint. China-U.S. cooperation to de­
velop low-cost nuclear power was proposed, but stymied by U.S. 
prohibition of technology transfer [210]. Competition is normal, 
but it can be managed if there is a will, reaping benefits of coop­
eration over confrontation [211]. Of late, priority has been given 
instead to economic and military hegemony, despite recognition 
of the climate threat, and without consultation with young peo­
ple or seeming consideration of their aspirations. Scientists can 
support an ecumenical perspective of our shared future by 
expanding international cooperation. Awareness of the gathering 
climate storm will grow this decade, so we must increase scien­
tific understanding worldwide as needed for climate restoration.
Third, we must take action to reduce and reverse Earth’s en­
ergy imbalance. Highest priority is to phase down emissions, but 
it is no longer feasible to rapidly restore energy balance via only 
GHG emission reductions. Additional action is almost surely 
needed to prevent grievous escalation of climate impacts includ­
ing lock-in of sea level rise that could destroy coastal cities 
world-wide. At least several years will be needed to define and 
gain acceptance of an approach for climate restoration. This ef­
fort should not deter action on mitigation of emissions; on the 
contrary, the concept of human intervention in climate is dis­
tasteful to many people, so support for GHG emission reductions 
will likely increase. Temporary solar radiation management 
(SRM) will probably be needed, e.g. via purposeful injection of at­
mospheric aerosols. Risks of such intervention must be defined, 
as well as risks of no intervention; thus, the U.S. National 
Academy of Sciences recommends research on SRM [212]. The 
Mt. Pinatubo eruption of 1991 is a natural experiment [213, 214] 
with a forcing that reached [30] –3 W/m2. Pinatubo deserves a co­
ordinated study with current models. The most innocuous aero­
sols may be fine salty droplets extracted from the ocean and 
sprayed into the air by autonomous sailboats [215]. This ap­
proach has been discussed for potential use on a global scale 
[216], but it needs research into potential unintended effects 
[217]. This decade may be our last chance to develop the knowl­
edge, technical capability, and political will for actions needed to 
save global coastal regions from long-term inundation.

Politics and climate change
Actions needed to drive carbon intensity to zero—most impor­
tant a rising carbon fee—are feasible, but not happening. The 
first author gained perspective on the reasons why during trips 
to Washington, DC, and to other nations at the invitation of gov­
ernments, environmentalists, and, in one case, oil executives in 
London. Politicians from right (conservative) and left (progres­
sive) parties are affected by fossil fuel interests. The right denies 
that fossil fuels cause climate change or says that the effect is ex­
aggerated. The left takes up the climate cause but proposes 
actions with only modest effect, such as cap-and-trade with off­
sets, including giveaways to the fossil fuel industry. The left also 
points to work of Amory Lovins as showing that energy efficiency 
plus renewables (mainly wind and solar energy) are sufficient to 
phase out fossil fuels. Lovins says that nuclear power is not 
needed. It is no wonder that the President of Shell Oil would write 
a foreword with praise for Lovins’ book, Reinventing Fire [218], and 
that the oil executives in London did not see Lovins’ work as a 
threat to their business.
Opportunities for progress often occur in conjunction with cri­
ses. Today, the world faces a crisis—political polarization, espe­
cially in the United States—that threatens effective governance. 
Yet the crisis offers an opportunity for young people to help 
shape the future of the nation and the planet. Ideals professed by 
the United States at the end of World War II were consummated 
in formation of the United Nations, the World Bank, the Marshall 
Plan, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Progress 
toward equal rights continued, albeit slowly. The ‘American 
dream’ of economic opportunity was real, as most people willing 
to work hard could afford college. Immigration policy welcomed 
the brightest; NASA in the 1960s invited scientists from European 
countries, Japan, China, India, Canada, and those wanting to stay 
found immigration to be straightforward. But the power of spe­
cial interests in Washington grew, government became insular 
and inefficient, and Congress refused to police itself. Their first 
priority became reelection and maintenance of elite status, sup­
ported by special interests. Thousands of pages of giveaways to 
special interests lard every funding bill, including the climate bill 
titled ‘Inflation Reduction Act’—Orwellian double-speak—as the 
funding is borrowed from young people via deficit spending. The 
public is fed up with the Washington swamp but hamstrung by 
rigid two-party elections focused on a polarized cultural war.
A political party that takes no money from special interests is 
essential to address political polarization, which is necessary if 
the West is to be capable of helping preserve the planet and a 
bright future for coming generations. Young people showed their 
ability to drive an election—via their support of Barack Obama in 
2008 and Bernie Sanders in 2016—without any funding from spe­
cial interests. Groundwork is being laid to allow third party can­
didates in 2026 and 2028 elections in the U.S. Ranked voting is 
being advocated in every state to avoid the ‘spoiler’ effect of a 
third party. It is asking a lot to expect young people to grasp the 
situation that they have been handed—but a lot is at stake. As 
they realize that they are being handed a planet in decline, the 
first reaction may be to stamp their feet and demand that gov­
ernments do better, but that has little effect. Nor is it sufficient 
to parrot big environmental organizations, which are now part of 
the problem, as they are partly supported by the fossil fuel indus­
try and wealthy donors who are comfortable with the status quo. 
Instead, young people have the opportunity to provide the drive 
for a revolutionary third party that restores democratic ideals 
while developing the technical knowledge that is needed to navi­
gate the stormy sea that their world is setting out upon.

David EE, Jr later became a global warming denier.
3.
GISS (2020) model is described as GISS-E2.1-G-NINT in published papers; 
NINT (noninteractive) signifies that the models use specified GHG and 
aerosol amounts.
4.
An imbalance of 1 W/m2 for a millennium is enough energy to melt ice 
raising sea level 110 m or to raise the temperature of the ocean’s upper 
kilometer by 11C.
5.
Tom Delworth (NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory), Gokhan 
Danabasoglu (National Center for Atmospheric Research), and Jonathan 
Gregory (UK Hadley Centre) kindly provided long 2  CO2 runs of GCMs 
of these leading modeling groups. All three models had response time as 
slow or slower than the GISS GCM.
6.
The GISS (2014) model is labeled as GISS-E2-R-NINT and GISS (2020) as 
GISS-E2.1-G-NINT in published papers, where NINT (noninteractive) sig­
nifies that the models use specified GHG and aerosol amounts.
7.
In Swedish, trapps are stairs. Basalt formations are commonly in layers 
from multiple extrusions.
8.
Small apparent discrepancy is roundoff. CO2 forcing is 9.13 W/m2 and 
solar forcing is −1.16 W/m2 at 50 MyBP.
9.
Forcing ¼ 4.6 W/m2 assumes that the increase of non-CO2 GHGs is 
human-made. This is true for CFCs and most trace gases, but a small 
part of CH4 and N2O growth could be a slow feedback, slightly reducing 
the GHG forcing.
10.
9.9C for ECS ¼ 1.2C per W/m2; 10.1C for ECS ¼ 1.22C per W/m2 (the 
precise ECS for 7C LGM cooling).
11.
Two significant flaws in the derivation of this ‘alternative aerosol sce­
nario’ were largely offsetting: (1) the intermediate climate response 
function employed was too ‘fast’, but (2) this was compensated by use of 
a low climate sensitivity of 3C for 2  CO2.
12.
In the absence of a response function from a GCM with ECS ¼ 4C, we 
use the normalized response function of the GISS (2020) model and put k 
¼ 1C per W/m2 in Equation (5).
