Introduction. Several frameworks exist to measure vulnerability to extreme heat events using a health equity
approach, but little evidence validates these measures and their applications. We investigated the degree to
which social vulnerability measures and their constituent elements correlate with excess emergency room
visits as an outcome measure. Methods. The relationship between six commonly used social vulnerability
indicators and measured excess emergency room visit rates (processed by including heat-related illnesses
and all-internal causes diagnosis, with considerations for age and heat days) was tested through geospatial
analytics and statistical regressions, for both California and Los Angeles County. Results. The vulnerability
indicators and the outcome measure were signiﬁcantly positively associated at the census tract-level but
weaker (»0.2 rs) at the scale of California and stronger (»0.6 rs) at the scale of Los Angeles County. Hazard-
speciﬁc vulnerability indicators showed stronger relationships with outcome measures regardless of scale. A
Poisson regression model showed a signiﬁcant inter-county variation, indicating the importance of localized
assessments for equitable environmental policies. Conclusion. The ﬁndings identify communities that are
overburdened by heat and pollution and highlight the need for use of both social vulnerability and indicators
of adverse outcomes from excessive heat. Patterns are found across all measures that suggest that popula-
tions facing accessibility barriers may be less likely to visit emergency rooms. This suggestion needs to be
tested in other environmental settings to draw broader conclusions but has direct implications for environ-
mental scientists and mitigation planners who use these methods.

1. Introduction
Heat causes more deaths than other weather-related hazards,
although these could be reduced by up to 25% with effective mitiga-
tion [1]. In addition to heat waves, which are becoming more intense,
more frequent, and of longer duration, average temperatures are
expected to rise, particularly in urban areas because of the urban
heat island effect, increasingly affecting residents of densely popu-
lated cities [2]. Impacts of heat events include hyperthermia, heat
cramps, heat exhaustion, heat stroke, respiratory problems, wors-
ened chronic conditions (e.g., cardiovascular disease), and increased
mortality [3,4]. Even though most people can adapt to incremental
increases in average temperatures, some susceptible groups may still
suffer adverse effects [5], and adaptation can only occur to a certain
degree.
Heat disproportionately harms some of the most vulnerable com-
munity members [6]. Several categories of people have been identi-
ﬁed as being at a higher risk for heat-related health impacts [7,8]:
children and infants [9]; age groups of 65 years and over [10]; socially
isolated individuals, or from low-income populations [11]; residents
of nursing homes, care facilities, or prisons without appropriate cool-
ing measures [12,13]; persons living with chronic conditions such as
disabilities, cardiovascular, pulmonary, or kidney and liver diseases,
diabetes, or obesity [14−16]; pregnant women and their fetuses [17];
persons living with mental health issues [18]; persons of various
races/ethnicities, which can be proxies for socioeconomic status, dif-
ferential exposure and health treatment, and access to health care;
those who have language barriers [19,20]; or persons that are home-
less [21]. Individuals with occupational exposure, exempliﬁed by the
need to wear personal protective equipment [22], outdoor or agricul-
tural workers [23,6], and workers in manufacturing locations without
temperature control systems [24] are also susceptible to extreme
heat.

In a broader social-ecological system, socioeconomic factors such
as income have shown stronger associations with heat exposure at
home [25] due to the cost of air conditioning or other housing charac-
teristics. Hence, a combination of socioeconomic and environmental
factors together can represent heat exposure and vulnerability. Heat-
related vulnerabilities have also been assessed in measurement
schemes [26,27], and applied in a few cases like Atlanta, Georgia [28],
Maricopa, Arizona [29], San Antonio, Texas [30], Georgia [31], and
Massachusetts [32], although more studies are needed to show the
effectiveness and use of these indicators. The “hazard of place” model
identiﬁes elements of hazard exposure in combination with underly-
ing vulnerabilities to describe the risk level [33], which motivates
this study to test the relationship between vulnerability indicators.
Interest in validating social vulnerability indicators (e.g., SoVI, SVI)
and their ability to explain disaster event outcomes (e.g., losses) [34
−36] has been growing. The challenges of measuring heat-event out-
comes in terms of loss (ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial) adds to the com-
plexities of validating vulnerability measures. Uejio et al. [37] applied
mixed models to study heat mortality and distress calls by accounting
for vegetation, temperatures, socioeconomic variables and neighbor-
hood stability in Philadelphia, PA, and Phoenix, AZ. Similarly, Reid et al.
[38] applied their Heat Vulnerability Index in metropolitan areas (in ﬁve
U.S. states) and assessed the hospitalization and mortality counts in
high-heat days using a Poisson regression, which showed strong associ-
ations, but predicted higher vulnerability than what was observed in
some areas. Also, Chuang and Gober [39] used hospitalization records in
Phoenix, AZ, to test the accuracy of their Heat Vulnerability Index.
California is the most populous state in the U.S. with a diverse
population that is experiencing more frequent and intense heat
waves with longer durations [40]. Model projections predict that
more humid nighttime conditions and a lack of acclimatization in
coastal populations will continue to exacerbate the impacts [41].
Individual variables of income and ethnicity have been tested in rela-
tion to heat exposure in California, which showed urban regions
experience disparities in temperatures between the wealthiest and
poorest neighborhoods [42]. The multi-dimensional construct of
social vulnerability can identify inﬂuences of other socioeconomic
factors in this context and several indices have been produced for
vulnerability assessments in California. The state has developed sev-
eral adaptation plans that use these indicators, to help target pro-
grams and funding in high-risk areas [43]. In this study, we evaluated
whether vulnerability metrics for California can explain the reported
heat-related excess emergency room visit pattern changes during
heat events and whether the scale of the analysis inﬂuences the
results. We also tested the associations across individual variables
that contribute to the vulnerability indicators as well. Our goal was to
help scientists and policymakers interested in mapping vulnerability
indices and outcome measures prioritize neighborhoods for heat
adaptation and response programs.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Vulnerability indicators
Social vulnerability as a concept is multi-dimensional and the spa-
tial distribution of its place-based measurements can show the con-
tributing factors to the abilities of communities to respond to hazard
events. The “vulnerability of place” is tested through the indicators
presented in previous studies and adopted plans as contributors to
heat-related health impacts. The selected indicators from the com-
monly used sources in California (Appendix A) include several varia-
bles and methodologies:
1) CalEnviroScreen (CES) 4.0 is the California Communities Environ-
mental Health Screening tool developed in 2021, released by the
California Ofﬁce of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment
(OEHHA), which is a part of the California Environmental Protection
Agency
(CalEPA)
[44].
CalEnviroScreen
considers
cumulative
impacts, is place-based, and includes 36 indicators of public health,
environmental,
and
socioeconomic
conditions.
The
CalEnvir-
oScreen Score is the result of average exposure and environmental
effects that consider sensitive populations and socioeconomic fac-
tors [44]. The timeframe for each variable is different but covers
2009 to 2019 and data are updated as newer versions are released.
2) The California Healthy Places Index (HPI) is developed by the Public
Health Alliance of Southern California in partnership with the
UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation. The HPI applies a positive
frame, includes indicators of socioeconomic conditions in addition
to the environmental factors, and the HPI score combines 25 char-
acteristics into a single score [45].
3) The Climate Change & Health Vulnerability Indicators for California
(CCHVIs) is produced by the Climate Change and Health Equity
Section of the California Building Resilience Against Climate
Effects (CalBRACE) Project that is part of the California Depart-
ment of Public Health. The CCHVIs is a database, which does not
include a composite score [46], and each variable has a different
timeframe from 2010 to 2019.
4) The development of California Heat Assessment Tool (CHAT) was
funded by the California Natural Resources Agency as part of the
California’s Fourth Climate Change Assessment and evaluations
were conducted by a partnership of institutes [47]. The Heat
Health Action Index is a statistically weighted result of indicators
in three categories of social vulnerability, health, and environ-
ment, which range from 0 to 100. The data for each variable comes
from different timeframes, from 1984 for historical records to
2050 for projected models.
5) The Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) using 5-year estimates for
2017 Census data. The SoVI measurement is a multi-dimensional
construct [33] that follows a Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
of normalized indicators (by z-scores) with varimax rotation. The
raw data from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2017 5-
year estimates at census tract-level were processed to run the
SoVI model separately for California and for Los Angeles County.
The SoVI model for California has seven factors explaining 68% of
the variation in input variables (Appendix D), and the model for
Los Angeles County has eight factors that explain 72% of the varia-
tion in input PCA variables [48].
6) Social Vulnerability Index (CDC’s SVI) by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), using data from the ACS, ranks cen-
sus tracts on 16 social factors and groups them into four themes
of socioeconomic status, household characteristics, racial and eth-
nic minority status, and housing type and transportation [49]. The
SVI score is the sum of all 16 variables. The data used for this study
is for year 2018.
7) The study area of Los Angeles County includes one additional
measure of vulnerability, which is the Social Sensitivity Scores
from the Los Angeles County Chief Sustainability Ofﬁce published
in 2021 with most recent data [50].
2.2. Excess emergency room visits
Excess emergency room visits rates are used as an outcome mea-
sure of heat-related adverse health effects to gage the relationship
between vulnerability indicators and the resulting outcomes and test
the level of predictability of these indices. Our study duration for data
used is truncated to only capture the timeline before the COVID-19
pandemic (due to comorbidities). The data for emergency room visits
were obtained from the California Department of Health Care Access
and Information and analyzed to include diagnoses codes for emer-
gency room visits due to heat-related illnesses and all-internal causes
that are known to be exacerbated during heat events (up to 25

2
diagnoses for each emergency room record) [51]. The analysis also
considers age and heat event days during the meteorological summer
and a lag of three days for each area (heat event days were deﬁned
using the Spatial Synoptic Classiﬁcation (SSC) system version 3 that is
adopted in climate and human health studies [23], and the SSC sta-
tions included were 67 in California and 13 in neighboring states of
Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona) [51]. The produced data for excess
emergency room visits are available at county and sub-county levels
(Fig. 1) [51]. The excess daily emergency room visit rate corresponds
to the number of excess emergency room visits per day per 10,000
persons in heat event days versus non-heat event days in that area
(each rate was calculated separately for heat and non-heat event
days then were age-adjusted, and ﬁnally subtracted to obtain the
excess daily visit rates), which is computed for 2009 to 2018 (Using
diagnoses ICD-9 codes of E900 or 992: “electrolyte imbalance (276);
cardiovascular disease (390−398, 401−429, 430−438, 440−459);
respiratory illness (460−519); acute kidney failure and chronic kid-
ney disease (584−586); disease of urinary system (580−599); diabe-
tes mellitus (250); dehydration (276.5) and disorders of ﬂuid,
electrolyte and acid-base balance (276)”, for 2009−2016, and ICD-10
codes of X30 or T67: “cardiovascular (I00−I99); respiratory (J00
−J99); acute kidney failure and chronic kidney disease (N17−N19);
Disease of urinary system (N00−N39); diabetes (E08−E13); dehydra-
tion (E86); and disorders of ﬂuid, electrolyte, and acid-base balance
(E87)”, for 2016−2018) [51].
2.3. Analysis
The scale of analysis, according to data constraints, are county and
census tracts (counties are the primary spatial unit for operational levels
of emergency management and public health in the US, and census
tracts are their ﬁner-spatial units for a stable presentation of data). The
vulnerability indicators are available at the census tract level, and the
zip code boundaries do not match with the tract boundaries, thus we
obtained excess emergency room visits data at the tract level by extract-
ing the average, minimum, maximum, and variance of the zip code level
data that covers each tract in ArcGIS Pro-using Python. We calculated
the Spearman’s correlation between all vulnerability indicators and
excess emergency room visit rates. For cross-comparisons, the variables
are all standardized by converting them into percentiles, and for classiﬁ-
cations of variables we have used the standard deviation from the mean
(i.e., class 1< mean - 0.5 Std.Dev.; mean - 0.5 Std.Dev. < class 2 <
mean + 0.5 Std.Dev.; and class 3> mean + 0.5 Std.Dev.).
To answer the question regarding variation of associations across
California, we applied three methods of geospatial mapping through
bivariate maps, a geographically weighted regression (GWR), and a
Poisson log-linear regression model for vulnerability indicators and
counties, in relation to the excess emergency room visit rates, which
follow the model of:
LogðExcess emergency room visitratesÞ
¼ a þ b1ðVulnerability indicatorÞ þ b2ðCounty

1
þ b3ðCounty

2
þ . . . þ biþ1ð CountyÞi
Where a is the intercept, and b is the coefﬁcient for vulnerability
indicator, and each of the counties (i = 58).
For cross-comparison, the high and low classes of vulnerability
indicators and the related classes of high and low excess emergency
room visit rates are analyzed by concordant pairs (i.e., high-high, or
low-low) or discordant pairs (i.e., high-low or low-high) to identify
overlaps in classiﬁcations. Finally, to test the inﬂuence of individual
indicators on the observed excess emergency room visit rates, the
extremes of high and low rates are compared using an independent
samples t-test. The highest and lowest rate groups were selected
using two standard deviations from the mean (i.e., §1.5 Std.Dev.),
which is approximately the same as the 1% top and 1% bottom (80
census tracts—high and low—for California). Analyses were per-
formed in RStudio, SPSS, JMP, GeoDa, and ArcGIS Pro.
3. Results
3.1. Geographical patterns
The visual comparison of the spatial distribution of the excess
emergency room visits rates and the vulnerability scores in bivariate
maps indicate a similar pattern of association across the measurement

schemes (Fig. 2). A concentration of high vulnerability and higher
emergency room visit rates is seen in Del Norte, Yuba, Mendocino, San
Benito, San Joaquin, Solano, and Alameda counties, while in Southern
California a pattern of lower emergency room visits, and high vulnera-
bility is observed. As expected, the patterns show higher variation by
census tracts, where a concentration of higher emergency room visits
and higher vulnerability follows an urban-rural pattern with concen-
tration around Merced and Stanislaus counties, San Fernando Valley,
and south-central Los Angeles County, western Riverside and San Ber-
nardino counties, and central Monterey County.
3.2. County-Scale analysis
There are no strong correlations between the composite vulnera-
bility scores and the rate of excess emergency room visits at the
county scale for California (Table 1). The CCHVI method does not
include a composite score and among their variables, the correlation
is moderately signiﬁcant and negative for the excess emergency
room visit rate and tree canopy coverage (rs = 0.31, p < 0.05), pro-
jected number of extreme heat days (rs = 0.3, p < 0.01), and percent
population without health insurance (rs = 0.28, p < 0.05) as is also

reﬂected in Factor 5 of SoVI (rs = 0.38, p < 0.01) (Table 1). The dif-
ference between the vulnerability scores for the counties with the
highest and lowest excess emergency room visit rates is not signiﬁ-
cant.
3.3. Census tract-scale analysis
The average excess emergency room visit rates for California at
the scale of census tracts have a signiﬁcant but weak relationship
with vulnerability scores (Table 2a, Fig. 3a), where the strongest asso-
ciation is with CHAT (rs = 0.26, p < 0.01), followed by CDC’s SVI
(rs = 0.23, p < 0.01) and SoVI (rs = 0.2, p < 0.01). The highest vulnera-
bility score class shows a higher average of excess emergency room
visits for the CHAT and SoVI indicators (Fig. 3). The relationship for
the CCHVI’s indicators and the excess emergency room visit rates are
also weak but signiﬁcant. The top 10 census tracts with the highest
rate of heat-related excess emergency room visits are from Los
Angeles, Monterey, and El Dorado counties, while the lowest rates
are from San Francisco, Nevada, Placer, San Diego, and Siskiyou Coun-
ties. The independent samples t-test for the highest and lowest rates,
only indicates a signiﬁcant difference for SVI’s theme 4 (i.e., housing
type and transportation) (t = 4.31, p < 0.001), CHAT (t = 3.6,
p < 0.005), and CES (t = 3.79, p < 0.001).

3.4. Regression
The Poisson log-linear regression model for excess emergency
room visit rates by each vulnerability score and county (using census
tract data) shows variations across counties but a rather similar pat-
tern across vulnerability scores (Appendix B). The results show the
relationship is dependent on the location and local measures would
be more predictive. The GWR results were not signiﬁcant (R2=0.001).
3.5. Individual indicators
Testing the individual indicators that are used to construct the
vulnerability scores, shows variations in their associations with the
outcome measure of excess emergency room visit rates. The individ-
ual indicators are tested for the two groups at the top and the bottom
1 % of census tracts, ranked by the average excess emergency room
visit rates, in an independent sample t-test comparison of means
(Appendix C). Individual indicators like lead pollution, asthma, car-
diovascular disease, poverty,% households without a car, and %
households without air conditioning have a signiﬁcant difference
between the two groups with a large effect (i.e., Cohen’s d> 0.8) and
a positive t-value referring to their impact in higher emergency room
visit rates. A number of other indicators have a signiﬁcant difference
and large effect size (i.e., Cohen’s d> 0.8) with a negative t-value, sug-
gesting an inverse relationship with the higher emergency room visit
rates, which include average ozone concentration (ppm),% elderly,%
White, homeownership, per capita income, and no transit access.
Some other indicators, with smaller effect sizes (Cohen’s d< 0.6), do
show a signiﬁcant difference, like housing burden, unemployment,
linguistic isolation, less college education, %Hispanic, %African Ameri-
can, %Asian, and pollution burden.
3.6. Los Angeles county
Vulnerability indicators associated with the excess emergency
room visits in Los Angeles County show a stronger relationship than
across all tracts in California (Table 2b, Fig. 3b). This is even more pro-
nounced in South-Central Los Angeles and San Fernando Valley
(Fig. 4). There are more concordant pairs than discordant pairs of vul-
nerability indicators and excess emergency room visit rates (i.e.,
high-high, or low-low, than high-low) at both study areas, but the
pairs are more synchronous at the Los Angeles County study area
(with more than 70% overlap) than in California and (with more than
30%overlap) across all indicators (Table 3). For example, there are
low visit rates and low vulnerability ranges from 41.5% to 46.7%
among the ﬁve indicators for the state, while for the high rates and

high vulnerability the indicators range from 29.5% to 46.7%. At the Los
Angeles County scale, the low rates and low vulnerability range from
63.7% to 86.1% among the six indicators, while for the high rate and
high vulnerability pairs, they also exceed 70% in each indicator (only
exception is the County Sensitivity Score with a lower coverage, with
46%).
The CDC’s SVI score has a higher signiﬁcant association with the
rate of excess emergency room visits (rs = 0.556, p < 0.001), which is
close to SoVI score (rs = 0.449, p < 0.001); and the Factor 1 of SoVI has
the strongest association among the factors (rs = 0.55, p < 0.001) rep-
resenting poverty, linguistic isolation, and Hispanic population. The
county sensitivity score has a moderate association with the excess
emergency room visit rates (rs = 0.379, p < 0.001). The HPI has a mod-
erate-strong negative association (rs = 0.587, p < 0.001), and the
CHAT score has a stronger positive correlation (rs = 0.601, p < 0.001).
Comparing the top and the bottom 1% census tracts with the highest
excess emergency room visits for Los Angeles County, shows a signiﬁ-
cant difference between the means for all the vulnerability scores
tested, but not for all the individual variables (e.g., transit access,
ozone exceedance, %Native American, %Asian American, park access,
%with disabilities, %female, and %mobile home residents).
4. Discussion and conclusion
In response to climate change and the increase in number, extent,
and duration of heat events, several vulnerability indicators have
been proposed but it is uncertain how much they reﬂect observed
disparities in the heat-impact across communities. In this study, we

used the rate of excess emergency room visits as an outcome mea-
sure to test the explanatory power of existing indicators for Califor-
nia. Our ﬁndings have four main implications.
First, while comparisons showed a similar statistical relationship
with available vulnerability indicators, we observed a stronger rela-
tionship with CHAT and CES. The relevance of heat-speciﬁc vulnera-
bility indicators conﬁrms the appropriateness of hazard-speciﬁc
vulnerability measures that has been seen in context of the COVID-19
pandemic and ﬂoods as well [52]. Therefore, custom indicators that
incorporate vulnerability attributes related to the hazard type might
be more deﬁning than an all-hazards approach, at least in case of
extreme heat. Single-hazard vulnerability assessments may be neces-
sary for effective hazard preparedness and mitigation.
Second, the observed strong patterns of differential impact
between urban and rural areas with clusters for disproportionately
high impacts in rural, northern California signiﬁes the necessity to
identify regionally relevant policy solutions or infrastructural needs.
Lack of acclimatization to heat, decreased availability of air condition-
ing and lack of community experience forcing inadequate response
might all be contributing factors.
Third, the strength of association between vulnerability indicators
and excess emergency room visit rates is higher at ﬁner scales. The
two levels of analysis (i.e., county and census tracts) and the focused
study area of Los Angeles County, highlight the importance of scale
and unit of analysis, where associations vary across counties and
within county (Figs. 2 and 4). There are more pairs that identify the
similar level of susceptibility to suffer harm in the Los Angeles County
study area (> 70 % overlap) than in California (> 30 % overlap) across
all vulnerability indicators, demonstrating that these indicators may
be closer in identifying the vulnerable tracts in a more focused study
area. Therefore, this ﬁnding suggests that localized studies are more
appropriate for mitigation planning and policy implementations.
Fourth, individual variables tested against the rate of excess emer-
gency room visits, indicated a signiﬁcant association with lead pollu-
tion, asthma and cardiovascular disease, poverty, access to a car, and
access to air conditioning. Based upon this ﬁnding one could consider
the possibility of merging policies and mitigation plans with efforts
on urban greening and public health to bring co-beneﬁts for overbur-
dened communities (e.g. parts of Merced County, Stanislaus County
near Turlock, and parts of Los Angeles County like south-central Los
Angeles). In contrast, the inverse association between emergency
room visits and some indicators (e.g., transit access), demonstrates
that the outcome measure of emergency room visits might not repre-
sent all vulnerable groups. The under-representations of some groups
in emergency room visits could stem from not having the access to
reach emergency rooms and seeking care in local clinics or not at all.
However, the indicators for socioeconomic status or health seem to
have a strong positive relationship with visit rates (e.g., poverty,
asthma). Thus, some vulnerable populations (e.g., those with accessi-
bility issues) might not be counted if we only use the outcome meas-
ures such as emergency room visit rates for locating the populations
in need of support, as they might be under-reported or under-repre-
sented in those outcome data.
There are a number of limitations in our study including those
associated with data availability and timeframes for the selected indi-
cators, and potential confounding bias or inaccuracy in accounting for
heat exposure effects in the excess emergency room visit rate calcula-
tions. Nevertheless, the stronger association with sub-county data
validates the use of the vulnerability indicators for environmental
policy implementation and highlights the need for both outcome
measures and socio-environmental vulnerability indices. Conse-
quently, we encourage further emphasis on local knowledge and
assessments to identify — at the operational level —the priority
groups for implementing mitigation measures or for response to heat
events.
