EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
BACKGROUND TO THE CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUE 
AND THE WHITE PAPER’S FINDINGS 
 
 
“The Great Lakes basin, its people and its commerce, is a microcosm of society as a 
whole.  The basin, jointly managed by two countries, is a unique natural resource and 
vital to the economies of both our countries.  It must be used wisely and protected.  What 
happens here in the future due to climate change will have enormous impacts on both the 
United States and Canada.”   — William Evans, 1989 
 
INTRODUCTION AND  BACKGROUND 
Climate provides fundamental bounds on, and opportunities for human activities and ecosystem functioning. 
 Climate has changed in the past, is changing today, and will continue to change.  As early as 1985, the Great Lakes 
scientific community began to recognize the potential implications of climate change on the Great Lakes.  In that year, 
Environment Canada’s Canadian Climate Program and the University of Toronto’s Institute for Environmental Studies 
convened a binational workshop to review the effects of climate change on the physical, bio-physical, and socio-
economic systems of the Great Lakes basin and to develop a research strategy. Other workshops followed, and 
investigations on impacts of climate change were undertaken.  In 1992 the binational Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Basin 
Project sought to identify the impacts of climate change on ecosystem health, human health, land use and management, 
and water use and management, and to develop adaptation strategies. In its 1989 report, the Science Advisory Board 
alerted the International Joint Commission to the potential impact of global climate change.  The Board noted that 
climate warming “... would affect the frequency, intensity, duration and location of extreme meteorological events. 
 The assessment of such events in the recent past and their ecological and societal implications might provide a first 
approximation of how climate change might affect the Great Lakes basin, and how societies in the basin might be 
prepared to cope with such changes.” In its 1989, 1991, and 1993 reports, the Board presented projected changes in 
Great Lakes conditions and consequent impacts on the system (Table 1), including impacts on socio-economic 
interests, which would be both positive and negative and would surely involve tradeoffs.  The Board also expressed 
concern about whether climate warming would counter restoration successes, make the lakes more eutrophic, and 
increase the probability of invasions of alien species.  Further, the Science Advisory Board indicated the need for 
policy changes for water level regulation, water diversion, fisheries, and shoreline management.

The Board concluded that predicting effects of climate change and then proactively adapting to, or planning for such 
changes were important issues to address under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement.  The Board further 
concluded that “... variability and the uncertainty that variability provides are perhaps the most difficult environmental 
properties for managers, planners and policy-makers to deal with effectively.”  The Board detailed a course of action 
for the Great Lakes community. 
 
Evidence developed over the past decade has strengthened and extended the confidence that climate change and 
associated impacts are valid concerns (see Figure 1).  The magnitude of changes presently occurring and projected to 
occur in our climate raises questions about not only the extent of their impact but also our ability to adapt, not only 
globally but more specifically in the Great Lakes region. 
 
Compounding the issue, numerous stresses already challenge the Great Lakes - land use changes, chemical 
contamination, nutrient over-enrichment, alien invasive species, and acid precipitation.  Climate change is yet another 
agent, acting in concert with other stresses. 
 
THE COMMISSION’S CHARGE TO THE WATER QUALITY BOARD 
 
The Commission has expressed its concern about the impact of climate change and variability for the Great Lakes 
region and its residents, in particular, to restore and maintain the integrity of the waters of the Great Lakes basin 
ecosystem and to achieve the beneficial uses given in Annex 2 of the Agreement.  In late 2001, the Commission asked 
its Water Quality Board to provide advice about implications and impacts of climate change on Great Lakes water 
quality and beneficial uses, and how we can address changes. 
 
THE  BOARD’S  INVESTIGATION 
 
A change in climate could lead to alterations and impacts on environmental quality (air, water, soil, sediment); surface 
and ground water quantity;  ecosystem health and functioning;  human health;  the “built” environment (sewer and 
treatment plant capacity);  and socio-economic systems, including agriculture, forestry, fisheries, recreation, tourism, 
energy, transportation, and manufacturing.  The climate changes for a number of reasons - natural and anthropogenic - 
and studies have been and are being carried out to detect changes in climate and identify associated impacts.  Natural 
climate variability is influenced by changes in solar radiation, wobbles in the earth’s orbit, and volcanic activity. 
 Humans influence the climate by urban development, changes in land- use patterns, and increased emissions of 
greenhouse gases. 
 
Both mitigation and adaptation actions are required as a balanced response to climate change.  Mitigation measures are 
geared to reduce emissions and increase sinks of greenhouse gases, while adaptation actions seek to increase resilience 
by reducing risks and taking advantage of opportunities due to a changing climate. Mitigation of climate change is 
being addressed by governments and stakeholders at global, national, and regional scales. Yet, even if mitigation 
measures aimed at reducing, for example, greenhouse gas emissions and slowing change are implemented, the earth’s 
climate will continue to change due to natural forces and human-caused effects. 
 
 
Figure 1.   
 
Potential Climate Change Impacts 
2 
Impacts of climate change manifest themselves uniquely in regions such as the Great Lakes basin.  As a result, 
adaptation measures need to be designed and implemented to accommodate each locality’s specific context and 
capacity.  Therefore, in its investigation, the Board chose to focus on adaptation.  A focus on adaptation in no way 
minimizes the importance of concomitant mitigation actions, which the Board will continue to monitor. 
 
To provide insight into the issues and impacts associated with climate change in the Great Lakes region, the options 
available to address those impacts, and the challenges associated with taking action, the Board commissioned a white 
paper, “Climate Change and Water Quality in the Great Lakes Region:  Risks, Opportunities, and Responses.”  The 
white paper addressed four key questions: 
 
• What are the Great Lakes water quality issues associated with climate change? 
• What are potential impacts of climate change on beneficial uses? 
• How might impacts vary across the Great Lakes region? 
• What are the implications for decision making? 
 
To confirm the scientific and technical basis that characterizes and underpins the conclusions and findings, the white 
paper was subjected to external review.  In addition, to ensure that the Board had properly characterized the 
consequences of climate change, appreciated the challenges for taking action, and could provide sound advice to 
address impacts, the findings presented in the white paper were “ground-truthed” at a stakeholder workshop held May 
28-29, 2003.  The white paper, revised in light of the external review and the contributions from workshop participants, 
constitutes Part 3 of this report to the Commission.  The white paper draws upon published materials with a nationwide 
or global perspective.  Information specific to the Great Lakes is highlighted.  The white paper’s findings are 
summarized below, and further details are contained in the references cited therein. 
 
The white paper is followed (Parts 4 and 5, respectively) by a synopsis of the workshop, which consists of the agenda, 
the list of participants, and the discussion summary;  and the presentation by guest speaker Georges Beauchemin.  The 
Board’s advice to the Commission, which draws upon the white paper’s findings as well as the workshop presentations 
and deliberations, is presented in Part 2. 
 
THE WHITE PAPER’S FINDINGS 
 
Climate Variability and Change during the 20th Century 
 
Key trends are summarized in Table 2, with details in Chapter 2. 
 
Table 2.  
Key Trends in Climate and Hydrology 
 
Mean annual air temperature increases;  most warming in winter and spring, least in the fall. 
Minimum air temperature increases more than maximum air temperature. 
Frost-free period lengthens and other temperature indices change. 
Annual precipitation increases. 
Ratio of snow to total precipitation decreases. 
Extreme precipitation increases in the U.S.;  no trend in Canada. 
Snow cover (depth, areal coverage, and duration) is reduced. 
Both wet and dry periods increase. 
Onset of spring melt (freshet) is earlier. 
Great Lakes water levels respond to climate variability. 
Dates for freezing of lakes is later;  dates for ice off are earlier. 
Timing of phenological events (periodically recurring natural phenomena related to climate 
 and seasonal change) is changing in North America and Europe.

Specific climate-related impacts already observed in the Great Lakes region include changes in ice cover, Canadian 
port gains with diminished ice, shifts in bird ranges and abundance, and a shift in the maple syrup industry.  Based on 
changes observed during the 20th century, Chapter 2 presents analogues for the types of climatic conditions and events 
that might be experienced during the 21  century and, hence, insight into the vulnerability of key systems in the Great 
Lakes region, notably:  changes in lake levels with consequent impacts on commercial shipping and recreational 
boating;  the impact of climate change on lake-effect snow storms; and the impact of climate variability on agriculture, 
forests, water use, and human health. 
 
Potential Impacts of Regional Climate Change 
 
Attributes of the climate system in the Great Lakes region that are projected to change are summarized in Table 
3.  Details are in Chapter 3. 
 
Table 3.

Daily air temperature range may decrease. 
Total annual precipitation increases but precipitation during key seasons may decrease. 
More precipitation may fall as rain and less as snow. 
Intensity of precipitation events may increase. 
Potential evapotranspiration increases with warmer air temperature. 
 
Projected changes in Great Lakes water supply are summarized in Table 4. 
 
Table 4.  
Projected Changes in Great Lakes Water Supply 
 
Annual runoff decreases for most climate change scenarios. 
More runoff may occur in winter. 
Spring freshet may occur earlier and have less flow. 
Summer and fall low flows may be lower and last longer. 
High flows may increase due to extreme precipitation events. 
Ground water recharge and levels may decrease. 
Amount and timing of ground water base flow to streams, lakes, and wetlands may change. 
Water levels in lakes decline. 
Seasonal cycle of water levels is shifting. 
Ice cover season is reduced or eliminated completely. 
The implications of climate change for Great Lakes water quality are summarized in Table 5. 
 
Table 5.

Warmer water temperatures affect physical, chemical, and biological processes. 
Taste and odor problems in drinking water may increase. 
Periods of thermal stratification may be extended with associated declines in dissolved oxygen. 
Changes in mixing depth affect productivity. 
Non-point source pollution increases with higher intensity precipitation events. 
Climate change may make it significantly more costly to meet water quality goals. 
Water quality remediation targets may not be met.

A number of human health outcomes are associated with weather and / or climate.  Because human health is intricately 
bound to weather and the many complex natural systems it affects, it is possible that projected climate change will have 
measurable impacts, both beneficial and adverse, on health.  However, projections of the extent and direction of 
potential impacts are extremely difficult to make, so human health outcomes in response to climate change are highly 
uncertain.  Chapter 3 examines climate-induced health effects on water-borne diseases, effects related to extreme 
weather events, air pollution-related effects, heat-related illnesses and deaths, and vector- and rodent-borne diseases. 
 
Natural ecosystems will be affected by a changing climate.  Implications are summarized in Table 6. 
 
Table 6.  
Implications of Climate Change on Natural Ecosystems 
 
Biological productivity is expected to increase with moderate temperature increases. 
Zoogeographical boundaries move in a changing climate. 
Introduction of invasive species could be exacerbated. 
Existing community structures and interactions may change. 
A changing climate is expected to lead to reduction in some habitats. 
Wetland vegetation communities, functioning, and values may change. 
Wildlife are susceptible to climate changes. 
Rare and endangered species may be more vulnerable. 
 
Climate change and variability will also impact agriculture in the Great Lakes region, as well as forests, 
recreation, and tourism. 
 
Implications for Beneficial Uses 
 
Annex 2 of the Agreement lists 14 beneficial uses, 12 of which are potentially vulnerable to climate change. 
Chapter 4 of the white paper reviews potential impacts, asking three questions: 
• 
Will climate change impact areas already deemed environmentally sensitive? 
• 
Will climate change create new Areas of Concern? 
• 
Will climate change impair beneficial uses that have already been restored? 
 
There is, however, a lack of specific research about the impacts of climate change on several beneficial uses. Therefore, 
impacts were assessed indirectly from associated literature. 
 
The Uncertainty of Climate Change and Impacts 
 
Most of the climate change impacts presented above are developed from impact assessments that are based on case 
studies of sensitivity to current and historical climate (e.g. extreme events) as analogues, or are based on studies where 
climate change scenarios are used as models to project future conditions such as for ecosystems and economic sectors. 
 These assessments identify risks due to climate change.  Uncertainties in the causes of climate change, the rate and the 
magnitude of the changes, and the associated impacts to the Great Lakes region lead to ambiguity and constrain 
adaptation or actions to deal with impacts. 
 
This creates a challenge for society as a whole to believe that human activities contribute to climate change, that 
climate change is an issue to be concerned about, and whether they should act.  Without a high degree of certainty, 
public understanding, and support, policy and decision-makers, although concerned, are not necessarily disposed to act. 
 
However, uncertainty should not be used as an excuse not to act.  Failure to adapt may leave the Great Lakes region 
poorly prepared to cope with adverse changes, and with increased probability of severe consequences. As the climate 
continues to change, society’s ability to protect sensitive systems may be further challenged.  In addition, analogous to 
the acid rain issue, there may be climatic surprises, e.g. unanticipated effects or a threshold change which may not 
necessarily be reversible after the stress is reduced or removed. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5 
 
 
 
Many decisions to act do not, however, require projections of future impacts.  There is a wealth of knowledge -
including traditional ecological knowledge - in the community to document impacts and trends.  As noted earlier, we 
have historic analogues.  We can also use climate change scenarios to guide “what if” exercises.  For example, if the 
climate is warmer and storm events more intense, water quality may be impaired by combined sewer overflows and 
negatively affect human health. 
 
 
ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE 
 
What is Adaptation? 
 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change defines adaptation as “adjustment in natural or human systems in 
response to actual or expected stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities.” 
Other definitions can be found in the literature, and the definition continues to evolve.  The Board views adaptation in 
broad terms, considering not only the ability of natural ecosystems to adjust on their own accord, but also adjustments 
to human systems, from urban infrastructure, to health alert protocols and economic incentives. 
 
Adaptation actions fall into two broad categories - reaction to climate change as it occurs or anticipation of future 
change.  Adaptation in natural systems is reactive, but adaptation in human systems can also be anticipatory, for 
example, development of new crop varieties. 
 
The Challenge of Adaptation 
 
A changing climate challenges managers.  They must ask: 
 
• 
How is the climate changing? 
• 
How great or rapid are the changes? 
• 
What and who might be affected? 
• 
What existing issues are exacerbated and how? 
• 
What new problems or opportunities emerge? 
• 
What adaptations must be made to cope with the changes? 
• 
When or how fast must adaptations be made? 
• 
What are the costs? 
• 
What are the impediments to adaptation? 
• 
What is the capacity to adapt? 
 
Many management practices in the Great Lakes region are predicated on the fact that the past is a reliable guide to the 
future.  However, a changing climate adds a new component to consider in planning, management, and program 
implementation.  Adaptation links needs of today with problems of tomorrow. 
 
Adaptation Measures 
 
The first step is to identify possible adaptation measures.  Chapter 6 of the white paper contains an extensive but 
preliminary list for a range of economic activities, human health, water resources, ecosystems, communication, and 
management (Table 7).  The list was drawn from the proceedings of symposia and workshops as well as climate change 
assessment reports.

Table 7.  
Implications of Climate Change 
 
Economic Activities 
 
- Hydro-electric power generation and transmission 
- Commercial navigation 
- Urban development and infrastructure 
- Agriculture 
- Recreation and tourism 
- Industry 
- Forestry 
 
Human Health 
 
- Water quality 
- Heat stress 
- Air quality 
- Disease and illness 
 
Water Resources 
 
- Drought 
- Flood 
- Water use 
- Water quality 
 
Ecosystems 
 
- Vegetation 
- Wetlands 
- Wildlife 
- Fish 
 
Communication 
 
- Environmental stewardship 
- Local stakeholders 
- High-risk populations (human health and weather extremes) 
- Sustainable use of water 
- Risk communication 
 
Management 
 
- Emergency planning, preparedness, forecasting, and disaster relief 
- Watershed planning and management 
- Data collection 
 
 
The next steps are more difficult.  Because managing to meet multiple demands in a changing environment 
requires an integrated approach, stakeholders and practitioners in the Great Lakes region must consult and 
collaborate to: 
 
• 
Assess and evaluate potential adaptation measures. 
• 
Choose preferred adaptation measures. 
• 
Develop action plans that contain a portfolio of adaptation measures and incorporate means to 
address barriers to adaptation. 
• 
Implement adaptations. 
• 
Monitor impacts and adaptation measures for effectiveness. 
• 
Reassess adaptation measures. 
 
The basic considerations presented below provide a general framework for undertaking these steps. 
 
 
“The key element for adaptation strategies is knowledge.” 
“The poorer you are, the more you need to know.” 
— Luc Crépeault 
 
 
 
 
 
7 
Basic Considerations in the Development of Adaptation Strategies 
 
After all is said and done, three considerations drive the decision to expend resources to avoid the effects of climate 
change - the perception of risk imposed by climate change, the perceived costs of the effort, and possible negative 
consequences of action taken.  If stakeholders decide to commit resources, six issues must be considered to ensure that 
the responses are effective. 
 
Distributional Effects 
 
The design of adaptive responses should vary by locality, sector, and demographic group.  The effects of 
climate change vary across localities within the Great Lakes basin, by sector (e.g. commercial fishery, shipping, 
transportation), and by demographic group (e.g. the elderly, the young).  Since potential risks and human capacity to 
respond to risks varies, adaptive measures must be tailored to take account of geography, sectors, and demographics. 
 However, any one particular effect of climate change (e.g. change in snowfall) may benefit one group or region but 
harm another.  Therefore, any assessment of potential adaptation strategies must lay out the risks and opportunities 
associated with potential effects, as well as the options for reducing risks and exploiting opportunities. 
 
Multiple Stresses 
 
Climate change should be viewed as one of several stresses of concern.  Many beneficial uses in the Great 
Lakes region that are sensitive to climate change are already under stress for other reasons.  Climate change may either 
exacerbate or ameliorate existing stresses.  Consider, for example, the impact of land use and land use changes on 
natural ecosystems and species diversity.  Factor in climate change as an additional stress, and the resiliency of the 
ecosystem and its capacity to adapt may be further challenged.  Consider also the present demand for water for human 
consumption, recreation, irrigation, and power generation.  Climate change will increase demand for water, resulting in 
even less water being available for such natural ecosystems as wetlands and forests, further threatening their survival. 
 
Any assessment of the vulnerability of Great Lakes systems to climate change, as well as assessment of potential 
adaptation strategies must consider multiple stressors on affected systems.  Otherwise, adaptive responses may prove 
ineffective and fail.  By the same token, placing climate change into the context of multiple stressors opens up 
opportunities to simultaneously reduce vulnerabilities to both climate change and other environmental stresses, for 
example, through the formulation of sustainable land-use practices. 
 
Costs 
 
The costs of adaptation must be considered.  Adaptation comes with a cost.  Resources to adapt to climate 
change likely have to be diverted from other productive activities, such as reduction of other stresses.  The decision of 
when to incur adaptation costs hinges on the value of expected net benefits associated with acting now rather than later. 
 Also, what will the resources buy?  Decision makers must weigh the costs and tradeoffs among alternative adaptation 
strategies and living with residual impacts associated with the decisions taken. 
 
In addition to funding costs, the potential effectiveness of adaptation also requires consideration of the availability of 
appropriate technology and trained personnel, cultural and social values, and political and legal institutions. 
 
Lastly, the willingness of society to divert resources from other uses must be considered.  Consider, for example, the 
costs associated with adapting to low lake levels.  Lower levels impact commercial shippers and recreational boaters. 
 The usual response is to dredge, but this response comes with operational costs for dredging, treatment, and disposal. 
 Since much of the dredged material is contaminated, dredging also comes with environmental costs when material is 
disturbed and contaminants exposed. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8 
Effectiveness of Adaptations 
 
The reasons for varying effectiveness of adaptations need to be understood and incorporated into strategy 
designs.  Different adaptive responses may vary in effectiveness.  Historic evidence demonstrates that 
societies have not always adapted effectively to existing risk.  Consider, for example, deaths from exposure to extreme 
heat, even in years without heat waves.  The reasons for society’s failure to adapt to existing risk must be understood in 
order to improve the design of future adaptation measures. 
 
Maladaptation 
 
There are dangers of maladaptation in poorly designed adaptation strategies.  Adaptive responses may 
have unintended, adverse consequences that outweigh the benefits of undertaking the action.  To avoid maladaptation, 
the strategy must consider interdependent systems that are sensitive to climate change as well as potential non-climate-
related side effects.  There may well be adverse consequences for human health and the environment, as well as for 
social well-being.  The societal acceptability of a particular adaptive response may depend on who benefits and who 
loses.  The key is to evaluate all potential adaptive responses in order to identify possible adverse consequences and 
conclude whether implementation of a particular adaptive response is therefore feasible and desirable. 
 
Multiple Benefits 
 
Sensible options have multiple benefits.  Many opportunities for adaptation make human systems more 
resilient to climate variability today and are beneficial whether or not climate change results in future effects. Win-win 
strategies such as heat-wave planning and vector-borne disease surveillance systems are important to protect lives and 
health regardless of future climate change.  Consideration of climate change and associated incremental effects may 
enhance or ameliorate the urgency of particular measures. 
 
Although such strategies would lead to more efficient resource allocation, public policies often involve considerations 
other than efficiency - for example, equity, political feasibility - that must be accounted for.  It is also worth noting that 
some existing institutional arrangements and public policies result in systems that are more rigid and unable to respond 
to change.  For example, U.S. federal flood insurance provides an incentive for development in high-risk flood plains 
and coastal areas, a risk that would increase with more severe storm events and further sea-level rise. 
 
Adaptation Strategy Implementation 
 
Investments in adaptation are warranted to reduce vulnerability to climate change and to exploit opportunities that may 
increase social well-being.  The agreed-upon adaptation strategy and its implementation depend upon societal values 
and selection criteria identified by decision makers - not researchers and assessors.  Such policy decisions are often 
complex because of the need to consider multiple social objectives and the need to assess their importance and 
relevance in some consistent way.  Thus, the strategy chosen may depend upon such considerations as equity (within 
and across generations), political feasibility, and specific environmental objectives chosen by society, such as the 
beneficial uses in Annex 2 of the Agreement.

RESEARCH  NEEDS 
 
As climate impact assessment moves toward a more participatory process, research must reflect practitioner/ 
stakeholder as well as researcher views of what is needed to understand climate change, the impacts, and adaptive 
responses.  Chapter 7 of the white paper contains an extensive list of research needs, compiled from numerous sources. 
 The list requires further refinement through dialogue within the Great Lakes community about what needs to be done. 
 Emphasis has been placed on understanding bio-physical systems.  More attention must be placed on understanding 
human and institutional behaviour in the face of a changing climate. Research is also required to determine the 
sensitivity of the Agreement’s 14 beneficial uses to climate change. 
Research needs are tabulated by seven themes: 
• 
Monitoring, surveillance, and analysis. 
• 
Climate change scenarios. 
• 
Model development. 
• 
Vulnerability, impact, and adaptation assessments. 
• 
Economic assessment. 
• 
Adaptation. 
• 
Communication. 
 
An associated requirement is to ensure that data are preserved for future reference and use.

PART 2 
THE WATER QUALITY BOARD’S ADVICE 
TO THE INTERNATIONAL JOINT COMMISSION 
 
 
In late 2001, the International Joint Commission asked its Great Lakes Water Quality Board to provide advice about 
implications and impacts of climate change on Great Lakes water quality and on achievement of the 14 beneficial uses 
identified in Annex 2 of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement.  The Commission also asked how we can address 
climate change.  In response, the Board commissioned a white paper (Part 3 of this report) and held a workshop (Parts 
4 and 5). 
 
The Water Quality Board believes that climate change and variability is a serious issue that requires action.  The white 
paper identifies changes in climate and hydrology within the Great Lakes region.  People, communities, economic 
activities, wildlife, and ecosystems are sensitive to climate variability and change.  However, through proactive 
planning, management adjustments, investments, legislation, institutional change, and education and training, 
modifications can be made to minimize impacts and take advantage of opportunities. 
 
Both mitigation and adaptation actions are required as a balanced response to climate change.  Mitigation of climate 
change is being addressed by governments and stakeholders at global, national, and regional scales. Yet, even if 
mitigation measures are implemented, the earth’s climate will continue to change due to natural forces and human-
caused effects. 
 
Impacts of climate change manifest themselves uniquely in regions such as the Great Lakes basin.  Adaptation 
measures need to be designed and implemented to accommodate each locality’s specific context and capacity. 
Therefore, the board chose to focus on adaptation. 
 
The Water Quality Board presents the following advice to the Commission.  Based on the information presented 
in the white paper and from discussion at the climate change workshop, the Board concludes that there is a need 
for: 
 
• 
Development and implementation of an adaptation strategy. 
• 
Research on climate impacts and adaptation, with a focus on the Great Lakes region. 
• 
Development of decision-making tools. 
• 
Communication and outreach. 
 
 
DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ADAPTATION STRATEGY 
 
The Board concludes that there is a need to embrace a risk assessment and management process to deal with climate 
change.  The Board has identified elements of a general framework for development of adaptation strategies, with 
details in the white paper.  The Board recognizes the magnitude of the climate change issue and the requirements and 
challenges associated with development of a strategy and implementation of adaptive measures, especially the 
consideration that must be given to spatial and temporal variability of climate change and impacts across the Great 
Lakes region. 
 
A crucial element for any strategy is stakeholder involvement.  This necessitates communication and outreach - 
especially with those vulnerable to climate change - to identify, define, and analyze issues and impacts, to develop 
responses, and to define goals and end points.  The Board supports a staged approach of consultation by sector, to work 
in partnership to address issues, impacts, and consequences - both environmental and economic - then to explore 
sensible approaches to adapt.  The strategy should identify and prioritize specific actions to be taken. 
 
Another important component of a climate change adaptation strategy is to link with other stressors that challenge the 
Great Lakes, and to develop and implement programs and actions in concert, to mutual benefit.

The Board acknowledges that additional impacts and adaptation research is required and effective decision-making 
tools need to be developed.  Nonetheless, there is sufficient risk-based information on climate change to take 
incremental, win-win actions now. 
 
RESEARCH ON CLIMATE IMPACTS AND ADAPTATION 
 
The Board recognizes the need to focus research on the Great Lakes, in order to better understand climate change and 
associated impacts on the region and to better understand the results of adaptive responses.  The research must 
incorporate the interests of both researchers and Great Lakes stakeholders.  In particular, research is required to better 
understand human and institutional behaviour in the face of a changing climate.  Research is also required to better 
understand the implications of climate change on achievement of beneficial uses given in Annex 2 of the Agreement. 
 
The Board recognizes the need to bring a broader range of Great Lakes stakeholders to the table for consultation within 
the community to develop a focussed research strategy for the Great Lakes region that will, in turn, inform the 
decision-making process and contribute to formulation of appropriate programs and policies in order to adapt to climate 
change. 
 
DEVELOPMENT OF DECISION-MAKING TOOLS 
 
Those affected by climate change want and need a quantified, integrated picture of the range of potential climate 
impacts and the consequences of taking action.  The challenge is to construct scenarios and develop application 
methods that aid decision making.  This requires models;  the linkage of models, e.g. climate and lake level models, 
may be fruitful.  This also requires dialogue between researchers and practitioners to identify research needs and 
priorities.  To facilitate decision making, a practical approach is required to develop and apply tools, for instance, 
climate / economic scenarios scaled from the global to the regional and local perspective.  For example, Ouranos, a 
consortium of public and private organizations and headquartered in Montréal, has under-taken such work for Québec. 
 
Scenarios at the scale of watersheds will help decision-makers understand vulnerabilities better.  The Canadian Institute 
for Climate Studies is providing global climate scenarios and statistical downscaling tools in order to develop the 
necessary local perspectives.  Modelling and scenarios will also help establish priorities for action, develop a portfolio 
of adaptation tools, and convey the consequences of taking (or not taking) particular actions. 
 
COMMUNICATION AND OUTREACH 
 
Climate change is a difficult, complex, and controversial issue.  The International Joint Commission can advance and 
inform the dialogue by providing clear, manageable information about climate change, the effects, and what can be 
done to adapt.  There is a need to communicate in clear language that the climate changes and that there are 
consequences and impacts as a result of these changes.  The message needs to be tailored to a wide audience, including 
the general public and those who influence public opinion;  private and public corporations and municipalities;  and the 
insurance industry, financial lenders and investors, and corporate and governance teams.  
 
Informing stakeholders about climate change, climate impacts, the need for timely action, and available adaptation 
options poses challenges and opportunities.  To be effective, communication and outreach should raise awareness, 
confer understanding, and motivate action.  Communication and outreach should: 
 
• 
Present success stories. 
• 
Lay out proposed actions so that society is motivated to act and requisite resources are sought and 
provided. 
• 
Quantify uncertainty and present implications for resource management decisions. 
• 
Provide decision-makers with the tools to facilitate decision-making under uncertainty. 
• 
Equip people to act, once a decision has been made. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 
Addressing climate change requires more than scientific facts and technical solutions; it requires dialogue about 
perceptions, social values, and expectations as well as consensus on what priorities and trade-offs society chooses and 
what risks and changes it is willing to accept.  The communication process should present and reconcile different, often 
contradictory, information about climate change, its impacts and severity, and what should be done. 
 
Communication becomes an important part in the science-policy link in adaptive planning and management. The 
dialogue it engenders ideally assists in developing a common perception or shared framing of the problem, from which 
cooperation and collective action can be developed.  Communication simplifies the problem into a number of key 
concepts, builds upon existing knowledge with facts and proof, clears misconceptions, and generates imagery to 
personalize the issue. 
 
Communication that provides factual information builds understanding.  It is easier to accept new facts than new 
opinions.  It summarizes what is known, based on the weight of scientific evidence, what the certainty is, what the 
available options and risks are, the costs and benefits, and how these are distributed within society. 
 
THE NEXT STEP 
 
Building upon its work to date, the Great Lakes Water Quality Board plans further investigation of climate change 
within the context of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement and the development of additional insight and advice 
for the International Joint Commission.

3.3 Impacts of Projected Changes in Climate ..........................................................................................41  
3.3.1 
 
Water Supply.......................................................................................................41  
Annual runoff decreases for most climate change scenarios.  
More runoff may occur in winter.    
Spring freshet may occur earlier and have less flow.    
Summer and fall low flows may be lower and last longer.   
High flows may increase due to extreme precipitation events. 
3.3.2 
 
Ground Water ..................................................................................................44  
Ground water recharge and levels may decrease.  
The amount and timing of ground water base flow to streams, lakes,   
     
  and wetlands may change.   
3.3.3 
Great Lakes Water Levels..................................................................................45  
Water levels in lakes decline.  
Seasonal cycle of water levels is shifting.  
3.3.4 
 
Ice Cover ................................................................................................................49  
The ice cover season is reduced or eliminated completely. 
3.3.5 Water Quality....................................................................................................49  
Warmer water temperatures affect physical, chemical, and biological processes.  
Taste and odour problems in drinking water may increase.  
Periods of thermal stratification may be extended with associated declines in   
dissolved oxygen.  
Changes in mixing depth affect productivity.  
Non-point source pollution increases with higher intensity precipitation events.  
Climate change may make it significantly more costly to meet water quality goals.  
Water quality remediation targets may not be met.  
3.3.6 
 
Human Health ..................................................................................................56  
Water-borne diseases may increase.  
Health effects related to extreme weather events may increase.  
Air pollution-related health effects could intensify.  
The number of heat-related illnesses and deaths may rise.  
Vector-borne and rodent-borne diseases may become more common.  
3.3.7  
Natural Ecosystems and Biodiversity..........................................................62  
Biological productivity is expected to increase with moderate temperature increases.  
Zoogeographical boundaries move in a changing climate.    
Introduction of invasive species could be exacerbated.  
Existing community structures and interactions may change.  
A changing climate is expected to lead to reduction in some habitats.  
Wetland vegetation communities, functioning, and values may change.  
Wildlife is susceptible to climate changes.  
Rare and endangered species may be more vulnerable.  
3.3.8  
 
Agriculture..............................................................................................................65  
Yields are expected to increase but not in all regions.  
Demand for water by the agricultural sector will likely increase.  
The impact of climate change on agriculture may be enhanced by current stresses.  
Adaptation strategies will likely be necessary.  
3.3.9 
 
Forests ......................................................................................................................69  
Shifts in potential tree species range limits in the Great Lakes region.

Introduction 
 
1.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
Climate provides fundamental limits on and opportunities for human activities and ecosystem functioning within the 
Great Lakes region.  A changing climate could lead to alterations in the frequency and severity of droughts and floods; 
water supply; air, soil, and water quality; ecosystem health; human health; and resource use and the economy.  Climate 
change may act through multiple pathways; interactions in and impacts on the Great Lakes ecosystem can be  
dynamic and non-linear.  Within the Great Lakes watershed, there are already numerous stressors that cause ecosystem 
change including land use change, pollution, eutrophication, invasion of exotic species, and acid precipitation.  A 
changing climate should be considered as another agent of change acting in concert with other ecosystem stresses 
(Easterling and Karl, 2001; Magnuson et al., 1996).  
 
Recognizing that this emerging issue required a survey of the potential impacts and the ability to adapt, the Great Lakes 
Water Quality Board commissioned a white paper to explore the implications of a changing climate on the Great Lakes 
watershed (Figure 1-1).  The white paper addresses four broad questions:

uses” in the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement?

How might these impacts vary across the Great Lakes?  
  
What are the implications for decision-making? 
 
Rather than simply focusing on the physical, chemical, and biological changes in water quality due to a changing 
climate, this paper has taken an ecosystem approach as outlined in the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement.  This 
approach recognizes that all components of the ecosystem are interdependent, including the water, biota, surrounding 
watershed, and atmosphere; humans are considered an integral part of this system (Lake Erie LAMP, 2000).  Then, 
climate change can be considered from a broader, sustainability perspective.  Identifying risks and opportunities of a 
changing climate on human activities and ecosystems of the Great Lakes watershed facilitates decision-making and 
planning on how to respond to the problem.  
 
This paper is written for a cross-section of the Great Lakes science, business, resource management, and policy 
community experts.  It is relevant to those who need to be aware of potential impacts of a changing climate as well as 
those who are in a position to develop policies and programmes in response to the changes.  This white paper was used 
to facilitate discussion among experts at a workshop May 28-29, 2003.  Discussion topics included: What are the key  
impacts of a changing climate? What are the options to adapt to impacts? How can climate change be successfully 
incorporated into long-term planning and decisions in the Great Lakes watershed? What are the scientific, programme, 
and information needs?  The deliberations from the workshop are included in the Water Quality Board’s advice to the 
International Joint Commission.  
 
By necessity, the white paper often uses published reports and journal articles with a nationwide or global perspective 
to develop the background for a changing climate.  However, information specific to the Great Lakes is highlighted 
where possible but, where there is no literature for the watershed, information from elsewhere is used to illustrate an 
impact or adaptation option.  
 
A number of experts on the Great Lakes, climate change detection, and climate change impact and adaptation 
assessment have reviewed the document.  Also, the comments from and expertise of the May 2003 workshop 
participants have been incorporated into this document.    
 
The task of surveying the issue of a changing climate in the Great Lakes watershed was approached in a number of 
steps and is reflected in the organization of the paper.  First, the 20th century changes in climate are described in 
Chapter 2.  Chapter 3 provides a general overview of the potential changes in climate and associated effects on 
ecosystems and human activities within the Great Lakes watershed; while Chapter 4 specifically focuses on the 
sensitivity of beneficial uses to a changing climate.  A primer on adaptation to climate change is developed in  
Chapter 5 and potential adaptation options are explored in Chapter 6.  Lastly, Chapter 7 summarizes knowledge gaps 
and research needs.

2.0 CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND CHANGE   
IN THE GREAT LAKES WATERSHED  
 
Has climate and hydrology in the Great Lakes watershed changed significantly during the 20th century?  In what ways 
has it changed and by how much?  This chapter explores recent trends in selected climatological and hydrological 
parameters.  Primarily, it draws from published literature at the global and national scale and relates results to the Great 
Lakes region.   
 
Key trends include:  
  
Mean annual air temperature increases; most warming occurs in winter and spring   
and the least in fall;  
  
Minimum air temperature increases more than maximum air temperature;  
  
Frost-free period lengthens and other temperature indices change;  
  
Annual precipitation increases;  
  
Ratio of snow to total precipitation decreases;    
  
Extreme precipitation increases in the United States and shows no trend in Canada;  
  
Snow cover (depth, areal coverage, and duration) is reduced;  
  
Both wet and dry periods increase;   
  
The onset of the spring melt (freshet) is earlier;   
  
Great Lakes water levels respond to climate variability but show no long-term  
changes;  
  
Dates for freezing of lakes are later and dates for ice off are earlier; and  
  
Timing of phenological events is changing in North America and Europe.  
 
2.1 DETECTING CHANGES  
Large-scale processes such as population growth, land use change (agricultural expansion and urbanization), and 
intensification of land uses confound the detection of changing climate and hydrology.  Data quality is also an issue. 
 Changes in station location, instrumentation, observing practices, urbanization, and exposure introduce 
inhomogeneities to the observations that need to be corrected.  Canadian and American observing practices and 
methods of Ňcorrecting” data can be dissimilar and differences are noted at the border.  Here we have reported results 
from trend analysis using the longest period of record available with the most homogeneous data.   
 
2.1.1  Air Temperature  
Mean annual air temperature increases.   
The global mean temperature has increased 0.6 ±  0.2  Celcius over the 20th century.  Analysis of the instrumental 
record since 1861 suggests that the warmest decade globally may have been the 1990s and 1998 may have been the 
warmest year (IPCC, 2001: 26).  Paleoclimate data for the Northern Hemisphere corroborates this; it also indicates that 
the temperature increase of the 20thcentury was the largest during the past 1000 years.

Climate Variability and Change in the Great Lakes Watershed 
 
Mean annual temperatures for Canada and the United States have increased (see Figures 2-1 and 2-2). The increase 
from 1900 to 1998 was 0.9 C for southern Canada while in the contiguous United States it was 0.4 C from 1900 to 
1994 (Zhang et al., 2000, 405; Karl et al., 1996: 282). Regional differences in the patterns of warming for Canada and 
United States are illustrated in Figures 2-3 and 2-4.  
 
Winter and spring in Canada have exhibited the greatest warming, while summer has less warming; in autumn some 
areas actually experienced a small cooling (Zhang et al., 2000).  Most of the warming in the United States has also 
occurred in winter and spring (Karl et al., 1996).  
 
Within the Great Lakes region, annual mean temperatures have increased by 0.7 C from 1895 to 1999 for the southern 
portion of the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence lowlands in Canada, (Mortsch  et al., 2000: 159).  Paleoclimate 
reconstructions over the last 12,000 years for the Great Lakes region indicate that temperatures have been up to 7°C 
cooler and 3°C warmer in the past (Magnuson et al., 1997: 829).

Minimum air temperature increases more than maximum air temperature.   
Extremes – very high or low daily air temperatures – can negatively affect human comfort and  
health, exacerbate air pollution, or exceed an ecological threshold.  Notable trends in maximum  
and minimum temperatures have been reported for the United States and Canada. They include:  
 
  
Minimum (i.e. nighttime) temperatures are warming more rapidly than maximum (i.e. daytime) temperatures 
(Skinner and Gullet, 1993; Vincent et al., 1999; Bonsal et al.,  2001; Easterling et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 
2000);  
  
Fewer days with extreme low minimum temperatures particularly in winter, spring, and summer (DeGaetano, 
1996; Karl et al., 1996; Easterling et al., 2000; Bonsal et al., 2001);   
  
More days with extreme high temperature in winter and spring are occurring although the increase is not as 
pronounced as the minimum low temperature increase (Bonsal et al., 2001);   
  
No consistent evidence of an increase in the number of extreme hot summer days (Skinner and Gullet, 1993; 
DeGaetano, 1996; Bonsal et al., 2001);

Autumn temperatures have remained the same or cooled.  Maximum autumn temperatures have cooled in the 
United States (Easterling et al., 1997).   In southern Canada, most autumn cooling has occurred late in the 
season during the freezing period;   
  
The diurnal temperature range is compressed (Bonsal et al., 2001).  
 
The regional changes in annual maximum and minimum temperatures for Canada are shown in Figure 2-5.  Minimum 
temperature increase had a significant trend in the Great Lakes region, while daily maximum temperature increases 
were not significant (Zhang et al., 2000).

Warming of the minimum and maximum temperatures in winter and spring has influenced the

agricultural crops.  Similarly, warming in spring, summer, and fall influences growing degree-days, a measure of the 
energy available to plants for growth.  It is an important reflection of plant distribution.  In Canada, the length of the 
frost-free period has increased primarily due to spring warming (an earlier start day) and to a lesser degree due to later 
end dates because of frost (Bonsal et al., 2001: 1973) (Figure 2-6).  A similar lengthening of the frost-free period was  
noted in northeastern United States (Cooter and Leduc, 1995).   
 
Socio-economic indices such as cooling degree-days and heating degree-days provide a measure of building heating 
and cooling requirements; they are affected by warming in winter and summer, respectively.  Heating requirements 
have decreased considerably and cooling requirements have increased but not as much (Bonsal et al., 2001: 1972). 
 More cooling requirements may have implications for energy demand as air conditioning is primarily served by 
electricity.  Demand for energy may be rising during a season when streamflow for hydroelectric generating may 
decrease; more electrical energy may have to be provided by fossil fuel burning or nuclear power.

2.1.2 Precipitation  
Total annual precipitation increases.  
Globally, annual land precipitation has increased about 0.5 - 1 % per decade during the 20th century in the mid to high 
latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere; increases in northern regions are highest during the cold season (IPCC, 2001: 30; 
Zhang et al., 2000: 396).  On average, annual precipitation increased for Canada and the United States in the 20th 
century (see Figures 2-7 and 2-8).  
 
Analyses to determine precipitation trends in the Canadian Great Lakes - St. Lawrence basin indicate that total 
precipitation has increased over the period from 1895 to 1995; snow has decreased and rain has increased (Mortsch et 
al., 2000).  Paleoclimatological reconstructions of precipitation in the Great Lakes region indicate current precipitation 
is high relative to the past 12,000 years; around 9,000 BP it was wetter than present.  Precipitation has at times been 
180 millimetres (7.1 inches) less than and 40 millimetres (1.6 inches) greater than at present (Magnuson et al., 1997).

Climate Variability and Change in the Great Lakes Watershed 
 
For most regions in southern Canada, annual total precipitation increased from 1900 to 1998 and likewise annual 
precipitation increased for much of the United States except the Central Plains (Groisman and Easterling, 1994: 203; 
Karl et al., 1996: 282; Zhang et al., 2000: 396) (see Figures 2-9 and 2-10).    
 
In a U.S. study of the correlation between temperature change and precipitation, Zhao and Khalil (1993) reported that, 
in a region to the south of the Great Lakes, when winter temperature increased precipitation also increased. 
 Conversely, this region showed a decrease in precipitation with increasing temperature in May, June, July (not 
significant); a similar strong relationship (significant) occurred in the Central Great Plains agricultural area.

11 
Climate Variability and Change in the Great Lakes Watershed 
 
Ratio of snow to total precipitation decreases.     
In southerly regions such as the Great Lakes watershed, the ratio of annual snow to total precipitation is decreasing; the 
trend is particularly significant in spring (Karl et al., 1993; Zhang  et al., 2000).  Higher air temperatures are associated 
with this trend (Groisman and Easterling, 1994; Davis et al., 1999).  Late winter and spring warming, with temperatures  
periodically rising above freezing, may result in more precipitation falling as rain than snow although total precipitation 
remains the same (Brown and Goodison, 1996; Brown and Braaten, 1998; Zhang et al., 2000).  A reduction in the 
proportion of total precipitation that falls as snow has hydrologic implications; there is less storage of precipitation in 
snowcover and more runoff from rainfall occurs in winter.  Less snow, and winter rainfall and ice formation can stress  
forage crops through frost heaving and ice encasement (Bélanger et al., 2002).   
 
Extreme precipitation increases in the United States and shows no trend in Canada.  
Extreme precipitation events (high amount of precipitation within a short period of time) create risks for flooding and 
erosion, water quality deterioration (entrainment of pollutants and sewer overflow) and human health concerns (more 
frequent outbreaks of water-borne diseases especially in rural areas).   
 
In the United States, extreme events have made up a disproportionate share of the observed increases in total annual 
precipitation.  For example, the number of days with precipitation greater than 50.8 millimetres (two inches) has 
increased (Karl et al., 1996).  Easterling et al. (2000) reported an increase in the frequency of one-day to seven-day 
precipitation accumulations exceeding one-year and five-year return periods.  These increases are largest in the Great 
Lakes, and southwest and midwest regions of the United States.  In Canada, annual extremes in daily rainfall and 
snowfall are variable from decade to decade but there is no evidence of changes in intensity (Kunkel et al., 1999; Zhang 
et al., 2001b).  Much of the observed increase in annual precipitation has been due to more small-to-moderate 
precipitation events.  Stone et al. (2000) reported that, in the Great Lakes region, light events decreased in winter, 
intermediate events increased in autumn, and heavy events increased in summer from 1950 - 1995.  
 
Both wet and dry periods increase.  
Across the United States in the 20th century, there is no long-term trend in drought but there is much variability from 
decade to decade (Karl et al., 1996).  Since 1970, more area of the United States has tended to be excessively wet (e.g. 
Mississippi flood).  However, during the past few decades a greater proportion of the United States was either in severe 
drought or severe moisture surplus (Karl et al., 1996).  Areas in southern Canada affected by both extreme dry and 
extreme wet conditions during summer increased when comparing the 1900-49 and 1950-98 periods (Zhang et al., 
2000a).   
 
Snow cover (depth, areal coverage, and duration) is reduced.  
The snow cover season may be ending earlier and, in some places, becoming more unreliable due to higher winter and 
spring temperatures.  Winter and early-spring snow depths in Canada decreased during the period from 1946 to 1995 
coincident with an increase in air temperature (Brown and Braaten, 1998).  Canadian snow cover statistics reveal 
widespread trends toward earlier dates of maximum snow depth and earlier disappearance of snow over the 1955 to 
1997 period (Brown, 2000).  Frei et al. (1999) analysed snow cover from 1900 to 1994 and reported

Climate Variability and Change in the Great Lakes Watershed 
 
that, during the last three decades, decreases in spring snow extent in North America occurred with a possible shift in 
the snow season.  Since the 1960s, November snow extent increased and March snow extent decreased.   
 
2.1.3 Hydrology  
Evapotranspiration   
Evapotranspiration is the loss of water to the atmosphere through evaporation from the earth’s surface (land and water) 
and the transpiration of plants.  A significant proportion of the precipitation that falls in the Great Lakes watershed 
returns to the atmosphere; for example, in Ontario, almost two-thirds is lost to evapotranspiration.  Evaporation plays a 
very important role in determining water availability; it affects soil moisture, streamflow, ground water recharge, and 
lake levels.    
 
Evaporation has increased with warming in some regions.  
Twenty years (1970-1990) of data for the Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario illustrate the relationship 
between temperature and evaporation in small boreal lakes and streams.  During this period, air temperature increased 
by 1.6ºC, precipitation decreased (approximately 60 % of highest years), and average annual evaporation increased by  
approximately 50 %.  Evaporation increased by an average of 35 mm/1ºC increase in annual air temperature or 68 
mm/1ºC increase in summer air temperature (Schindler et al., 1990; Schindler et al., 1996).  For the twenty-year 
record, evaporation increased by an average of nine mm/year. The net effect of these changes was decreased 
streamflow, with annual runoff declining significantly from about 400 mm/yr to less than 150 mm/yr in the late 1980s. 
The lakes had longer water renewal times. The changes in climate and hydrology influenced chemical exports from the 
watersheds to the lakes and affected in-lake processes, lake chemistry, and biology 
 
Streamflow  
The onset of the spring melt (freshet) is earlier.  
The timing of hydrologic events is important to ecosystems (wetland and perched lake renewal) and for water resource 
management (reservoir filling).  Temperature can have an important effect by shifting the magnitude and timing of 
hydrologic events.  In a changing climate, the first adjustments noted may not be changes in volume of flow but 
alterations to timing of events (e.g. freshet), particularly if they are tied to snow accumulation and melt (Westmacott 
and Burn, 1997; Whitfield and Canon, 2000).  During spring warming, above freezing temperatures contribute to 
melting of the snowpack that has accumulated over the winter; this causes a period of high flow, the freshet, in 
numerous watersheds.  To assess trends in the timing of peak spring runoff, Burn (1994) analyzed the long-term record 
of 84 unregulated river basins extending from northwestern Ontario to Alberta. The more northerly rivers displayed 
trends to earlier spring snowmelt runoff; the trend was more prevalent in the recent years of data.  Whitfield and  
Canon (2000) also reported an earlier onset of runoff.  Similarly, Zhang et al. (2001a) mapped a significant trend 
toward the earlier occurrence of the freshet season across Canada (see Figure 2-11).

indicate that trends are not significant at the ten percent level 
Source: Zhang et al., 2001a  
 
Shifts in timing and amount of streamflow are detected.  
Shifts in timing and amount of streamflow have important socio-economic and ecological impacts.  For example, low 
flows, particularly in summer, affect assimilation of wastes, recreation opportunities, and habitat for fish. Changes in 
timing and flow have been reported but the changes are not consistent between the United States and Canada. 
 
Whitfield and Cannon (2000) compared the streamflow in natural flow rivers for the period 1976-1985 with 1986-
1995; hydrologic shifts detected for the Canadian Great Lakes region included higher winter flows, changes in spring 
peak and lower summer flows; these were in response to warmer winter temperatures and higher winter precipitation. 
 In the U.S. portion of the Great Lakes region, annual low flows (drought) are decreasing and baseflow is increasing;  
average annual flows are increasing and maximum annual flow (including floods) are not increasing or decreasing 
(Lins and Slack, 1999).  However, a pattern toward an increase in mean discharge in the autumn and winter months 
was reported.  The increase in extreme precipitation (greater than 50.8 millimetres or 2 inches) reported by Karl et al. 
(1996) is not detected in more flooding events (Lins and Slack, 1999).  The precipitation increase is considered too 
modest.  
 
2.1.4 Great Lakes Water Levels  
High water levels cause flooding and erosion that damage homes, recreational property, and coastal infrastructure. 
 Low water levels also have wide-ranging impacts that include reducing hydroelectric generation, curtailing 
commercial navigation and recreational boating, and affecting wetland functioning.  
 
Great Lakes water levels respond to climate variability but show no long-term changes.  
Lake levels fluctuate on different time scales ranging from: short-duration storm surge and wind set-up; seasonal 
progression of high and low levels (snow melt and evaporation), and inter-annual water level changes caused by long-
term changes in climate (evaporation, precipitation)  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
14 
Climate Variability and Change in the Great Lakes Watershed 
 
(Kite, 1992).  The Great Lakes are a naturally well-regulated system because of the large storage volume with respect 
to the small inflow and outlet channel capacities.  Lakes Superior and Ontario have outflows regulated by control 
structures to minimize the high and low levels.  
 
Annual water levels in the Great Lakes have only fluctuated about 1.8 metres (six feet) from measured maximum and 
minimum levels.  Water levels were very high in 1973-75, 1985-86, and 1997. They were very low in 1934-35 and 
1964-65.  Since the late 1800s, dredging and navigation improvements in the St. Clair River have lowered Lake 
Michigan-Huron by 37 to 62 centimetres (15 to 24 inches) (Bishop, 1990; Quinn and Sellinger, 1990).    
 
Since the early 1970s, there has been a run of relatively high water supplies (wet weather) with water levels generally 
above long-term average (Magnuson et al., 1997).  The trend for Lake Huron is shown in Figure 2-12.  Levels dropped 
dramatically from their record highs in 1986 due to the drought of 1988 with low precipitation and high evaporation. 
 They dropped again from highs in 1997 in part because 1998 was the hottest year (+2.3 C) and fifth driest year (- 
11.5 %) in the region for 51 years.  Water levels in 2000 also approached record lows.

Kite (1992) analyzed monthly mean Lake Erie levels recorded at Cleveland and Buffalo for trend, periodic, and 
autoregressive components.  No trends related to climate change were found.  A periodic component included the 12-
month seasonal cycle.  The self-regulating effect of large lakes (autoregression) dominated, meaning that there is a 
tendency that high levels follow high levels and low lake levels follow low levels.   
 
2.1.5 Ice Cover  
Changes in ice can affect evaporation, lake levels, shoreline erosion and lake-effect snow as well as ecosystem 
processes such as winter fish kills and over-winter survival of fish eggs.

Climate Variability and Change in the Great Lakes Watershed 
 
 
Dates for freezing of lakes are later and dates for ice off are earlier.  
In the Northern Hemisphere, ice break up on small lakes has been occurring earlier in the season, and freeze dates are 
happening later.  Magnuson et al. (2000) reported that between 1846-1995, break-up dates advanced 6.5 days and 
freeze dates were 5.8 days later.  Air temperature during this time increased 1.2°C per 100 years.  These trends are in 
agreement with Great Lakes regional freeze-up and break-up dates (Assel and Robertson, 1995).  For example, Assel 
 et al. (1995) examined six locations in the Great Lakes; between 1823-1994 freeze-up dates gradually became later and 
ice-off dates earlier.  In the 1980s, there was a significant trend to earlier ice loss dates.  Assel and Robertson (1995) 
examined lake ice records for Traverse Bay, Michigan from 1851-1993.  Here, the 1980s also had the shortest duration 
of ice cover when compared to the previous 13 decades.  Assel et al. (2003) examined the annual maximum ice 
concentration (AMIC) in the Great Lakes for trends.  They reported that 60 % of lowest AMICs occurred in the winters 
between 1983-2001.      
 
2.1.6 Phenology  
Phenology studies the seasonal timing of different developmental stages or life cycles of plants and animals (Bradley et 
al, 1999).  For plants, the stages are bud and leaf emergence, flowering, and leaf development.  Ecological studies have 
demonstrated that the timing of bloom, bud, and leaf emergence of many plant species in different eco-regions is 
influenced by temperature and heat accumulation (Lieth, 1997; Beaubien and Freeland, 2000).  Other phenological 
indicators include timing of breeding, migration, and stages of development for invertebrates, mammals, amphibians, 
and reptiles.  No phenological studies focusing directly on the Great Lakes region were found.  As a result, studies 
conducted in other regions of the United States and Canada, and globally are used to illustrate some changes.  
 
Dates for breeding and migration are occurring earlier.  
Globally, McCarty (2001) reported the earlier breeding and migration dates of birds.  There has also been an earlier 
appearance of crop pests and breeding of amphibians and wildflowers. Hughs (2000) found the warmer climatic events 
of the past century have advanced phenological timings for insects, plants, birds, and amphibians.  Walther (2002) 
discovered that since the 1960s, spring activities (such as bird migration) have begun much earlier.  There has also been  
evidence of the later onset of fall activities, although not to the same extent as the spring. Examples include advance, 
delay, or no change in bird migration and the changing colour of leaves on trees.  
 
In Europe, the effects of a warmer spring can include earlier insect and bird arrival and breeding times (Sparks et al., 
2002).  Kuchlein et al. (1997) found many organisms respond to temperature change with acceleration in the rate of 
development.  They may live for shorter periods but become more active.  Insects may even produce extra generations 
throughout the year.  Butterfly populations have shifted northward in response to increased temperatures. Other 
climate-sensitive organisms with similar population structures, such as beetles, grasshoppers, rodents, and frogs could 
also exhibit a change in geographic boundaries. Forchhammer et al. (1998) found that warmer winters led to an earlier 
breeding of amphibians. Spring plant phenology events are also occurring earlier (Chmielewski et al., 2000).  Sparks et  
al. (2002) reported the changes in plant phenology were most prominent earlier in the year (late winter and early 
spring).  Chmielewski et al. (2001) reported that a warming in the early spring  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
16 
Climate Variability and Change in the Great Lakes Watershed 
 
by 1 °C caused the growing season to begin seven days earlier.  Ahas et al. (2002) noted plant ecosystems in snow 
climates were more sensitive to small temperature fluctuations (the melting point) during the early spring.   
 
In North America, Schwartz et al. (2000) discovered first leaf data were increasing at a linear rate of 5.4 days over what 
period.  First bloom dates and last frost dates also began earlier, 4.2 days and 4.5 days respectively.  Lilac first-bloom 
dates began an average of five to six days earlier between 1959-1993.  Studies in southern Wisconsin have found 
photosynthetic activity has begun earlier between the latitudes 45°N and 65°N (Bradley et al., 1999).  In the low  
altitudes of Colorado, there have been changes in the hibernation habits of yellow-bellied marmots (emerging 38 days 
earlier than 23 years ago) and the arrival of the American robin (arriving 14 days earlier than in 1981) (Inouye et al., 
2000). 
 
Some studies have also related phenology to temperatures in parts of Canada.  In Alberta, studies on Aspen Poplar, 
Chokecherry, and Saskatoon have found that the flowering of these species is mainly a reaction to temperature, where 
earlier blooming has occurred in years with higher spring temperatures (Beaubien et al., 2000).  The red squirrel, 
located in the southern Yukon, has exhibited earlier breeding habits due to warmer temperatures (Reale et al., 2003).  
 
Changes in phenology can influence human health (i.e. earlier pollen release and insect infestations) and production 
(horticulture, viticulture, forestry, and agriculture) (Sparks and Menzel, 2002).  For example, earlier flowering, and 
subsequent earlier pollen release, may advance the start of the hay fever season (Van Vliet et al., 2002).  
 
2.2 LESSONS LEARNED ABOUT VULNERABILITIES FROM HISTORIC  
ANALOGUES  
How will changes in climate affect sensitive human and natural systems in the Great Lakes region?  Records from the 
past provide an informed perspective on this question.  There have been a number of climate variations during the 20th  
century that provide analogues for the types of climatic conditions and events we might experience with increasing 
frequency and intensity in the Great Lakes region in the 21st century.  These include substantial warming, increases in  
the quantity and intensity of precipitation, droughts and floods, significant reductions in lake levels, reductions in 
duration and extent of ice cover, and reductions in snow cover extent. Analyzing these variations, and their effects on 
human and natural systems, provides important insights into how resilient or vulnerable we may be in the future.  
 
In this section we provide six illustrations of how insights can be gained from historic analogues about the vulnerability 
of key systems in the Great Lakes region to variations in climate. Examples include changes in Great Lakes levels and 
their impacts on commercial shipping and recreational boating, the impacts of changes in lake-effect snowstorms, and 
the impacts of climate variability on agriculture, forests, water use, and human health.  
 
2.2.1 Changes in Lake Levels and the Shipping Industry and Recreational Boating   
Current reductions in Great Lakes levels have had a significant effect on both the commercial shipping economy and 
recreational boating.  Starting in the fall of 1998, lake levels dropped precipitously as a result of the extremely mild 
1997-98 winter.  With below-normal precipitation  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
17 
Climate Variability and Change in the Great Lakes Watershed 
 
and above-normal temperatures in 1998-99, lake levels continued to drop and were below Chart Datum by as much as 
15 centimetres (six inches).  
 
Lower lake levels mean ships cannot carry as much cargo.  Commercial carriers are very dependent on water depth in 
channel-ways and harbours.  According to the Great Lakes Carrier’s Association, a 1,000-foot (305 metre) long vessel 
(of the type that is used for intra-lake transportation) loses 270 tonnes of capacity for each inch of draft loss.  Draft is 
the distance between the water line and the bottom of the vessel.  Ocean-going vessels (sized for passageway through 
the St. Lawrence Seaway), which are approximately 740 feet (226 metres) long, lose 100 tonnes of capacity for each 
inch of draft lost.  Clearly, in an environment where other modes of transportation (rail and truck) are extremely price-
competitive with Great Lakes shipping, the loss of even one inch of draft can seriously disadvantage Great Lakes 
carriers and ports (Great Lakes Regional Assessment Group, 2000).  
 
Low water also makes it more difficult for recreational boaters.  There is a greater chance of damage when entering or 
leaving the water.  There is greater risk of running aground in harbours, marinas, or while underway in lakes or rivers 
because of propeller, keel, or hull strikes on lake bottom, boulders, or shoals (Pearce, 1999).  The most common 
approach for managing lowered lake level situations in marinas, harbours, and channel-ways is by dredging. Dredging  
imposes both operational and environmental costs.  Material dredged from channels and harbours can be contaminated 
by industrial waste and spills.  This must be buried in existing landfills, which are nearing capacity.  In the 1970s, the 
U.S. federal government built 26 confined disposal facilities (CDFs) for dredged sediments of the Great Lakes.  The 
CDFs are viewed as an alternative to the open lake disposal of these sometimes contaminated materials. Currently these 
26 CDFs are either full or nearly full, and by 2006 only two facilities will have room.  Furthermore, ongoing federal 
support for their continued construction and operation is questionable.  In addition, if not done properly, the dredging 
process could release buried toxins into the lake water (though effective environmental dredging that does not release 
toxins can be conducted). Non-environmental dredging would threaten to reverse the trend towards less contaminated 
fish in the Great Lakes.   
 
The last time that the Great Lakes experienced a significant decline in water levels was during 1962-1964.  These 
declines resulted in dramatic increase in dredging activity and expenditure by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the 
Corps is responsible for 145 harbours and 745 miles (1,200 kilometres) of channels in the Great Lakes/St. Lawrence 
area).  Prior to 1963, dredging activity for all of the U.S. federal port facilities in the Great Lakes averaged 372,000 
cubic yards (284,000 cubic metres) annually.  In the five years after 1963, dredging activity averaged 4,119,000 cubic 
yards (3,149,000 cubic metres) annually.  Activity was curtailed as lake levels rose in the subsequent 20 years.  
 
This tenfold increase in dredging activity is likely to be exceeded in circumstances like those projected in some climate 
scenarios.  During the last five years, average annual dredging activity has removed approximately 752,000 cubic yards 
(575,000 cubic metres).  Additionally, costs for dredging have risen significantly since the 1960s.  Current prices for 
dredging are averaging approximately $8.00 (U.S.) per cubic yard (0.8 cubic metres) with local highs going above  
$12.00 (U.S.) per cubic yard.  This implies that in a situation with heightened demand for dredging services, it would 
not be unreasonable to assume prices would be at least $10.00 to  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
18 
Climate Variability and Change in the Great Lakes Watershed 
 
$12.00 (U.S.) per cubic yard on average.  Therefore, in a situation where 7,500,000 to 12,500,000 cubic yards 
(5,730,000 to 9,560,000 cubic metres) are being removed from federal harbours on an annual basis, it is reasonable to 
assume that annual expenditures of $75 to $125 million (U.S.) could be expected as a minimal investment in Great 
Lakes shipping infrastructure.  
 
2.2.2   Impacts of Lake-Effect Snow  
Lake-effect snow is a common cold season phenomenon in the Great Lakes region, occurring most frequently in late 
autumn and early winter.  This type of snow results from the rapid warming and moistening of Arctic air masses that 
pass over lakes that are still relatively warm. The Arctic air becomes unstable and the resulting convection forms 
clouds and precipitation. The precipitation falls over and downwind of the lakes.  For very cold air masses, 
temperatures remain below freezing even after passage over the warmer lakes, causing the precipitation to fall as snow. 
 Lake-effect snow causes considerable enhancement of snowfall in narrow snowbelts along the downwind lakeshores. 
 For example, Detroit, Michigan on the western (upwind) shore of Lake Erie receives an average of 1.1 metres (42 
inches) of snow per year, while Buffalo, New York, on the eastern (downwind) shore of Lake Erie, receives an average 
of 2.3 metres (92 inches) per year.  Toronto, Ontario, on the northwestern (upwind) shore of Lake Ontario, receives 
about 1.4 metres (54 inches) per year, while Syracuse, New York, located to the southeast (downwind) shore of Lake 
Ontario, receives 2.8 metres (109 inches) per year and is the snowiest metropolitan area in the United States.  
 
Lake-effect snow creates transportation problems and results in additional costs to keep roads clear.  A major 
transportation artery, Interstate 90, passes along the southern shore of Lake Erie and is vulnerable to lake-effect snow 
storms.  Increased property damage, injuries, and deaths due to accidents and exertion accompany such events.  Major 
airports, such as those in Buffalo and Cleveland, are also vulnerable to disruptions.  The roofs of buildings in the 
snowbelts must be built to support heavier loads of snow than for locations away from the snowbelts (Schmidlin et al., 
1992).  Retail sales may drop temporarily.  A single lake-effect snowstorm near Cleveland, Ohio in November 1996 
resulted in eight deaths, hundreds of human injuries, widespread power outages, damage to numerous buildings, and 
over $30 million (U.S.) in economic losses (Schmidlin and Kosarik, 1999).  On the positive side, there is a large private  
snow removal business sector that benefits from the snowfall.  Sales of winter-related products may increase.  Lake-
effect snowfall also supports an important winter recreational industry in some parts of the Great Lakes.  Although 
there is not a large downhill ski industry in the Lake Erie snowbelt, many of the Midwest’s premier downhill ski resorts 
are located in the snowbelts of the other lakes in the region.  
 
Abnormally light snowfall amounts during the winter season have also created significant negative impacts, 
particularly when snowfall deficiencies have been widespread and the associated losses have affected many locations 
throughout the Great Lakes region.  Such was the case over most of the Great Lakes region during the 1997-1998 El 
Nino year.  The widespread nature of this event resulted in impacts over a large area.  For example, business at  
Midwest U.S. ski resorts was down 50 % and losses were estimated at $120 million (U.S.) (Great Lakes Regional 
Assessment Group, 2000).

Climate Variability and Change in the Great Lakes Watershed  
 
2.2.3 Great Lakes Water Diversion  
In 1900, the city of Chicago built the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal to keep sewage from contaminating the Chicago 
water supply intakes in Lake Michigan. The flow of water down the Chicago River was reversed; sizeable amounts of 
water were diverted from Lake Michigan. This diversion launched a series of continuing legal controversies involving 
Illinois as a defendant against claims by the U.S. federal government, various lake states, and Canada (which wanted 
the diversion stopped or drastically reduced).  During the past 96 years, extended dry periods lowered the lake levels. 
 Using these dry periods as surrogates for future conditions, their effects on the past controversies provide analogues 
for what might occur as a result of climate change.  The results suggest that changing socio-economic factors, including 
population growth, will likely cause increased water use, with Chicago seeking additional water from the Great Lakes. 
 New priorities for water use will emerge as in the past.  Future reductions in available water could lead to increased 
diversions from the Great Lakes to serve interests in and outside the basin.  Lower lake levels in the future could lead to 
conflicts related to existing and proposed diversions, and these conflicts would be exacerbated by the consequences of 
global warming.  Costs of coping with the new water levels could also be significant.  Should Lake Michigan levels 
drop by as much as five feet (1.6 metres) by the end of the 21st century (as projected using one Canadian climate 
change scenario), it is possible that a lowering of the level of the canal would be needed.  To lower the canal by four 
feet (1.2 metres), at least 30 miles (48 kilometres) of the canal would need to be dredged, and 15-17 miles (24-27 
kilometres) would be rock excavation at huge financial costs (Injerd, 1998).  A warmer climate, even with modest  
increases in precipitation, will likely lead to a drier climatic regime and will tax the economy and challenge existing 
laws and institutions for dealing with Great Lakes water issues.  
 
2.2.4 Agriculture and Drought  
The agricultural impacts in the U.S. of the drought of 1988 illustrate potential impacts of one possible future climate 
scenario, one that is warmer and much drier (National Assessment Synthesis Team, 2001).  The temperature and 
precipitation conditions in 1988 were similar to conditions in the 1930s.  Overall grain production was down by 31 %, 
with corn production down by 45 %.  The supply of grain was adequate to meet demand because of large surpluses 
from previous years; however, the drought reduced surpluses by 60 %.  Interestingly, overall farm income was not 
reduced because grain prices increased substantially (35 % for corn, 45 % for soybeans); however, these overall figures 
mask large losses in the heart of the drought region where yield reductions were much larger than the U.S. national 
average. The reduced production caused slightly higher domestic food prices, estimated at a one percent increase in 
1988 and a two percent rise in 1989. (In 1989, the drought persisted in some areas and surpluses were much reduced 
following 1988).  In summary, the drought of 1988 demonstrated that the agribusiness sector remains vulnerable to 
severe climatic anomalies, despite decades of advances in agricultural technology.  
 
2.2.5 Droughts, Insects, and the Decline of Forest Species  
In the late 1930s, many hemlock trees showed signs of deterioration in the Menominee Indian Reservation in east-
central Wisconsin.  Hemlock is an important forest tree at Menominee, which is located about 30 miles (48 km) north 
of the southwestern range limit of the tree.  By  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
20 
Climate Variability and Change in the Great Lakes Watershed  
 
the late 1930s, the hemlock borer, ordinarily not a problem, reached epidemic proportions. Careful examination 
(Secrest et al., 1941) revealed that extensive root damage had occurred during the drought years 1930-1937.  Borer 
attacks in 1938 were successful only on trees that had 10 % or less of their root system still alive.  In 1939, attacks were 
successful only on trees with less than half of the main lateral roots alive.  Obviously, hemlock borer attacks were  
successful only on trees that were already heavily damaged by unfavourable climatic conditions. The 1930s droughts 
were ultimately responsible for the loss of trees near the range limit, but insect attack was the proximate cause of death 
of trees already weakened by drought. The insight to be gained from this example is that unfavourable climatic 
conditions may not kill trees outright, but by stressing the trees, climate can contribute to death by insect attack.  
 
2.2.6 Heat Waves and Human Mortality  
A variety of weather phenomena can cause injury and death to humans.  People who lack protection from extremely hot 
or cold weather will eventually suffer from disturbances of normal physiological functions.  Exposure to extreme, 
prolonged heat is associated with cramps, fainting (syncope), heat exhaustion, and ultimately heat stroke.  Within 
limits, however, what is meant by Ňextreme” is somewhat relative, partly depending on previous exposure, 
physiological adaptation, age, and other health conditions.  Furthermore, the impact of temperature extremes depends 
on the length of time that people have been exposed to local conditions, socio-economic status and ability to cope, 
genetic predispositions to various conditions, and various physiological factors (Martens, 1998).  Some heat waves may 
last for a few days or for weeks, but the difference can influence how people with previous exposure or social 
conditions respond.  Long or repeated heat waves may not allow people’s bodies to recover from the heat.  Also, since 
heat waves often occur with little or no rain, high humidity, elevated ozone, and other air pollutants, susceptibility to 
these conditions also will affect health outcomes.  
 
Historic analogues have taught us that the impacts of climate change on human health in the Great Lakes region are 
likely to be greatest in urban areas, especially where extremely high temperatures historically have been rare.  For 
example, July 1999 was the hottest on record in New York.  As many as 70 people died in Chicago during a 1999 
summer heat wave where temperatures reached 37  C (99  F) (Currie, 1999).  But heat waves are not new to Chicago. 
 In 1995, more than 700 people died from exposure to extreme heat.  Most of these people were elderly.  The impact 
from heat stress can be minimized through appropriate behavioural adaptation, such as using air conditioning, wearing 
light clothing, and maintaining hydration. But the repeated occurrence of avoidable deaths during heat waves in the 
Great Lakes region suggests that adaptation is still imperfect (Great Lakes Regional Assessment Group, 2000).  
 
2.3 CLIMATE-RELATED IMPACTS ALREADY OBSERVED  
The climate of the Great Lakes region has changed, is changing, and will continue to change in the future (Great Lakes 
Regional Assessment Group, 2000; IPCC, 1996a).  Since there are a variety of systems in the region sensitive to 
climate, including human health, ecosystems, and socio-economic systems, it is reasonable to ask whether there have 
been noticeable changes in these systems as the climate has changed (IPCC, 1996b, 1997; Scheraga, 1998).   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
21 
Climate Variability and Change in the Great Lakes Watershed  
 
This is an important question for several reasons.  First, identifying impacts that have already occurred can help us 
better understand potential vulnerabilities to climate change.  Second, adaptation measures can, in many cases, reduce 
the magnitude of harmful impacts, or take advantage of beneficial impacts.  While it is impossible to attribute any of 
the observed impacts to human-induced climate change, as opposed to natural climatic variation, examination of  
impacts that have been manifested in the past may help us better evaluate our ability, or inability, to cope with future 
changes.  We may, for example, discover that as the climate continues to change, our ability to protect sensitive 
systems may be further challenged.  Third, any inability to cope with future changes may provide justification for 
taking actions to slow the rate of anthropogenically induced climate change, i.e. to reduce emissions of greenhouse 
gases1 from human activities.   Fourth, identifying impacts that have already occurred conveys the important point that 
climate change poses an immediate challenge to communities in the Great Lakes region.  It is not a long-term 
phenomenon that will first result in impacts 50 to 100 years from now.   
 
The distinction between climate variability and climate change is important if one is trying to associate observed 
impacts with longer-term climate change.  At any point in time, the climate in a region can be described by average 
conditions (where characterization of average2 conditions depends upon the length of the time period under 
consideration). Climate variability refers to fluctuations around the average conditions, and can refer to daily, weekly,  
monthly, or even inter-annual deviations (as in the case of El Nino events).  Climate change refers to longer-term 
changes in average conditions.  Typically, changes in climate can be described as Ňshort-term” (e.g. inter-annual), 
Ňmedium-term” (e.g. inter-decadal), or Ňlong-term” (e.g. across centuries or millennia).  The magnitude of impacts to 
climate-sensitive systems depends on the time period and geographic scale under consideration.  Short-term impacts 
(e.g. infrastructure damages resulting from one unexpected ice storm) differ from long-term impacts (e.g. expected 
infrastructure damages given a change in the frequency of expected ice storms as the climate changes).  
 
In this section, we provide several illustrations of the types of impacts that have been manifested as a result of changes 
in climate that have already occurred in the Great Lakes region.  They illustrate the types of effects (both positive and 
negative) that may occur at an increasing rate asst the climate in the Great Lakes region continues to change during the 
21  century – and at ath faster rate than observed during the 20  century (National Assessment Synthesis Team, 2000).   
Some of the expected change in regional climate will occur as the result of natural climatic variation.  Some will occur 
as the result of human activities that have already altered the atmosphere and committed us to future climate change. 
 Regardless of the source of change,  
 
 
 
 
1 The capacity to adapt or Ňcope” with climate change varies considerably throughout the Great Lakes region and  across 
demographic groups.  It also will vary over time.  Locations and communities with limited economic resources, low institutions, and 
inequitable levels of technology, poor information and skills, poor infrastructure, unstable or weak empowerment and access to 
resources have the least capacity to adapt.  They will also be the most vulnerable (IPCC 2001).  
 
 
2 
Climate is what you expect.  Weather is what you get.  If one lives in a particular location, you expect certain weather conditions on 
any particular day.  For example, on a typical winter day in January, one might expect freezing conditions and blustery winds in 
Chicago, given the current climate.  But it is still possible to be surprised and have a spring-like day with 60°F (16°C) temperatures 
and clear skies in the middle of winter.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
22 
Climate Variability and Change in the Great Lakes Watershed  
 
 
systems that are sensitive to changes in climatic conditions will be affected (Scheraga and Grambsch, 1998).  
 
2.3.1 Changes in Ice Cover  
Past studies have suggested that water temperature increases that would accompany climatechange in the Great Lakes 
region may lead to decreases in the duration and extent of icest cover over the 21  century (Lofgren et al., 2002; 
National Assessment Synthesis Team, 2001; Quinn et al., 1999; Fang and Stefan, 1998).  Such changes would have 
economic and ecological impacts.  Reduced ice cover duration would have feedbacks on lake evaporation, lake levels,  
and even lake-effect snowfall (by possibly affecting the seasonality of lake-effect snowstorms).  A longer ice-free 
season could translate into hundreds of millions of dollars of additional business revenue, although the shipping cost 
per ton would likely increase due to lower water levels (Chao, 1999).  Ecosystem services that could possibly be lost 
with a reduction of lake ice include storage of airborne atmospheric particulates until their rapid release in the spring,  
enhancement of overwinter survival of fish and fish eggs, and protection of the shore against erosion.  For the 
thousands of smaller lakes in the region, changes in the duration and extent of ice cover could eliminate fish winterkill 
in most shallow lakes, but possibly endanger wildlife, as well as traditional recreational users of these lakes because of 
reduced ice thickness.  
 
Figure 2-13 demonstrates that changes in the duration and extent of ice cover have already been observed in the Great 
Lakes region.  A 142-year record (1856-1998) of lake ice duration at Lake Mendota in Madison, Wisconsin is 
presented (National Assessment Synthesis Team, 2000).  It shows that lake ice duration has decreased by nearly one 
month over the past 150 years, with a record low in the winter of 1997-98.  This is consistent with observed increases 
in temperature.

Figures 2-14 and 2-15 present satellite photographs of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, taken 12 years apart.  Although one 
must be careful not to draw conclusions about long-term trends from two observations, the photographs depict dramatic 
differences in ice cover that were observed 12 years apart in the same location during the month of March.  In March 
1987, most of the gulf is covered by ice, reducing wave action and the amount of shore erosion, while on March 26,  
1999, little sea ice is present, exposing the shore to wave action produced by winter storms and increasing the risk of 
damages to the shoreline.

2.3.2 Canadian Port Gains as Ice Diminishes  
As the climate changes in the Great Lakes region, shippers are shifting marine routes to Churchill in Manitoba (Brooke, 
2000).  Churchill is the northernmost industrial harbour in Canada and the only major port on Hudson Bay.  For 
decades, Churchill was not an attractive harbour because of ice hazards.  But decreases in the duration and extent of ice 
cover are making Churchill a more attractive port.  By docking at Churchill (population 1,100), ocean-going ships 
benefit from rail links to the prairie heartlands of Canada and the U.S.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
25 
Climate Variability and Change in the Great Lakes Watershed  
 
The Canadian Ice Service has measured ice extent on July 15, the benchmark date for the annual start of shipping in 
Hudson Bay, since 1971.  Although there is variability in the amounts, the trend is that over the last three decades the 
expanse of Hudson Bay ice on that date has decreased by about one third.  The ice is gone from the port earlier and 
forms in the port later.  
 
In 1997, the Denver-based company, Omnitrax Inc., bought the port.  They hope to expand the standard insured 
shipping season from three months to five months, from July 1 to the end of November. Currently, the season is from 
July 21 to October 21.  
 
In addition to climate change, increased shipping in Churchill is a result of better ice mapping by the Canadian 
government, better ice detection equipment on ships, and aggressive marketing.  
 
Shipping wheat and other grains grown in the prairies through Churchill saves as much as $20 (U.S.) a tonne in 
shipping costs compared with the cost of sending grain through its competitor, Thunder Bay, Ontario, the starting point 
for the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway system.  Since Churchill is the closest port for one-quarter of Canada’s 
prairie farmers, they saved $10 million (U.S.) in international shipping costs in 2000.  
 
Thunder Bay’s season is still twice as long as Churchill’s.  However, shipping through Churchill is often cheaper 
because there are no seaway fees and grain does not have to be transferred from lake boats to ocean-going vessels. 
 Also, recent dredging increased Churchill’s navigation depth, allowing it to handle vessels loaded with 50,000 tonnes 
of grain, double the loads ocean-going boats at Thunder Bay can carry.  
 
With shippers shifting to Hudson Bay from Thunder Bay, about one third of Thunder Bay’s grain tonnage is now being 
shipped through Churchill – double the average share in the 1990s.  
 
This real example of a manifestation of climate change with significant economic impacts also illustrates how there 
will be Ňwinners” and Ňlosers” as the climate in the Great Lakes region changes.    
 
2.3.3 Shifts in Bird Ranges and Abundance  
A changing climate throughout North America – including the Great Lakes region – is already having direct and 
indirect effects on birds.  Higher temperatures are directly altering their life cycles.  The loss of wetlands, beaches, and 
other habitat could also have an important indirect effect, by making some regions less hospitable to birds than those 
regions are today.  
 
Many animals already may be responding to local climatic changes.  The types of changes already observed include 
poleward and elevational movement of ranges, changes in animal abundance, changes in body size, and shifts in the 
timing of events, such as earlier breeding in spring.  Possible climatically associated shifts in animal ranges and 
densities have been noted on many continents and within each major taxonomic group of animals (IPCC, 2001).  
 
Climate and climate change are strong drivers of biotic systems.  The distribution and survival of most species are 
moderated by climate (Root, 1988a,b,c; Martin, 1998; Duellman, 1999).   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
26 
Climate Variability and Change in the Great Lakes Watershed  
 
Although species have responded to climatic changes throughout evolutionary time (Harris, 1993), the primary concern 
today is the projected rapid rate of change.  High species richness appears to be related to stable conditions; abrupt 
impoverishment of species has occurred during times of rapid change (Tambussi et al., 1993).  
 
As temperatures warm, birds will tend to inhabit more northerly areas (in the Northern Hemisphere).  Data collected by 
the National Audubon Society’s Christmas Bird Count show that during years with warmer temperatures, the majority 
of bird species do not fly as far south for the winter.  Warmer temperatures also allow birds to spend their summers 
farther north.  A 1997 study examined the impact of warmer summers on the bobolink (a North American songbird) 
(Schneider and Root, 1997).  During summer, this bird is currently found throughout New England, the states that 
border the Great Lakes, and north of a line stretching from Missouri to Idaho.  With the projected climate changes 
under a 2xCO  scenario, the bobolink would not be found south of the Great Lakes.  
 
2.3.4 Maple Syrup Industry in the U.S. and Canada  
The maple sugar industry represents an important component of both New York’s and New England’s character and 
economy.  The successful maple syrup season depends on the proper combination of freezing nights and warm daytime 
temperatures greater than 40 F (4  C).  Once a string of days occurs where night-time temperatures no longer fall below 
freezing, sap flow stops.  The first sap flow of the season generally has the highest sugar content and the lowest  
nitrogen content, resulting in the highest quality syrup of a given season.  Therefore, the maple industry in New York 
and New England depends to a large extent on the timing of these critical climate events.  
 
The maple syrup industry in the U.S. has exhibited a dramatic decline since early in the 20th century (New England 
Regional Assessment Group, 2001).  This decline is due to many factors, including climate.  Climate impacts, such as 
drought and ice storms, have resulted in significant local and regional-scale maple tree damage, which has influenced 
sap flow and syrup production.  For example, the ice storms of 1998 appear to have had significant impacts on maple 
syrup production and tree health in the New York/New England region.  In areas where maple stands were affected by 
the ice storms, moderate to severe damage occurred on 22 % of the trees.  Northern New York was severely affected by 
the ice storms and an average of 26 % of the trees within damaged sugar bushes were severely damaged (80-100 % 
crown loss).  In addition, changes in the freeze/thaw cycle in New York and New England have affected sap flows.  
 
This is another example, however, of how there will be Ňwinners,” as well as Ňlosers,” as the climate changes (New 
England Regional Assessment Group, 2001).  Over the past 30 years, the Canadian maple industry has shown a 
dramatic increase, also due to many factors, including climate change, aggressive marketing, and the advent of tubing-
based methods of sap collection.  In the past, the success of the maple syrup industry in Canada was limited by deep 
snow cover (limiting access to individual trees) and fewer freeze/thaw cycles due to prolonged periods of low night-
time and day-time temperatures.  The development of tubing-based sap collection methods that provide easier access to 
trees and early initial flows and warmer night-time temperatures (fewer freeze/thaw cycles and reduced cold recharge 
periods) across New York  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
27 
Climate Variability and Change in the Great Lakes Watershed  
 
and New England over the past two decades, have resulted in a shift in syrup production to the Gaspé Peninsula of 
Quebec.  
 
The increased Canadian production of maple syrup has increased market competition with the U.S. Canadian 
production of maple syrup has tripled since the 1970s.  
 
Most disturbing are the results of ecological modeling efforts that show the changes in climate could potentially 
eradicate the sugar maple within New England.  The maple syrup industry is an important part of the New England and 
New York character, way of life, and economy that, because it is highly dependent upon prevailing climatic conditions, 
may be irreparably altered under a changing climate.

3.0 CONSEQUENCES OF REGIONAL CLIMATE CHANGE:   
OVERVIEW OF POTENTIAL IMPACTS  
 
This section provides a general overview of the potential changes in climate and the associated effects on ecosystems 
and human activities within the Great Lakes watershed.  Impacts to water quantity and water quality as well as impacts 
to quality of life (human health), resource use (e.g. forestry) and ecosystem health are key sustainability issues for the 
Great Lakes region.  
 
3.1 APPROACHES FOR THINKING ABOUT FUTURE CHANGES IN CLIMATE   
Confident  predictions of the future state of the climate are not possible because of the complexity of the climate system 
and the social and economic drivers of global change as well as inherent uncertainties and indeterminacies. 
Recognizing this, a variety of techniques have been used to develop Ňclimate scenarios” for climate change impact and 
adaptation assessments. Scenarios are developed from global climate models (GCMs), regional climate models 
(RCMs), downscaling, analogues (spatial and temporal), and systematic changes to observed climate data. Numerous 
resources provide guidance on climate scenario development (Rosenberg et al., 1993; Wilby and Wigley, 1997; IPCC, 
1999; Beersma et al., 2000; CCIS, 2002).  
 
Most climate change impact assessments in the Great Lakes region have used GCM scenarios (Croley, 1990; Chao, 
1999; Mortsch et al., 2000; Lofgren et al., 2002).  GCM scenarios are currently the best tools for understanding the 
human-caused influence on enhancing the greenhouse effect.  RCMs, when they are available, will be even more useful 
because of their smaller scale.  Spatial analogues have been used (Mortsch and Quinn, 1996; Croley et al., 1998;  
Kunkel  et al., 1998).  Historical/temporal analogues (usually of extremes) and systematic changes to climate variables 
have been used infrequently (Schwartz, 2001).  The benefit of these techniques is that they can explore vulnerability or 
sensitivity to current climate extremes and thresholds of changes. These scenarios are described in more detail in 
Appendix A.  
 
3.2 PROJECTED CHANGES IN CLIMATE   
Many attributes of the climate system in the Great Lakes watershed are projected to change.    
Key changes discussed include:  
 
  
Air temperatures increase.  
  
Daily air temperature range may decrease.  
  
Total annual precipitation increases but precipitation during key seasons  
may decrease.  
  
More precipitation may fall as rain and less as snow.  
  
Intensity of precipitation events may increase.   
  
Potential evapotranspiration increases with warmer air temperatures.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
33 
Consequences of Regional Climate Change  
 
3.2.1 Air Temperature  
Air temperatures increase.   
All GCM scenarios showed an increase in annual and seasonal mean temperatures for the Great Lakes watershed 
(Figure 3-1 and Appendix B for the seasons).  Spring (0.75 to 5.0  C) had the greatest range in temperature increase 
while summer had the least (1.5 to 4.0 C) 
 
Air temperature has an important role in defining the range limits of species through length of the growing season, the 
frost-free season and other important temperature thresholds.  It affects freeze and thaw cycles, the rate of chemical 
reactions, and biological productivity. Cold temperatures often limit pests and diseases.  Increases in air temperature 
can drive other changes such as water surface temperatures.   
 
Figure 3-1. Basin-wide annual temperature change ( C) versus annual precipitation change (%)  
for a number of GCMs using a range of emission scenarios (SRES and IS92a) for 2050, relative to 1961 – 1990.   
 
Source: CICS, 2002  
 
Daily air temperature range may decrease.  
Numerous GCM experiments have determined that the daily temperature range, the difference between the daily high 
and daily low temperature, tends to decrease with increasing greenhouse gas forcing and aerosol cooling.  For example, 
in the Canadian CGCM1 decreases are greatest during the winter while significant decreases also occur in spring and 
fall (Stone and Weaver, 2002).   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
34 
Consequences of Regional Climate Change    
3.2.2  Precipitation   
Total annual precipitation increases but precipitation during key seasons may decrease.  
Annual average precipitation increases in all scenarios (see Figure 3-1); however, precipitation change is not consistent 
throughout all seasons (see Appendix B – Figures B-1 to B-4).  All winter and spring scenarios have consistent 
increases in precipitation.  Summer has some modest increases but half the scenarios show a decrease in precipitation. 
 In autumn, about one third of the scenarios have precipitation decreases.   
 
Changes in precipitation, combined with temperature increases, will influence soil moisture, ground water recharge, 
and runoff in the Great Lakes watershed.  The critical factor for water availability is whether projected increases in 
precipitation will be offset by more water loss due to higher evaporation.  From a hydrologic perspective, the potential 
for decreases in precipitation during the summer and autumn is significant.  In the basin, these seasons are typically 
characterized by low stream flow.  In some scenarios, low flow conditions could become more extreme and Great 
Lakes residents and activities could become more vulnerable to water supply and demand mismatches in summer and 
autumn.  
 
More precipitation may fall as rain and less as snow.  
In the more southerly parts of Canada, such as the Great Lakes watershed, warmer air temperatures in winter and early 
spring affect the frequency of temperatures rising above the 0°C threshold and precipitation that previously fell as snow 
may fall as rain. The sensitivity of the form of precipitation to a changing climate is illustrated in Figure 3-2. A 2050 
scenario shows that the number of days with snow decreases and days with rain increases relative to 1961-90. As a 
result, more runoff may occur in winter; less snow may accumulate and it may become more intermittent.

Consequences of Regional Climate Change    
 
Intensity of precipitation events may increase.  
Extreme precipitation is expected to increase in a warmer world; this is consistent with a warmer atmosphere having a 
greater moisture-holding capacity (Trenberth, 1999; Kharin and Zwiers, 2000).  Moderate and heavy precipitation 
depends primarily upon the moisture already in the atmosphere with advection and re-supply of moisture by storm 
circulation also playing a role (Trenberth, 1999).   
 
Analyses of precipitation extremes in GCMs and RCMs indicate more heavy precipitation events, fewer moderate 
events and more dry days or days with light precipitation (Cubasch et al., 1995; Hennessy et al., 1997; Jones et al., 
1997 in Trenberth, 1999; Trenberth, 1999).  On a global scale, Kharin and Zwiers (2000: 3784) report that the 20-year 
return values of daily precipitation increased by 8 % and 14 % in 2040-2060 and 2080-2100, respectively, while the  
global precipitation rate increased by 1 % and 4 % during the same period.  
 
Changes in precipitation intensity can increase the risk of soil erosion, land and water quality degradation, flooding, 
and infrastructure failure.  In urban areas, longer periods of dry weather between rainfall events allow more pollutants 
to accumulate on road and land surfaces. This creates high loadings during the early onset of a precipitation event.   
 
3.2.3 Evaporation/Evapotranspiration  
Potential evapotranspiration increases with warmer air temperatures.  
As air temperature increases, the moisture-holding capacity of the atmosphere is enhanced.  The potential for loss of 
water to the atmosphere through evaporation/evapotranspiration demand should also increase.  Other factors such as 
wind speed, cloud cover, vapour pressure, and vegetation changes also influence the potential for water loss to the 
atmosphere, but in a humid region such as the Great Lakes, atmospheric moisture content is the most important factor.   
Figure 3-3 illustrates the change in potential evapotranspiration for climate change scenarios.  Actual 
evapotranspiration loss, however, is constrained by water availability as soil moisture and ground water.  
 
In a recent impact assessment for the Great Lakes, mean annual lake surface evaporation increased by +6 to +39 % 
(CGCM1 and HadCM2 scenarios) due to an increase in lake surface temperatures (Lofgren et al., 2002).

effects influence the airshed, nearshore, watershed, or in-lake regions.

3.3 IMPACTS OF PROJECTED CHANGES IN CLIMATE  
 
3.3.1 Water Supply    
Increasing air temperatures with associated evaporation and evapotranspiration changes as well as alterations to 
precipitation amount, timing, and duration could lead to more variability of water supply in the Great Lakes region. 
 The frequency of both droughts and flooding are expected to increase. Stream flow, lake levels, and ground water are 
affected.   
 
Key changes include:  
 
  
Annual runoff decreases for most climate change scenarios.   
  
More runoff may occur in winter.   
  
Spring freshet may occur earlier and have less flow.    
  
Summer and fall low flows may be lower and last longer.   
  
High flows may increase due to extreme precipitation events.  
  
Ground water recharge and levels may decrease.  
  
The amount and timing of ground water base flow to streams, lakes,   
     and wetlands may change.  
  
Water levels in lakes decline.  
  
Seasonal cycle of water levels is shifting.   
  
The ice cover season is reduced or eliminated completely.    
 
Stream flow/runoff  
A changing climate could have an effect on the magnitude of the mean, minimum, and extreme stream flows as well as 
their seasonal distribution and duration.   
 
Annual runoff decreases for most climate change scenarios.  
The impact of climate change scenarios on runoff reflects the complex interaction between gains due to precipitation 
increases and losses through more evaporation and transpiration.  Timing of these interactions is also important.  Most 
projections are for reductions in runoff for the Great Lakes watershed (Croley 1990; Lofgren et al., 2002).  Annual 
runoff changes for rivers in the Great Lakes basin are summarized in Table 3-1.  Decreases in mean annual flow 
suggest a decrease in stream flow persistence due to a decrease in base flow and higher evapotranspiration.  
 
The implications of mean flow changes range from influences on Great Lakes water levels, in-stream assimilative 
capacity changes affecting water quality, habitat deterioration, curtailment of water-based recreation, and access to 
water for irrigation, drinking water, and hydropower.

More runoff may occur in winter.    
Winter in the Great Lakes region is typically a period with reduced runoff due to frozen conditions; most precipitation 
falls as snow and is stored in snow pack.  Warmer winter temperatures may lead to more winter rainfall events, which 
create runoff.  Often infiltration is reduced at this time due to frozen ground conditions and more overland runoff may 
occur rather than infiltration.  Also, more frequent thaw and freezing episodes could melt the snow pack and  
contribute to runoff in winter.  In response, flow in rivers and streams increase.  Winter flooding could be more of a 
risk.  
 
Spring freshet may occur earlier and have less flow.    
A key feature of the hydrology of the Great Lakes region is that winter precipitation is stored in snow pack for a 
number of months and contributes very little to infiltration and runoff.  However, in the spring as temperatures rise 
above freezing, melt of the snow pack occurs and stream flow increases.  Peak flows can be high as the snow cover 
often melts during a short period.  Warmer temperatures throughout the winter may reduce precipitation falling as snow  
and over-winter storage of precipitation as snow cover.  Figure 3-5 illustrates that snow packs may become more 
intermittent and shallower because of warmer winter temperatures.  Earlier spring warming may bring on an earlier 
melt.  Since there may be less snow stored in the snow pack, the amount of water available to runoff and contribute to 
the peak flow will be less.  As a result, an earlier and less pronounced volume of runoff in spring - the freshet - occurs.

Summer and fall low flows may be lower and last longer.   
Flows in the Great Lakes watershed are typically low in late summer and early fall because of the effects of lower soil 
moisture, increased evapotranspiration and minimal ground water input.  However, summer and fall low flows may 
become even lower due to higher air temperatures, greater evapotranspiration losses, a longer 
evapotranspiration/evaporation season and reductions in groundwater base flow (Leavesley, 1994).  
 
Table 3-2 summarizes annual and summertime flow reduction at three locations in the Bay of Quinte watershed: the 
mouth of the Trent River as it enters the Bay, the Gull River (a headwater location), and the outlet of Stony Lake 
midway in the watershed.  Despite small increases in precipitation, flow rates decrease relative to the 1996 baseline due 
to higher air temperatures and greater potential evapotranspiration.  The precipitation for the 2090 scenario is 10 % 
higher than

the 1996 base line and this accounts for a rebound in annual average flow rates from 2050 to 2090.  The reductions in 
annual flow rate are the greatest at the Stony Lake site.  It is at the downstream portion of the Kawartha Lakes chain 
and is sensitive to water management activities and lake evaporation upstream.  Summertime flow reductions are very 
pronounced at all locations.  Summer reductions exceed the annual average changes because the GCM climate 
scenarios have lower summertime rainfall, slightly higher potential evapotranspiration, and warmer air temperatures. 
 The outflow from Stony Lake constitutes most of the flow in the Otonabee River that flows past and assimilates 
wastewater from the City of Peterborough.  
 
Table 3-2.  Changes in annual and summer flow for rivers in the Bay of Quinte watershed

High flows may increase due to extreme precipitation events.  
More extreme rainfall events, rain on snow, or rapid snowmelt, may cause more extreme runoff events and flooding 
(Whetton et al., 1993; IPCC, 1996).  
 
3.3.2 Ground Water  
Ground water is the source of drinking water for about 30 % of Canadian and U.S. residents in the Great Lakes region. 
 In Ontario, over 90 % of the rural population is supplied by ground water for drinking water as well as irrigation 
(Grannemann et al., 2000; Piggott et al., 2001).  The slow release of water from this underground reservoir provides a 
reliable, minimum flow of high quality water throughout the year to streams, lakes, and wetlands.  This is critical to 
aquatic habitat.  Ground water indirectly contributes more than 50 % of the flow in streams discharging to the Great 
Lakes (Grannemann et al., 2000).   
 
Ground water recharge and levels may decrease.  
Spatial and temporal changes in temperature (and associated evapotranspiration) and the magnitude and timing of 
precipitation and snowmelt modify infiltration of water to aquifers.  Both the increased frequency of droughts and 
heavy precipitation due to a changing climate can reduce recharge and water levels in aquifers.  Shallow aquifers 
consisting of unconsolidated sediments, weathered or fractured bedrock are more vulnerable to these changes in the 
short term whereas deeper aquifers will only exhibit changes in the long term.   
 
Less rainfall, higher evapotranspiration losses, and lower soil moisture during droughts reduce recharge and lower 
water levels in aquifers.  Development of dry, crusty tops on soils can impede infiltration once rain occurs.  Drought-
like conditions in Ontario from 1997 to 2000  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
44 
Consequences of Regional Climate Change    
 
revealed the vulnerability of southern Ontario rural areas to reduced ground water levels; some areas had reductions 
while others suffered a complete loss of water supply (Piggott et al., 2001).  
 
In extreme precipitation events, much of the precipitation is lost as overland flow or runoff rather than infiltrating to 
recharge groundwater (Soil and Water Conservation Society, 2003).  Although a changing climate may result in higher 
total annual precipitation, this may not correspond to an increase in actual aquifer recharge (Nastev et al., 2002).   
 
The amount and timing of ground water base flow to streams, lakes, and wetlands  
may change.   
Two climate change scenarios were applied to a network of 174 southwestern Ontario watersheds to determine 
potential impacts on groundwater conditions.  For the total annual base flow, the Canadian CGCM1 scenario projected 
an average decrease of 19 %, while the UK HadCM2 projected a modest 3 % increase (Piggott et al., 2001).  Both 
scenarios projected similar changes in the annual distribution of base flow; flow increased during the winter (less  
snow accumulation and more winter rain and runoff) and flow decreased during the spring and early summer. On a 
smaller scale, a study on the Grand River watershed in Canada also projected decreases in ground water flow (see 
Figure 3-6.) A U.S.-based assessment of the sensitivity of Lansing’s regional ground water supply to climate change 
reported similar base flow changes (Lofgren et al., 2002).  Base flow decreased by 19.7 % with the CGCM1 (2030  
scenario) while it increased by 4.1 % with the HadCM2 scenario.  Ground water contribution to local stream flow was 
also influenced (-32 % CGCM1 2030 scenario and +6 % HadCM2 2030 scenario).

2050, and 2090  
 
3.3.3 Great Lakes Water Levels  
A changing climate has a high likelihood of lowering water levels in the Great Lakes.  Figure 3-7 illustrates the 
crosscutting implications of a reduction in levels for ecosystems, economic activity, and policy development in the 
region.

Consequences of Regional Climate Change    
 
Water levels in lakes decline.  
Most climate change impact assessments project lower net basin supplies and reductions in water levels (see Table 3-
3).  As a result, the frequency and duration of low water levels could increase; average water levels could be below 
historic low extremes more frequently.  Only the UK HadCM2 scenario, wetter with less warming (see Appendix B), 
projects future increases in water levels.  These water level results reflect the critical balance between the timing and  
amount of precipitation and higher air temperatures and evapotranspiration.  
 
The low water levels experienced in the Great Lakes during 1999 to 2001 (and the associated issues) could occur more 
frequently in the future due to a changing climate.  Low water level conditions experienced in the summer of 2000 
along portions of the Lake Huron shoreline are illustrated in Figure 3-8.  The degree of shoreline exposure is a function 
of water level change and the slope of the shoreline (Wall, 1998).  Exposed shoreline and mudflats diminish aesthetics  
and enjoyment of recreational property.  Access for recreational boaters and at marinas is curtailed; safety issues arise. 
 Infrastructure needs to be modified and expenditures made to extend docks and dredge for access.  Lower lake levels 
reduce the risk of flooding, however, interest in developing on the exposed shoreline may increase (Moulton and 
Cuthbert, 2000).  
 
Low water levels restrict access of commercial navigation vessels in shipping channels, locks, and ports.  The Great 
Lakes shipping industry adapts by decreasing cargo to maintain draft for access to ports and shipping lanes and making 
more trips to carry cargo.  However, costs to the shipping industry as well as their customers increase.   
 
Dredging is a common response to low water levels but it is expensive.  A climate impact assessment of water level 
change on Goderich, Ontario found that dredging costs for the harbour could be as high as $6.84 million (CAD) 
(Schwartz, 2001).  The estimated cost of compensating for a 1.25 to 2.5 metre drop in the 101-kilometre stretch of the 
Illinois shoreline, including Chicago, entailed expenditures of $251 to $515 million (U.S.) over 50 years (Changnon et 
al., 1989).  This included harbour dredging as well as costs for refitting bulkheads, slips, and docks. Sometimes it is not 
feasible to dredge.  The Welland Canal is underlain by rock and deepening would entail a multi-year project with 
drilling and blasting (Lindeberg and Albercook, 2000).  Ironically, in the long term, dredging in connecting channels 
has the effect of further reducing water levels as more water flows through the dredged channel.   
 
Dredging raises environmental and human health concerns particularly where there may be contaminated sediment 
(Rhodes and Wiley, 1993).  Improperly conducted dredging can resuspend material that has been Ňstored” in the 
sediments.  Disposal of the dredged material raises issues of designating sites, ensuring the safe and secure containment 
of materials, and costs.  
 
Hydroelectric power production is reduced by lower water levels and reductions in connecting channel flows.  
 
Seasonal cycle of water levels is shifting.    
Lake levels in the Great Lakes typically progress through an annual cycle of high and low that ranges from 30 to 50 
centimetres.  Minimum levels occur in late autumn and early winter; they rise in spring with snowmelt and reach a 
maximum in July to September (depending on the  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
47 
Consequences of Regional Climate Change    
 
lake).  Then, they decline in autumn due to evaporation and reduction in runoff.  A changing climate could increase 
winter rainfall events creating more runoff in winter.  The spring water level rise may occur sooner due to warmer 
springs, but the maximum level attained may be reduced because of less snow to melt and more evaporation.  The fall 
decline may occur earlier and the minimum may be lower due to reduced runoff to the lakes during summer and fall.  
 
Distinct shifts are being detected in the seasonal cycle of water levels for the Great Lakes.  In Lakes Erie and Ontario, 
during the period from 1860 to 1990, the annual rise and fall of levels occurred approximately one month earlier; spring 
levels are becoming higher and fall levels are becoming lower sooner (Lenters, 2001).    Michigan-Huron exhibited a 
change in the timing and range of the seasonal water level cycle since 1860 (Argyilan and Forman, in press). The 
largest changes were detecting in the transition from winter to spring.  Levels were higher in winter and reflected a 
shift, since 1965, to more runoff in winter and less spring runoff.  In Lake Superior, summer and fall levels are 
decreasing (typically the high period) while spring and winter levels remain roughly the same.  The amplitude of the 
seasonal cycle has decreased.     
 
A change in the seasonal cycle has ecological implications (Mortsch, 1998).  For example, wetland vegetation relies on 
patterns of water level change to encourage particular vegetation growth.  Fish spawning could be affected through 
curtailed access to spawning beds and exposure of eggs once they are laid.

3.3.4 Ice Cover  
The ice cover season is reduced or eliminated completely.   
Climate warming could shorten the duration of the ice season on the lakes and reduce the extent of ice cover or even 
result in ice-free winters.  Lofgren et al. (2002) reported significant reductions in ice duration and extent on Lakes Erie 
and Superior.  For the CGCM1 scenario, reductions ranged from 12 to 47 days (2030 scenario), 16 to 52 days (2050 
scenario) and 37 to 81 days (2090 scenario).  Earlier assessments of these lakes with three 2xCO2 scenarios  
projected that the average ice duration could decrease by five to 13 weeks (Assel, 1991).  The maximum ice cover 
extent demonstrates the influence of a lake’s thermal capacity and is less sensitive to warming on Lake Erie than on 
Lake Superior (Lofgren et al., 2002).   
 
Changes in duration of ice can have impacts on evaporation, lake levels, and lake effect snow. Ice cover acts as a 
barrier, cutting off interaction between the atmosphere and the lakes.  The greatest evaporative losses from the Great 
Lakes occur in late fall and winter when cold, dry air passes over the warmer moist lakes.  A longer open water season 
enhances lake-effect snowfall if air temperatures do not rise above the threshold that prevents the formation of snow 
(Kunkel et al., 2003).  Ice is also important in protecting the shoreline from winter storms, as it is an effective barrier 
against wave erosion.  Ice also has important ecosystem functions such as over winter survival of fish eggs and winter 
fish kills due to low dissolved oxygen conditions.   
 
3.3.5 Water Quality   
Interactions between atmospheric, terrestrial, and aquatic processes in a watershed as well as the human use of 
resources affect water quality.  Climate change will influence these components leading to direct and indirect changes 
in water quality.   
 
Murdoch et al. (2000) produced an extensive review of the impact of climate change on water quality in North 
America.  The implications of an increase in temperature and a decrease in moisture (temperature increases and 
evapotranspiration exceed increases in precipitation) were reviewed.  Effects relevant to the Great Lakes watershed are 
summarized in Tables 3-4 and 3-5.

Consequences of Regional Climate Change    
 
Key implications for water quality discussed in this paper include:  
 
  
Warmer water temperatures affect physical, chemical, and biological processes.  
  
Taste and odour problems in drinking water may increase.  
  
Periods of thermal stratification may be extended with associated declines in  
dissolved oxygen.  
  
Changes in mixing depth affect productivity.  
  
Non-point source pollution increases with higher intensity precipitation events.  
  
Climate change may make it significantly more costly to meet water quality goals.  
  
Water quality remediation targets may not be met.  
 
Warmer water temperatures affect physical, chemical, and biological processes.  
As air temperature increases, water temperatures in rivers, streams, lakes, reservoirs, and ground water are also 
expected to mirror that rise.  Warmer water temperatures reduce dissolved oxygen concentrations, which are a critical 
aquatic ecosystem requirement.  Changes in rate of chemical reactions in the water column, sediment-water interface, 
and water-atmosphere interface are also expected.  
 
In Lake Superior, the deepest coldest lake, average annual surface water temperatures could increase 5  C by 2100 
(CGCM1 and HadCM2 scenarios).  Summer maximum surface water temperatures could be greater than 20  C (68  F) 
(Lehman, 2003).  Bottom water temperatures also increase but not as dramatically.  Higher bottom water temperatures 
increase the metabolic rates of invertebrates and microbes and accelerate dissolved oxygen use (Lehman, 2003).  
 
Warming may result in water temperature thresholds being reached for certain species. Breeding windows may be 
compressed or shifted.  Optimum temperatures for lake trout spawning in the autumn is 8 C to 11  C (46  F to 52  F) 
and spring spawning for northern pike is 4 C to 12  C (39  F to 54  F); warming could affect timing.  Similarly, other 
developmental responses that are cued by temperature could be affected.  Although metabolism changes and growth 
rates of species are important implications, the more serious biological concern is invasion by southerly species 
(Lehman, 2003).  
 
Ground water discharge plays an important role in maintaining cooler water temperatures in streams; this cooling effect 
could be reduced as ground water temperatures are expected to warm with increases in air temperature (Meisner et al., 
1988).  Cold-water fish could lose important habitat as temperatures rise above their thermal thresholds (Meisner, 
1990).  Shading by riparian vegetation could offset this effect.   
 
A water quality sensitivity analysis for the Grand River in Ontario showed that, in conjunction with nutrient loading, 
the dissolved oxygen levels in this eutrophic system were more sensitive to changes in water temperature, particularly 
over-night water temperature, than to changes in flow.  Similar relationships were observed during the 1998 and 1999 
droughts. Reduction/control of water temperature pollution may require a higher degree of consideration in the future  
(Minshall, 2000).

Consequences of Regional Climate Change    
 
The temperature of the water released from dams is dependent on whether the water is removed from warmer top of the 
reservoir (epilimnion) or the cooler bottom waters of the hypolimnion.  Release of cold reservoir water can influence 
water temperatures 48 kilometres downstream in small, shaded Minnesota streams but the distance is shortened by 25 
to 50 % in a 2xCO2 scenario (Sinokrot et al., 1995).   
 
Taste and odour problems in drinking water may increase.  
Phytoplankton community composition in lakes is influenced by water temperature; blue-green algae dominate at the 
highest temperatures, followed by green algae, then flagellates and finally diatoms at lowest temperatures (Magnuson 
et al., 1997).  Blue-green algae have been associated with taste and odour problems in drinking water during the 
summer (Anderson and Quartermaine, 1998).  Fishy, grassy, or earthy-musty odours occur.  Warmer water 
temperatures may increase algal blooms and may require changes to the water supply system as well as water  
treatment processes.  Various methods, granular-activated carbon and powder-activated carbon, can be used but water 
treatment costs increase (Johnson, 2001).  
 
Periods of thermal stratification may be extended with associated declines in  
dissolved oxygen.  
As air temperatures increase, water temperatures also warm leading to changes in thermal-density driven mixing 
dynamics.  These effects were modelled by Blumberg and DiToro (1990) for Lake Erie and McCormick (1990) for 
Lake Michigan, while Lehman (2003) assessed the impact on all Great Lakes; 2xCO2 scenarios were used in the first 
two studies and transient scenarios (CGCM1 and HadCM2) in the other.  Warming led to longer summer stratification  
(by up to two months).  Other implications reported include: surface waters warm more than bottom waters, a sharper 
temperature gradient occurs in the thermocline, physical exchange with the deep bottom waters decreases (McCormick 
1990), bottom water temperatures increase (above 4  C in 2090 for most lakes), sediment temperatures are warmer 
(Lehman, 2003), and dissolved oxygen in hypolimnetic water is depleted (Blumberg and DiToro, 1990; Lehman,  
2003). Lake Superior exhibits the greatest relative changes while Lake Erie exhibits the least.  Vulnerability to oxygen 
depletion in the lake bottom waters can be estimated using lake geometry ratios (relating surface area to maximum 
depth); Lake Ontario may be the most sensitive to hypolimnetic oxygen depletion, then Lake Superior, and then Lake 
Michigan (Lehman, 2003).  
 
Changes in mixing depth affect productivity.  
With increased stability of the thermocline, there may be less mixing and cycling of nutrients from the bottom waters. 
 Offshore areas are more dependent upon annual density-temperature driven mixing to bring up nutrients from the 
sediment; longer periods of nutrient limitation could occur (Lehman, 2003).  Mixing depth interacts with algal biomass 
and rates of primary productivity.  Most algal biomass is produced in a primary bloom in spring with a secondary  
bloom in autumn.  The spring bloom was projected to diminish if early stratification capped the nutrient supply and 
increased cloud cover reduced light input for photosynthesis (Brooks and Zastrow, 2003).  Fall production could also 
decrease due to an extension of the stratified period.  Nearshore areas may not be as nutrient limited because they 
receive nutrients from catchment runoff and are exposed to wave and wind mixing (Bootsma, 2001).

Consequences of Regional Climate Change    
 
Non-point source pollution increases with higher intensity precipitation events.  
Climate change is projected to increase the intensity of precipitation events.  As precipitation intensity increases, 
delivery of sediment, sediment-attached pollutants (e.g. phosphorus, ammonium, and pesticides), and soluble pollutants 
(e.g. nitrates, phosphorus, and pesticides) to water bodies increases.  Precipitation intensity has a greater effect on soil 
erosion than an increase in the frequency of precipitation events (see Table 3-6).  With more intense precipitation 
events, more pollutants reach watercourses directly and rapidly through surface transport than subsurface (ground 
water) flow.  Soil type, slope, and vegetation cover influence how changes in precipitation intensity and frequency 
affect soil erosion and runoff.  In agricultural areas, timing of planting, harvesting, tillage practices, and nutrient and 
pesticide applications interact and lead to different vulnerabilities for soil erosion during the seasons.  Spring can be a 
high runoff and pollution-loading period because fertilizer and pesticide application combine with little vegetative 
cover to increase vulnerability.  Episodic water quality problems increase in a changing climate (Soil and Water 
Conservation Society, 2003).

Climate change may make it significantly more costly to meet water quality goals.  
Aside from its direct effects on the hydrology of the Great Lakes, climate change may also affect water quality and the 
cost of environmental protection.  In the United States, current discharge limits for large point sources of pollution are 
generally based on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) evaluation of water treatment technology – in 
the parlance of the Clean Water Act, the best available technology economically achievable.  Hundreds of streams, 
rivers, and lakes in the Great Lakes region do not meet water quality standards even though most large point sources 
are already complying with these discharge limits.  In such cases, more stringent limits – total maximum daily loads 
(TMDLs) – must be developed for all the pollutant sources within an impaired water body’s watershed.  For the  
point sources, increasing their treatment efficiency to meet TMDLs can be an expensive proposition, and climate 
change may have the effect of increasing the costs of treatment to meet water quality goals.  
 
Flow in the water body is one of the key determinants in setting TMDLs.  In the same way that floods (high flow 
conditions) can be characterized in terms of recurrence interval (e.g. the 100-year flood), so can low flow conditions. 
 Water quality planners use the 10-year recurrence interval low flow (averaged over a seven-day period) as the Ňdesign 
flow,” i.e. the basis for determining how much pollutant a water body can receive without exceeding a water quality  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
54 
Consequences of Regional Climate Change    
 
standard – the lower the flow, the more stringent the TMDL.  Some simulations of climate change indicate that 
precipitation patterns are likely to shift and evapotranspiration increases such that drier periods will become more 
common.  This would lead to a shift in flow patterns; for a given stream, the 10-year recurrence interval low flow 
would become lower than it is now, and TMDLs would need to be more stringent.  
 
The potential impact of climate change on low flow standards could be substantial. A recent study by Eheart et al. 
(1999) examined a range of climate change scenarios and scenarios of stream-supplied irrigation. Their results suggest 
that a 25 % decrease in mean precipitation could lead to a 63 % reduction in design flow, even in the absence of 
irrigation. With irrigation, the reduction could be as much as 100 %. These changes would affect the frequency of 
single violations and multiple violations of low flow criteria. Single violations could increase several-fold with 
irrigation, and multiple violations in a three-year period could increase from around 20 % to nearly 100 % as climate 
change becomes more severe.   
 
The effects of climate change on stream flow could have significant implications for the cost of meeting water quality 
standards in the United States. Preliminary results from a screening study being conducted by U.S. EPA’s Global 
Change Research Program suggest that even a small reduction in the design flow would have significant cost 
implications, i.e. holding all other factors constant, climate change may make it significantly more costly to meet water 
quality goals in the Great Lakes region. The study is focusing on 235 publicly owned treatment works (POTWs, or 
sewage treatment plants) discharging to streams and rivers that are impaired due to organic enrichment and low 
dissolved oxygen. These POTWs will probably be required to meet TMDLs more stringent than current discharge 
levels, and the effect of climate change on streamflow could result in even more stringent discharge limitations.  
 
Water quality remediation targets may not be met.  
Lower streamflow and higher non-point source runoff results in a phosphorus increase of 25 to 35 % to the Bay of 
Quinte. Average annual phosphorus projections at the mouth of the Trent River are presented in Figure 3-9 for CGCM1 
scenarios.  Although runoff is projected to decrease, non-point source loadings of phosphorus increase by about 25 %, 
10 %, and 15 % in 2030, 2050, and 2090, respectively.  All point source loadings as well as agricultural/livestock  
and septic system inputs were not modified for future changes. Winter precipitation increases and erosion also 
increases because precipitation falls as rain on exposed soils.  Under 1996 base case conditions, the Bay of Quinte 
Remedial Action Plan target for phosphorus is achieved on average.  However, under the climate change scenarios, the 
target becomes very difficult to achieve, especially as the more easily managed components of the watershed 
phosphorus load become a smaller percentage of the total (Walker, 2001).

3.3.6 Human Health   
Certain health outcomes are known to be associated with weather and/or climate, including: illnesses and deaths 
associated with temperature; extreme precipitation events; air pollution; water contamination; and diseases carried by 
mosquitoes, ticks, and rodents.  Because human health is intricately bound to weather and the many complex natural 
systems it affects, it is possible that projected climate change will have measurable impacts, both beneficial and  
adverse, on health.  Projections of the extent and direction of potential impacts of climate variability and change on 
health are extremely difficult to make because of many confounding and poorly understood factors associated with 
potential health outcomes, population vulnerability, and adaptation.  
 
Health outcomes in response to climate change are highly uncertain. Currently available information suggests that a 
range of negative health impacts is possible, although some positive health outcomes (e.g. reductions in cold-weather 
mortality) could occur.  In this section, the categories of climate-induced health effects that have received the most 
attention in the literature are examined: water-borne and food-borne diseases; health effects related to extreme  
weather events; air pollution-related health effects; heat-related illnesses and death; and vector-borne and rodent-borne 
diseases.  
 
Key implications for human health discussed in this paper include:  
 
  
Water-borne diseases may increase.  
  
Health effects related to extreme weather events may increase.  
  
Air pollution-related health effects could intensify.  
  
The number of heat-related illnesses and deaths may rise.  
  
Vector-borne and rodent-borne diseases may become more common.  
 
At present, much of the U.S. and Canadian populations are protected against adverse health outcomes associated with 
weather and/or climate, although certain demographic and geographic populations are at greater risk.  Adaptation, 
primarily through the maintenance and improvement  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
56 
Consequences of Regional Climate Change    
 
of public health systems and their responsiveness to changing climate conditions and to identify vulnerable 
subpopulations, should help to protect the U.S. population from adverse health outcomes of projected climate change. 
The costs, benefits, and availability of resources for such adaptation must be considered, and further research into key 
knowledge gaps on the relationships between climate/weather and health is needed.  (National Assessment Synthesis  
Team, 2000).  
 
Populations Most Vulnerable to Climate Change Health Threats in the Great Lakes Region  
 
Within the Great Lakes region, the elderly, children, low-income, and immune-compromised individuals already are at 
higher risk from a variety of environmental hazards, including air pollution, water pollution, heat stroke, and infectious 
diseases. These same individuals may be more vulnerable to health risks that can be intensified by climate change. 
 
Despite the capacity to adapt in the United States and Canada, one cannot be cavalier about the effectiveness of 
adaptive strategies when making projections of future vulnerabilities to climate change. As noted in section 5.1.4 of this 
paper, historic evidence suggests that society has not always successfully adapted to existing risks.  For example, public 
health and emergency infrastructure have experienced difficulties in coping with multiple emergencies and health  
threats such as floods, ice storms, and disease-causing organisms such as E. coli, coronavirus (SARS), and West Nile 
virus. The reasons for such shortcomings need to be explored to help improve the design of future adaptation measures.  
 
Water-borne diseases may increase.  
Climate change and weather variability in the Great Lakes region pose threats for water-borne diseases, some food-
borne diseases, and marine and coastal issues, including harmful algal blooms and ecological disruption.  Changes in 
precipitation, temperature, humidity, salinity, and wind have a measurable effect on the quality of water used for 
drinking, recreation, and commerce.  Heavy rainfall has been associated with water-borne disease outbreaks throughout  
the United States and Canada.  
 
Although environmental regulations protect much of the U.S. and Canadian populations, current deficiencies in 
watershed protection and storm drainage systems can increase the risk of contamination events if rainfall increases as 
projected with climate change.  For example, wastewater systems that combine storm water drainage and sewage are 
still in use in about 950 communities in the United States (Figure 3-10).  These systems service both public wastewater  
and drinking water. Increased storm events could lead to more combined sewage overflow events.  During periods of 
heavy rainfall, these systems discharge excess wastewater directly into surface water bodies that may be used to 
provide public drinking water.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
57 
Consequences of Regional Climate Change    
 
Figure 3-10. Location of combined wastewater systems in the United States (National  
Assessment Synthesis Team, 2000).  
 
Also, many experts agree that the Canadian population is not as well protected from water-borne illness as it could be. 
Coast-to-coast enforceability of drinking water standards in all jurisdictions and the evolution of a preventive quality 
management approach would better protect public health, and would foster greater adaptability to changing conditions.  
 
Strategies that could reduce the risks of water-borne diseases include:  
  
Improved surveillance for infectious diseases.   
  
Enhanced water systems and improved water systems engineering.   
  
Watershed protection policies.  
  
Enforceability of drinking water regulations.  
  
Water quality management approaches that foster continuous improvement and prevention.  
 
Health effects related to extreme weather events may increase.  
Changes in the frequency, timing, intensity, and duration of extreme weather events, such as floods and storms, could 
have negative health impacts in the Great Lakes region. Potential effects from weather disasters range from acute 
trauma and drowning to conditions of unsafe water and post-traumatic stress disorder.  
 
The health impacts of floods, storms, and other extreme weather events hinge on a number of factors, the most 
important being the vulnerabilities of the natural environment and the local population, as well as on their capacity to 
recover. The location of development in high-risk areas, such as coasts and floodplains, increases a community’s 
vulnerability to extreme weather effects.  
 
Strategies that could reduce the risks from extreme weather events include:  
  
Emergency response plans with transportation and power back up plans.  
  
Continued refinements to public early warning systems.  
  
Improved engineering for flood control.  
  
Enhanced zoning and building codes.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
58 
Consequences of Regional Climate Change    
 
Air pollution-related health effects could intensify.  
Climate change and variability may affect exposure to air pollutants in the Great Lakes region by influencing local 
weather, changing the distribution and types of airborne allergens, and increasing both human-driven and natural 
emissions.  
 
The mechanisms by which climate change affects exposures to air pollutants include (1) affecting weather and thereby 
local and regional pollution concentrations; (2) affecting human-caused emissions; (3) affecting natural sources of air 
pollutant emissions; and (4) changing the distribution and types of allergens (National Assessment Synthesis Team, 
2000).   
 
Warmer and more variable weather may cause increases in ground-level ozone (Figure 3-11).  These increases could 
intensify respiratory diseases by damaging lung tissue, reducing lung function, and sensitizing the respiratory tract to 
other irritants.  More air conditioning use due to warmer temperatures could cause an increase in potentially harmful 
power plant emissions.  Exposure to particulate matter from these and other combustion-related sources can aggravate  
chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, alter host defences, damage lung tissue, lead to premature death, and 
possibly contribute to cancer.  
 
Figure 3-11. Ozone concentrations versus maximum temperature (National Assessment  
Synthesis Team, 2000).  
 
Without knowledge of future emissions in specific places, the success of air pollution policies, and local and regional 
meteorological scenarios, more specific predictions of exposure to air pollutants and health effects cannot be made with 
confidence.  
 
Strategies that could reduce the risks from air pollution include:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
59 
Consequences of Regional Climate Change    
 
  
Improved early warning systems for air quality.   
  
Increased use of mass transit.  
  
Better urban planning.  
  
Improved pollution control policies.  
  
Changes to building codes to design cooler buildings.  
  
More non-emitting energy sources.  
 
The number of heat-related illnesses and deaths may rise.  
More frequent heat waves are projected to accompany climate change in the Great Lakes region.  In addition, it is 
expected that average nighttime temperatures will continue to rise faster than average daytime temperatures, removing 
the possibility of nighttime heat relief for exposed populations.    
 
Studies in urban areas, mostly in temperate regions, show an association between increases in heat and increases in 
mortality (McGeehin and Mirabelli, 2001).  The risk of heat stress may rise as a result of climate change (Kalkstein and 
Greene, 1997).  The most vulnerable populations within heat-sensitive regions are urban populations. They are likely to 
experience the greatest number of heat-related deaths and illnesses, which include heat cramps, fainting, heat  
exhaustion, and stroke. Within these vulnerable populations, the elderly, young children, the poor, and people who are 
bedridden or are on certain medications are at particular risk.  
 
Cities in the Great Lakes region are particularly vulnerable to heat-related illnesses and deaths.  High temperatures 
currently occur infrequently or irregularly in these cities, so people living in these urban areas have not acclimatized to 
heat to the same degree as populations in more southern cities.  
 
Milder winters could potentially reduce the current level of winter deaths. In general, however, more research is needed 
to understand the relationship between temperature and winter deaths. Strategies that could reduce the risks of heat-
related illnesses and death include:  
  
Individual behaviour changes, including increased fluid intake and increased use of air  
conditioning.   
  
Development of community-wide heat emergency plans.  
 
To be effective, adaptive responses must target these vulnerable regions and demographic groups, some of which may 
be difficult to reach (Chestnut et al., 1998).  For example, the elderly are less likely to perceive excess heat (Blum et al., 
1998).  They may be socially isolated and physically frail (Semenza et al., 1996; Kilbourne et al., 1982).  This may 
make it difficult to convince them to use air conditioning (i.e. because they do not feel the heat) or to travel to air- 
conditioned environments (e.g. they may have no one to take them and may be unable to travel on their own).  The 
poor may not be able to afford air conditioning, and if they live in high crime areas, then they may be afraid to visit 
cooling shelters.  Finally, for infants and young children, decisions about how warmly to dress and how much time to 
spend in hot environments are often made by adults, with the children and infants unable to effectively communicate 
their discomfort (Blum et al., 1998).

Consequences of Regional Climate Change    
 
Vector-borne and rodent-borne diseases may become more common.  
Vector-borne diseases result from infections transmitted to humans and other animals by blood-feeding insects, such as 
mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas.  Most vector-borne diseases exhibit a distinct seasonal pattern, which clearly suggests that 
they are weather sensitive. Specifically, some vector-borne diseases are sensitive to changes in temperature and 
humidity because the reproductive success and feeding habits of vectors (e.g. mosquitoes), as well as pathogen  
replication within vectors, may be sensitive to temperature and humidity. For example, past St. Louis encephalitis 
outbreaks have been associated with a pattern of warm, wet winters, cool springs, and hot, dry summers.   
 
Rodent-borne diseases are less directly affected by temperature. However, the impact of weather on disease-carrying 
rodent populations (for example, increased food supply or exposure during flooding) can affect transmission of diseases 
such as hantavirus and flea-borne plague.  
 
Case Study: Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome in the Southwestern United States  
 
In 1993, a disease characterized by acute respiratory distress with a high death rate (>50 %) among previously healthy 
persons was identified in the southwestern United States. This disease, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), was 
traced to a virus maintained and transmitted primarily within populations of a common native rodent, the deer mouse.  
 
After the outbreak occurred, researchers hypothesized that it was due to environmental conditions and increased rodent 
populations caused by unusual weather associated with the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in 1991-92.  It was 
suggested that a cascading series of events from weather (unseasonable rains in 1991 and 1992, and the mild winter of 
1992), through changes in vegetation, to virus maintenance and transmission within rodent populations, culminated in 
changes in human disease risk from HPS.  Public health officials wanted to understand the cause of the outbreak so 
they could develop effective techniques for intervening and preventing the disease.  
 
An EPA-sponsored study at The Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health explored this hypothesis by 
comparing the environmental characteristics of sites where people were infected with those sites where people were not 
infected (Glass et al., 2000). This research found that high-risk areas for HPS can be predicted over 6 months in 
advance based on satellite-generated risk maps of climate-dependent land cover. Predicted risk paralleled vegetative 
growth, supporting the hypothesis that heavy rainfall from El Niño in 1992 was associated with higher rodent 
populations that triggered the Hantavirus outbreak in 1993. Landsat satellite remote sensing images from 1995, a non 
El Niño Ňcontrol” year, showed low risk in the region, whereas the images from the 1998 strong El Niño again  
showed high risk areas as in 1992-93. Trapping mice in the field (collectors blinded to risk category) validated these 
satellite-generated risk maps with mouse populations directly related to risk level, with a correlation factor of over 0.90. 
Risk classification also was  consistent with the numbers of HPS cases in 1994, 1996, 1998, and 1999.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
61 
Consequences of Regional Climate Change    
 
In general, disease transmission by insects and rodents is a complex process and unique for each disease.  Population 
characteristics, human behaviour, and ecological factors play a critical role in determining when and where disease 
occurs, which makes it unlikely that increasing temperatures alone will have a major impact on tropical diseases 
spreading into the United States and Canada.  There is even greater uncertainty regarding diseases that cycle through  
animals and can also infect humans, such as Lyme disease and mosquito-carried encephalitis viruses.  
 
Strategies that could reduce the risks of vector-borne diseases include:  
  
Improved disease surveillance in humans and animals, vectors.  
  
Enhanced insect-control programs.   
  
Reduced human exposure by identifying risk areas or risk behaviours.  
  
Vaccine development and improved protections for U.S. and Canadian travelers to disease- 
endemic areas.  
  
Changed building codes (screens for example).  
  
Removal of standing water in areas such as parks and fountains.  
 
3.3.7 Natural Ecosystems and Biodiversity   
In a changing climate, natural ecosystems will be affected by CO2 enrichment, changes in timing and amount of 
precipitation, warmer temperatures, higher evaporation, less water availability, and extreme events.  However, it is 
expected that natural ecosystem responses to a changing climate are likely to be non-linear; change may not occur until 
a threshold has been reached and then rapid, dramatic transitions may occur (Moll and Hudon, 1998).  Ecological  
surprises are expected.  Some species will benefit while others will not.  Detailed assessments of impacts on particular 
species and ecosystem functioning are limited by the complexity and interconnectedness of ecosystems (Fisher et al., 
2000).   
 
Nevertheless, some key implications of climate change on natural ecosystems have emerged; they include:  
 
  
Biological productivity is expected to increase with moderate temperature  
increases.  
  
Zoogeographical boundaries move in a changing climate.    
  
Introduction of invasive species could be exacerbated.  
  
Existing community structures and interactions may change.  
  
A changing climate is expected to lead to reduction in some habitats.   
  
Wetland vegetation communities, functioning, and values may change.  
  
Wildlife is susceptible to climate changes.  
  
Rare and endangered species may be more vulnerable.  
 
Biological productivity is expected to increase with moderate temperature increases.  
Earlier warming of spring temperatures and later cooling of temperatures in autumn contribute to an earlier start for 
plant growth and a longer growing season.  If other factors such as  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
62 
Consequences of Regional Climate Change    
 
nutrients, water availability, and sunlight are not limited, plant productivity is expected to increase.  Terrestrial 
photosynthetic activity monitored from satellite from 1981-1991 has shown an increase that may be rated to warming. 
 The greatest increases were from 45 N to 70  N (Myneni et al., 1997).  
 
Zoogeographical boundaries move in a changing climate.    
Climate change is projected to alter the fundamental climatic basis for contemporary diversity gradients (based on 
factors such as energy requirements or temperature thresholds).  For example, species currently at the limits of their 
physiological tolerance to temperature may not persist if climate warming takes local climate beyond their temperature 
threshold.  They will need to migrate in order to remain within a climatically suitable region (Kerr and Packer, 1998).   
Or, a species may be opportunistic and expand to suitable conditions.  Adaptation by migrating assumes that species are 
able to move rapidly enough to remain within their preferred climate zones even with natural and human-caused 
barriers.  For example, birds, mammals, and annual plants may be able to migrate more easily than fish that are 
constrained by interconnectedness of water systems and trees that have slow growth rates influencing dispersion.  
 
Range extensions have been observed; the average latitude of occurrence of 43 % of warblers in the U.S. has shifted 
north an average 70 kilometres in 20 years (Price and Root, 2000).  Climate change impact assessments have projected 
that fish ranges could move more than 500-600 kilometres northward leading to invasions of warmer water fish and 
extirpations of colder water fish (Magnuson et al., 1997).  Similarly, a study by Kerr and Packer (1998) demonstrated 
the potential for an influx of southern species; mammal diversity was projected to increase by 10 % in southern 
Canada.    
 
Introduction of invasive species could be exacerbated.  
An invasive species is a species that is beyond its natural range or natural zone of potential dispersion.  Invasive 
species, a current stress in the Great Lakes region, could be exacerbated with a changing climate.  Species currently 
limited to southern states may be able to extend their range northward into the Great Lakes region.  Accidental 
introductions (e.g. bilge water) may be more successful because of altered environmental conditions and stress to 
existing native species.  Through this process, indigenous species are threatened and ecosystems can be radically 
changed through transformations and extinctions (Rendell, 2002).  Species such as carp, zebra mussel, purple 
loosestrife, curly-leaf pondweed, and Eurasian milfoil are examples of species whose introductions have affected the 
Great Lakes ecosystem.  Warmer water temperatures due to a changing climate may allow the zebra mussel to become 
more widespread on Lake Superior.  At present, it is primarily found in the lower Great Lakes while the cold  
water of Lake Superior limits its expansion (Easterling and Karl, 2001).  
 
Existing community structures and interactions may change.  
Existing community structures may be vulnerable because species will have different adaptation potential to a changing 
climate (Gitay et al., 2001).  For example, some plants may not be able to migrate quickly due to their dispersion rates 
and growth rates while others may be more adept at filling emerging niches or overcoming human and natural barriers 
(Fisher et al., 2000).  As a result, ecosystems may not be able to respond with a cohesive turnover from one group of  
species to another.  Instead, certain ecosystem components (e.g. some species or age classes) may react more quickly 
than others and will move individually thereby producing new  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
63 
Consequences of Regional Climate Change    
 
combinations in colonized areas (Fleming and Candau, 1998).  Resident ecosystems may lose their more sensitive 
components.  Biodiversity measured by richness (number of species) and evenness (lack of dominance) could change 
dramatically as ecosystems respond. For example, blue-green algae dominate at warm water temperatures.  This has 
ecological and socio-economic implications; blue-green algae cause taste and odour problems in drinking water and  
are not preferred food.  
 
Fleming and Candau (1998) provide an excellent case study of the spruce budworm-forest ecosystem that illustrates 
how a changing climate affects population level processes, interactions, and timings that influence the ecosystem’s 
characteristics.  For example, alteration in rates of phenological development shifted the synchrony between life stages 
of the spruce budworm as a prey and its vulnerability to parasites; natural mortality processes were affected.  Weather 
extremes and forest fires altered the health and distribution of the host trees affecting the severity and opportunity for 
spruce budworm infestation.     
 
A changing climate is expected to lead to reduction in some habitats.   
Climate change is another factor that contributes to habitat change and destruction; it also causes habitat fragmentation. 
 Terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in the Great Lakes region will not necessarily respond to a changing climate 
similarly due to different edaphic characteristics, hydrology, surrounding land uses, and human stresses.  This is 
expected to lead to reduction in some habitats and an increase in others.  Loss of habitat can reduce genetic diversity 
through the loss of locally adapted genotypes, particularly those species with limited migration capability (Anderson et 
al., 1998).  
 
In climate warming scenarios, habitat for warm-, cool-, and cold-water fish increases in deep stratified lakes if 
dissolved oxygen concentrations do not become limiting.  But, habitat for cold-water fish decreases in shallow, 
unstratified lakes (Magnuson et al., 1997).  The cold-water stream habitat of some fish species decreases with warmer 
air temperatures and warming of surface waters and ground water inputs.  For example, cold-water habitat for brook 
trout in two southern Ontario streams decreased significantly with climate change scenarios (Meisner, 1990).  Small, 
shallow lakes (e.g. Wisconsin) could disappear where evaporative losses exceed input by precipitation.  Reductions in 
volume and increases in residence time may cause these lakes to undergo marked shifts to more eutrophic, saline, and 
contaminated states (Magnuson et al., 1997).  Small semi-permanent, pothole wetlands are also vulnerable to water 
balance changes.  Area of wetland decreases, vegetation composition changes to drier species, and the interspersion of 
water and wetland plants decreases (Poiani and Johnson, 1993).  Waterfowl populations decrease as habitat declines.   
 
Wetland vegetation communities, functioning, and values may change.  
Air temperature and water balance changes may have significant implications for wetland functioning and values as 
well as vegetation community composition.  Other impacts on wetlands from a changing climate include warmer water; 
reduction in water levels; changes in timing and amount of water flowing through a wetland affecting flushing, 
sedimentation, nutrient input; and length of ice cover.  
 
Wetlands that are directly dependent on precipitation input (with evapotranspiration losses) such as bogs are likely to 
be more vulnerable to climate change than those that are reliant on ground  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
64 
Consequences of Regional Climate Change    
 
water drainage.  Great Lakes shoreline wetlands such as marshes linked to the lakes may be the least vulnerable 
(depending on geomorphology) (Jacobs et al., 2001). The annual and perennial vegetation of marsh wetlands may be 
able to migrate in response to water level declines; however, trees in swamps are slow to respond to environmental 
changes.  Great Lakes shoreline fens may be vulnerable because they are more strongly influenced by regional ground 
water input than Great Lakes water levels.  
 
A changing climate will have two important effects on water levels: an increased frequency and duration of low water 
levels and a change in the seasonal cycle of high and low.  Generally, wetland vegetative zones shift lakeward in 
response to a decrease in water levels, as the landward margins of the wetland dry up.  Wetland vegetation 
communities requiring little water such as sedges, grasses, wet meadows, and trees replace emergents and submergents. 
 Indirect effects of lower lake levels include an increase in the occurrence of fires and oxidation of wetland bottoms, 
which can cause the germination of seeds buried in the substrate.  The geomorphology of the wetland, shoreline slope, 
soils, and man-made structures affect a wetland’s ability to adapt to water level changes (Mortsch, 1998).  
 
Wildlife is susceptible to climate changes.   
Wildlife is susceptible to extreme climate events.  Droughts and periods of excessive wetness can affect habitat and 
food supply.  Reproduction can decrease leading to poor recruitment and declines in population (Easterling and Karl, 
2001).  Temperature changes can influence the timing of events such as breeding and bird migration (earlier arrival 
dates of spring migrants and later autumn departure dates) (Kerr and Packer, 1998).    
 
Rare and endangered species may be more vulnerable.  
Species are identified as rare or endangered because they have a small range size, a limited distribution of suitable 
habitat within their range, and/or a small population size.  These populations have very restricted habitat requirements 
or habitat availability; they are the most vulnerable to changes and have the least adaptation options 
.   
3.3.8 Agriculture  
Agriculture is of vital importance to the entire Great Lakes region, the United States and Canada, and the world. It is an 
economically important sector and a major source of food supplies.  At the same time, agriculture is a weather- and 
climate-sensitive sector.  The types of crops that can be grown is partly a function of the regional climate.  The yields 
of these crops are sensitive to the amount of water and the frequency of its availability.  
 
Key impacts of climate change include:  
 
  
Yields are expected to increase but not in all regions.  
  
Demand for water by the agricultural sector will likely increase.  
  
The impact of climate change on agriculture may be enhanced by current stresses.  
  
Adaptation strategies will likely be necessary.  
 
Yields are expected to increase but not in all regions.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
65 
Consequences of Regional Climate Change    
 
Agriculture has exhibited a capacity to adapt to moderate differences in growing season climate, and it is likely that 
agriculture would be able to continue to adapt.  With an increase in the length of the growing season, double cropping, 
the practice of planting a second crop after the first is harvested, is likely to become more prevalent.  The CO2 
fertilization effect is likely to enhance plant growth and contribute to generally higher yields.  The largest increases are  
projected to occur in the northern areas of the region, where crop yields are currently temperature limited.  However, 
yields are not likely to increase in all parts of the region.  For example, in the southern portions of Indiana in the United 
States, corn yields are likely to decline, with 10-20 % decreases projected in some locations.  Consumers are likely to 
pay lower prices due to generally increased yields, while most producers are likely to suffer reduced profits due to 
declining prices.  Increased use of pesticides and herbicides is very likely to be required and to present new challenges.  
 
Demand for water by the agricultural sector will likely increase.  
Water is used for agricultural irrigation on a small percentage of harvested cropland in the Great Lakes region. 
Irrigation water is applied as a supplemental production input to natural rainfall, especially during short periods of 
drought.  Irrigation is applied because the rainfall is not adequate or reliable during the critical growth stage, the soil 
may offer a low soil moisture holding capacity that may increase the need to irrigate during critical stages, or the crops 
are water insensitive and are subject to soil moisture stress.  
 
The estimation of the quantities of water required for irrigation, however, must be an integral component of any 
framework to determine the total water withdrawal or the consumptive use with the Great Lakes region, especially 
within basins that may experience water shortages due to climate changes and have more intensive agricultural 
development.  There is the potential for changes in irrigation demand in certain localized, but limited areas, that already 
have a higher percentage of farms utilizing irrigation due to the increase in temperature.  A small percentage decrease 
in the amount of water used in agriculture could greatly reduce the possibilities for water conflicts and enhance the 
possibilities for economic growth within the region.  The comparative stability of surface water use for irrigated 
agriculture in the face of increasing water scarcity reflects the insulation of water costs to surface irrigators from market 
considerations and energy costs.  
 
Agriculture use generally exhibits a relatively low marginal value for water use.  The incentives for farmers to utilize 
water more efficiently without incurring financial losses and their ability to substitute other production inputs (labour, 
energy, fertilizer, and pesticides) are the keys to the future viability of irrigated agriculture, especially in basins or sub-
basins that exhibit water scarcity.  The efficient and productive use of factors of production on the farm, the policies 
that affect the technology or preferences underlying the demand for supplemental water, the associated costs, and the 
resulting profit in relation to climate change variables are major issues to be investigated in the Great Lakes.  
 
The impact of climate change on agriculture may be enhanced by current stresses.  
The major stresses on agriculture in the upper Great Lakes region can generally be categorized as economic, social, 
environmental, and regulatory.  The amount of water and the frequency of its availability are the primary climatological 
constraints for the production of most annual  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
66 
Consequences of Regional Climate Change    
 
crops.  Growing season precipitation provides the bulk of the moisture used by crops during the season, with the 
remainder provided by soil moisture storage accumulated during the off-season.   
 
Several factors will affect water management and water withdrawal for agricultural use in the future: the availability of 
ground water and surface water; supplemental irrigation requirements; the real cost of energy for pumping; uncertainty 
regarding water application and crop yield; technical developments for management of irrigation delivery systems; and 
adverse environmental impacts from irrigation.  The issue of adverse environmental impacts, in the form of non-point 
source pollution, may become more widespread with more intensive irrigated crop production on light soils and the 
predicted changes in water levels in the Great Lakes.  
 
Given significant land use changes occurring across the region, farmers are facing increasing pressure from urban 
encroachment and the loss of prime or productive agricultural land to urbanization.  The future rate of change of this 
loss is dependent on growth of population, especially around urban areas, and the vitality of regional economies.  
 
Environmental factors like climate and its inherent variability, long-term degradation of soil resources, geographical 
concentration of livestock production and the associated management of large amounts of livestock waste, and the 
contamination of surface waters and ground water by agricultural chemicals may also create direct stress on regional 
agriculture.  
 
Finally, one category of stresses that integrates many of the above factors is governmental regulation, which may 
drastically change standards or alter the economics of the production system. One current example in the United States 
is the gradual implementation of the Food Quality Protection Act, which may ultimately result in the loss of many 
pesticides used commercially in agriculture (especially in fruit and vegetable production) and for which few, if  
any, substitutes now exist.  
 
The potential impacts of climate change on agriculture in the Great Lakes region will depend greatly on the magnitude, 
timing, and the variability associated with the change. Variability is generally considered to be the most difficult aspect 
with which to cope and adapt. Most of the recent research on climate change in the Great Lakes region has suggested a 
warmer and wetter climate in the future, with relatively more warming occurring in the winter and spring than in other 
seasons. Agriculturally, this would most likely lead to a longer growing season and greater potential productivity, but 
also to greater potential rates of evapotranspiration (Figure 3-12). An additional critical factor in determining potential 
productivity is CO2 enrichment, which has been associated with increases in total plant dry matter accumulation and 
improved crop water use efficiency through decreases in transpiration rates. While some research studies have shown  
that yield-increases from higher atmospheric CO  levels may actually decrease when other resources are limiting and 
that the enrichment effect may decrease over time for some plant species, most scientific literature suggests that there 
will be significant long-term benefits to agriculture as atmospheric CO  levels increase in the future.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
67 
Consequences of Regional Climate Change    
 
Figure 3-12.  Impacts of climate change on growing seasons, Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin (Great  
Lakes Regional Assessment Group, 2000). 
 
There may be potential changes in the productivity of arable land for specific crops in sub-regions, especially where 
specialty crops will be sensitive to increases in CO2 enrichment, temperature, or rainfall during critical growth periods. 
 Potential productivity may also be affected by changes in the rate of vegetative development in a season prior to the 
last spring frost and in the frequency of sub-freezing temperatures after critical growth stages for specialty crops such 
as cherries.  
 
Other economic changes may occur in the commodity prices for field crops driven by worldwide changes in production 
and demand.  This may affect the profitability of farm operations.  There is likely to be an increasing dependence upon 
agriculture’s use of rail and truck for moving agricultural commodities to market due to decreased capacity of shipping 
on the Great Lakes.  Finally, the impact of regulations may dictate changes in farming practices, including the types 
and amounts of fuel and fertilizers used to produce crops that can affect the cost structure of farm operations.  
 
Adaptation strategies will likely be necessary.  
Adaptations such as changing planting dates and choosing longer season varieties are likely to offset losses or further 
increase yields.  Breeding for response to CO2 will likely be necessary to achieve the strong fertilization effect 
assumed in the crop studies.  This is an unexploited opportunity and the prospects for selecting CO2 response are good. 
 However, attempts to breed for a single characteristic are often not successful, unless other traits and interactions are  
considered.  Breeding for tolerance to climatic stress has already been heavily exploited and  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
68 
Consequences of Regional Climate Change    
 
varieties that do best under ideal conditions usually also outperform other varieties under stress conditions.  Breeding 
specific varieties for specific conditions of climate stress is therefore less likely to encounter stress.  
 
Some adaptations to climate change and its impacts can have negative secondary effects.  For example, an increase in 
the use of pesticides and herbicides is one adaptation to increased insects, weeds, and diseases associated with 
warming.  Runoff of these chemicals into prairie wetlands, groundwater, and rivers and lakes could threaten drinking 
water supplies, coastal waters, recreation areas, and waterfowl habitat.  
 
Some of the possible ways in which agriculture in the Great Lakes region can adapt to climate change include:  
  
Change sowing dates.   
  
Introduce new crop varieties.  
  
Increase use of water supplies, irrigation, and drainage systems.  
  
Change tillage practices.  
  
Use near-term climate predictions to reduce losses due to weather variability.  
  
Make other management adjustments in virtually all components of the farming system from  
planting to harvesting to selling to adjust to climate change.  
 
3.3.9 Forests   
Forests cover a significant portion of the Great Lakes region, providing wildlife habitat, clean air and water, cultural 
and aesthetic values, carbon storage, recreational opportunities such as hiking, camping, fishing, and autumn leaf tours, 
and products that can be harvested such as timber, pulpwood, fuelwood, wild game, ferns, mushrooms, and berries. 
 This wealth depends on forest biodiversity (the variety of plant and animal species) and forest functioning (water  
flows, nutrient cycling, and productivity).  These aspects of forests are strongly influenced by climate.  Native forests 
are adapted to their local climates.  
 
The forest resources of the Great Lakes region are already under stress, even without the potential for increases in 
temperatures caused by climate change.  Dutch elm disease contributed to an almost complete dieoff of this species 
throughout the region in the 1970s.  Forests, particularly in the urban areas, used this as a lesson to promote diversity 
among the species that are planted in cities.  
 
Currently, gypsy moth-related defoliation exists and is clearly worsening in all parts of the region.  State authorities are 
aggressively seeking to combat this infestation with ground and satellite-based surveys, biological controls, and 
trapping methods.  With these efforts, the spread of this infestation would be even greater.  Oak wilt is another disease 
that exists in many parts of the region, although it mostly affects the northern portion.  Other forest-related diseases and  
pests that are found in the region in non-epidemic numbers include spruce budworm, cankerworms, forest tent 
caterpillar, white pine blister rust, white pine weevil, basswood thrips, butternut canker, and Asian long-horned beetle.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
69 
Consequences of Regional Climate Change    
 
Extreme weather certainly plays a role in regional forest destruction.  Severe storms with lightning, high winds, hail, or 
tornadoes can quickly destroy whole stands of trees.  Recently thinned or logged areas and older forests, from which 
fire has been excluded, are particularly susceptible to destruction in these circumstances.  Exceptionally cold or hot 
(and dry) weather can also retard growth or kill trees depending on the duration and location of such weather.  Also, the 
potential for increased risk of fires could pose human health hazards such as direct loss of life and injury, and health 
effects resulting from changes in air quality.  
 
Land use is also a serious stress.  Increasing development, coupled with declining rates of agricultural abandonment, is 
likely to lead to declines in forest area in the long term.  Furthermore, large-scale management of forests on private 
lands is becoming increasingly difficult as ownership is becoming increasingly fragmented into more and smaller 
parcels.   
 
Shifts in potential tree species range limits in the Great Lakes region.  
Current climate patterns correlate with geographic ranges of plants, leading to the expectation that future climate 
change will cause shifts in the distribution of vegetation (Peters and Lovejoy, 1992; Prentic et al., 1992).  Rapid global 
warming might cause species to die off along their southern range margin long before replacement species can 
immigrate from the south, leaving behind a reduced array of species (Solomon and Kirilenko, 1997).  
 
Will tree species that are now important in Great Lakes forests continue to grow here?  Which trees will die out and 
which will remain, and what forest species that are presently absent disperse into the region?  To arrive at a realistic 
prediction of future forest composition in the Great Lakes region, the impact of climate change must be considered 
separately for each species.  Each has a different current geographic range and an individualistic response to  
climate.  
 
Researchers have used various types of models to predict the future ranges of different forest species.  For example, 
equilibrium models predict species ranges using bioclimatic variables that physiologically limit species to particular 
geographic regions.  Species-specific parameters (minimum and/or maximum tolerance values for each bioclimatic 
variable) define the climate-space suitable for the species.  Using tolerance values for each species and a set of climate  
values predicted by global climate models, it is possible to map the potential geographic range for each species under 
future equilibrium conditions.  
 
Modelling efforts that have addressed the impacts of climate change on forests in the Great Lakes region have 
consistently projected a northward shift in species ranges.  Most of these efforts have shown that species at the southern 
boundaries of their ranges, like boreal species within the region or northern hardwood species in the southern part of 
the region, will experience increased mortality and will be eventually replaced by species from communities to the 
south.  Although there is no general agreement on the time that it will take for this replacement to occur, the models are 
in general agreement about the northward shift in ranges.  Mortality, disturbance, migration rates, pests, disease, land 
use, and management will play a critical role in forest health and composition in the coming decades.  To date, only a 
few of the more advanced dynamic or transient analyses of climate change and tree species (migration) have been 
conducted.  Many more steady-state analyses, although easier to design and run, simulate current and future climates 
separated by a sudden and unrealistic jump in CO2.

Consequences of Regional Climate Change    
 
The timing of replacement is critical because dieback of northern species could occur from heat or drought stress, 
increased winter damage due to diminished dormancy, or increased pest activity, before the southern species are 
available for replacement. This possibility raises questions about just how susceptible the forests are to increased 
mortality, how disturbance regimes will be affected by climate change, and how quickly the southern species can 
migrate.  Other questions relate to the possibility that established trees may persist longer than shown in early studies. 
 Confounded with these questions is the possibility that CO2 enrichment, by improving water use efficiency by trees 
and increasing productivity, could speed the succession process.  
 
Several tree species will retreat from their southern and southwestern range limits in the Great Lakes region during the 
21st century.  This may mean that in the area close to their southern range limits, these trees will experience reduced 
growth rates, reproductive failure, and increased disease and mortality.  Increased fuel loading will increase the 
likelihood of fire in the forests where the trees are moribund.  Unfortunately, some of the most economically valuable  
trees in the Great Lakes region are included in this category.  White pine, aspen, jack pine, red pine, and yellow birch 
are all predicted to show signs of stress along their southern range limits in the early decades of the 21st century.  
 
The dieback and retreat of these species depends on the steep rise in summer temperature predicted by the climate 
models.  However, the projected summer temperature increases differ among models.  In cases where the temperature 
increases are less severe, dieback from southern range limits would be delayed, and the magnitude of species loss 
would not be as severe, but the direction of change would be similar.  In all cases, further dieback could occur if 
climate continues to change after the end of the 21st century.  
 
The four categories of tree responses are summarized here.  The first category is composed of trees that are presently 
confined to the southern part of the Great Lakes region, and are predicted to expand northward (e.g. cherry and black 
walnut).  The potential range of black walnut will also expand toward the eastern part of the region along the southern 
shores of Lakes Erie and Ontario.  
 
The second category includes trees whose range limits within the Great Lakes region are not greatly affected, but which 
may show signs of stress in some areas (e.g. red oak and sugar maples).  It is predicted that red oak will persist within 
its present range, expanding a few tens of kilometres westward into the present-day prairie.  Toward the end of the 21st 
century, warm conditions in summer will begin to stress this species in the southern part of the region.  Soil moisture 
deficits near the limit for this species will stress populations in the lower peninsula of Michigan throughout the century.  
 
The third category is composed of species that are predicted to retreat gradually from the southern part of their ranges 
in the Great Lakes region due to the predicted rise in summer temperatures.  Some of the most important timber trees 
are included in this category: quaking aspen, yellow birch, jack pine, red pine, and white pine (Figures 3-13 and 3-14).  
The fourth category includes only beech.  Study results widely differ, however.  Some show beech retreating from its 
western limit and moving northward.  Others suggest that this tree may  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
71 
Consequences of Regional Climate Change    
 
expand westward.  And still others predict complete elimination of beech from the Great Lakes region.  All of the 
studies have had difficulty specifying the climate parameters that correspond to the present range of beech.  This may 
explain why results differ so widely, and adds considerable uncertainty to future predictions.

Assessment Group, 2000).  
 
 
Figure 3-14. Retreat of aspen, birch, and pine trees:  2025-2034  (Great Lakes Regional  
Assessment Group, 2000).  
 
 
By the end of this century, forests of the Great Lakes region may have changed greatly as a result of climate warming. 
 Studies that use different methods differ in the extent of predicted changes, but the direction of changes are similar. 
 Many of the forest dominants, including some of the most commercially valuable trees (aspen and white pine) may no 
longer be able to grow in much of the region.  Hardwood trees that are predicted to remain in the region, such as sugar  
maple and red oak, may come to dominate additional forest stands once their competitors retreat.  Because dispersal of 
southern species such as black walnut and black cherry is unlikely to occur as rapidly as dieback of northern species, 
forests may be much less diverse than at

present.  Haphazard dispersal by humans may bring some southern trees to limited areas of the north, but widespread 
distribution and establishment of these species will likely take longer than a century.  New, unknown dynamics in these 
changing, low-diversity forests will present a challenge to forest managers.  
 
Human activities modify forests.  Native forests have been converted to agricultural and urban uses. In some cases, 
forests have re-grown on abandoned agricultural lands.  Expansion of urban areas has fragmented forests into smaller, 
less contiguous patches.  Fire suppression has changed the species found in Great Lakes forests.  Harvesting methods, 
where all trees or a few trees are cut, have also changed species composition.  Trees have been planted for aesthetics 
and landscaping purposes in urban and rural areas that are often far outside of the species’ natural range.  Intensive 
management along with favourable climates in parts of the U.S. and Canada have resulted in highly productive forests. 
 Human activities will continue to modify forests while forests are also experiencing the effects of climate change.  
 
3.3.10 Recreation and Tourism  
 
Key impacts of climate change include:  
  
Season length for recreation activities changes – lengthens for warm-   
 weather activities and shortens for cold weather activities.   
  
The resource base for recreation activities may be altered.  
 
Season length for recreation activities changes – lengthens for warm-weather activities and  
shortens for cold weather activities.   
Cold weather activities, such as ice fishing, skiing, and snowmobiling, are sensitive to warmer air temperatures in 
winter that affect the duration and depth of snow on the ground and ice in waterways.  The length of the reliable season 
decreases (Scott et al., 2002).  However, warm-weather activities such as camping, trail use, swimming, fishing, 
boating, and golfing may have an extended season with the amenable conditions including more of the shoulder 
seasons of spring and fall.  However, an increase in the frequency of extremely high air temperatures in summer may 
reduce some recreation opportunities because it is too warm.  While there may be economic benefits from an extended 
season, the increase in number of users as well as a longer period of use may lead to environmental deterioration. Parks 
and natural areas will need to assess vulnerability.  Management practices such as limiting access or the number of 
visitors may have to be instituted (Cohen et al., 2001).  
 
The resource base for recreation activities may be altered.  
Climate change may alter the availability and quality of the resource base upon which recreational activities depend 
(Cohen et al., 2001).  Projected water level reductions in the Great Lakes could significantly limit the access, 
navigability, and safety of marinas and recreational boating waters.  Recreational boating is a very important economic 
activity in the region; there are over 4.2 million recreational boats in the Great Lakes states while Ontario has over 1.2  
million recreational boats registered (Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, 2002). Nearshore areas with shallow 
sloping shorelines, narrow bays, shifting sand bars, or variable

Consequences of Regional Climate Change    
 
bathymetry would be most vulnerable.  Recent low water levels in 2000 and 2001 illustrate the sensitivity.   Beach 
width, however, may expand with lower water levels but aesthetics may suffer in the short term.  Water-contact 
activities, particularly swimming, could be affected by water quality changes.  Combined sewer overflows and 
contaminant entrainment may increase with more intense precipitation events; more beaches may be closed due to 
bacterial contamination.  Warmer water temperatures may also increase potential for summer algae blooms and 
bacterial pollution.  Changes in the range and habitat of fish, waterfowl and other birds, and mammals alter 
opportunities for angling (particularly cold-water fishery), hunting, and birdwatching.  For example, 20 to 40 % of 
warblers are currently found further north than 25 years ago.  In 2001, more than 1.9 million Minnesotans spent $532 
(U.S.) million watching wildlife  (Great Lakes Regional Climate Change Assessment, 2002).  An important 
recreational feature of the autumn is the display of fall foliage.  Warmer temperatures in autumn are associated with 
muting of fall foliage colours.  Drought also decreases leaf colour in addition to changing the timing of leaf drop 
(Barron, 2001).

Specific Implications for Beneficial Uses

SPECIFIC IMPLICATIONS FOR BENEFICIAL USES  
IDENTIFIED IN THE GREAT LAKES WATER QUALITY  
AGREEMENT 
  
Environmentally sensitive areas became an issue for policy makers in the Canadian and United States governments in 
the early 1970s (IJC, 2002).  As outlined by the International Joint Commission (IJC) (2002), water pollution problems 
led to the development of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement.  This document was an accord between Canada 
and the United States to study and restore the health of the Great Lakes freshwater resource shared by both countries.   
Over time, this agreement has been modified.  In 1978, there was a call to end the discharge of toxic substances (such 
as PCBs) into the lakes.  In 1987, another revision was added for the cleanup and restoration of areas impacted by one 
or more of the 14 beneficial uses impairments identified in the Great Lakes.  An impaired beneficial use occurs when 
there is a change in the chemical, physical, or biological integrity of the Great Lakes system, causing use impairments  
or other related issues, such as the microbial objective for waters used for body contact recreational activities (IJC, 
1991).  
 
Environmental restoration of environmentally sensitive areas is long-term activity that could be impeded by a changing 
climate and an altered hydrological regime (Rhodes et al., 1993). For the white paper, 12 of the 14 beneficial uses were 
identified as having a potential vulnerability to climate change. They are listed in Table 4-1 in italics.

An area where one or more beneficial uses are impaired has been termed an Area of Concern (AOC).  Annex 2 of the 
1987 Protocol to the Agreement defines an AOC as "É a geographic area that fails to meet the General or Specific 
Objectives of the Agreement where such failure has caused or is likely to cause impairment of beneficial use or of the 
area’s ability to support aquatic life”.  For each AOC, a Remedial Action Plan (RAP) is to be developed and  
implemented to restore and protect the beneficial uses.  For open lake waters, Lakewide Management Plans (LaMPs) 
were developed to distinguish pollutants that could affect humans or aquatic life and to restore beneficial uses that were 
impaired.  There are currently 41 AOCs (there were 43) (Figure 4-1).  Collingwood Harbour (IJC, 1991) and Severn 
Sound (Kirschner, 2003) have been delisted.

There are 26 AOCs identified in U.S. waters, 10 in Canadian waters and five are bi-national efforts on connecting river 
systems (GLIN, 2003).  The impairments to beneficial uses by AOC are listed in Table 4-2.  For each AOC, a 
beneficial use is either impaired, unimpaired, under assessment, or restored.  A use is deemed impaired if it meets the 
listing guidelines approved by the IJC and unimpaired if it does not.  A use is under assessment when environmental 
conditions are unknown or under review and restored when the delisting guidelines have been achieved. Each of the 12 
beneficial uses potentially vulnerable to climate change are reviewed in the following section.  The listing guideline for 
each use is described, and then the potential impacts from climate change are identified using published literature (if 
available).

Specific Implications for Beneficial Uses 
 
4.1 IMPAIRED BENEFICIAL USES IN THE GREAT LAKES BASIN   
 
A changing climate may put added stress on beneficial uses that are already impaired, possibly create new stresses 
within ecologically healthy areas, and influence remediation plans. Projected changes in climate outlined in Section 3.2 
are used as a guide to discuss potential implications for beneficial uses.  Many papers were reviewed for this section 
and are summarized in the tables below.  Preference was given to research findings directly related to the impacts of 
climate change on the beneficial uses in the Great Lakes basin.  They are presented in the following research findings 
tables in italics.  Research findings drawn from areas outside of the Great Lakes basin are used to illustrate a further 
range of climate change impacts where relevant; they are presented in the research findings tables in normal font.   
 
4.1.1 Loss of Fish and Wildlife Habitat  
 
Listing Guideline: When fish and wildlife management goals have not been met as a  
result of loss of fish and wildlife habitat due to a perturbation in the physical, chemical,  
or biological integrity of the Boundary Waters, including wetlands (IJC, 1991).  
 
Increases in temperature, changes in precipitation, and water levels can have an impact on vegetation biodiversity 
(Thompson et al., 1998).  For example, shoreline wetlands surrounding the Great Lakes are negatively impacted by 
lower water levels, resulting in loss of diversity and areal extent (Mortsch, 1998) which could impact important 
spawning and nursery sites for fish (Edsall et al., 1997).  Changes in the population and species of herbivores (e.g. 
through climate change) can also impact and accelerate changes in vegetation (Hobbs, 1996).  Climate changes,  
warmer air temperatures,and increased drought severity such as increased atmospheric CO2, and frequency can alter 
the physiology of plants and influence physiological processes such as photosynthesis, phenology, and respiration 
(Table 4-3).

• Valuable timber trees, including white, red, and jack pine, with southern

in summer air temperatures. One scenario showed the complete disappearance  
of these species by the end of the century; another scenario showed movement  
of 100-200 km from the southern limits (Walker et al., 2002: 566).

Specific Implications for Beneficial Uses  
 
4.1.2 Degradation of Phytoplankton and Zooplankton Populations  
 
Listing Guideline: When phytoplankton or zooplankton community structure significantly  
diverges from unimpacted control sites of comparable physical and chemical  
characteristics.  In addition, this use will be considered impaired when relevant, field- 
validated, phytoplankton or zooplankton bioassays (e.g. Ceriodaphnia, algal fractionation  
bioassays) with appropriate quality assurance/quality controls confirm toxicity in ambient  
waters (IJC, 1991).  
 
Phytoplankton are tiny plants and zooplankton are tiny animals that reside in the waters of the Great Lakes.  Both play 
important roles in the food chain, as they are essential sources of food for fish, benthos, and larger zooplankton.  They 
can be good indicators of the health of an aquatic environment.  Changes in climate may stress plankton, inhibiting 
their ability to function normally.

Air temperature  
 
• Cooler conditions in northeast United States are correlated with a higher  
increase.   
 
species diversity (Stemberger et al. 1996, Chen et al., 2002: 586).  
• Off the coast of California, an increase in surface water temperature has  
been coupled with a decrease in zooplankton  (Roemmich et al., 1995).  
• Studies in the Mediterranean have shown a drastic reduction in  
phytoplankton between 1979 and 1998, in relation to an increase in surface  
water temperature (Goffart et al., 2002).   
• In the Experimental Lakes Area of northwest Ontario, phytoplankton  
biomass and the number of species was observed to increase during periods  
of drought, even though there was a decrease in nutrient input (Findlay et al.,  
2001).  
• Annual phytoplankton and zooplankton production may increase, but there  
would be many complex reactions in the community due to altered  
temperatures, thermocline depths, light penetration, and nutrient inputs  
(Magnuson, 1998: 103).  
• Warmer temperatures may lead to smaller sizes for zooplankton (Chen et al.,  
2002).  
• Fall warming may activate zooplankton sexual and asexual reproduction and  
the resting stages (Chen et al. 1996).  
 
Changes in runoff.   
• Warmer temperatures and drier hydrological conditions have been shown to  
reduce the dissolved organic carbon concentration in the lakes, exposing the  
biota to increased UV-B radiation (Schindler et al., 1996).  
 
Changes in timing   
• A climate-induced decrease in the duration of the river-ice season, or an  
and duration of ice   
increase in the size and frequency of open water sections where re-aeration  
break up.  
 
can occur, should decrease the potential for biologically damaging oxygen  
depletion (Prowse et al., 2002: 818).

Specific Implications for Beneficial Uses  
 
4.1.3 
Added Costs to Agriculture or Industry  
 
Listing Guideline: When there are additional costs required to treat the water prior to use  
for agricultural purposes É or industrial purposes (IJC, 1991).  
 
There is no published literature found concerning the impact of climate change on the costs of water treatment for 
agricultural and industrial use.  
 
4.1.4 
Degradation of Aesthetics  
 
Listing Guideline: When any substance in water produces a persistent objectionable  
deposit, unnatural color or turbidity, or unnatural odor (e.g. oil slick, surface scum). (IJC, 1991).  
 
There were no publications found pertaining directly to the impacts of climate change on degradation of aesthetics, but 
one was found pertaining to low water levels.

Listing Guideline: When waters, which are commonly used for total-body contact or  
partial-body contact recreation, exceed standards, objectives, or guidelines for such use  
(IJC, 1991).  
 
There was no literature discovered that dealt directly with the impacts of climate change on beach closings.  There was 
minimal information found concerning the impacts of two key climatic changes, increased intensity of precipitation and 
lower water levels, and their impacts on beach closures.

4.1.6 Restrictions on Drinking Water Consumption or Taste and Odour Problems  
 
Listing Guideline: When treated drinking water supplies are impacted to the extent that:  
(1) densities of disease-causing organisms or concentrations of hazardous toxic chemicals  
or radioactive substances exceed human health standards, objectives or guidelines; (2) taste  
and odor problems are present; or (3) treatment needed to make raw water suitable for  
drinking is beyond the standard treatment used in comparable portions of the Great Lakes  
which are not degraded (i.e. settling, coagulation, disinfection). (IJC, 1991).  
 
 
Seasonal taste and odour problems in drinking water are experienced by communities drawing water from the Great 
Lakes (Anderson et al., 1998).  These unpleasant odours can raise questions concerning the quality of drinking water, 
though in many cases substances can be detected by taste and odour at concentrations far below levels that could affect 
the health of people (Young et al., 1996).  In the Great Lakes, the majority of taste and odour problems occur during the 
late summer and early fall when algae are at their optimal growing conditions (Anderson et al., 1998).

4.1.7 Eutrophication or Undesirable Algae  
 
Listing Guideline: When there are persistent water quality problems (e.g. dissolved  
oxygen depletion of bottom waters, nuisance algal blooms or accumulation, decreased  
water clarity, etc.) attributed to cultural eutrophication (IJC, 1991).  
 
Warmer waters may lead to growth of undesirable species of algae.  This problem could be exaggerated in areas where 
predatory fish have been eliminated due to a loss of suitable habitat.   
 
Table 4-9. Eutrophication or undesirable algae research findings.  
Climate   
 
Research Findings  
Sensitivities  
 
Air temperature  
 
• Water quality could decline with warmer temperatures.  Warmer water  
increase; water  
 
enhances productivity, but could lead to an increase in the growth of  
temperature  
 
undesirable species (e.g. algae blooms) (Poff et al., 2000).  
increase   
 
• Increased water clarity due to an increase in zebra mussels accelerates  
algae growth.  This has led to the suggestion that the average summer  
temperature has increased over the past 10 years, allowing for improved  
growing conditions (Anderson et al., 1998: 861).  
scenarios show an early temperature increase of Lake Erie could  
• 2xCO2 lead to an increase in nutrient uptake by algae in the early spring and  
lengthened algae production (Atkinson et al., 1999).  
• Warmer lake temperatures could lead to anoxia or hypoxia by increasing  
the metabolic rate of sediment bacteria and biological productivity and  
respiration in the water column, and by decreasing dissolved oxygen  
saturation values (Blumberg et al., 1990: 210).  
• A decrease in dissolved oxygen due to warmer water temperatures would  
increase the rate of bacterial activity in hypolimnon water and sediment  
(Blumberg et al., 1990: 210).  
• Insufficient oxygen in the deep, cooler water during the late summer, to  
support large game fish could lead to an increase in smaller fish and a  
decrease in the zooplankton population, allowing algae to grow (Kitchell,  
1993).   
• A climate-induced decrease in the duration of river ice or an increase in the  
size and frequency of open water sections where re-aeration can occur could  
decrease the potential for biologically damaging oxygen depletion (Prowse,

Restrictions on Dredging Activities  
 
Listing Guideline:  When contaminants in sediments exceed standards, criteria, or  
guidelines such that there are restrictions on dredging or disposal activities (IJC, 1991).  
 
According to the IJC’s Sediment Priority Action Committee (1999), there are a number of AOCs with impairment of 
beneficial uses as a result of contaminated sediment.  These impairments are listed in Table 4-10.

There was no literature found directly focusing on the impacts of climate change on dredging activities and the possible 
impacts on the ecosystem.  There were a few studies found pertaining to contaminated sediment and changes in water 
levels, suspended sediment and disposal sites.

Lower water levels  
 
• Dredging can lead to the resuspension of containments in the water column,  
causing ecosystem health problems (Colborn et al., 1990).  
• Leaving toxic contaminants undisturbed on the on the lake bed could be a  
viable alternative remediation option for some of the contaminated areas to  
avoid resuspension (Rhodes et al., 1993: 293).  
• Shallow contaminated sediment are most vulnerable to changes in water  
levels, and are also the most difficult for remediation.  The AOCs not  
consistently dredged for navigational purposes may take the longest to be  
cleaned up (Rhodes et al., 1993: 302).  
• There have been problems finding disposal sites for contaminated sediment.   
The added cost of dredging and disposal increases the costs for all levels of  
government (Colborn et al., 1990).

Specific Implications for Beneficial Uses  
 
4.1.9  Degradation of Benthos  
 
Listing Guideline: When the benthic macroinvertebrate community structure significantly  
diverges from unimpacted control sites of comparable physical and chemical  
characteristics.  In addition, this use will be considered impaired when toxicity (as defined  
by relevant, field-validated, bioassays with appropriate quality assurance/quality controls)  
of sediment associated contaminants at a site is significantly higher than controls (IJC,  
1991).  
 
Benthos are animals that live in or on the lake bottom.  A variety of benthic species can indicate a healthy lake 
ecosystem.  No literature focusing specifically with the impacts of climate change on benthos in the Great Lakes was 
found (Table 4-12).

Research Findings  
Sensitivities  
 
Water quality  
 
• Shallow water fauna can be more sensitive to changes in overall water  
changes   
 
quality in a large lake than those in deep water (Kilgour et al., 2000).  
 
Air temperatures   
• Climate change effects on benthos sources can occur as a result of the  
increase    
 
effects on water column mixing and resuspension of bottom sediment  
(Atkinson et al., 1999: 7-18).  
 
 
4.1.10. Degradation of Fish and Wildlife Populations  
 
Listing Guideline: When fish and wildlife management programs have identified degraded  
fish or wildlife populations due to a cause within the watershed.  In addition, this use will  
be considered impaired when relevant, field-validated, fish or wildlife bioassays with  
appropriate quality assurance/quality controls confirm significant toxicity from water  
column or sediment contaminants (IJC, 1991).  
 
Climate change effects on fish and wildlife populations are not expected to be gradual and transitional (Cherry, 1998). 
 The reaction of these populations to climatic change can significantly depend on species and genetic diversity (Peters, 
1990; Cherry, 1998; Hogg et al., 1998).  Cherry (1998) found species that are, at present, widespread will experience 
extreme shifts in range boundaries and undergo certain losses of genetic variation and some population extirpation. 
Some smaller and more localized species may undergo severe reductions in size or even extinction.  Those with greater 
levels of genetic variability may be able to inhabit a wider range of environmental conditions and would be better able 
to adapt to environmental change relative to species with lower genetic variability (Hogg et al., 1998).  Climate 
responses are dependent on the both the timing and magnitude of warming, and the vulnerability of a species  
in response to seasonal changes (Chen et al., 1996).

Research Findings  
Sensitivities  
 
Lower water levels  
• Cold water fish species (e.g. trout and salmon) are expected to disappear  
and increased  
 
from fresh water lakes in the United States, as water temperatures increase,  
temperatures can   
exceeding their tolerance limits.  Other species that can tolerate warmer  
impact the physical  
temperatures (e.g. large mouth bass and carp) may expand (Poff et al., 2002).  
health of a species.   
• Most species may experience a time lag before extensive colonization is  
possible into the new habitat and in the short term may show a range  
diminishment (Peters, 1990).  
• Increases in water temperature by 2 and 4 °C decreased growth and  
reproductive success in female rainbow trout in California (Van Winkle et al.,  
1997).  
• Higher lake levels maintain larger wildlife diversity, while lower levels lead  
to poorer conditions (Mortsch, 1998).  
• Positive results from changes (increased temperature and precipitation  
include Ňfaster growth and maturation rates, less winter mortality due to cold  
or anoxia, and expanded habitats with ice retreat”.  This should offset  
negative factors such as increased summer anoxia, demands for food (due to  
higher metabolism), negative changes in lake thermal structure, and  
decreased thermal habitat for cold-water species (Regier et al., 1996: 11).  
• There could be an overall increase in fish production due to an increase in  
growth rates and food supply.  There would be a change in some species as a  
result of thermal tolerances.  There would be a shift away from traditional  
cold-water fisheries to warm-water fisheries as a result of a shrinking habitat  
for cold-water species (Atkinson et al., 1999: 7-16).  
• Warmer water temperatures could lead to an increase in the growth  
potential of lake trout, striped bass, and Chinook salmon in Lake Michigan  
(Brandt et al., 2002).  
• Water temperature increases in epilimnetic habitats would alter yearling  
growth and prey consumption.  The degree of alteration would depend on how  
close the species were to their optimal temperature and their ability to  
thermoregulate (Hill et al., 1990: 271-272).   
• Historically important fish species in Lake Erie may be lost due to water  
level change as it limits the availability of spawning and nursery habitat  
(Koonce et al., 1996).  
• An increase in mean global temperature could lead to an increase in the  
year class strength of small mouth bass, a warmwater species, in Lake  
Ontario (Casselman et al., 2002).  
• Global warming will significantly decrease the recruitment of cold and cool- 
water fish species and increase the recruitment of warm-water fish species in  
the Great Lakes (Casselman, 2002). 
 
Warmer water  
 
• The zoogeographical boundary for fish in the northern U.S. could move

species.   
 
• Invasion of warm water species and a local extirpation of cool water and  
cold water species (Mandrak, 1989).  
• Warming can establish the potential for fish species invasions by expanding  
(or contracting) their geographic range.  It would be very difficult to prevent  
 
 
 
 
94 
Specific Implications for Beneficial Uses  
 
movement of southern species into the Great Lakes (International Association  
for Great Lakes Research, 2002: 14).  
• Climate warming could lead to earlier spawning, decrease incubation  
period, lengthen the growing season, and increase survival rates of sea  
lamprey (Holmes, 1990: 298).  
 
Water chemistry  
 
• Less dissolved oxygen below the thermocline of the lakes would degrade  
stratified lakes for cold-water fish (Magnuson, 1998: 103).  
• Changes in water chemistry, including decreased oxygen in the bottom  
waters due to decay of dead algae and macrophytes, can make the bottom  
waters unusable for species like lake trout (Crowder et al., 1996: 131).  
• Warming will lead to an increase in thermal stress and less productive  
conditions.  Rivers with low oxygen at low flows will severely limit the fish  
population (Regier et al., 1996: 10).  
Air temperature  
 
• Reptile richness increases monotonically with temperature.  Climate  
increase   
 
warming could be positive, resulting in large increases for the northern half of  
the United States (Currie, 2001: 220).  
• Increases in mean summer monthly minimum temperatures could lower elk  
population growth rates or juvenile recruitment in Rocky Mountain National  
Park, Colorado (Wang et al., 2002: 218).  
• A study of painted turtles in Mississippi found that sex determination was  
based on air temperature.  Years with warmer mean July temperatures  
produced more female offspring, cooler temperatures produced more male  
offspring (Janzen, 1994).  
• In Canada, the evolutionary process of mammals may be inhibited or  
reversed if climate change leads to an increased mixing of sub-species, where  
each species possesses distinct characteristics (Kerr et al., 1997: 268).  
• In Canada, populations of plants and animals may experience the effect of  
climate change directly through shifts in their growth rates, and indirectly  
through feedback and interaction with other species and abiotic components  
of the environment (Fleming et al., 1997: 237).  
• Salmon eggs in the freshwater Catamaran Brook of New Brunswick had the  
lowest survival rate during an atypical winter where ice break-up was initiated  
by rain on snow events that resulted in the scouring of the streambed (Cunjak  
et al., 1998: 174).  
• Can result in the loss of sensitive animal species from lakeshores and  
national parks in the western Great Lakes. Because of the location of parks  
on the southern Lake Superior shore, migration to another potential range in  
the north will be problematic for many species (Davis et al., 1999: 981).  
 
Impact on food  
 
• Climate could indirectly affect elk populations in Rocky Mountain National  
sources   
 
Park, Colorado, by altering vegetation in their habitats (Wang et al., 2002:  
218).  
 
 
4.1.11 Restrictions on Fish and Wildlife Consumption  
 
Listing Guideline: When contaminant levels in fish or wildlife populations exceed current  
standards, objectives or guidelines, or public health advisories are in effect for human  
consumption of fish or wildlife.  Contaminant levels in fish and wildlife must be due to  
contaminant input from the watershed (IJC, 1991).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
95 
Specific Implications for Beneficial Uses  
 
The IJC has identified 362 contaminants in the Great Lakes, and a third of these chemicals have been assessed for their 
potential toxic effects on wildlife, aquatic life, and human health (GLIN, 2003).  In 1985, 11 of the most extensive and 
persistent chemicals were identified and termed ŇCritical Great Lakes Pollutants”, and are listed in Table 4-14 (GLIN, 
2003).

PCBs

Human exposure to contaminants is dependent, in part, on the amount of wildlife or fish eaten and the species 
consumed.  There is currently minimal information concerning maximum exposure levels, body burden, and heath 
impacts (GLIN, 2003). There were no studies found regarding climate change impacts on fish and wildlife consumption 
restrictions and bioaccumulation of these chemicals in wildlife.  
 
4.1.12  Tainting of Fish and Wildlife Flavour  
 
Listing Guideline: When ambient water quality standards, objectives, or guidelines for the  
anthropogenic substance(s) known to cause tainting, are being exceeded, or survey results have identified 
tainting of fish or wildlife flavour (IJC, 1991).  
 
There have been no studies found concerning impacts of climate change on the tainting of fish and wildlife flavour. 
 There have, however, been studies that have focused on water pollutants and the tainting of fish flavour.  Shumway 
and Palensky (1973) performed fish bioassays and assessed the impacts of different chemical concentrations and 
exposure times on the taste of fish.  They discovered that many organic compounds are capable of impairing the flavour 
at levels not considered detrimental to the fish.  
 
4.2 SUMMARY  
Potential impacts from climate change, using published literature, have been surveyed.  There were numerous 
publications available relating to the impacts of climate change on loss of fish and wildlife habitat, degradation of fish 
and wildlife populations, and eutrophication or undesirable algae.    Few publications were found for most of the other 
impaired beneficial uses.  For three of the beneficial uses (added costs to agriculture or industry, restrictions on fish and  
wildlife consumption, and tainting of fish and wildlife flavour) no publications were found.

Primer on Adaptation to Climate Change  
 
5.0  PRIMER ON ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE  
 
As our understanding of the potential consequences of climate change in the Great Lakes region has grown, the 
importance placed on developing response options to reduce the risks, or take advantage of the opportunities, posed by 
climate change has also increased.  Adaptation measures intended to increase the resilience of the Great Lakes region to 
change is a necessary complement to mitigation actions.  Even if mitigation measures aimed at reducing greenhouse  
gases and slowing climate change are implemented, the earth’s climate is expected to change, resulting in impacts 
throughout the Great Lakes region.  
 
Many of the physical, biological, and ecological systems in the Great Lakes region are sensitive to weather and climate; 
i.e. many systems are affected to varying degrees by climate-related stimuli (encompassing all the elements of climate 
change, including mean climate characteristics, climate variability, and the frequency and magnitude of extremes). 
 Many of these systems yield Ňbeneficial uses” protected by the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 1978 (as 
amended by the protocol signed November 18, 1987).  Changes in climate will affect these systems.  The effects may 
be direct (e.g. reductions in Great Lakes water levels due to changes in precipitation, temperature, and evaporation) or 
indirect (e.g. changes in water quality in rivers and streams as more intense precipitation leads to runoff of pesticides 
from farmland).   
 
Yet, many of the sensitive systems in the  
Adaptation refers to adjustment in natural or  
Great Lakes region also have the ability to  
human systems in response to actual or  
adjust to climate change.  The extent to  
expected climate stimuli or their effects,  
which a system is vulnerable to a changing  
which moderates harm or exploits beneficial  
climate depends upon its adaptive capacity,  
opportunities (IPCC, 2001).  
i.e. on the ability of the system to adjust to  
climate change (including climate  
variability and extremes) to moderate  
potential damages, to take advantage of opportunities, or to cope with the consequences (IPCC, 2001).  Vulnerability 
plays an essential role in determining whether climate change actually harms human populations, so that understanding 
the dynamics of vulnerability is as important as understanding climate itself (Liverman, 1990; Handmer et al., 1999).   
 
Adaptive actions are those responses or actions taken to enhance the resilience of vulnerable systems, thereby reducing 
damages to human and natural systems from climate change and 1 These actions may be taken in reaction to climate 
change as it occurs or in variability.anticipation of future climate change (Smith, 1997; WHO, 2000).  In natural 
systems, adaptation is reactive, whereas in human systems it also can be anticipatory.  For example, aquatic life must 
react to changes in the mix of surface nutrients and oxygen throughout the depth of the Great Lakes as air and lake 
temperature, sunshine, and winds change.  In contrast, humans have  
 
 
1Several definitions of climate-related adaptation can be found in the literature and they continue to evolve. Many 
definitions focus on human actions (e.g. Burton, 1992; Smith et al., 1996), some include current climate variability and 
extreme events (e.g. Smit, 1993), and others are limited to adverse consequences of climate change (e.g..  Stakhiv, 
1993; Smith et al., 1996). The IPCC (2001) definition is used through this chapter

Adaptation Measures  
 
the opportunity and ability to anticipate the effects of climate change on agriculture and develop new varieties of crops 
that are more adaptable to inter-annual variations of weather (Sousounis and Bisanz, 2000).  
 
While there is uncertainty about future climatic changes and their effects in the Great Lakes region, failure to invest in 
adaptation may leave the region poorly prepared to cope with adverse changes and increases the probability of severe 
consequences (Smith and Lenhart, 1996).  As the climate continues to change, our ability to protect sensitive systems 
may be further challenged. In addition, the possibility of abrupt climatic Ňsurprises” cannot be discounted.  In these 
cases, waiting to react to climate change may be unsatisfactory because the adverse effects of climate change may be 
significant (OTA, 1993).  It is therefore prudent to begin considering investments in adaptive responses to reduce the 
vulnerability of human health, ecosystems, and socio-economic systems to current climate variability and future 
climate change.  
 
5.1 BASIC CONSIDERATIONS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF   
ADAPTATION STRATEGIES  
The extent to which interested stakeholders are willing to expend resources to avoid the effects of climate change will 
depend in part on their perceptions of the risks posed by climate change, the perceived costs of the effort, and how 
much they are willing to risk possible negative consequences (NAS, 1992; OTA, 1993).  If stakeholders decide to 
implement adaptive measures in anticipation of climate change, six important issues must be considered to ensure that 
the adaptive responses are effective (Scheraga and Grambsch, 1998):  
 
• Distributional effects:  Stakeholders should focus on specific locations because the effects of climate change will vary 
across the region.  Also, stakeholders should consider the distributional effects climate change will have on different 
sectors (e.g. commercial fishing, shipping, and transportation) and demographic groups (e.g. the elderly and very young  
children).  
 
• Multiple stresses:  The effects of climate change must be considered in the context of other stressors and factors, 
which may be as important to the design of adaptive responses as the sensitivity to change.  Also, opportunities exist to 
adapt to multiple factors, including climate change.  
 
• Cost:  Adaptation comes at a cost.  
 
• Effectiveness of actions:  Stakeholders should investigate the varying degrees of effectiveness of alternative adaptive 
responses, as demonstrated by current efforts to cope with climate variability.  
 
• Maladaptation:  Maladaptation can result in negative effects that are as serious as the climate-induced effects being 
avoided.  
 
• Multiple benefits:  Many opportunities for adaptation make sense whether or not the effects of climate change are 
realized.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
101 
Adaptation Measures  
 
5.1.1 Distributional Effects   
The design of adaptive responses should vary by locality, sector, and demographic group.    
There is a regional texture to changes in climate and, therefore, to the effects of climate change (Shriner and Street, 
1997; Scheraga, 1998).  The unique location of the entire Great Lakes region – halfway between the equator and North 
Pole within a large continental land mass and co-located with the largest lakes in the world – gives it a unique climate. 
 Warm summers, cold winters, and significant precipitation year-round characterize this climate.  But within the region, 
there are significant variations in local climates.  The Great Lakes are large enough and close enough to each other to 
exert significant impacts on local and regional weather. Areas in the north and west have lower temperatures, a larger 
seasonal temperature range, and less annual and less seasonally distributed precipitation than areas in the south and 
east.  Areas close to the lakes have a smaller annual temperature range than areas farther away (Sousounis and Bisanz,  
2000).   
 
In the same way that there is a regional texture to  
 
Adaptive strategies must be tailored to  
ongoing climate change, there is a regional texture  
 
specific effects in specific locations.  
to the risks and opportunities presented by climate  
change.  The human and ecological systems that  
are sensitive to climate change, and the degree to which they are vulnerable, will vary geographically.  Even within 
specific geographic locations, the effects of climate change will vary across systems, sectors, and demographic groups.  
  
CASE STUDY   
Regional and Distributional Effects of Changes in Heavy Lake-effect Snowstorms  
 
Consider, for example, the effects of an expected decrease in the frequency of heavy lake-effect snowstorms near Lake 
Erie and the other Great Lakes (Kunkel et al., 2000).  Such a change would yield benefits in some locations as the cost 
of snow removal declines and the frequency of transportation disruptions decreases.  But in the southern portions of the 
Great Lakes, the winter recreational industry will be adversely affected.  As illustrated by the experience of the 1997-
1998 El Niño year, the financial losses could be significant.  During the 1997-1998 period, business at midwestern ski 
resorts declined 50 % and losses were estimated at $120 million.  
 
Particular demographic groups may also be differentially affected by climate change.  Consider, for example, that 
climate change will likely increase the frequency and severity of very hot days and heat waves during the summer. 
 Studies in urban areas show an association between increases in mortality and increases in heat (McGeehin and 
Mirabelli, 2001).  The risk of heat stress may rise as a result of climate change (Kalkstein and Greene, 1997).  The most 
vulnerable populations within heat-sensitive regions are urban populations.  Within these vulnerable populations, the 
elderly, young children, the poor, and people who are bedridden or are on certain medications are at particular risk.  
 
To be effective, adaptive responses must target these vulnerable regions and demographic groups, some of which may 
be difficult to reach (Chestnut et al., 1998).  For example, the elderly are less likely to perceive excess heat (Blum et al., 
1998).  They may be socially isolated and physically frail (Semenza et al., 1996; Kilbourne et al., 1982).  This may 
make it difficult to  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
102 
Adaptation Measures  
 
get them to use air conditioning (i.e.  because they do not feel the heat) or to travel to air-conditioned environments 
(e.g. they have no one to take them and may be unable to travel on their own).  The poor may not be able to afford air 
conditioning, and if they live in high crime areas then they may be afraid to visit cooling shelters.  Finally, for young 
children and infants, adults often make decisions about how warmly to dress and time spent in hot environments, and  
the children and infants may be unable to communicate their discomfort (Blum et al., 1998).   
 
The variation of impacts across localities, sectors, and demographic groups must be considered if effective adaptive 
strategies are to be developed.  Appropriate adaptive responses should vary across different geographic regions, sectors, 
and demographic groups since the potential risks, and human capacity to respond to those risks, vary regionally in 
scope and severity. At the same time, it should be recognized that as stakeholders strive to protect beneficial uses and 
increase society’s well being through the implementation of adaptation policies, tradeoffs likely will have to be made. 
 Any one particular effect of climate change may benefit one region or demographic group within a region, while 
harming another region or demographic group. ŇOne 2 person’s opportunity may be another person’s loss.”   It is 
therefore important that any assessment of potential adaptation strategies to protect Ňbeneficial uses” in the Great 
Lakes region articulate the range of potential effects, including both risks and opportunities, and the options for 
reducing the risks and exploiting the opportunities.  
 
5.1.2 Multiple Stresses    
Climate change should be viewed as one of several stressors of concern.   
Many of the beneficial uses in the Great  
Lakes region that are sensitive to climate  
change and climate variability are already  
 
Beneficial uses such as fish and wildlife

sensitive to climate change. But these  
beneficial uses are already under stress for  
To illustrate the importance of assessing the  
 
other reasons – such as population growth,  
potential consequences of climate change  
 
land-use changes, and pollution.  
within a larger context, consider the potential  
effect that climate change may have on  
natural ecosystems in the Great Lakes region.  The rate of climate change, the size of species ranges, and the dispersal 
rates of individual species all are important determinants of the ability of natural ecosystems to adapt to changing 
climatic conditions.  However, existing threats to natural ecosystems and species diversity will also affect ecosystem 
resiliency and capacity to adapt to climate change.  Conversion of land for human activities (e.g. urban settlements,  
farming, harvesting of forests) can interfere directly with seed dispersal and cause changes in the composition of 
forested ecosystems.  Natural and manmade barriers, such as roads, cities, bodies of water, and agricultural land may 
block migration of species.  Manmade pollution and habitat degradation may impair the health of particular species, 
making them less able to withstand stresses from climate change.  Fragmentation of ecosystems and competition from

Adaptation Measures  
 
introduced exotic species may make it impossible for species to migrate to suitable areas in response to climatic shifts. 
 Failure to include these stressors in any evaluation of potential adaptation strategies will result in an incorrect picture 
of future ecosystem distributions.  
 
CASE STUDY  
Multiple Stresses on Great Lakes Rivers  
 
Over the years, Great Lakes rivers have been subjected to numerous stresses.  For example, the logging era resulted in 
cleared land, which led to warmer streams and increased sedimentation, which was further exacerbated by floating the 
logs to river mouths.  Today, Grayling, Michigan, is a popular recreational destination, but its namesake, a salmonid 
fish much sought after by fly-fishers in Alaska and Canada, was extirpated in the 1990s.  Other types of fish habitat 
destruction, invasions of non-native species, and chemical pollution are amongst the most important current stresses. 
 Agriculture and sprawl are common examples of how changing land use and population can influence the delivery  
of sediment, nutrients, and contaminants into surface waters.  Climate change will add yet another stress.  Unless 
strategies focused on adapting to climate change also consider other significant stresses, the adaptive responses may 
prove ineffective and fail.  
 
Humans may also indirectly affect ecosystem migration through other activities, such as through the consumption of 
water that is needed by the ecosystem to survive.  Competition for water in the Great Lakes region is already a real 
concern, and is likely to increase with climate change. Consider that as the climate changes, water supplies will be 
directly affected by precipitation changes and increased evapotranspiration.  The availability of water also will be 
indirectly affected by changes in the competition for water among multiple uses (e.g. urban water demand, recreational 
activities, irrigation in agriculture, hydropower).  In such cases, the water required by natural ecosystems such as 
wetlands and forests to survive may become scarcer.  
 
A complete assessment of the vulnerability of Great Lakes systems to climate change and potential adaptation 
strategies must consider the multiple stressors on the affected systems.  Assessments that do not include these stressors 
will provide incorrect information to those who are developing adaptive responses in anticipation of future change, 
increasing the possibility that less effective adaptation, and in some cases maladaptive strategies, will be chosen.  
 
By placing climate change in the context of multiple stressors, one opens up opportunities to reduce vulnerabilities to 
other environmental stresses as climate change is addressed, and vice versa (IPCC, 2002: 132).  For example, removing 
societal stresses and managing resources in a sustainable manner may help unique and threatened systems also to cope 
with the additional stress posed by climate change.  Addressing or avoiding land degradation also decreases  
vulnerability to climate change, especially when response strategies consider the social and economic factors defining 
the land-use practices together with the additional risks imposed by climate change.  Problems with the availability, 
abundance, and pollution of freshwater, which are often caused by demographic and development pressures, can be 
exacerbated by climate change.  Reducing vulnerability to water stress (e.g. by water conservation, water-demand  
management, and more efficient water use) also reduces vulnerability to additional stress by climate change.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
104 
Adaptation Measures  
 
5.1.3 Cost  
The costs of adaptation must be considered.   
Adaptation is not without cost.  The scarce resources that are used to adapt to a changing climate in the Great Lakes 
region must be diverted from other productive activities.   Resources that are used to adapt to climate change could be 
used to reduce other stresses on human health, ecosystems, and economic systems.  In the vernacular of economics, 
there are opportunity costs to using scarce resources for adaptation.   
 
Society also has the option of incurring the costs of adaptation at different points in time.  It can invest in adaptation 
immediately, or it can delay the investment for a future time (assuming that the effectiveness of the adaptation isn’t 
compromised).  In either case, there is a cost associated with adaptation. It is a question of when the costs are incurred 
and what they buy.  The decision of whether to adapt now or later should be based on a comparison of the present value 
of expected net benefits associated with acting sooner versus later.  
 
The costs of adaptation – whether they are incurred in the present or future – must be carefully weighed by decision 
makers when considering the tradeoffs among alternative adaptation strategies, reducing the cause of the change, and 
living with the residual impacts (Shriner and Street, 1997).  It is therefore important that in assessing the potential 
effectiveness of adaptation, the availability of the resources required to implement alternative strategies be evaluated. 
 The lack of appropriate technology and trained personnel, financial limitations, cultural and social values, and political 
and legal institutions may all restrict a nation’s ability to implement adaptation measures, which will likely vary across 
regions and demographic groups.  Also, one must evaluate the willingness of society to divert required resources away 
from other desired uses.  
 
CASE STUDY  
The Costs of Adapting to Low Lake Levels  
There is a significant chance that Great Lake water levels will decline as the climate changes.  Current reductions in 
Great Lakes levels have had a significant effect on both the commercial shipping economy and recreational boating. 
 Lower lake levels mean ships cannot carry as much.  Low water also makes it more difficult for recreational boaters. 
 The most common approach for managing lowered lake level situations in marinas, harbours, and channel-ways is by 
dredging.  Dredging from channels and imposes both operational and environmental costs.  Much of the material 
dredged harbours is contaminated from industrial waste and spills, and must be buried in existing landfills. In  
government built 26 confined disposal facilities (CDFs) for dredged the 1970s, the U.S. federal sediments of the Great 
Lakes.  The CDFs are viewed as an alternative to the open lake disposal of 26 CDFs are either full or nearly full, and  
these sometimes contaminated materials.  Currently, these by 2006 only two facilities will have room.  
 
 
 
A resource is said to be scarce if it is desired but limited.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
105 
Adaptation Measures  
 
5.1.4 Effectiveness of Adaptations  
The reasons for varying effectiveness of adaptations need to be understood and incorporated  
into strategy designs.    
In assessing the capacity of society to adapt to climate change in order to project future vulnerabilities, it is instructive 
to look at the effectiveness of adaptation policy under current climatic conditions.  Historic evidence demonstrates that 
society has not always adapted to existing risks effectively.  
 
The difficulties involved in ensuring the effectiveness of future adaptive responses is illustrated by shortcomings in 
existing efforts to cope with the effects of climate variability under current climatic conditions.  For example, exposure 
to extreme heat causes deaths in urban areas throughout the world, even during years with no heat waves.  During heat 
waves, these numbers can increase dramatically. These deaths are preventable, yet they persist.  
 
There is a wide array of possible explanations for society’s failure to adapt effectively to existing risks.  This may be 
due to a failure to identify and understand stressors and factors that affect the risk and the ability of society and 
individuals to respond.  It may be due to limited resources available to society for adaptation.  Or it may be due to a 
conscious decision by society not to invest scarce resources in adaptive responses.  Regardless of the reasons for the  
limited effectiveness of existing adaptive responses, the historic evidence suggests that one cannot be cavalier about the 
effectiveness of adaptive strategies when making projections of future vulnerabilities to climate change.  In cases where 
past adaptations have not been perfectly effective, the reasons for the shortcomings should be explored to help improve 
the design of future adaptation measures.  
 
5.1.5 Maladaptation   
There are dangers of maladaptation in poorly designed adaptation strategies.    
Adaptive responses may have unintended, adverse, secondary consequences that outweigh the benefits of undertaking 
the strategy.  An adaptive response that is made without consideration for interdependent systems may, inadvertently, 
increase risks to other systems that are sensitive to climate change.  However, even when a comprehensive approach is 
taken to the development of strategies for adapting to climate-induced effects, one must account for potential non-
climate related side effects of the adaptive strategies to avoid maladaptation.  The possibility has to be considered that 
adaptive responses might have adverse consequences for human health or the environment (Shriner and Street, 1997; 
Parry and Carter, 1998).  Adaptive responses also might have adverse consequences for social well-being. 
 Consideration should be given in the design of adaptive strategies to issues of equity.  The social acceptability of a 
particular adaptive response may depend upon who in society will benefit from the adaptation policy and who will lose 
(Smith et al., 1995).  
 
The concept of maladaptation can be illustrated by one possible response to risks posed by climate change to fisheries. 
Climate change is likely to exacerbate existing stresses on fish stocks.  Hatcheries can be used to enhance natural 
recruitment of fish stocks when climate causes stocks to fall below the carrying capacity of an ecosystem for a given 
species.  This adaptive response might increase stock productivity, reduce recruitment variability, and enable  
the colonization or re-colonization of new areas.  But injudicious use may alter or impoverish  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
106 
Adaptation Measures  
 
the biodiversity of an ecosystem and the genetic pool of resources.  It might also lead to the transmission of parasites 
and diseases (Everett, 1996).  
 
A well-informed decision maker may decide that the adverse effects of the adaptive measures are of greater concern 
than the risks posed by climate change itself.  It is important that all adaptive responses be evaluated in an assessment 
to identify possible adverse consequences and how they might affect the range of feasible and desirable adaptive 
responses that are available.  
 
CASE STUDY   
Low Lake Levels and Dredging   
 
The dredging process that has become the most common approach for managing lowered lake level situations has 
adverse, secondary consequences.  The dredging process may release buried toxins into the lake water.  That is, there is 
a risk of re-suspending human-made inert toxins and heavy metals lying within the lake bottom sediment, significantly 
impacting water quality.  This would reverse the trend towards less contaminated fish in the Great Lakes.  The risks 
posed by future dredging operations need to be assessed and incorporated into any decisions about options for adapting 
to future low lake levels. 
 
5.1.6 Multiple Benefits  
Sensible options have multiple benefits.   
Many strategies that would reduce risks posed by climate change or exploit opportunities make sense whether or not 
the effects of climate change are realized.  These Ňwin-win” adaptation measures result in human systems that are 
more resilient to climate variability today, and hence to future climate change.  Win-win strategies such as heat-wave 
planning and vector-borne disease surveillance systems, are recognized by the public health community as important to 
the protection of lives and health regardless of future climate change (Bernard and Ebi, 2001).  The urgency of 
implementing particular measures may be enhanced or ameliorated by considerations of climate change, and an 
understanding of the incremental effects of climate change is important.  Nevertheless, the current importance of many 
measures suggests that an assessment of strategies for responding to climate change should reflect the fact that the 
measures will prove beneficial even if the projected effects of climate change never materialize.   
 
In some cases, existing institutions and public policies result in systems that are more rigid and unable to respond to 
changing conditions.  For example, the existence of federal flood insurance in the United States provides an incentive 
for development in high-risk coastal areas.  Such development increases the risk of injury and death to coastal 
populations.  Elimination of the federal flood insurance today would reduce the size of coastal communities that are at 
risk today, as well as in the future when sea level rises further.  
 
Care must be taken, however, in evaluating such win-win strategies.  These strategies would  
lead to a more efficient allocation of scarce resources under current and future climatic  
conditions.  However, as noted earlier, the formulation of public policies – including public  
health policies – often involve considerations other than efficiency (e.g. equity considerations,  
political feasibility).  These additional considerations must be accounted for in the assessment of  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
107 
Adaptation Measures  
 
win-win strategies for adapting to climate change in order to protect the physical, biological, and human resources of 
the Great Lakes region.  
 
5.2 TOOLS TO FACILITATE DECISION MAKING   
Once a decision has been made to implement adaptation strategies, the choice of a Ňbest” policy for coping with 
climate change is a decision that inherently depends upon social values and selection criteria that must be identified by 
decision makers (not by researchers or assessors). Policy decisions are often complex because of the need to consider 
multiple social objectives, and the need to assess the importance and relevance of these objectives in some consistent 
way – which requires their own set of tools (Herrod-Julius and Scheraga, 2000).  The choice of a specific best coping 
strategy may depend upon considerations other than climate change, such as equity considerations (both within and 
across generations) and political feasibility.  Also, the choice of a best coping strategy may depend upon specific 
environmental objectives chosen by society, such as the protection of unique ecosystems or sustainable development 
goals.  
 
5.3 CONCLUSIONS  
Anticipatory adaptation is a risk management policy.  Although many uncertainties exist about the potential 
consequences of future climate change, existing evidence suggests that climate in the Great Lakes region is changing 
and will continue to change.  This will result in both beneficial and adverse effects on human health, ecosystems, and 
socio-economic systems that are sensitive to changes in climate.  Investments in adaptation are warranted to reduce the  
vulnerability of systems to climate change and to exploit the opportunities that may increase social well-being.

6.0 ADAPTATION MEASURES FOR CONSIDERATION  
 
Many of the management practices in the Great Lakes region are predicated on the fact that the past is a reliable guide 
to the future.  However, a changing climate challenges managers.  They must examine: How is the climate changing? 
How great or rapid are the changes? What and who might be affected? What adaptations must be made to cope with  
the changes? When or how fast must these adaptations be made? What are the costs? What are the impediments to 
adaptation? What is the capacity to adapt?  Climate change may exacerbate existing issues within the region and adds a 
new component to consider in planning, management, and program implementation.  Adaptation links needs of today  
with problems of tomorrow. 
  
A preliminary list of potential adaptation measures was drawn from the proceedings of symposia and workshops and 
well as climate change assessment reports (see Table 6-1).  Identifying possible adaptations is the first step and 
numerous lists have been developed.  The next steps are more difficult and require consultation and collaboration 
amongst stakeholders and practitioners in the Great Lakes region because managing to meet multiple demands in a 
changing environment requires an integrated approach.  The process includes:   
1. 
Assessing and evaluating potential adaptation measures;  
2. 
Choosing preferred adaptation measures;  
3. 
Developing action plans that contain a portfolio of adaptation measures and  
incorporate means to address barriers to adaptation;  
4. 
Implementing adaptations;  
5. 
Monitoring impacts and adaptation measures for effectiveness; and  
6. 
Reassessing adaptation measures.

7.0 RESEARCH NEEDS  
 
As climate impact assessment moves to a more participatory process, the research undertaken needs to reflect 
practitioner/stakeholder as well as researcher views of what is needed to understand climate change, the impacts, and 
adaptive responses.  To reflect this dialogue, a list of research needs has been compiled from numerous climate change 
workshop and symposia reports, and climate impact assessment documents (Mortsch et al., 1998; Hofmann et al., 1998;  
Mills and Craig, 1999; Fisher et al., 2000; Scott et al., 2000; Sousounis and Bisanz, 2000; Arnell  et al., 2001; Gitay et 
al., 2001; Grondin and Gosselin, 2002).  This is an extensive list that needs further refinement through dialogue within 
the Great Lakes community on what needs to be done to address climate change.  Much emphasis has been placed on 
understanding biophysical systems and clearly more attention needs to be placed on understanding human and  
institutional behaviour in the face of a changing climate.  
 
Also, assessing the sensitivity of beneficial uses to climate change uncovered numerous topics where there has been 
little or no research in the Great Lakes region.  The tables in Chapter 4 highlight the gaps specifically; however, the 
general needs are incorporated below.   
 
The research needs are organized into themes including: monitoring/surveillance/analysis, climate change scenarios, 
model development, vulnerability, impact and adaptation assessments, economic assessment, adaptation, and 
communication.  
 
7.1 MONITORING/SURVEILLANCE/ANALYSIS  
Long-term monitoring of systematically gathered environmental and socio-economic data is critical.  Reliable data are 
required from which to make decisions, calibrate models, and make projections.  Similarly, these data are important to 
understanding patterns of variability, for even without climate change the recent past may not be a reliable guide for 
management due to other agents of change.   
 
Needs include:  
  
Critical assessments of current monitoring programs with adjustments identified to meet  
future needs;  
  
Collaboration and protocols for common methods of monitoring that allow  
intercomparison of data collected in different cities, states, or provinces (e.g. disease  
surveillance information; climate data);  
  
Gathering baseline data for the evaluation of climate, hydrological, water quality, and  
ecosystem variability and trends over time to provide context for changing climate;  
  
Monitoring and analysis for detecting changing climatic, hydrologic, water quality, and  
ecosystem conditions (using indices that are relevant to stakeholders and practitioners as  
well as researchers);  
  
Monitoring and analysis to corroborate climate change impacts (e.g. duration of effects,  
spatial extent of effects, changes in species or processes) identified in impact  
assessments;

7.2 CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIOS  
The development of credible climate change scenarios is a common research need.  However, there are different 
scenario requirements for the research community and resource management practitioners.  The challenge is to 
construct scenarios and develop methods of applying scenarios that aid decision-making.  This requires frequent 
discussion between the researchers and practitioners on the evolving science and front-line needs.  One critical 
requirement is to provide guidance on using a range of climate scenarios in impact assessments.  
 
Needs include:  
  
Regional climate scenarios (with the Great Lakes incorporated in the landcover scheme);   
  
Downscaling techniques;  
  
Changes in variability at all time scales;  
  
Improved projections for frequency, timing, and intensity of extreme weather (especially  
precipitation).  
 
7.3 MODEL DEVELOPMENT  
Models are important tools to explore the sensitivity of systems to a changing climate.  The sophistication of the 
climate impact assessment is, in part, affected by the complexity of the biophysical and socio-economic models that are 
used.  Biophysical models (hydrology, forestry, and agriculture) are more common and advanced than socio-economic 
models (decision-making, adaptation process).    
 
Needs include:  
  
More robust regulation models for Lakes Superior and Ontario as current regulation  
models have significant limitations under climate change scenarios including failure;  
need to expand interests that are considered (e.g. recreational boating and the  
environment);  
  
Second generation runoff models for the Great Lakes watershed that incorporate land  
surface processes as well as changes in land use and cover in a changing climate;   
  
Improved Great Lakes evaporation model;  
  
Models that include realistic representation of processes that generate streamflow and  
recharge as well as determine water quality;  
  
Advances in mixed layer modelling that include lake morphometry, heat advection by  
river discharge, and ice dynamics;  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
123 
Research Needs  
 
  
Models that could assess changes to wetland form, functioning, vegetation, chemistry  
and, habitat due to hydrologic and temperature changes;  
  
Coupled models of ecosystem productivity with models of land use change to  
understand change under altered climate;   
  
Dynamic (transient) models of ecosystems (e.g. Gap model) combined with spatially  
distributed models of landscape function;   
  
Response of disturbance regimes (fires, pests, diseases) to climate change;   
  
The effect of seed dispersal on the rate of species establishment.   
 
7.4 VULNERABILITY, IMPACT, AND ADAPTATION (VIA) ASSESSMENTS  
7.4.1 Climate Link  
This review uncovered a large range of topics that are climate sensitive but where there has been very little linkage 
made to climate variability, let alone climate change.  Research needs include:  
  
Understanding the linkages between climate variables and ecosystem components such  
as species composition, diversity, production, respiration, recruitment, and mortality;   
  
Identifying aspects of climate variability that are most ecologically relevant and the  
segment of ecosystems most sensitive to climate change;

and quality, fisheries, ecosystems and wildlife, human health, and forests;   
  
Understanding the impact of greater warming at night.  
 
7.4.2 Rate of Change  
There is uncertainty regarding the rate of climate change.  Our vulnerability to climate change will depend on both the 
nature of the impacts and our ability to adapt to them.  The rate of climate change is a critical factor affecting the ability 
to adapt; rapid climate change could mean increased costs and disruption.  No VIA assessments have addressed the 
implications of different rates of climate change.   
 
7.4.3 Baseline   
VIA assessments need a baseline or starting conditions from which to project a changing climate and to assess the 
changes to biophysical and socio-economic conditions.  Many baselines exist due to the constantly evolving nature of 
institutions and economies as well as the natural resource base.  Methods need to be developed to address this issue.

variability and change.  
 
7.4.10 Economic Assessment  
There is an overwhelming lack of economic analysis of the impact of climate change.  More detailed regional analysis 
is needed on costs, benefits, interface between sectors, and distributional aspects of climate change impacts.  Also, 
human adaptation needs to be costed.

7.4.12 Communication  
Most climate change assessment summaries and workshop proceedings call for more communication of climate change 
information among researchers, decision makers, practitioners, stakeholders, and the general public.  However, there 
are few assessments of information needs, effective communication methods for different groups and various 
outcomes, and guidelines for Ňeffective” communication.

Summary  
 
8.0 SUMMARY  
 
Within the Great Lakes region, some notable changes in climate and hydrology have been identified.  For example, air 
temperatures are rising, the minimums more than the maximums.  Associated indices such as growing season length, 
frost-free season, cooling season, and heating season are also affected.  Snow cover duration and areal extent are 
decreasing.  The important spring runoff is occurring earlier.  
 
The people, communities, economic activities, wildlife, and ecosystems of the Great Lakes region are sensitive to 
climate variability and change.  However, their vulnerability depends on the capacity to adapt.  Human systems have 
the greatest capacity to deal with a changing climate because they can be deliberate about adaptation.  Through 
proactive planning, management adjustments, investment, legislation, institutional change, and education and training,  
modifications can be made to minimize impacts and take advantage of opportunities.  It is not an easy task but it can be 
done.  Yet, thresholds may be reached that significantly strain adaptive capacity.  Natural ecosystems, their processes 
and wildlife are most vulnerable to a changing climate because adaptation is autonomous.  The ecosystems respond 
through natural processes but the outcomes are uncertain.  Significant human intervention may be required to 
Ňmanage” change but managers do not have the knowledge or the capacity to address all the potential changes.    
 
There is much to be done to address the issue of a changing climate in the Great Lakes watershed.  Monitoring is 
required to detect changes in climate as well as identify impacts in ecosystems, to communities, and on economic 
activity.  Climate change impact assessments are needed particularly on the effects on ecosystems and water quality. 
 There is a crucial lack of understanding of the implications of a changing climate for the beneficial uses in the Great  
Lakes Water Quality Agreement.  Adaptation measures need to be identified, assessed, costed, and incorporated into an 
adaptation strategy.  This requires an integrated approach where a wide range of adaptations are considered; many 
practitioners and stakeholders are involved in dialogue and included in the decision process.

Summary  
 
Appendix A   
 
Climate Change Scenario Development  
A scenario is a plausible, coherent, internally consistent description of a possible future state of the world (Carter et al., 
1994); it is not a prediction or forecast since no probability of occurrence is associated with the scenario.  This 
appendix describes the three most common scenario-generating techniques that have been used for climate change 
impact assessments in the Great Lakes.  
 
A.1 
Global Climate Model (GCM) Scenarios  
The most commonly used scenario-generating technique is GCM-based.  Coupled general circulation models of the 
atmosphere and ocean (AOGCMs) provide the most credible quantitative estimate of the climate response to changing 
concentrations of greenhouse gases, sulphate aerosols, and other elements that affect climate forcing (IPCC, 1999).  
 
Historically, GCM-based scenarios were developed from equilibrium-response climate change experiments where the 
atmospheric component was linked to highly simplified oceanic and sea-ice components.  In these experiments, the 
global climate system was perturbed by an instantaneous increase in the atmospheric concentration of CO2 (usually a  
doubling) and allowed to stabilize to a Ňnew” climate. This is known as a 2xCO2 run.  In addition, a 1xCO2 control 
run of the GCM was produced with pre-industrial or current atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. The 2xCO 
climate change scenario was derived from the difference (temperature) or the ratio (precipitation) between the 2xCO2 
and 1xCO2results.  The 2xCO2 scenarios reported here include CCC92, GISS (87) and the GFDL (87).  
 
Current climate change impact assessments use transient experiments in which AOGCMs simulate the response of the 
climate system to a gradual increase in CO2 and sulphate aerosols. The AOGCM incorporates the ocean’s important 
role in sequestering and distributing heat. In most cases, data are available depicting the evolution of the climate  
system to 2100 in response to historical and projected greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing described by the IS92 and 
Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) emission scenarios (IPCC, 2000).  In the scenario-generating process, 
the 30-year simulation period from 1961-90 is used as the reference climate from which Ňchange fields” for future 
periods are calculated.  Now, most scenarios are calculated for the 2020s (2010-2039), the 2050s (2040-2069), and the 
2080s (2070-2099) although shorter 20-year periods were used in the U.S. National Assessment and recent 
International Joint Commission Studies (Lofgren et al., 2002; Mortsch et al., 2000).   
 
IS92  
Through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), six (a to f) greenhouse gas and sulphate emission 
scenarios were developed using scenarios of economic development, population growth, and energy mix (Leggett et al., 
1992).  The IS92a scenario is known as the Ňbusiness as usual scenario” where emission scenarios are based on 
historical increases to 1990 and thereafter a 1 % annum growth, compounded. The IS92a emission scenario was used 
by all GCM modelling centres for their climate sensitivity experiments.  The IS92a is the only scenario used in all 
climate impact assessments in the Great Lakes watershed.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
130 
 
Summary  
 
SRES  
The SRES emission futures consist of a series of four scenario families, A1, A2, B1, and B2, which represent different 
demographic, social, economic, and technological futures called Ňstorylines” (Carter et al., 1999). They differ from the 
IS92 by having lower population projections as well as other features.  The A1 and A2 families have an economic 
development focus while B1 and B2 focus are more environmental (CCIS, 2002). The A1 and B1 scenarios have a 
global perspective while the A2 and B2 are more regional. To date no SRES scenarios have been used in climate 
change impact assessments in the Great Lakes; however, the International Joint Commission Lake Ontario Reference 
will be using these scenarios for an assessment of water level changes (Barrow, 2002).  
 
SRES Storylines  
  
The  A1 storyline is a world of very rapid economic growth, low population  
increase, and rapid introduction of new, more efficient technologies.  The  
economy grows to approximately $550 (U.S.) trillion by 2100.   Global  
populations reach 9 billion by 2050, and decrease to 7 billion by 2100.  There  
are abundant energy and mineral resources available due to rapid technical  
progress.  
 
  
The  A2 storyline is a diverse world.  There is a reliance and preservation of  
local identities and a high population growth, 15 billion by 2100.  Economic  
development is regionally orientated. Economic growth and technological  
change are more uneven and slower than the other storylines.  Global per capita  
income is low compared to the other scenarios.  The GDP is $250 (U.S.) trillion  
by 2100.  
 
  
The  B1 storyline is a convergent world.  There is low population growth, 9  
billion by 2050 and a decrease to 7 billion by 2100.  There are rapid changes in  
the economic organization through service, information economy, and resource- 
efficient technology.  The GDP is $350 (U.S.) trillion by 2100.  
 
  
The  B2 storyline concentrates on local solutions to economic, social, and  
environmental sustainability.  There is a moderate population growth of 10  
billion and the GDP is $250 (U.S.) trillion by 2100.  This storyline focuses on  
local and regional levels of environmental protection and social equity IPCC  
(2000).  
 
A.2 Climate Change Analogues  
Analogue scenarios are constructed from real-world climatological observations and are defined as temporal or spatial 
analogues. Temporal analogues focus on an historical extreme event (drought, flood, wind storm, or ice storm) that has 
occurred in the past in the study area that may occur more frequently or severely in the future. The current vulnerability 
(or impacts) to climate can be demonstrated and as well adaptations implemented in response to the condition can be 
studied. For spatial analogues, measured observations (evaporation, precipitation, and temperature) from another region 
are used to test the potential vulnerability of the region to different mean climatic conditions and climate variability. 
Different boundary conditions (topographic, land use) and forcing factors (hurricanes) affect the validity of the  
application of these scenarios (Kunkel et al., 1998; Mortsch and Quinn, 1996).    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
131 
Summary  
 
These scenarios may be more palatable to policy and decision-makers as they appear to have a greater Ňgrounding” in 
reality; they have been experienced in the past. However, the magnitude and types of changes that may be expected as a 
result of climate change have not been experienced during recorded history, making it difficult to find appropriate 
analogues.   
 
A.3 Systematic Changes to Climate Parameters  
In this technique, scenarios are developed by making systematic changes to observed climate data, for example, 1 or 2 
or 3  C temperature increase or  10 % or  20 % precipitation change or other factors such as lake levels.  These 
scenarios are developed with guidance from GCMs (e.g. limits of temperature changes) or stakeholder-specified 
vulnerabilities.  These scenarios are often considered very simplistic representations of the complex response of the 
climate system.  However, they can provide a preliminary exploration of critical thresholds or changes in a Ňsensitivity 
analysis”.  If warranted, more detailed scenario development and impact analysis can follow.

WORKSHOP PURPOSE 
The draft white paper provided insight into the issues and impacts associated with climate change in the Great 
Lakes region, the options available to address those impacts, and the challenges associated with taking action.  To 
ensure that the Water Quality Board had properly characterized the consequences of climate change, appreciated the 
challenges for taking action, and would provide sound advice to address impacts, the Board convened a two-day 
workshop, using the draft white paper as the basis for discussion. The workshop was intended to appeal to members of 
the Great Lakes community familiar with impacts or impacted by climate change, as well as those positioned to 
implement adaptive measures and influence programs and policy.  Workshop participants were asked to ground-truth 
the information in the draft white paper and to provide advice about how to address climate change, specifically to: 
 
• 
Confirm that key impacts had been correctly identified. 
• 
Identify how impacts on ecosystem quality, ecosystem health, human health, and beneficial uses of  
 
The Great Lakes interact and interrelate. 
• 
Identify and assess adaptation options available to address impacts. 
• 
Identify knowledge gaps and research needs to inform policy and decision making. 
• 
Facilitate cross-border communication and cooperation. 
 
Participants were encouraged to draw upon and share their personal real-world experiences:  impacts encountered, 
specific response measures taken, the extent to which adaptation was possible, and limitations and barriers to taking 
action or further action. 
 
WORKSHOP STRUCTURE 
 
The workshop was designed to provide ample opportunity for dialogue among participants.  The agenda is presented in 
Table 1.  Formal presentations were limited to an overview of the white paper by the authors, plus a presentation by 
Georges Beauchemin who provided insight into real-world considerations of risks, opportunities, and responses.  The 
revised white paper and M. Beauchemin’s presentation respectively constitute Parts 3 and 5 of this report to the 
Commission. 
 
Workshop participants were divided into breakout groups.  To provide structure and focus to the breakout discussions, 
seven questions were posed (Table 2).  The questions were not, however, intended to be exclusive nor answered 
sequentially.  Rather, they were intended as a guide to draw out people’s insight and experiences. The breakout groups 
met twice, once on each day. 
 
To provide additional opportunity for discussion, the breakout session facilitators constituted a plenary panel during 
which they presented the key points arising from the breakout discussions.  The panelists were also encouraged to share 
additional insights, to stimulate people to “think outside the box.” 
 
The workshop concluded with a group discussion to identify key points that would contribute to the Board’s “bottom 
line” advice to the Commission.

Breakout Group Discussion Questions 
 
Background.  In addressing climate change, we want to take advantage of positive impacts, minimize negative 
impacts, and ensure compatibility among various interests.  Each change, impact, intervention mode, and adaptation 
option poses opportunities, challenges, and barriers.  In answering the questions, please consider the following: 
 
• 
Responsibility.  Who does what, when, where, how, and why? 
• 
Cost. 
• 
Time frame -- short-term action?  long-term investment? 
• 
Adequacy of existing institutional framework -- legal, management structure, programs, and 
policies. 
• 
Availability and adequacy of engineering and technical infrastructure. 
• 
Impact on Great Lakes governance. 
• 
The extent to which adaptation options and mechanisms exist (including those for other stressors) 
and can be utilized. 
• 
Socio-economic considerations, including consequences and incentives. 
• 
Consequences of implementing adaptation options on competing interests.

The plenary discussions and breakout group deliberations are summarized below.  The Water Quality Board 
subsequently incorporated many of the insightful comments provided by the workshop participants into the revised 
white paper.  Written comments received subsequent to the workshop were also taken into consideration. The Board 
limited changes to those that corrected errors of fact and to those that extended, amplified, or clarified the information 
presented. 
 
The Board also incorporated a number of key points into its advice to the Commission. 
 
Some of the comments received were beyond the intended scope of the white paper, and other suggestions would have 
entailed additional time and investigation by the authors.  Although the white paper would be more focussed by 
addressing these additional comments and suggestions, the Board concluded that there is no “end point.”  The 
information base - hence, our understanding of issues, impacts, and responses - will continue to evolve.  The Board 
further concluded that the white paper is a snapshot in time and - although there are gaps - provides a good overview of 
the issue. 
 
TERMINOLOGY — THE CONNOTATION OF ADAPTATION 
 
Milt Clark advocated against using the word “adaptation.”  The term implies that climate change will be easy to adjust 
to and that people will just have to live with it.  The draft white paper did not make the point that adaptations will not 
result in complete success nor “solve” problems posed by climate change.  Clark preferred the term “strategies / 
responses” or “coping.”  Alain Bourque said that the idea of adaptation is captured in the phrase “limiting the adverse 
effects of climate change.”  Jim Bruce defended the use of “adaptation,” noting that some of the effects will not be 
negative.  “Adaptation” allows flexibility to discuss changes that should be made to address beneficial, as well as 
negative, effects.  John Carey also defended the term and said that “strategies / responses” is too limiting, noting that 
impacts cannot always be addressed with strategies.  At times it is necessary to adapt expectations. 
 
Clark did not object to the term “adaptation” if the phrase were, for example, “adaptive action” rather than a more 
passive “adaptive measures” and if the white paper recognized the importance of mitigation efforts and that both 
adaptation and mitigation are required to address the climate change issue.  The white paper, at a minimum, should 
recognize current mitigation measures.

The authors provided an overview of the contents of the white paper.  Their presentations are summarized below.

Presentation - Climate Change and Water Quality 
in the Great Lakes Region.  Linda Mortsch 
 
The white paper embraces an ecosystem perspective:  rather than focusing solely on water quality, the paper examines 
the impact that climate change could have at the ecosystem scale, and how the impacts could affect a variety of 
systems, including water resources, human health, agriculture, recreation, and the economy.  Ms. Mortsch focussed on 
the impacts that a changing climate could have on the Great Lakes basin.  She asked the audience to consider three 
questions:  What impacts are of concern to me and my stakeholders?  What adaptation measures need to be 
implemented?  How can we facilitate adaptation? 
 
Modeling exercises and various studies indicate that climate change could lead to significant airshed, nearshore, in-
lake, and watershed effects.  As air temperature rises, the following are projected:  (1) the frequency and intensity of 
storms will change;  (2) more precipitation will fall on an annual basis but less during key growing seasons;  (3) high-
intensity precipitation events will be more frequent;  (4) evaporation and evapotranspiration rates will increase;  (5) 
there will be less ice cover on lakes;  and (6) there will be less snowfall (and therefore less snow pack) and more rain 
during the winter season.  These effects could have significant implications on ecosystems and biodiversity, recreation 
and tourism, agriculture, streamflow, lake levels, ground water, and human health. 
 
Ecosystems and Biodiversity 
 
Thermal conditions and precipitation patterns - both of which are projected to change - set the boundaries which 
determine where different types of wildlife and vegetation are able to live.  As the boundaries change, some types of 
habitat will be lost, some will expand, and existing community structures and interactions will likely be altered.  While 
some animals and plants may find that climate change brings them new opportunities, others will be driven out of their 
homes.  For example, studies suggest that southerly species of warm-water fish may be able to supplant northerly 
species of cold-water fish.  Mortsch presented maps which show how the distribution of bobolink (a bird species) could 
change in the future.  She also presented maps that showed how vegetation zones might change as more carbon dioxide 
(CO ) enters the atmosphere in a 2 X CO  climate change scenario.  The scenario suggests that existing forests may 
become severely stressed and that their boundaries may be altered due to changed climate conditions.  Expanding on 
the topic of forestry, climate change might induce a major shift in the range of tree species, and it has the potential to 
degrade forest health, promote harmful plant diseases and pests, cause increases in forest fires, and induce changes in 
water availability and water quality. 
 
Rare and endangered species which, by definition, may be few in number and have a small range and / or limited 
habitat, may be particularly vulnerable to the stress of a changing habitat.  In addition, non-native species might be able 
to gain strong footholds as the climate changes.  For example, although zebra mussels have already been introduced to 
Lake Superior through bilge water, they do not currently flourish in the lake because the water is too cold.  What will 
happen if Lake Superior’s water temperature rises? 
 
Recreation and Tourism 
 
Climate change could cause dramatic shifts in the recreation and tourism industry.  For example, because climate 
change is expected to result in longer summers and shorter winters, the season for summer time activities (e.g. 
camping, boating, and hiking) will lengthen, but the season for winter sports will be curtailed.  A shorter winter season 
would harm the skiing industry.  Ski resorts would have a shorter reliable season and would have to rely on costly 
snow-making activities.  Even those who manage summertime activities might have to face some tough management 
issues.  For example, if the hiking season is longer, will resource managers have to limit access to trails to protect them 
from overuse and damage?  Also, if climate change causes adverse effects, such as poor water quality, low water levels, 
species loss, or aesthetic problems, will hunting, bird watching, fishing, swimming, or canoeing still be desirable 
activities? 
 
Agriculture 
 
While climate change could result in a longer growing season, a warmer climate might induce some negative effects on 
the agricultural industry.  For example, irrigation demand might increase, since precipitation during key seasons, such 
as summer and fall, may decrease as the climate changes.  Also, some projections suggest that 
 
 
 
 
6 
warmer temperatures will support the growth of more pests and weeds.  If so, additional pesticides and herbicides will 
be needed to address the problem, but these products come at a cost for farmers and also cause environmental concerns. 
 The agricultural industry might also be adversely impacted.  An increase in soilerosion is projected to occur, because 
high-intensity rainfalls are expected to increase, and snow cover, which acts as a barrier to erosion, is expected to 
lessen, further exacerbated by an increase in winter rainfall.  Water quality will be affected.  In addition, climate change 
might require a change in the type of crops grown and the types of tillage practices used. 
 
Streamflow 
 
Studies suggest that climate change will cause changes in the timing and the amount of streamflow.  While more water 
is expected to run off and flow through streams during the winter months, summer and fall low-flow events are 
expected to be exacerbated.  Not only will these changes affect water quality, they could also increase the likelihood of 
conflicts about the apportionment of water among different users, such as in-stream ecological needs and economic 
uses.  The results of a modeling exercise performed on the Trent River suggest that summer flow might be reduced by 
as much as 22% in 2030, 37% in 2050, and 55% in 2090. 
 
Lake Levels 
 
Most climate change scenarios project that water levels in the Great Lakes will decrease.  While some models predict 
decreases of about 22 centimetres, others anticipate a drop of 2.5 metres.  Low lake levels could have negative impacts 
on transportation, tourism, recreation, fisheries, industry, municipalities, agriculture, and human health.  If water levels 
decreased by 1.6 metres, the shoreline of Lake St. Clair could shift by 0.5 to 6 kilometers. Such a drop in water level 
could impact the shipping channel and cause more boats to run aground.  At least one boat salvage company has 
experienced a boost in business as more boats have started running aground because of present low levels.  Changing 
water levels will also have dramatic impacts on wetlands and the types of plants and animals that live in such 
environments. 
 
Ground Water 
 
Some studies suggest that climate change could decrease ground-water recharge, levels, and base flow.  If so, this 
would change the amount and timing of base flow to streams, lakes, and wetlands.  The studies also suggest a 
seasonality effect.  Less flow is expected during critical times, such as spring and early summer, and more flow during 
the wintertime.  The proportion of ground water in stream flow is also altered. 
 
Water Quality 
 
Climate change could have dramatic impacts on water quality.  Increases in water temperature could affect physical, 
chemical, and biological processes.  Some work suggests that there will be extended thermal stratification and less 
mixing, increasing the potential for anoxia, and an increase in the metabolic rates of invertebrates and microbes.  All of 
these factors could affect water quality.  Also, non-point source pollution is expected to become a more significant 
problem as the climate changes.  The Soil and Water Conservation Society recently released a report stating that 
increases in precipitation intensity could lead to greater erosion and entrainment of sediments, nutrients, and pesticides. 
 Point source pollution might also pose a more serious problem as the climate changes;  reductions in flow and 
increases in low-flow episodes could reduce assimilative capacity and make it more difficult for point sources to meet 
existing water quality discharge standards.  A climate impact assessment for the Bay of Quinte watershed illustrated 
that phosphorus remediation targets may not be met. 
 
Human Health 
 
Climate change will affect human health.  For example, humans could be affected by:  (1) increases in extreme weather 
events, such as flooding and ice storms;  (2) increases in heat stress episodes and decreases in cold stress episodes;  (3) 
increases in vector-borne and rodent-borne diseases;  and (4) poor air quality.  To expand, ground-level ozone, which 
causes adverse health effects, becomes a bigger problem as temperatures rise.  Those who might be the most vulnerable 
to health risks are children and the elderly, as well as low-income and immuno-compromised individuals.  Climate 
change could cause more water quality impairment from combined sewer systems.  These systems, which service many 
cities in the United States and Canada, contribute pollutants, including bacteria, into water bodies during intense 
precipitation events that cause high runoff.  As the climate changes and the frequency of high-intensity rain events 
increases, more pollution incidents are anticipated.

Presentation - Implications for Beneficial Uses Identified 
in the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement.  Marianne Alden 
 
The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement calls for the restoration of 14 impaired beneficial uses.  Also, there are 
currently 42 Areas of Concern (AOCs) in the Great Lakes.  An AOC is defined as “a geographic area that fails to meet 
the General or Specific Objectives of the Agreement where such failure has caused or is likely to cause impairment of 
beneficial use or of the area’s ability to support aquatic life.”  It is important to analyze the impact that climate change 
could have on achievement of beneficial uses and on AOCs.  Three key questions require attention:  Will climate 
change impact areas that have already been deemed environmentally sensitive? Will climate change create new AOCs? 
 Will climate change impair beneficial uses that have already been restored? 
 
The white paper summarizes research that examines the impact that climate change could have on 12 beneficial uses. 
 
Loss of fish and wildlife habitat.  Fish and wildlife habitat have been studied to examine the impacts of changing 
water levels, precipitation patterns, air temperatures, ice break up patterns, and disturbance hazards (e.g. forest fires and 
insect outbreaks).  Some studies suggest that:  (1) the areal extent of wetlands will be altered as water levels change; 
 (2) tree lines will shift and certain tree species will disappear as air temperatures change; and (3) channel morphology 
could be altered due to changes in ice break-up intensity, affecting vegetation succession and fish-spawning habitat 
along the shoreline. 
 
Degradation of phytoplankton and zooplankton populations.  According to existing research, plankton 
populations appear to be sensitive to:  (1) warmer air and water temperatures;  (2) drier hydrological conditions; and (3) 
changes in ice break up.  For example, some studies show that colder waters support larger and more diverse plankton 
populations. 
 
Added costs to agriculture or industry.  No research has been performed to determine exactly how climate 
change will impact costs incurred by these sectors. 
 
Degradation of aesthetics.  No specific research has been performed regarding the effect of climate change on 
aesthetics.  Some studies do suggest, however, that decreases in water level result in shoreline changes that are not 
aesthetically pleasing, such as exposed and rotting vegetation and muddy shorelines and mudflats. 
 
Beach closings.  No specific research has been performed regarding the expected effect of climate change on 
beach closings.  Some studies do suggest, however, that beaches are negatively impacted by increased precipitation 
events and lower water levels.  For example, in July 1998, an intense rainstorm washed waste from the street and 
caused sewage plant overflows.  This resulted in the closure of almost every beach in Kingston, Toronto, Hamilton, and 
St. Catharines, Ontario. 
 
Restrictions on drinking water consumption or taste and odor problems.  According to existing research, such 
impairments have been linked to air temperature increases and low water levels. 
 
Eutrophication or undesirable algae.  The following play a role in increasing eutrophication rates and promoting 
algal blooms:  (1) increases in air and water temperatures;  (2) decreases in water levels;  and (3) increases in high-
intensity precipitation events. 
 
Restrictions on dredging activities.  While no specific research has been performed regarding the effect of 
climate change on dredging activities, some studies do suggest that problems, such as resuspension of sediment, are 
exacerbated as water levels decrease. 
 
Degradation of benthos.  While no specific research has been performed regarding the effect of climate change 
on benthos populations, some studies do suggest that these populations are impacted by changes in water quality. 
 
Degradation of fish and wildlife populations.  A significant amount of research has been performed.  The results 
suggest that fish and wildlife populations are affected by increases in water and air temperature, invasions of non-native 
species, changes in water chemistry, and changes in food sources.  For example, the sex ratio of 
 
 
 
 
8 
painted turtle populations is affected by air temperature;  more females are born when conditions are warmer. Also, 
warmer water might allow sea lampreys to thrive and cold-water fish to be driven out of their habitats by warm-water 
fish.  In addition, warmer temperatures have been known to prompt some species to mate or migrate early.  In the case 
of the latter, an animal could arrive at its destination before its food source is available. 
 
Restrictions on fish and wildlife consumption.  No specific research has been performed regarding the effect of 
climate change. 
 
Tainting of fish and wildlife flavor.  No specific research has been performed regarding the effect of climate 
change. 
 
Clearly, there are knowledge gaps that need to be filled. 
 
Summary of Discussion following Presentations 
 
The white paper should include information about the link between climate change and greenhouse (GHG) emissions. 
 Omission would undermine the importance of GHG mitigation efforts and deprive readers of a full 
understanding of climate change issues.  The linkage between GHGs and temperature change should be mentioned, but 
it would be unwise to engage in a lengthy debate on the topic.  The conclusions of the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) and the National Academy of Science on this topic should be cited.  Be clear that Canada and 
the United States are actively involved in GHG reduction efforts. 
 
The white paper should incorporate recently published information on observed changes in summer wind field 
patterns across Green Bay.  The changes will impact resuspension, sediment transport, and sediment burial 
rates. This could impact how long it takes for contaminants to be buried and could have ecological, human health, and 
water quality effects. 
 
Although the white paper acknowledges that there will be winners and losers, it should provide more examples of the 
positive benefits of climate change. 
 
Species may be able to better adapt to a changing climate if the changes occur gradually rather than abruptly. The white 
paper should include information on the significance of the speed and magnitude of change on a species’ ability to 
adapt.  More research needs to be performed on how adaptable humans and ecological systems are to the rate of 
change. 
 
The white paper should discuss the potential cumulative effects of climate change.  Some effects may be additive; 
 others will cancel out.  The combined effect of lower water levels, increased periods of stratification, and changes in 
precipitation regimes could cause serious anoxia problems. 
 
The white paper should provide more information about how an “ecosystem approach” to management will translate 
to action. 
 
The white paper should examine the potential impact of rising temperatures on contaminant volatilization. Volatile 
organic chemicals (VOCs) that currently contaminate the Great Lakes could volatilize at an increased rate, leading to 
negative impacts on northern communities, since VOCs may simply be redeposited in colder waters. 
 
The white paper should acknowledge that surprises are to be expected.  Climate change will lead to effects that no one 
has anticipated yet. 
 
There is a need to differentiate between physical habitat (the substrate) and overlying water.  Much more research 
needs to be performed on the nearshore zone. 
 
Uncertainty is a fact of life and should not be an excuse for paralysis of action.  The IPCC reports might have 
some useful discussions to draw upon regarding the issue of uncertainty.  It is time to take action on climate change 
issues - “the perfect is the enemy of the good, so let’s get on with it.”

Presentation - Adapting To Climate Change.  Joel Scheraga 
 
Dr. Scheraga explained why decision makers in the Great Lakes basin must start implementing adaptation strategies to 
address climate change.  According to a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, “Adaptation refers 
to adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected stimuli or their effects, which moderates 
harm or exploits beneficial opportunities.”  In his presentation, Scheraga explained the importance of adaptation, 
discussed basic considerations that should be taken into account when developing adaptation strategies, and offered 
recommendations to the Great Lakes Water Quality Board. 
 
The Importance of Adaptation 
 
Climate change poses a range of potential risks and opportunities.  It is unclear how severe the impacts will be. Society 
is moving into unchartered territory:  CO  levels are higher today than they have ever been during the course of human 
history and are only expected to increase.  Humans are playing a grand experiment with the earth’s systems. 
 Greenhouse gas concentrations are building at a rate more rapid than anything humankind has experienced before. 
 
The projected effects of climate change (e.g. higher temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, and rising sea 
level) will exert impacts on a variety of systems that humans care about:  human health, agriculture, forests, water 
resources, coastal areas, and species and natural areas.  In order to protect these systems, humans should strive to 
develop a balanced portfolio of mitigation and adaptation strategies.  While mitigation is important, the focus of the 
white paper is adaptation.  Some people are reluctant to talk about adaptation because of the fear that efforts to 
implement adaptation strategies will detract from efforts to implement mitigation strategies. However, the opposite may 
be true:  by implementing adaptation strategies, the public will become more aware of climate change issues and press 
more forcefully for mitigation strategies.  Focussing on adaptation is also justified because climate change is happening 
now, and changes will continue to occur even if mitigation strategies are implemented today.  Thus, because change is 
unavoidable, it makes sense for people to do what they can to build resilience and decrease vulnerabilities to impending 
changes.  Compared to natural systems, humans are fortunate.  While nature can only react to changes, humans can 
anticipate and act to reduce the negative effects that might result.  Humans can also take advantage of the positive 
opportunities that could arise.  To expand, some climate change effects could be beneficial and it is foolish not to take 
advantage. While some policymakers agree that adaptation makes sense, they find it difficult to act since there is so 
much uncertainty about the rate and magnitude of climate change.  This is a difficult problem, but policymakers must 
realize that failing to invest in adaptation today can leave regions vulnerable to severe consequences.  As time goes on 
and the climate changes, it may become more difficult to protect sensitive systems.  In addition, if policymakers fail to 
take climate change into account when designing new infrastructure, they may find themselves stuck with obsolete 
infrastructure that is incapable of addressing future stressors.  When designing a new combined sewer, for example, 
planners should take projected changes in precipitation patterns into account. 
 
Policymakers have asked the scientific community to make concrete predictions about climate change effects. Some 
have asked scientists to attach probabilities to anticipated outcomes.  This type of information would help policymakers 
make smart decisions about adaptation strategies.  While concrete predictions are difficult with the tools currently 
available, useful information can be obtained by running scenarios, performing “what if” analyses, and looking at 
historic analogs.  Information provided from these sources should give planners sufficient information to at least start 
thinking about what needs to be done.  Efforts should be made to improve methods for quantifying and displaying 
uncertainties and characterizing the implications for resource management decisions. 
 
Basic Considerations in the Development of Adaptation Strategies 
 
Following is a primer on basic considerations that need to be taken into account when developing adaptation strategies. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10 
Distributional effects.  The effects of climate change will vary by location, sector, and demographic group. Care 
needs to be taken to ensure that adaptation strategies are targeted to address the right problem. As a result, adaptation 
strategies may need to vary from place to place.  For example, experience shows that heat stress disproportionately 
harms the elderly, the young, the poor, and the infirm.  Thus, when developing adaptation strategies, vulnerable 
populations should be targeted.  Another complicating factor relates to distributional effects:  one person’s negative 
impact might be another person’s positive opportunity.  For example, while decreases in snowfall might harm the 
skiing industry, such an outcome would help municipalities save money on snow removal activities. 
 
Multiple stressors.  Several beneficial uses are already under stress from factors that have nothing to do with 
climate change, such as land use and population growth.  Climate change could exacerbate or ameliorate such existing 
stressors, a point that needs to be taken into account when developing adaptation strategies. 
 
Cost.  Many productive activities require funding. Unfortunately, funds are scarce, so resources used for 
adaptation must be diverted from other productive activities.  Until adaptation is recognized as vitally important, other 
projects will be funded first.  For example, in the face of a dramatic problem like AIDS, it is difficult to get the health 
care community to focus on the more insidious and less visible impacts of climate change. 
 
The effectiveness of alternative adaptation strategies.  Adaptation responses vary in effectiveness from place to 
place or across demographic groups.  Also, other stressors may impact the effectiveness of a particular adaptation 
strategy.  Thus, care must be taken to perform a rigorous site-specific assessment of the efficacy of different strategies. 
 In some cases, planners will find that an adaptation strategy needs to be augmented to address community-specific 
challenges.  For example, when trying to identify the most appropriate strategy for preventing heat-stress-related 
deaths, community leaders might have to go beyond issuing heat advisories and set up a buddy system to ensure that 
the elderly are able to get out of their homes and into air-conditioned facilities. 
 
Maladaptation.  Planners must realize that, if poorly designed adaptation measures result in detrimental 
secondary effects, then society might be better off if such measures were not implemented.  For example, the use of 
hatcheries to enhance natural recruitment of fish stocks could alter or impoverish biodiversity and harm the genetic 
pool.  Another example:  Many think pest populations will increase as the climate changes.  Farmers could adapt by 
applying more pesticides, but this will adversely impact water quality. 
 
Multiple benefits.  Some “win-win” measures are sensible to undertake whether or not climate change occurs to 
the full extent anticipated.  These can be described as the “low hanging fruit,” for example:  (1) improving watershed 
management to reduce flood and drought damage and to protect water quality;  (2) removing incentives for practices 
that place people, investments, and ecosystems in harm’s way;  (3) improving water pricing to increase efficient water 
use;  (4) fostering continued adaptation in agriculture;  and (5) establishing surveillance systems for vector-borne 
disease. 
 
While easy to talk about in theory, adaptation is difficult and complex to implement in practice.  Efforts need to 
be made to build a bridge between theory and practice. 
 
Improving Integration of Adaptation into Decisions and Policy 
 
Development and implementation of successful adaptation strategies is imperative now.  Scheraga identified five 
concrete activities that the Water Quality Board could undertake. 
 
Elicit information needs from decision-makers.  In order to develop successful adaptation strategies, the Board 
needs to know who the stakeholders are and what endpoints they hope to achieve.  Workshops and discussion forums 
are a means to:  (1) identify relevant stakeholders; (2) learn more about their needs and issues of concern;  and (3) find 
out how they perceive climate change risks.  Some such work has already been done, for example, the Great Lakes 
Regional Assessment Team has held five workshops with different stakeholder groups, during which participants 
discussed the potential impact of climate change on water levels, lake ecology, agriculture, terrestrial ecology, and 
recreation.  The goal was to determine the type of information the stakeholders need in order to make informed 
decisions. 
 
Better characterize uncertainty for decision-makers and explain the implications of different outcomes. Be clear 
about the uncertainties associated with climate change modeling and invest more effort to quantify uncertainties and 
help decision-makers understand the implications of uncertainty. 
 
 
11 
Develop better decision support tools.  Many policymakers do not know how to account for climate change in 
their day-to-day decision-making processes.  To alleviate this problem, tools need to be developed to help resource 
managers gain a better understanding of:  (1) the potential impacts of climate change;  (2) how climate change fits in 
within the context of other stressors;  and (3) the implications and tradeoffs of different management decisions made 
under uncertainty.  The last will help decision-makers gain a better understanding of what is at stake when they make 
decisions.  Some tools have already been developed, for example, U.S. EPA’s TEAM web-based decision-support tool 
and the hantavirus pulmonary syndrome risk map that is being used in the U.S. southwest to guide decisions about 
public health intervention. 
 
Develop a communication strategy.  The Board should develop a communications strategy with the goal to make 
climate change a “real” issue for Great Lakes basin stakeholders.  Many stakeholders fail to see climate change as a 
salient issue that requires immediate attention.  Others feel powerless to respond because they think climate change is 
too large an issue to tackle.  Efforts need be made to help people understand that they have the ability to anticipate 
changes and implement adaptation strategies that will minimize harm and / or exploit opportunities. Efforts also need to 
be made to break down complex assessment findings into easy-to-understand information. Once stakeholders clearly 
understand projected impacts, they will be ready to sit down and talk about adaptation strategies.  Examples of the 
types of data that could be used to make climate change “real” include (1) pictures depicting changes in ice cover in the 
Gulf of St. Lawrence and (2) graphs that show changes in lake ice break-up dates over time. 
 
Foster the adoption of adaptation strategies.  This process involves six steps:  (1) assess and evaluate potential 
adaptation measures;  (2) choose preferred adaptation methods;  (3) develop action plans;  (4) implement adaptation 
strategy;  (5) monitor the strategy;  and (6) reassess the strategy to determine whether any revisions are required. 
 
Summary of Discussion following Presentation 
 
The U.S. media give the impression that many scientists do not believe that climate change is really occurring. 
Scheraga indicated that, while there are skeptics, they do not represent mainstream scientific opinion – most 
scientists do believe that climate change is occurring and will continue.  This point is rarely disputed. The debate 
focuses more around the rate and magnitude of the impacts that will be realized as a result of climate change and what 
should be done to address the issue. 
 
The white paper lists a number of adaptation strategies.  It would be useful to add information to help decision makers 
better understand which adaptation strategies are the most likely to succeed, for example, a ranking system or 
scale of 3 (high success), 2 (moderate success), or 1 (low success).  Although it is possible to add something to help 
shed light on the utility of different adaptation strategies, it is not possible to provide a detailed ranking system.  Not 
enough is known about different adaptation strategies to say - with any level of certainty - which will perform best. 
 Other factors also make ranking adaptation strategies difficult.  For example, the level of success for a particular 
adaptation strategy could differ by sector.  Also, it is unclear how to measure success. What one person may regard as a 
success could be perceived as a failure to another, for example, water rights.  An economist might perceive success in 
terms of achieving the most efficient allocation of resources, but such an approach could cause social inequities and be 
regarded as a failure to a farmer who depends on the water. 
 
It is important to encourage planners to take climate change into consideration when designing new infrastructure 
systems.  The white paper uses combined sewers as an example to drive home this point, but the example may be 
obsolete.  Canada is no longer designing new combined sewers and probably neither is the United States. However, 
existing systems are still being revamped and expanded.  The important point is that climate change (and the associated 
heavier rainfalls) should be taken into account when these systems are up for redesign. 
 
It is important to periodically reassess adaptation strategies after implementation to determine whether they need to be 
tweaked or improved to increase their utility.  In reality, projects are rarely reassessed because people do not want to 
spend money for such efforts.  Reassessment should be embraced as a key element of a project’s implementation 
strategy.  It would be helpful to generate a strategic plan that provides a long-term road map that outlines a 10-to-20-
year strategy and highlights key implementation steps required along the way.  Reassessment 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12 
could be highlighted as an important step in the process.  Efforts should also be made to educate people about the 
importance of reassessment activities and the negative effects that could result from canceling or delaying 
reassessment. 
 
Increased erosion rates have the potential to dump large quantities of nutrients and toxic materials into the Great Lakes. 
 This should be emphasized and information added to the white paper about adaptation measures to minimize erosion 
during high-intensity rainfall events.  Indeed, runoff will be a bigger problem as the frequency of high-intensity 
rainfalls increases.  In February 2003, U.S. EPA completed a study into the effectiveness of different types of riparian 
buffer zones to reduce sedimentation that may be exacerbated by climate change. 
 
A booklet, Risk Management Guidelines for the Caribbean, was developed to help decision makers there learn how to 
cope with uncertainty and risk in a systematic way.  A similar booklet that discusses risk management guidelines 
should be considered for the Great Lakes region.  However, it is not enough to simply create and distribute 
educational manuals.  Decision makers also need to be equipped with tools that will help them decide on a course of 
action and determine how much intervention to advocate. 
 
It is important to develop probabilistic modeling tools that will help decision makers gain a better understanding of the 
likelihood of different climate change outcomes.  Canadian and U.S. modelers should work together, share data, and 
develop new models for the Great Lakes region.  There is no such emphasis in the United States’ existing Science Plan, 
and Canada does not even have a science plan.  The director of the U.S. Climate Change Science Program is 
championing the effort to incorporate this modeling objective into the U.S. plan.  He hopes to establish two modeling 
centers in the United States to perform scenario development activities. Although the topic is very much in the 
forefront, securing the needed dollars could prove difficult. 
 
An army of professionals helps communities address land-use management issues, watershed management, water 
permitting issues, infrastructure design, and habitat protection issues.  Most of these community-support professionals 
are poorly equipped to address climate change considerations or to promote adaptation strategies, because they have 
not received training and information about these issues.  Thus, it is important to train the people who are actually 
working with communities on a day-to-day level - “train the trainer” as it were.   Workshops and training 
sessions would facilitate the effort.   Indeed, a communication strategy is a critical component to any adaptation 
strategy.  It is critically important to make people understand that climate change is real and is happening now, but it 
can be difficult to convince people that climate change is salient. 
 
The word “adaptation” has a connotation of incrementalism that could give the impression that the effects of climate 
change can be easily managed if small incremental steps are taken to adjust to the changes.  Such an interpretation is 
false.  Adaptation strategies will not fix everything.  It is important that people understand that fundamental change, 
rather than incremental change, is needed to address the effects of climate change.  Further, it is important to identify 
the endpoints that are of concern to different sectors.  Once these are determined, a sensible combination of mitigation 
and adaptation strategies needs to be developed to protect the systems that various sectors care about.  One 
complicating factor is that the effectiveness of regional adaptation policies may depend on what is done at the national 
level.  
The Board and the Commission are in a unique position to examine and publicize sustainability success stories and 
“win-win” adaptation measures. 
 
The IPCC may discuss indicators of the impacts of a changing climate in its next report, but these may only be relevant 
to scientists.  What indicators are important to the public?  It will not be easy to convince people to take immediate 
action to address and adapt to climate change.  Can key indicators be identified that will prompt people to care and 
take action?  A number of indicators might spur the public to action:  deaths, beach closures, negative economic 
ramifications, and water shortages. As unfortunate as it may sound, the public may have to be confronted with such 
negative impacts before it will rally to support a coordinated adaptation strategy.  Optimistically, the public may 
understand the relevance of climate change before dramatic negative impacts are as apparent. For example, in the 
United States, the public is becoming more and more knowledgeable about the issue and some states (e.g. 
Massachusetts) are suing the federal government in an effort to encourage federal officials to place high priority on 
climate change issues.  Public skepticism and the level of emphasis on climate change highlight the importance to 
develop communication materials that clearly link negative impacts, such as death and economic losses, with climate 
change in order to grab the public’s attention.  The IPPC plans to write a chapter on this issue.

SUMMARY OF PLENARY DISCUSSIONS 
 
Environmental Quality Breakout Group Report -- Day 1 
Gail Krantzberg, Facilitator 
 
Better establish the link between climate change and beneficial use impairments.  The Commission must have a 
clear picture of how changes in hydrology, temperature, precipitation, water level, and ice cover could impact 
beneficial uses. 
 
Stress the importance of watershed planning and management.  Scenarios and modelling tools that look at trends 
over time at the watershed level will help decision makers better understand the vulnerabilities of watersheds. 
 
Address the interconnectedness of stressors.  Climate change is just one of many elements stressing the Great 
Lakes.  Additional work is needed on land management planning and modeling to better understand how future land 
management decisions, and the stressors related to them, will impact watersheds in light of a changing climate.  For 
example, communities that strive to address flash flooding and runoff issues will be better positioned to address future 
climate changes. 
 
Emphasize the impact of severe storm events and severe droughts on water quality.  As the frequency of high-
intensity storm events increases, runoff events will increase, combined sewers will overflow more often, and sanitary 
infrastructure will be overtaxed, resulting in more toxins and pathogens entering the Great Lakes and possibly leading 
to higher bacterial counts, more beach closings, and poorer water quality. 
 
Expect the unexpected.  Do not be paralyzed by uncertainty.  Communities need to develop flexible plans that 
can be adapted to changing conditions.  Do not postpone action until the magnitude of impacts is more certain. 
Uncertainty is inevitable and is no excuse for inaction.  “The perfect is the enemy of the good, so let’s get on with it.” 
 
The term “adaptation” implies that humans will be able to live with climate change and continue business as 
usual, once some simple adjustments are made.  This interpretation is false. 
 
 
Ecosystem Health Breakout Group Report — Day 1 
John Gannon, Facilitator 
 
In addition to discussing the first-line effects of climate change, also discuss the next steps, for example, the effects of 
climate change on bioaccumulation and impacts to wildlife. 
 
Perform more research about the impact of climate change on beneficial uses. 
 
Undertake more monitoring and surveillance.  Enlist volunteers to assist. 
 
To help generate public outcry for action, undertake more public outreach to instruct people about the importance of 
the climate change issue. 
 
Changes have already been observed.  For example, the hunting season on Walpole Island has shifted and now 
coincides with when adult ducks raise their young. 
 
More islands are appearing near Walpole Island because the water level is dropping. 
 
Consider climate change when planning ecological restoration activities. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
14 
Combined Environmental Quality / 
Ecosystem Health Breakout Group Report — Day 2 
John Gannon, Facilitator 
 
Highlight success stories.  Promote win-win sustainable success stories.  Focus on systems not originally designed 
with climate change issues in mind.  This will help community members realize that they may be able to tweak existing 
systems to accommodate climate change.  It will convey a “can do” feeling and an understanding of how adaptation for 
climate change could help address other non-climate-change related stressors. Emphasis on win-win situations will help 
instill a feeling of power. 
 
Train the trainers and the implementers about climate change issues. 
 
Tap into the emergency response and the watershed planning communities to promote adaptation strategies. 
 
Take climate change into account when developing habitat restoration programs.  For example, it makes little 
sense to restore a wetland if climate change modeling results indicate that the area is expected to dry up in the future. 
 Such points should be communicated to those who fund habitat restoration programs. 
 
Better understand ecosystem function.  More information about ecosystem vulnerability and resilience to change 
would equip decision makers to target areas that are most vulnerable to negative effects and to intervene in these 
situations. 
 
Communicate research information about vulnerable areas to officials who administer environmental programs. 
For example, it would be beneficial if those who issue water permits had a clear understanding of which areas 
were most likely to experience water loss as the climate changes. 
 
Promote monitoring programs, link the programs to specific indicators and endpoints, and identify champions 
for them. 
 
Promote information sharing.  The lack of communication and collaboration across the border prevents gaining 
a better understanding of ecosystems.  Inventory available information and invest in efforts to learn more about what is 
happening in both countries. 
 
Publicize lessons learned about successful adaptation efforts.  Develop an adaptation portfolio, which includes 
tools, techniques, and real-world examples. 
 
Human Health Breakout Group Report 
Alain Bourque, Facilitator 
 
Human health considerations extend beyond physiological concerns.  Quality of life issues and psychological well 
being are important components. 
 
Consider “exceedences” as well as “extremes.” 
 
Clarify whether “climate change” refers to both naturally induced and anthropogenic-induced effects or just the 
latter. 
 
Better define baseline conditions.  Undertake more monitoring to establish a solid baseline, without which it is 
difficult to predict future impacts. 
 
Increased temperatures will increase biological activity and associated hazards, such as the spread of vector-
borne disease.  Consider also the impact of climate change on food-borne illnesses. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
15 
Consider the changing characteristics of air masses.  Climate change impacts not only temperature but also 
humidity and contaminant concentrations, all of which can have significant health implications. 
 
Discuss the concept of “ecosystem flips.”  Adaptation does not address fundamental changes which can result 
when a threshold is reached;  the result may not be reversible. 
 
Higher temperatures could lead to a more sedentary life style, which could have negative health impacts. 
 
People might be putting too much hope in “the medical solution” as a means to address human health concerns 
related to climate change.  People believe that modern medicine can take care of everything.  When it comes to 
climate change, the medical community will not be able to provide for all who are impacted. 
 
Make climate change more visible in the public eye.  The public needs more information about current climate 
change impacts.  Provide data on the number of lives and dollars lost. 
 
Develop a marketing strategy and education materials for a variety of groups.  There is a need for a variety of 
outreach efforts.  The general public is probably best served by simple and concise messages that emphasize the 
importance of addressing climate change and explain what people can do to help minimize harmful effects.  Win-win 
situations should be emphasized.  For example, a slogan such as “Save energy, save money, save the environment” 
might be effective.  A separate marketing strategy should be developed for decision makers;  it would be useful to find 
a champion to advocate issues.  For industry, emphasize business opportunities that could be realized by developing 
environmentally friendly products. 
 
Develop a sound strategic plan for the Great Lakes basin.  Clearly define important questions, the definitions to 
be used, the partnerships to be tapped into, and the philosophies and values to be adopted.  In addition, take the global 
picture into account and consider space and time scales. 
 
Develop better economic evaluations and better predictive tools. 
 
Municipal / Urban Breakout Group Report 
John Carey, Facilitator 
 
Use a worst-case scenario rather than a best-case scenario when examining the risks associated with climate 
change.  A 2 X CO  scenario is not overly realistic. 
 
Provide urban managers with tools that integrate more robust spatial and temporal scales.  Also provide a better 
understanding of how climate change will affect the frequency and magnitude of extreme events, so that they can 
analyze impacts beyond existing design thresholds.  In turn, managers and users should provide input for the 
development of design scenarios, to ensure that relevant issues are taken into account. 
 
Urban infrastructure is typically in place for long time.  Even if there is agreement that adaptation to climate 
change is necessary, it could take decades to make infrastructure changes.  Further, if a community has a poor 
management system, improvements should be made now to avoid exacerbation of problems resulting from climate 
change.  A municipality’s response to climate change could affect the private sector’s willingness to invest in municipal 
infrastructure. 
 
Prioritize adaptation schemes based on their likelihood of success.  Schemes that aim to protect human health 
and property are more likely to succeed than those that aim to manage ecosystems.  While ecosystems should be 
monitored and efforts made to minimize human impacts on ecosystems, not much can actually be done to manage 
them.  Ecosystems manage themselves.  It is unclear how realistic ecological restoration efforts are. 
 
Consider water temperature elevations in urban tributaries. 
 
Include information on net effects, in addition to just a list of effects.  This would help people understand 
whether effects are additive or cancel each other out. 
 
 
 
 
16 
Further explore impacts to groundwater recharge, a major concern in urban areas.  Consider the impact of 
major events, such as a high-intensity rain falling on frozen ground. 
 
The political will to act is likely tied to a specific event.  High-impact events, such as a catastrophic flood, raise 
awareness about the need for adaptation strategies.  As a result, after such an event, the window of opportunity is open 
to implement an adaptation strategy.  For this reason, it is important to have strategies well thought out and ready for 
implementation at a moment’s notice. 
 
Place more emphasis on identifying true vulnerabilities and actual risk.  Identify vulnerable areas and estimate 
the actual risk of harmful results. 
 
When developing adaptation strategies, determine whether existing systems can be tweaked to address a community’s 
vulnerabilities rather than developing a new system from scratch. 
 
Tap into already-established networks to develop adaptation strategies.  Engineering professionals, health 
providers, bankers, and the insurance industry will all play a role to help communities address the negative impacts of 
climate change.  Engage these sectors. 
 
Identify communities that will be particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, for example, water 
scarcity, and work with them to develop targeted adaptation strategies. 
 
Strengthen non-point source management programs.  Non-point source pollution has been a long-standing 
problem and is likely to become bigger as the climate changes.  Analyze existing non-point source control programs 
and determine how to strengthen and improve them. 
 
Encourage relevant parties to develop probabilistic models and make clear predictions.  The public requires clear 
and concise messages about how the scientific community thinks climate change will impact the Great Lakes basin. 
 Such messages can be provided if probabilistic models and predictive tools are developed. 
 
Connect existing models to better predict the effects of climate change.  For example, connect the regional 
climate model with the water-level model. 
 
Encourage improved data storage practices and the sharing of data.  Some important historical data have been 
lost.  Try to prevent similar losses in the future. 
 
Develop more robust economic forecasts.  When projecting the costs associated with climate change, try to 
calculate the cost of both inaction and action. 
 
Resource / Resource Use Breakout Group Report 
Jim Bruce, Facilitator 
 
More clearly explain how climate change will adversely impact beneficial uses. 
 
Incorporate recently published articles in the white paper and strengthen the information for the agriculture 
section.  Specific references were provided. 
 
Adaptations that are designed to address short-term events will help communities prepare for the long-term 
impacts of global climate change. 
 
Climate change impacts have already been seen.  Drought and extreme temperature events are occurring more 
frequently.  At Walpole Island, there are many cloudless summer days now, a rare event years ago.  The flow of the 
Niagara River has declined since the 1970s, impacting the hydro power industry and forcing greater reliance on coal in 
New York and Ontario.  Seasonal changes are shifting, for example, on Lake Ontario and Lake Erie, the spring rise is 
occurring earlier.  The recreational and tourist industries are suffering from the effects of a warming climate. 
 
 
 
 
17 
Consider changing the hunting and fishing seasons to accommodate changes being seen in the timing of seasonal 
events, such as spawning. 
 
The agricultural sector is already adapting.  For example, chicken farmers are placing ceramic tiles on coop 
roofs to reduce interior temperatures.  But what is the utility of making adaptations that support already unsustainable 
agricultural practices?  There is also a need to consider how crop selection will be impacted by climate change. 
 
From an industry and human population perspective, ensure constant and continued access to high-quality 
water. 
 
High-intensity rainfall events have larger-than-expected impacts on erosion.  Data for the northeastern U.S. in a 
recent Soil and Water Conservation Society report suggest that the frequency of high-intensity and extreme rainfall 
events has increased and that, when precipitation events increase by 10%, erosion increases by 24%.  The concern is 
the huge amount of contaminants entering the water system.  Data are also available for Canada but not yet published. 
 
Consider the potential for maladaptation.  Climate change might increase agricultural pest populations. While 
increased pesticide usage could be an adaptation strategy, this could have negative secondary effects. Collect more 
information on the effects of pesticides before resorting to increased pesticide use. 
 
Develop better regional climate models for the Great Lakes.  Global-scale climate models do not provide detailed 
information about the Great Lakes basin.   Create better regional-scale models to help people in the Great Lakes areas 
gain a better understanding of how climate change could impact lake-effect storms, lake levels, drought frequency, and 
other extreme events. 
 
Examine how climate change will impact the ability to reuse water.  How will changes in the hydraulic cycle 
impact water reuse programs in the Great Lakes? 
 
Develop ready-to-go adaptation action plans.  Borrowing from the disaster mitigation community’s philosophy, 
develop adaptation plans as soon as possible, even if the political support is not in place to support the plan.  There 
would be a public outcry for adaptation if a disaster occurs, and adaptation measures could be implemented 
immediately before political support for such efforts evaporates. 
 
To convince decision makers that adaptation is important, focus on climate change effects that are happening now 
rather than predicted outcomes.  This will help policy makers understand that climate change is a relevant issue 
and that adaptation should be initiated now rather than in the future.  
 
When calculating the costs associated with adaptation measures, also estimate the losses that could be incurred 
if adaptation is not undertaken.  For example, when calculating the cost of expanding an existing storm sewer 
system, also estimate the costs that would be incurred if the investment were not made and flooding events became 
more frequent. 
 
The Great Lakes monitoring network has some weaknesses.  In some parts of the basin, basic data networks are 
in disarray. 
 
Develop a binational research and monitoring strategy.  The Commission should direct its Science Advisory 
Board to develop a science plan for the Great Lakes basin. 
 
Request government funds to fill in knowledge gaps regarding the effects that climate change could have on the 
Great Lakes basin.  Specifically include support for student research and hydrological monitoring. 
 
Review lake level regulation plans.  Try to account for shifts in the seasonal timing of water-level change events 
that have been observed over the last 30 to 40 years. 
 
Review Great Lakes policies through a climate change lens. 
 
 
 
 
 
18 
Develop and distribute risk management guidelines to educate policymakers about climate change and 
adaptation measures. 
 
Focus more attention on erosion management and adaptation measures needed to address the increase in high-
intensity rainfalls.   Work with non-governmental organizations and investor groups. 
 
Encourage governments to examine the impact of climate change on human health. 
 
Provide strong support for an educational program. 
 
Provide information about how likely potential climate change outcomes are in the Great Lakes basin. Use the 
IPPC report to help classify the outcomes of climate change as highly likely, moderately likely, or unlikely. 
 
Walpole Island Breakout Group Report 
Dave White, Facilitator 
 
The aboriginal people of Canada have significant experience with adaptation.  They have been forced to adapt to 
life on smaller and smaller territories and to deal with pollution from upstream sources. 
 
Walpole Island residents have succeeded in maintaining five major ecosystems and protecting about 50 rare and 
endangered species. 
 
Aboriginal people should continue to be involved in workshops and other forums. 
 
Aboriginal people possess a wealth of information and data on ecosystems and rare and endangered species. 
This information is vitally important to the scientific community.  In addition, they possess detailed information 
about their surrounding lands and have a good understanding of the vulnerabilities of different areas and which areas 
are most likely to be impacted by a changing climate. 
 
Aboriginal people offer a clear vision.  Humans are charged with the responsibility to preserve the balance 
between the earth and the sky. When this balance is destroyed, catastrophic problems can emerge.

ADAPTATION STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION 
 
 
Given the importance of implementing a sound adaptation strategy, key points made by the white paper authors are 
synthesized below with insight and advice provided by workshop participants. 
 
A number of common-sense win-win adaptation options were identified, for example: 
• 
Improved watershed management will reduce flood and drought damage and protect water quality 
and human health. 
• 
Removal of incentives for practices that place people, investments, and ecosystems in “harm’s 
way.” 
• 
Improved water pricing to increase efficient water use. 
• 
Continued adaptation in agriculture. 
 
However, if such actions are so sensible to reduce risk and take advantage of opportunities, why have they not been 
implemented?  In reality, there are numerous barriers to adaptation.  A formidable challenge, then, is to improve the 
integration of adaptation to climate change into decision-making, policy formulation, and program implementation.  In 
addition, information and knowledge gaps - such as the impact of climate change on beneficial uses - point out the need 
for research into impacts and potential adaptations, in order to establish or strengthen linkages.  Effective linkages 
require communication and dialogue, which lead to education, outreach, and marketing. 
 
A number of approaches and tools are available.  For example, in 1997 the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Basin Project 
undertook consultations via a binational conference on adapting to the impacts of climate change and variability.  More 
recently, the U.S. Great Lakes Regional Assessment Team and the Canadian Climate Impacts and Adaptation Research 
Network have hosted a series of sector-specific workshops and consultations (Table 3).  Another approach is Ouranos, 
a Québec-based consortium of major stakeholders who have pooled financial, technical, and scientific resources to 
quantify climate change impacts and propose adaptation scenarios suited to their respective needs (see Part 5).

Such initiatives, targeted at interested stakeholders and their constituencies, are intended to: 
 
• 
Identify decision makers. 
• 
Ascertain issues of concern. 
• 
Identify stakeholder perceptions of risk, whether these perceptions are scientifically sound, and 
how the perceptions were formed. 
 
These initiatives, in turn, provide an avenue to: 
 
• 
Characterize uncertainties and explain implications for outcomes of concern to decision makers. 
• 
Communicate climate change impact assessment findings. 
• 
Identify research needs. 
• 
Develop decision support tools. 
 
 
 
 
20 
Communication of assessment findings poses challenges: 
 
• 
The issues are complex. 
• 
Potential consequences and adaptation strategies have many uncertainties. 
• 
Issues are not salient - there is a lag in the occurrence of impacts, and impacts are diffuse. 
• 
There is a sense of powerlessness. 
 
Much of the effort over the past two decades has been to convince people that climate change is an issue.  As a result, 
only a limited number of sectors and stakeholders have effectively changed the way they do business in anticipation of 
future climate change.  There is a continuing need to make climate change real for stakeholders. With increased 
awareness of the sensitivity of outcomes to climate change, stakeholders can effectively change the way they do 
business.  Society is beginning to adapt to impacts, for example, Canadian ports, coastal zone protection, health 
monitoring and surveillance, wildlife migration corridors, and ski resorts. 
 
Decision support tools would help resource managers: 
 
• 
Depict potential impacts. 
• 
Place effects of climate change into context with other stresses. 
• 
Display implications and tradeoffs of alternative management decisions. 
• 
Facilitate decision making under uncertainty. 
 
For example, risk maps can be developed as decision support tools to guide public health interventions, such as for the 
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome outbreak in the southwestern U.S. in 1993, where high-risk areas can now be predicted 
in advance.  U.S. EPA has developed TEAM (Tool for Environmental Assessment and Management), an interactive 
web-based tool to help water resource managers include considerations of climate change in their day-to-day decision 
making, utilizing decision criteria and objectives defined by the user. 
 
Climate change impact assessment will never be “perfect” and without uncertainties, but existing assessments already 
provide timely and useful information for decision-makers and resource managers about potential consequences of 
climate change and possible adaptation strategies.  For example, wastewater conveyance systems can be designed and 
constructed to take account of combined sewer overflows and effects of climate change on precipitation.  Society has 
the opportunity to be anticipatory and proactive, rather than waiting to react in the midst of a crisis.  Decisions will 
have to be made.  Making no decision is equivalent to making a decision, and an informed decision is better than an 
uninformed one.

FORMULATION OF SUGGESTED BOARD ADVICE 
 
 
Dave Ullrich summarized five themes that had emerged from the workshop discussions and presentations. 
 
Promote education, outreach, communication, and marketing efforts to a variety of audiences.  The messages: 
 climate change is a serious issue, communicate success stories, train the trainer, and understand ecosystem functions. 
 
Develop tools.  Integrate climate and lake level models, develop better economic models, and enhance the 
modeling community’s ability to predict the outcomes of global climate change. 
 
Support science.  Ensure that funds are available for student research, promote monitoring, preserve data, and 
identify impacts on beneficial uses. 
 
Develop a strategy for addressing climate change issues.  Have a ready-to-go implementation plan so that 
strategies can be immediately executed when crisis emerges, identify groups that are particularly vulnerable, prioritize 
restoration programs, build in philosophies and values, emphasize partnerships, and be clear about definitions and 
actions. 
 
Implement strategies.  Rather than regarding strategic planning simply as a paper exercise, actually 
implementing strategies is important.  Release a list of easy activities that governments and / or individuals can 
undertake to address climate change. 
 
The Water Quality Board and the Commission have the opportunity (and responsibility) to elevate climate change 
dialogue and to create power where there is currently a sense of powerlessness.  More specifically, the Board and the 
Commission can help people understand that climate change is real and happening now, and help the public realize that 
it has the ability to act in ways that will minimize the negative impacts of climate change. 
 
Workshop participants suggested additional points.  Dave White suggested the Board explore and acknowledge the 
traditional ecological knowledge that First Nation people possess.  In many cases, aboriginal people can provide 
important insight about vulnerable areas.  He cited the example about the Inuit school that was buried by an avalanche -
- aboriginal people knew that the school was located in an unstable location and had advised against building there. 
 The advice was not heeded, however.  White advised merging aboriginal knowledge with Western science.  By 
collaborating, it would be possible to obtain a more complete picture of what is happening and would empower policy 
makers to make better decisions.  Others strongly supported White’s suggestion.  John Carey felt that there is too much 
emphasis on modeling and not enough on observational knowledge, traditional knowledge, and monitoring efforts.  A 
greater effort should be made to collect information from aboriginal communities as well as community-level 
emergency response managers.  We should break the dependence on modeling techniques as the basis for risk 
assessment and planning.  Jim Bruce said that the benefits offered from modeling efforts should not be downplayed. 
 John Lenters said that observational knowledge and modeling are both very important and complement each other. 
 
George Kuper thought that the five outlined themes did not provide an in-depth approach.  He advised a focus around 
the idea of a robust risk assessment and risk management process.  This would help risk managers make good decisions 
about how to address climate change issues.  In the process of performing the risk assessment, a variety of stakeholders 
would become involved and educated about climate change and adaptation issues.  Milt Clark said that that enough 
information is already available to move forward with decision making.  Waiting for a risk assessment would delay 
important decision-making activities for 10 to 20 years.  Others agreed.  
 
The white paper authors - Marianne Alden, Linda Mortsch, and Joel Scheraga - were thanked for the great effort they 
had put into the paper’s development, for the impressive product, and their clear description of the content in their 
presentations.  Georges Beauchemin was thanked for his insight about climate change from a client or user perspective. 
 All participants were thanked for freely sharing their views and insights over the course of the workshop.  The 
breakout group facilitators and recorders were thanked for ensuring that the key discussion points were captured and 
shared with all.  Lastly, Christ Hartnett of ERG, Inc. was thanked for logistical support, including recording of the 
workshop.  All the advice received would be taken into consideration in preparing the revised white paper (the nature 
and scope of the changes made are described above) and to formulate the Board’s advice to the Commission.

PART 5 
CROSS BORDER TOOLS AND STRATEGIES 
 
Presentation by Georges Beauchemin 
at the Climate Change Workshop 
May 28, 2003 
 
BIOGRAPHY 
 
Georges Beauchemin has been a public servant with the province of Québec for 25 years.  He began his career in 
1977 as an urban planner with the Ministère des affaires municipales.  He is very familiar with the issues and the 
impacts of climate change.  In 1996, as the assistant secretary for the Conseil executif, Georges served as the inter-
departmental coordinator for the reconstruction and the economic recovery of the Saguenay flood disaster area.  In 
1999, he was given the task of responding to the ice storm that hit eastern Ontario and western Québec and, in 2000, he 
was called upon to respond to the avalanche in the Inuit village of Kangiqsualujjuaq, Québec.  Georges is currently the 
director general of municipal affairs in the Québec Department of Public Security.  He is also the chair of Ouranos, a 
consortium created in 2002 by the province of Québec, Hydro-Québec, and the Meteorological Service of Canada to 
promote the acquisition of expertise to advance the understanding of regional climate change and of its environmental, 
social, and economic impacts.  The consortium brings together government ministries, universities, associations, 
foundations, and other organizations in order to develop the expertise and the strategies necessary to mitigate the 
impacts of climate change.   Georges’ presentation looks at climate change from a client or user perspective and, as 
such, provides insight for the organization of governance structures to address the issue.  For information about 
Ouranos, see:  http://www.ouranos.ca . 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
When I received the invitation to address this workshop, I was perplexed.  The invitation asked me to do a presentation 
on extreme events.  However, upon reflection, I concluded that the climate change adaptation issue -- this story line -- 
is not event based.  Climate change is an extreme situation which we are facing and must focus on.  In reading all the 
IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) reports and other climate change reports, I found that most of the 
adaptation issues that we have to deal with relate one way or another to water, that water is the common denominator. 
 
In August 2002, Montréal city officials who manage the potable water intake for the city called Ouranos in a panic. 
 The Montréal water system is old and outdated, and it leaks.  The official figure is that around 30 to 40% of the water 
is lost to the ground.  But the panic was not about this issue.  Rather, the water level in the St. Lawrence River was so 
low that they could not get the bulk of the water into the plant, and the emergency pipe was inoperable.  The officials 
responsible for Montréal’s infrastructure debated whether to advance an emergency water intake project or to repair the 
leaky pipes.  Finally, they decided to do neither.  With the water level in the St. Lawrence today, we would probably 
need precipitation 200% above normal during the coming months just to avoid this happening again.  Before, they had 
to instruct Canada Packers and others to close down.  And it will happen again. 
 
RISKS 
 
Climate change is not a question of in the future -- it is already there.  One of the basic ideas in the white paper (in Part 
3) is risk.  Consider information that has become available since IPCC’s latest report, such as this report by the Hadley 
Climate Centre.  Scientists are telling stakeholders like myself what we read in Figure 1.  There

will be damage and it will be long-lasting.  Greenhouse gas emissions are on the rise, basically because we have not 
uncoupled economic growth with energy consumption, which produces a lot of greenhouse gases. 
 
Figure 1 
 
Today’s world is depicted in Figure 2.  Our region -- the Great Lakes / St. Lawrence community -- has around 
70 million people connected to the watershed.  The top shows where people in the world live today.  The bottom is the 
night-time energy picture today.  It is only natural that, during the coming years, people in Asia would like to shine as 
much in the dark as we do at night.  That is a big issue for the world.

Figure 2

The U.S. Department of Energy’s latest outlook, just published, has a chapter that shows CO2 emissions for the 
next 25 years.  Figure 3 shows that levels are very high and are going higher. 
 
Figure 3 
 
Figure 4 gives an idea of the picture from 1971 to 2020.  People argue about greenhouse gas mitigation.  Look at the 
graph without Kyoto, with Kyoto, and with Kyoto should the U.S. join.  The main story is that most of the greenhouse 
gases will not come from North America.  Rather, the big issue is that they will come from south-east Asia and China 
over the coming century. Figure 4 
 
 
3 
The bar charts in Figure 5 are very useful to understand what is coming.  I have captured the issue by asking, What is 
our final destination?  If we think about mitigation as doing 1, 2 or 3 Kyoto’s, we are actually not sending an amount of 
carbon into the atmosphere.  The bars on the left show how much proven coal, gas, and oil reserves we have.  Should  
we, as a species, wish to burn it, the bars indicate the amount that we would actually put into the atmosphere, compared 
to what we have released so far.  It is what we call 1 X CO2 basically, the natural level around 1750.  One can argue 
whether it is 1800 or 1750, but it does not matter very much. 
 
Today we are basically at 1.3 X and the scenarios on the right side of Figure 5 -- the IPCC report calls these stress 
scenarios -- show story lines for what the future might look like.  Consider these story lines and the driving forces 
behind them.  Should we decide that we are not going to argue about this issue as a species and as countries, the bars 
indicate the best and worst scenarios we would reach.  These bars indicate the amount of CO  we can release into the 
air.  These story lines incorporate population, economic, environment, equity, and other scenarios.  The best-case 
scenario is 2 X CO .  When we look at the International Energy Outlook, that is exactly the scenario which we are on 
track for today.  So, doing mitigation actions on greenhouse gases -- whether inside Kyoto or outside Kyoto -- does not 
matter.  It is simply irrelevant.  It is the amount that counts. 
 
An analogy.  Should you wish to NOT go to a particular destination, understand that because of the long life of 
greenhouse gases, once you have taken the subway from station No. 1 you will reach station No. 2 and then No. 3.  If 
you want to stop at No. 3 you will have to hold it back at No. 1 for quite a long time.  It is not the actual concentration 
over 100 years.  It is 120 years later, and it does not matter there.  So, the global picture is basically doing at least 10 
times the reduction in Kyoto with the United States included, and those who manage those kinds of issues are who win. 
 And it is a certitude that we are going to have to adapt, too.

What does that mean?  I work for public security.  I address all sorts of things, like climate change, disasters, 
avalanches, and now al-Qaida has been added to our plate.  But basically we are risk managers.  When we look at risk, 
we want to understand the assumptions that scientists are making.  What do you know and what are you not telling me 
that I should know and need to know?  This is what is most important to us.  Consider the atmospheres in Figure 6.  1.3 
X CO2  is today’s familiar atmosphere.  It is the climate we know or, rather, we think we know.  If the story line 
projects 2 X CO2 , it is like having 2.3 times today’s energy content unleashed over our heads.  It is the new climate 
that we do not really know very well.  4 X CO2  is a totally different story. It is non-linear, unknown.  Do not ask a 
professional climate modeller to model 4 X CO2 .  He will say, you’re crazy.  It is non-linear.  I do not know what’s 
going to happen.  It is the black box. 
Figure 6 
 
 
We are learning more about carbon cycling.  This will be a topic in the next IPCC report.  Figure 7 is a British carbon 
cycle modelling study published in October 2002.  Basically, it says that temperature has a very high influence. 
Temperature determines the amount that the oceans will take in as a carbon sink, and the biggest sink is not the 
Amazon forest, not the boreal forest, not the pasture land.  It is the ocean.  And it slows down.  What it means for us is, 
we thought that if we did 10 Kyoto’s in the next 100 years, we would reach 2.8 X CO2   In fact, we have to do it in 50 
years to reach the target of 2 X CO2 .  That is an even bigger challenge to stop arguing about and start doing something 
about.  
Figure 7

The catch 22 is captured in Figure 8.  2 X CO2 is the best case scenario.  But a risk manager does not want to plan with 
the best case scenario.  Because of that, it is a very risky scenario.  If I believe what scientists write and what I read, 
and I ask questions, worse climate scenarios are in the making.  They may well be more probable, but they are a lot 
riskier.  What kind of strategy should we adopt in view of such risks, and what strategy for the Great Lakes and the St. 
Lawrence River? 
Figure 8 
 
 
We have wrestled with this inside the Québec government for the last year and half.  Ouranos was asked to do the 
opening at the parliamentary commission on how to implement Kyoto.  We were successful in having the government 
recognize that Québec’s strategy will have to be to do both (Figure 9).  Stop the argument about mitigation or 
adaptation.  These two different crowds will have to talk to one another and will have to act together because one 
interacts with the other.  From what we see coming from scientists, there is no other choice.

OPPORTUNITIES 
 
Luc Crépeault makes two key points: 
 
1. 
“The key element for adaptation strategies is knowledge.” 
 
2. 
“The poorer you are, the more you need to know.” 
 
He is my boss and he believes it.  Ouranos would not have gone as far as it has without him pushing us in the right 
direction.  We need to direct more resources to knowledge and expertise because we are going to need it as users and 
stakeholders. 
 
Ouranos is a consortium of major stakeholders Figure 10 that brings together financial and technical resources, and 
technical includes people.  Eight Québec government departments put money where their mouth is, along with Hydro-
Québec;  Environment Canada, both headquarters and the Québec region;  VRQ which, like CFCAS, provided some 
seed money;  UQÀM which does the Canadian regional climate model;  McGill University;  Université Laval;  INRS. 
 Ouranos has a new financial collaboration with British Columbia.  In an agreement with Meteo France, they will, free 
of charge, provide regional scenarios for North America using their model.  This will allow us to compare their 
projections with the Canadian regional model.  Through CFCAS, Ouranos is working with other stakeholders on future 
partnerships.

We are located in Montréal.  No, there is no sign on the building, as implied in Figure 11.  At the beginning, we 
discussed whether Ouranos should be virtual or real.  We decided that it has to be real for people to believe in. We need 
a physical place for people to meet and talk, because at least   of the business is done in the corridors -- not done in the 
computer room, not in the office, in the corridors.  We need corridors in order for people to interact with one another. 
 It is informal, it is non-aggressive -- that is how people interact. 
 
Figure 11 
 
 
Ouranos today has a facility of around 65 - 70, and next fall we will reach capacity at around 90.  Ouranos has a small 
super-computer facility running the Canadian regional climate model.  The meteorological office has a faster computer, 
but it is used for weather and is shut down twice a day.  We need a dedicated computer, and we have our corridor for 
discussion. 
 
Ouranos invests in science in order to get tools for decisions.  We try our best to invest in our own people but, if they 
cannot do the job and we need the answer, we will buy it, wherever it is.  We were asked, why should we invest in the 
Canadian regional climate model if you turn to Hadley or another one?  That’s the bottom line.  We will get the answer 
wherever it is, because we need the answer. 
 
We need tools and we need scenarios, because that is the way that Ouranos plans and acts.  We discuss with 
stakeholders, based on assumptions and scenarios.  We are risk takers, so that is the usual way of doing business.  We 
are interested in both climate change and climate variation, because that is how climate change is going to behave. 
 Changes in natural variability will occur.  We have to understand that.  If it results in an avalanche, it matters not 
whether it is related to climate change or climate variation.  It is still an avalanche, and it still kills people.  My job is to 
get them out of there. 
 
As shown in Figure 12, Ouranos is structured by projects.  That means a coordinator who we call the champion. For an 
issue, find a natural champion who everybody is looking at and convince him to undertake leadership. Ouranos will 
supply some paid personnel.  We ask the stakeholders, if they believe in the project, to provide their own dedicated 
personnel for the project, also institutional personnel from universities.  Ouranos has started 14 projects since last 
September, with a workforce of around 250 people.   This looks huge, but it is actually only 10% of what we feel will 
be needed.  We will need a tenfold increase just to try and understand what kind of risk we will have to decide upon.

Figure 12 
We were talking about the box -- outside the box, inside the box, the black box.  Consider Québec’s exposure to 
climate change outside of the box, depicted in Figure 13.  First, the loss of economic and geopolitical attractiveness of 
the carbon-intensive St. Lawrence / Great Lakes / Mississippi corridor. 
 
 
Figure 13 
Consider the Prairies.  The price of corn went crazy last summer because of the drought.  The people doing agricultural 
insurance for Québec did not see it coming.  Québec produces a lot of pork -- pork is actually corn on feet -- if we 
cannot predict drought, the insurance cost will go crazy, because there is no magic bucket for money. 
 
Hudson’s Bay is a huge issue.  Nobody understands Hudson’s Bay future behaviour.  This is an inland sea the size of 
the Gulf of Mexico.  The last time a scientific team studied this body of water was in the 1960s.  There

is a report that will get the attention of leaders and lobbyists over the coming years.  The report proposes the Grand 
Canal.  The main assumption is that there is no biological life in Hudson’s Bay, so it is not worthwhile protecting.  The 
Grand Canal would raise the water level of the Great Lakes by diverting water, then pumping or pushing water out of 
the Great Lakes and down the Mississippi River.  This is a solution in the minds of some people, and they are ready to 
put their money on it. 
 
The Labrador Sea, contrary to normal wisdom about climate change, is cooling.  We have over fished the cod, but 
salmon are dying because of cooler water.  For Québec, this means that we are a peninsula surrounded by water with a 
very cold signal at our doorstep.  This is a big issue and I would like to know the consequences. 
 
The Great Lakes do not have coastal erosion and rising sea levels, but Québec does.  In fact, Québec seems to capture 
just about everything about climate change.  
 
The issue in the northeast is energy demand and weather extremes.  Last year, we negotiated and signed a compact of 
mutual assistance in times of disaster among the premiers and the governors of New England, Québec, New 
Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland.  This is the type of new thinking the decision-
makers have to rely on.  The compact gives me the authority to call the National Guard of New York or Maine to come 
into Québec and help us with an ice storm or whatever.  The compact went through the U.S. Congress.  We in Québec 
get called to go to Massachusetts and repair hydro lines.  Why?  Because Hydro-Québec has 800 teams ready to roll 
anytime.  My main line of business is security and, if we are going to have more major events, it would make sense to 
sign more such agreements, and we are considering such an expansion with Ontario. 
 
Lastly, with the rest of the United States, we have other climate-related issues -- water, insurance costs going up -- 
because of the increasing number of big events. 
 
Let us look now inside the box of Québec.  We have divided the province into four sub-regions, as shown in Figure 14. 
 In the Arctic, we have polar bears and Inuit.  The Inuit eat polar bears -- sometimes the polar bears eat the Inuit.  They 
need an ice shelf to capture the seals.  The avalanche in Ungava was a freak event that killed nine people.  The 
community was having its New Year’s party in the school gym, the only facility big enough. The gym was built beside 
a cliff.  When the avalanche struck after midnight, we were lucky because half of the people had already left.  The gym 
was filled with two metres of snow with people buried underneath.  If that school had been hit on a school day, we 
would have lost 100 kids.  The next summer, we moved   of the village. Twelve thousand truckloads just to do new 
streets, $35 million just for one freak event.  We never thought that we would have avalanches in Québec.  We have 
hills, not the Rockies or the Alps.  We had to find experts for these kind of hills in Russia and Norway just to 
understand why “gentle slopes” are actually more dangerous to avalanches because people are not aware of how far the 
snow will go. 
 
The vast central area is where Québec produces power and timber.  In the maritime region we are seeing coastal 
erosion like crazy.  The shore is sand or clay.  We have people calling and telling us that the shore moved 30 feet 
during a storm and that it is now so close to the church or whatever.  We have to start doing something.  If the sea level 
is rising, perhaps the answer is to move some of the villages, because we will not win against rising seas.  We have to 
plan ahead and start educating mayors and politicians to understand the issues.  In the south of Québec, it is just like in 
the Great Lakes -- every issue that you can imagine. 
 
For climate change or variability, we must consider the economy, health and safety, environment and conservation, and 
system dynamics, as shown in Figure 15.  Apart from the Arctic, everything we are trying to put together is very useful, 
because a lot of economic assets are vulnerable to climate change (Figure 16).  Regarding the fishery, the cod are 
already gone, and the next in line are shellfish, because of colder water and bad management.  Water temperature plus 
bad management can create havoc on a resource.

Québec shares concerns about impacts and adaptation with its neighbours (Figure 17). 
Figure 17 
 
Figure 18 shows how electricity is produced in North America.  The black, white, and grey are CO2 based. The red is 
nuclear and the blue is the hydro.  We use a lot of coal to produce electricity.  Regardless of one’s opinions, the Great 
Lakes region is basically a region of cities with very carbon-dependent economic clusters. We use coal, we use steel so 
we can have cars which, in turn, use petroleum.  There is a huge issue on CO2 management that will impact the Great 
Lakes region.  Whether one likes it or not, it is there: Figure 18 
12 
The picture in Figure 19 is in the Canada Steamship Lines lobby.  Agriculture is how they pay for the ship.  We can 
expect a decline in the amount of cargo available for carriage.  With a one degree increase in temperature, there will be 
at least 17% decline in corn and soybean crop yields in the United States.  And look at how the grain belt in Canada has 
been impacted by repeated droughts over the several last years. 
Figure 19 
 
 
If one is a stakeholder managing the assets of a company and is concerned about exports and imports, you have an issue 
with climate change policies, climate change itself, and lower water (Figure 20). 
Figure 20 
13 
Figure 21 depicts the exposure of the U.S. side of the Great Lakes and Seaway to climate change.  Note that salt is used 
to melt the ice off the roads, so is climate related.  Grain is climate related, but it represents only 5 - 6% of shipping. 
 Basically, the driver is CO2 policies, which will impact the Great Lakes, and everybody is going to be impacted by the 
same thing -- water levels. 
Figure 21 
 
Inside the white paper and in the report by the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Ecological Society of America 
are a lot of important issues (Figure 22).  I am not suggesting that we focus on only one issue.  Quite a number of them 
are important.  My point is that the water level of the Great Lakes is probably the one that captures most of them, 
indirectly or directly. 
Figure 22  
 
 
 
          14 
The United Kingdom’s climate impact program has published a paper which describes how decision-makers plan and 
work, if it is to be done in a professional mode (Figure 23).  One needs to identify the problem and establish the criteria 
by which one will reach a decision.  To do that, one will do a merry-go-round quite a few times.  If that has been well 
done, then the decision will be implemented, followed by monitoring and starting over again.  If the biggest problem is 
water levels, we will have to focus on that. 
Figure 23 
 
RESPONSES 
I am personally convinced that our only true added value in what we do is with brains and data, will and expertise, that 
is, our responsibility to put together the impetus and start talking to decision-makers that it happened. 
 
When we talk about adaptation, there are three kinds of audiences (Figure 24), but one cannot produce the same 
material for all of them, and putting everyone under the same cover does not work.  Nobody is satisfied with the 
product, because of that.  It is a basic marketing issue.

Ouranos is basically focusing on the third group (Figure 25) because these are the people who want to know.  It matters 
not to them whether it is climate change or variability, whether it is Kyoto or something else, what they want is the 
bottom line.  Can you get your act together and give me the bottom line?  To do that, one must do a quantitative 
assessment (Figure 26). 
Figure 25 
 
Figure 26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
16 
The way we are doing it with Hydro-Québec is with the dynamic Canadian region climate model, which is a 
downscaling technique of global circulation models (GCMs) (Figure 27).  For example, one will to have to do 
an economic analysis of electric demand, tailored to their needs and it will not be public. 
Figure 27 
 
Accept and live by the standard that some of this work will not reach the public stage.  If we do not provide 
what they want, they will buy it from somebody else who will.  There are people in the re-insurance business or 
Standard & Poors asking these questions of all the hydro utilities.  Are they going to have the water they say 
they are going to have?  This means that we have to understand the concerns of the user, and that can only be 
done with a partnership (Figure 28). 
Figure 28  
 
 
 
  17 
We know that water levels are our biggest risk in terms of financial exposure in Québec.  Advance weather and climate 
knowledge is a hedge against such risk, so it makes sense to invest in climate modeling (Figure 29). 
Figure 29 
 
We have gone from the theoretical to the experimental on climate scenarios with the Canadian regional climate model 
(Figure 30).  Ouranos is trying to move to the operational stage over the next two years.  Operational means that we 
will do multiple runs, check them, put them into users’ hands and tell them the truth about the model.  They need to 
know whether it is good, bad, grey, what shade of grey.  Europeans are already doing probabilistics.  We can as well, 
but we will need a 10-year time lapse, a 10-15 fold increase in brains, people, data, and dedicated super-computer.  The 
computer is the least of the worry and not an issue, as they have become a commodity and are becoming cheap.

Only two consortiums are investing in nested models and dynamical downscaling -- Prudence in Europe and Ouranos. 
 Figure 31 shows the window each is modeling.  Perhaps one day the two will merge.  Some future partnerships are 
going into that direction.  One drives inside the box with the data from a GCM -- whether it is Canadian, Hadley, or 
another does not matter (Figure 32).  The model has its own climatology inside the box, and the model is high 
resolution.  To date, it has been 45 by 45 km, but it can set it at any level, if one is ready to pay.  Figures 33 and 34 are 
the windows that Ouranos is modeling.  In order to understand the climate in one particular area, which is my main 
concern, scientists tell me I need to model a much larger area, so I am doing part of the job for Canada and the United 
States.

Figure 35 shows the size of every cell that Ouranos is modeling.  Each is 29 km high and stratified to 35 layers. 
Compared to the GCM we will have a lot more detail, the first of which should be available in 2004.  Ouranos 
is modeling with the previous stress scenario because the data were available in IS92A.  It will take 15 months 
of computer time to get the results.

Figure 35 
 
Consider the two sides of the border (Figure 36).  The United States has decided to undertake greenhouse gas 
mitigation outside of Kyoto -- no problem with that for me.  However, I am concerned about Canada.  The U.S. has a 
science plan -- whether one likes it or not -- scheduled for June 25, 2003.  Canada does not, and Canada signed Kyoto, 
which requires us to have one (Figure 37).

Canada has another problem -- insufficient data.  Figure 38 shows weather and climate stations.  When one thinks 
about the size of the window to model, we will need data.  There are stakeholders who say that we do not need a 
meteorological office because we have the weather channel -- and they believe it.  Some of the issues we have to 
address with major stakeholders is that some of the assumptions are totally wrong and it is our responsibility to address 
them.  In the meantime, we can try alternative solutions such as small airplanes (Figure 39). There is also the need to 
monitor vertically (Figure 40).  Figure 41 depicts the size of the network needed to do a good job.  The Great Lakes are 
going to be acting like a heat sink (Figure 42).  We will have to monitor water temperatures.  It can be done very 
inexpensively.

IN A NUTSHELL 
 
Figure 43 indicates that there are some climate-independent decisions, and there are some climate-influenced or climate 
adaptation decisions.  In my view, the Great Lakes / St. Lawrence system falls in the latter for a number of issues.  We 
also know from past studies that climate variations do not move in a very linear pattern (Figure 44).  The variations 
move in steps.  One of our biggest issues is that we are managing the Great Lakes on a weekly basis, which is not bad, 
but we should be looking on a yearly basis, because that is where the added knowledge for adaptation truly lies.  In my 
view, we would all benefit from cross-border strategic thinking for the next 5-10 years as to where we would want to be 
regarding practical climate science (Figure 45).  In my view, users will be pushing for probable rather than 
deterministic and for combined adaptation (Figure 46). The International Joint Commission may be a suitable 
mechanism.  Ouranos and others are ready to start linking resources, models, computers to do this.  Thank you.

DISCUSSION 
 
Question.  What was the situation or context in Québec that allowed the Québec government to take action? 
 
Beauchemin.  Part of it was timing and part was people.  By timing, we had the Saguenay flood, the ice storm, 
and the avalanche.  The Prime Minister asked, How are you managing the Saguenay flood?  Do you need any more 
help?  Do you have everything you need?  He was also tacitly asking, Why did it happen?  Manitoba was struck by 
massive floods in 1970.  The basic line of reasoning was the responsibility to do something, and that it was up to civil 
servants to take up the challenge to meet the leaders and tell them what to do.  Here is where it is coming from and this 
is what we should be doing. 
 
The other assumption was that we would have water in the hydro reservoirs for ever, but it is not there.  The GCM 
story line was that we would have 20% more water, but we actually have 40% less.  Then what good is that model? 
 The only way to answer the question is to invest time and money into understanding what these things are all about.   It 
was a coming together of basic interests and also the fact that we have to think outside of the box.  Like smashing 
airplanes into buildings to produce a mass effect, we are not used to this kind of thinking but, as stakeholders, we are 
challenged to start thinking in that mode.  When one reads the story line behind climate --  I have to address climate 
and I have to, as a department, tell Environment and Natural Resources to stop quarreling and work together in my own 
government. 
 
Question.  Can we attribute the loss or the recovery of the fishery to climate change? 
 
Beauchemin.  One never sees an official statement but, if you ask the person who is doing the study, there is no 
doubt that over-fishing killed the industry, and it still is.  An article in a recent issue of Nature or Science reported that 
90% of the big fish were over-fished.  Nobody is managing the resource sensibly.  But hardships are never alone.  The 
story behind water temperature is also there, and that has basically erased all possibility of that species getting back on 
its feet because, in those areas, the fish are so stressed by water temperature that they do not grow enough, and other 
species are moving in, but basically we’re managing on images.  The next in line to go will be shellfish.  We are over-
fishing shellfish.  We know what the water temperature is, and water temperature is crucial for such species, but we are 
not used to thinking in that mode.  We invest money in aquaculture.  We have focused on fisheries and not on oceans. 
 Europe is monitoring the Atlantic temperature-wise on an operational basis.  We should be doing the same with our 
waters.  
 
Question.  One could characterize many of your examples as low probability and high impact, which are likely 
impossible to model.  Yet, are any projections or comparisons possible? 
 
Beauchemin.  So far, we have been operating in an emergency mode, but we are not getting our dollar’s worth 
so that -- if the story line is true -- we need to move into a prevention mode.  What risk do I take in putting $3 million a 
year into prevention, compared to money spent on an emergency where money does not count?  As a stakeholder, are 
you willing to make this investment?  Sewer design is already outdated, based on the old assumptions that we are 
presently using.  If we are to spend wisely, the money that we are putting into infrastructure should be based on larger 
values. 
 
Question.  The issue of combined sewers is a good example of designing for a given capacity such as a 100-year 
event.  If, indeed, with climate change we will have less frequent but more intense events, how can we predict the 
volume and how do we design sufficient capacity? 
 
Beauchemin.  I do not know the technical answer, but people do know how to do it, and we will have to undertake 
that kind of process.  As decision-makers, we have to identify our criteria and the level of confidence in those criteria to 
meet the challenges before us.  That is the decision-makers’ responsibility.  What we are designing today is based in 
part on what people are whispering in our ear.  That is no good.  If we design a car or a chemical that goes into the 
human body, are you liable?  It is the same kind of issue here.  You will be liable. 
 
Moderator.  Thank you again for a thought-provoking and challenging presentation.
