Abstract
Inﬂuencing factors, and variations and trends of Antarctic ozone hole in recent decades are analyzed, and sudden
change processes of ozone at Zhongshan station and the eﬀect of atmospheric dynamic processes on ozone changes are
also discussed by using the satellite ozone data and the ground-measured ozone data at two Antarctic stations as well
as the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data.
The results show that equivalent eﬀective stratospheric chlorine (EESC) and
stratospheric temperature are two important factors inﬂuencing the ozone hole. The column ozone at Zhongshan and
Syowa stations is signiﬁcantly related with EESC and stratospheric temperature, which means that even though the
two stations are both located on the edge of the ozone hole, EESC and stratospheric temperature still played a very
important role in column ozone changes, and mean while veriﬁes that EESC is applicable on the coast of east Antarctic
continent. Decadal changes in EESC are similar with those of the ozone hole, and inter-annual variations of ozone are
closely related with stratospheric temperature. Based on the relation of EESC and ozone hole size, it can be projected
that the ozone hole size will gradually reduce to the 1980’s level from 2010 to around 2070. Of course there might exist
many uncertainties in the projection, which therefore needs to be further studied.

1 Introduction
Since the mid-1980s, scientists in Japan and the
United Kingdom [Chubachi, 1984; Farman et al., 1985]
have successively found that the total amount of at-
mospheric ozone observed in the Antarctic station in
spring (from September to November) was decreased
by 30%–40% compared with the value ten years ago;
later, the American scientists conﬁrmed the existence
of ozone hole over the Antarctic in spring with the
satellite data [Stolarski et al., 1986]; since then, the
observation of the ozone hole and the research of its
formation mechanism have become hot issues at home
and abroad. From the space point of view, the ozone
hole over the Antarctic appears to the south of 60◦S.
It is the low-value area of ozone within the polar vor-
tex and the high-value area outside the vortex. From
the time point of view, the total amount of ozone over
the Antarctic drops suddenly and dramatically dur-
ing September and October each year, forming a low-
value period. The existing main research [Lu et al.,
1997] hold that, the Antarctic ozone hole is the result
of the joint action of the atmospheric dynamics and
the atmospheric chemical processes. The reason for a
large number of ozone depletion is closely related to
the
unique
geography
and
climatic
environment
in
the
Antarctic
as
well
as
the
atmospheric
circulation, particularly the polar vortex activities

in the stratosphere. It is unable to fully explain the
formation of the ozone hole in the Antarctic with
the atmospheric dynamics, solar activity, atmospheric
chemistry and other individual factors. The Antarctic
ozone hole size is mainly aﬀected by chlorine (Cl) and
bromine (Br) in the stratosphere, followed by the tem-
perature inside the polar vortex [Newman and Nash,
2005; Newman et al., 2006]. The inter-annual change
of the Antarctic ozone is inﬂuenced by the planetary
waves and polar temperature [Huck et al., 2005]. At
present, many studies [Lu et al., 1997; Hofmann et al.,
1997; WMO, 2003] suggest that the Antarctic ozone
will recover to the level before 1980, but due to many
existing uncertainties, it needs further research. China
established the observation station of the total ground-
level ozone with the internationally advanced Brewer
ozone spectrophotometer in Zhongshan station in the
Antarctic in 1993 and has obtained the continuous
data [Zheng et al., 1995]. In order to know the ver-
tical structure of the ozone hole over the Zhongshan
station, 12 ozone sondes were released during Septem-
ber and November in the same year to obtain the par-
tial pressure proﬁle of the atmospheric ozone [Kong
et al., 1996].
In addition, 56 times of atmospheric
ozone sounding were carried out in Zhongshan station
from February 2008 to February 2009, which laid a
foundation for the analysis of the troposphere, strato-
spheric structure and seasonal variation characteris-
tics of ozone in the Antarctic.
The research of the
spatial and temporal variation characteristics of ozone
in the Antarctic shows that the average total ozone
has a clear decreasing trend [Zhou and Lu, 1998; Zhou
et al., 1997]. The ozone depletion in the South Pole
is the severest with a decrease of 6% every 10 years.
The decreasing rate slows down with the latitude. The
total atmospheric ozone in Zhongshan station shows a
big change by the day, which is associated with the
changes of the intensity and central position of the
polar vortex. The total amount of ozone begins to de-
crease from September. The minimum generally oc-
curs in October and the largest area of ozone loss is
between 13 and 23 km [Zheng et al., 1995; Kong et al.,
1996; Guo et al., 1997].
Based on the ozone observations by the spec-
trophotometer in the Antarctic station, the ozone data
by satellite detection and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis
data, and with reference to the chloride and bromide
parameters in the Ozone Assessment Report by the
World Meteorological Organization [WMO, 2006], this
paper analyzes the key factors aﬀecting the Antarctic
ozone changes and the changing trends to provide a
reference for further assess the ozone’s role in climate
change.
Nonlinear regression method is used to es-
tablish the statistical relationship between the ozone
hole size and equivalent eﬀective stratospheric chlo-
rine (EESC) and the stratospheric temperature during
1980–2008.
2 Information and method
The total ozone detected by satellite in this paper
is during September 7 and October 13 from 1980 to
2008. The stratospheric temperature for calculation is
the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data in the same period.
The total ground-level ozone in the mainland coast of
the Southeast Antarctic is the observation materials
observed day by day by spectrometer in Zhongshan
station (1993–2008) and Syowa station (1980–2007).
It should be noted that Dobson spectrometer is used
in Syowa station for the observation of the total ozone
and Brewer spectrometer is used in Zhongshan station.
Two spectrometers have been identiﬁed by WMO with
high accuracy. Stratospheric temperature is the av-
erage data of 50 hPa temperature in 60◦–90◦S. The
Antarctic ozone hole size (OHS) refers to areas less
than 220 DU total ozone. The parameter calculation
of EESC adopts the correction method of WMO cal-
culation method proposed by Newman et al. [2006].
The equation is as follows:
E(t) =
X
i
nClj fi(Γ)ρi + α
X
j
nBrj fj(Γ)ρj.
(1)
In the Eq. (1): E is EESC; t is the year; nCl and
nBr are respectively the atom number of chlorine and
bromine in various ozone depleting substances; α is the
release eﬃciency of bromine to chlorine in the process
of ozone destruction, and its value is 50; f(Γ) is release
rate of chlorine to bromine; ρi and ρj are the mixing
ratio of chlorine and bromine compounds respectively
[WMO, 2006]. The multiple regression method is used
70

to make OHS (O) as the dependent variable and
EESC and stratospheric temperature as the indepen-
dent variables to get the regression equation to explore
the changing trend of ozone. The relationship is as fol-
lows:
O(S) = a · E2 + b · E + c · T 2 + d · T + e.
(2)
In the formula, E is the chlorine and bromine
halide equivalent in the stratosphere; T is the 50 hPa
temperature; a, b, c, d, and e are the regression coeﬃ-
cients; S is the total ozone of single station. Taking
into account the inﬂuence of the EESC and the strato-
spheric temperature on the change of the ozone hole
size, the yearly regressed ozone hole size is calculated
by Eq. (2) by the use of EESC parameters and the
stratospheric temperature.
3 The changes of the Antarctic OHS
Figure 1 shows the temporal series of the Antarc-
tic ozone hole size since 1980.
From Figure 1, the
ozone hole size signiﬁcantly increased in 1980–1990
with a speed of 1.73×106 km2 each year. The growth
rate was gradually slow after 1990s and tended to be
stable in the 21st century. In 2002, the ozone hole size
was suddenly reduced by almost 50%. WMO ozone
assessment report [WMO, 2006] pointed out that this
mutation was because that the upload of planetary
wave energy in the tropospheric layer in the Antarctic
in September 2002 resulted in the sudden warming in
the stratosphere, which made the deceleration of po-
lar night current and the increase of the temperature
and ozone concentration inside the polar vortex, un-
dermining the strong polar vortex in winter.
Figure 2 shows the time series of the minimum
total ozone during the ozone hole. Compared with
Figure 1 Time series of OHS and EESC from 1980 to 2008
Figure 1, it can be seen that the minimum total ozone
and the ozone hole size change reversely and the cor-
relation coeﬃcient between them is –0.99.
In other
words, the greater the ozone hole size is, the smaller
the minimum total ozone is.

4 The relationship between the ozone
changes in the Antarctic and EESC
and temperature
As the chemicals that depleting the ozone ob-
served based on the ground is on the decrease, many
studies suggest that the ozone over the Antarctic will
restore to the level of the 1980s [Newman et al., 2006].
Currently, the changes of the Antarctic ozone hole are
forecasted to show three trends: to stop decreasing,
to begin increasing, and to return to the level in 1980.
Recently, it enters the state of stopping decrease [Huck
et al., 2005]. Figure 1 showed that the ozone hole size
was signiﬁcantly correlated with EESC during 1980–
2008 with the correlation coeﬃcient of 0.8.
EESC
showed an increasing trend year by year during 1980–
1998, which was basically the same trend as the change
of the ozone hole size. The ozone hole size tended to
remain stable since 1995 and maintained to be around
2,300×106 km2 and the EESC parameters tended to
decrease slowly. In 2002, the ozone hole size suddenly
decreased, but EESC did not do so, indicating the
changes of EESC parameters can only be part of the
reasons that result in the changes of the ozone hole size
to a large extent. Figure 3 shows the temporal series of
the ozone hole size and 50 hPa mean temperature af-
ter the separation of EESC eﬀect. The two series show
the same change with the correlation coeﬃcient of
BIAN Lin-Gen et al. / Trend of Antarctic Ozone Hole and Its Inﬂuencing Factors
71
–0.77 and the relevant signiﬁcant level of 0.001. Thus,
the inter-annual ﬂuctuation of the stratospheric tem-
perature will cause the ozone hole size changes and is
an important factor aﬀecting the ozone hole size.
Figure 3 Time series of OHS and stratospheric average
temperature from 1980 to 2008
Figure 4 shows the time series of the regressed
ozone hole size and the ozone hole size observed
by the satellite.
The correlation coeﬃcient between
them reaches 0.97 and the correlation signiﬁcant
level reaches 0.001. This relationship shows that the
changes of the ozone hole size in the Antarctic in
spring is the result of the joint action of EESC and the
stratospheric temperature, in which EESC reﬂects the
decadal changes of the ozone hole size while the strato-
spheric temperature shows the inter-annual changes
of the ozone hole size.
In order to analyze the fu-
ture changing trend of the Antarctic ozone, based on
the physical parameters of the ozone depletion in the
stratosphere under the A1 emission scenario in next
100 years given by WMO [2006], Eq. (1) is used to
calculate the future changing trend of EESC, and the
regression experience (Eq. 2) for 1980–2008 is applied
to calculate the future changes of ozone hole size, as
shown in Figure 5. The ozone hole size will remain sta-
ble until around 2010, then begin to decrease slowly,
and return to the 1980 level in about 2070.

observed OHS during 1980–2008
Figure 5 Trend of OHS from 1980 to 2070
In order to verify the applicability of the EESC
parameters given by WMO in the mainland cost of the
Southeast Antarctic, the data of Zhongshan station
and Syowa station are used to analyze the relationship
between the EESC and the stratospheric temperature
and the total ozone during the period of the ozone
hole. Figure 6 demonstrates the temporal series of the

observed and regressed total ozone of the two stations.
Although the two stations are located at the edge of
the ozone hole, the total ozone changes can still be de-
termined by the equivalent of the ozone depletion in
stratosphere and the stratospheric temperature. For
the two stations based on these two factors, the total
regressed ozone based on those two factors in the two
stations and the total ground-level observed ozone are
signiﬁcantly correlated (the correlation coeﬃcients are
0.96 and 0.97).
5 Case analysis of ozone change and the
dynamic process
According to the above analysis, the key factors
of the ozone depletion in the Antarctic during the pe-
riod of the ozone hole are EESC and the stratospheric
temperature. In order to further reveal the role of the
atmospheric dynamics on ozone change, we choose the
case of the sudden ozone hole change in Zhongshan sta-
tion for analysis. Figure 7 shows the time series of the
total ozone at Zhongshan station during September 15
and October 10 in 2008. The ﬁgure shows that with
the gradual increase of the sun elevation in spring, the
total ozone showed an upward trend, but it suddenly
increased between October 22 and 24, reaching more
than 320 DU, and then decreased rapidly. From the
spatial distribution of the total ozone, 50 hPa geopo-
tential height and the temperature ﬁled in the Antarc-
tic during October 20 and 25 in 2008 (Fig. 8), Zhong-
shan station was located in the ozone hole (the total
ozone was 160.5 DU), and within the high-altitude po-
lar vortex (the geopotential height was 1,900 dam) on
October 20. The stratospheric temperature was below
–65◦C. On October 21, the total ozone in Zhongshan
station increased to 253.7 DU, the geopotential height
rose to 1,920 dam and the temperature rose to –55◦C.
With the deviation of the polar vortex from the sta-
tion region, it was covered by high concentrations of
ozone, reaching 320 DU or more. Meanwhile, 50 hPa
temperature quickly rose to –40◦C or less. Later, with
the invasion of the polar vortex, Zhongshan station
was located at the edge of the ozone hole and the polar
vortex, and the temperature was reduced accordingly.
Thus, the mutation process of the ozone in Zhong-
shan station during October 22 and 24 was caused by
the movement and intensity change of the polar vor-
tex.
Figure 9 shows the temporal series of 50 hPa
meridional thermal ﬂux over the areas around Zhong-
shan station (75◦–80◦E, 60◦–70◦S) during September
15 and October 9 in 2008. The mutation process of the
ozone was associated with the sudden increase process
of the meridional thermal ﬂux, resulting in a sudden
increase heat transport from north to south and lead-
ing to the rapid warming and polar vortex position
changes in stratosphere and the transport of the high
ozone concentration in low latitude to the area over
Zhongshan station. Therefore, the abnormal increase
of the total ozone in Zhongshan station is the role
of the atmospheric dynamics. Feng and Chipperﬁeld
[2005] has simulated and compared the similar pro-
cess occurred in the past and conﬁrmed the dynamic
eﬀect of the large-scale horizontal transport on the po-
lar vortex and the ozone.

squares) from 15 September to 9 November 2008 at Zhong-
shan station, and its time trend (thin solid curve)
6 Conclusions and discussion
The observations by the space-based and ground-
based satellites show that the total ozone over the
Antarctic decreased rapidly and then formed the ozone
hole during the 1980s and the early 1990s, and the
ozone hole size changed slowly in the late 1990s and
remained stable in the 21st century.
EESC is the
BIAN Lin-Gen et al. / Trend of Antarctic Ozone Hole and Its Inﬂuencing Factors
73
key factor aﬀecting the ozone hole size and the to-
tal ozone changes in the Antarctic.
The signiﬁcant
relationship between them shows that the EESC cal-
culation program given by WMO is reliable; in addi-
tion, the stratospheric temperature is also an impor-
tant factor aﬀecting the ozone hole size and the total
ozone changes in the Antarctic. The impacts of two
factors on the ozone hole in the Antarctic have diﬀer-
ent roles. EESC determines the decadal change of the
ozone while the stratospheric temperature determines
its inter-annual changes.

ture are signiﬁcantly correlated in Zhongshan station
and Syowa station in the Antarctica during the period
of the ozone hole, indicating that although the two sta-
tions are located at the edge of the ozone hole, the to-
tal ozone changes can still be determined by the EESC
and the stratospheric temperature, which also veriﬁes
the EESC parameters’ applicability in the mainland
coast of the Southeast Pole.
EESC given by WMO A1 program, the ozone hole
size and the EESC regression results show that the
ozone hole size will gradually decrease after 2010, and
may return to the 1980 level in 2070 or so. It should be
noted that this result still has great uncertainty and
needs further study.
