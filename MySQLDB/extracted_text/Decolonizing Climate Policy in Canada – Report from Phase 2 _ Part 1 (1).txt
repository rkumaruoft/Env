Decolonizing Climate 
Policy in Canada
REPORT FROM PHASE 2 | PART 1
Indigenous Climate Action (ICA) is an Indigenous-led 
organization guided by a diverse group of Indigenous 
knowledge keepers, water protectors and land defenders 
from communities and regions across the country. We 
believe that Indigenous Peoples’ rights and knowledge 
systems are critical to developing solutions to the climate 
crisis and achieving climate justice. 
ICA works on connecting and supporting Indigenous 
communities to reinforce our place as leaders driving 
climate change solutions for today and tomorrow. 
We model our work and organizational structure on 
systems of free, prior and informed consent and self-
determination. By providing communities with knowledge 
and resources, we can inspire a new generation of 
Indigenous climate leaders building solutions centered 
around our inherent rights and cultures.

4 / INTRODUCING THIS REPORT
Policy is so intimate for us. We've had a very abusive relationship with 
policy. Since we've had this lived experience of the abuses we face through 
the Indian Act and different ways of colonization, that means we're actual 
hardcore policy experts that deserve to be in those spaces to actually make 
them better and less colonial. There are already experts everywhere within 
the territories that know what needs to be done."

DECOLONIZING CLIMATE POLICY / 5 
ver the last few years, our research team at 
Indigenous Climate Action (ICA) has been talking 
with First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Peoples across 
so-called Canada about climate change and climate 
policy. We've been reading Indigenous scholars on the 
subject, and our staff team has been thinking hard and 
talking amongst ourselves about the real, Indigenous-led 
climate policy and climate solutions happening, and how 
these can be raised up and well supported.
We know that settler-led climate policies are failing. We’ve 
argued that abundantly in our 2021  Decolonizing Climate 
Policy Report and The Risks and Threats of Nature-based 
Climate Solutions Report, also from 2021. They are failing 
to serve our communities’ needs, and they are failing to 
address the root causes of the crisis. And they are even 
failing to reduce carbon pollution in any real way. 
And so we are looking elsewhere for the real solutions, 
for transformative approaches to policy-making from the 
ground up, for centering our own ways relating to the land, 
waters, and territories. We are looking to each other as 
climate leaders. These conversations have gathered such 
a huge wealth of beautiful ideas, reflections, and insights, 
rooted in traditional Indigenous ecological intelligence, 
and we want to share it all. It is too much gorgeous 
material for one report, so we are sharing it in a series of 
three releases. 
Introducing  
this Report
INTRODUCING THIS REPORT / 5 
O
The Executive Summary of this Report was released 
in December 2022, explaining our motivations for the 
research and for centering biomes (tundra, boreal forest, 
grassland, temperate deciduous forest, and mountain 
biomes). The summary presents the methods we used, 
and gives an overview of the people we spoke to, and a 
brief summary of each of the chapters. It also presents 
the circle structure of this report, made up of 6 chapters 
centered around spirit and divided into 4 quadrants. This 
circular structure of the report is inspired by the many 
Indigenous cultures that honour the Medicine Wheel and 
other circular symbols.
This report you’re reading now shares the Colonization 
and Truth & Reconciliation Quadrants and includes 3 
chapters: 
1.	 Climate Impacts – Identifying Climate Priorities for 
Indigenous Communities; 
2.	 Settler climate policy is Holding up Colonialism;  
3.	 Identifying and Addressing Barriers to Indigenous-
led Climate Policy.
6 / INTRODUCING THIS REPORT
The final Part 3 of the report will be released in the coming 
months. It will include The Resurgence and Living in 
Balance Quadrants, with chapters:
4.	 Reclaiming Policy, Returning to our own 
Knowledge and Governance Systems,
5.	 Looking to the Youth. The future is Decolonized; 
and 
6.	 Pathways to Indigenous-led Climate Relationships 
and Solutions
Since the release of the Executive Summary, our research 
team conducted more research to build on the powerful 
insights gathered through the interviews and surveys. 
First, we conducted a literature review on Indigenous 
scholarship on climate justice. Then the ICA staff sat down 
for a Think Tank Session for the purpose of bringing to this 
project their experience and knowledge. 
Acknowledgements: We would like to thank all the 
incredible people across these lands who spoke to us in 
the surveys and interviews. We’d like to acknowledge the 
Advisory Council who guided this work: Tiffany Traverse, 
Pam Beebe, Katherine Whitecloud, Deborah McGregor, 
Bryanna Brown, and Jesse Mike. We are deeply grateful.
We would like to also acknowledge the support of ICA 
staff who have contributed to this project over the last 
few years: Eriel Deranger, Jayce Chiblow, Rebecca Sinclair, 
Breanne Lavellee Heckert, Sarah Hanson, and the entire 
ICA team that has help to bring this project to life. 
Thank you to the research volunteers and coordinators 
at Research for the Front Lines for their supportive role in 
preparing this report for publication: Ashley Henry, Jen 
Gobby, Gerda Kits, Sam Talbot, and Amy Janzwood.

Each Section of the Report
A Note  
On Biomes
s explained in the Executive Summary of this 
report, this research project was guided by 
a Council of Advisors, one from each of the 
five biomes in so-called Canada: tundra, boreal forest, 
grassland, temperate deciduous forest, and mountain 
biomes. 
A biome is a large geographical region defined by the 
climate (precipitation and temperature) and the specific 
communities of plants, animals, and other natural entities 
like soils, rock, and mountains that live there. 
Our inspiration to build this project around Biomes 
is derived from our desire to incorporate Indigenous 
knowledges from different lands and their human and 
non-human communities. This report is full of the 
powerful voices of First Nations, Inuit, and Métis folks from 
all across these 5 Biomes. 
The map on the next page shows these 5 biomes.

Climate Impacts
Identifying 
Climate Priorities 
for Indigenous 
Communities
e have heard from many Indigenous communities that they have a 
desire to address the negative impacts of climate change. To do this 
effectively, our communities first need to identify the ways in which 
climate change is affecting us and our lands. We asked participants 
in our survey to describe issues that are important to them, and how they are 
affected by climate change. Many of the issues they named echo concerns 
that have been raised by Indigenous communities and advocates in climate 
declarations and reports for decades.1
Experiencing the Impacts of Climate Change
We heard that Indigenous communities are experiencing the impacts of 
climate change in many ways.2 In fact, because of our close connection to and 
reliance on the land, as Hetxw'ms Gyetxw from the Gitxsan Nation (Mountain 
Biome) put it, “Indigenous communities experience the changing climate first 
before any other communities do.” A quarter (25%) of folks told us that they 
have seen changes in the weather including more storms and droughts. Many 
observed that the weather is becoming warmer and drier, and that the seasons 
are changing. Temperature measurements across so-called Canada show that 
we are experiencing warming at twice the global rate. Between 1948 and 1916, 
mean temperatures increased by 1.7°C for all of Canada and 2.3°C in the North, 
with the number of very hot days tripling over this period.3

The Swinomish Indian Tribal Community in Washington State used a 
values- and place-based process to determine climate change priorities. 
As a community, they came together to identify indicators of community 
health. Using information about how climate change is likely to affect key 
food sources, they evaluated how these changes will affect the health of 
their community and set priorities for action.

There is no standard definition of an extreme heat event, commonly known as a "heat wave." Environment Canada (Ontario Region) defines a heat wave as 
"a period with more than three consecutive days of maximum temperatures at or above 32°C [90°F]."

In the past decades, we've seen significant changes to the 
seasons (either delayed or early) which affects not only 
wildlife but also our people who harvest from the lands.” 
Jolene Patrick 
N'Quatqua Nation | Mountain Biome.
More extreme heat4 events are putting Indigenous 
communities in danger. High temperatures are causing 
more severe storms and contributing to more intense 
and dangerous wildfires, many of which affect our 
communities. Shaunti Davis, Dane-zaa, Tahltan, from 
Blueberry River First Nations (Mountain Biome) told us 
that wildfires have endangered their community through 
the past few summers. Wildfires were identified by 16% 
of folks as an issue in their communities. This number is 
likely much higher now after this summer of 2023 that saw 
massive wildfires across our many territories. 
Sixteen percent of folks identified flooding and changing 
water levels as issues in their communities. Kahsennahawi 
David from Kanehsatake (Temperate Deciduous Biome) 
reported that since 2017, their community has been 
“affected by bad flooding three times. We are losing 
shoreline and areas where we can build housing.” These 
are becoming more common experiences for Indigenous 
communities leading to the loss of traditional and 
ceremonial lands. As climate change continues to worsen, 
extreme events such as wildfires, droughts, and floods 
are likely to continue to become more frequent and more 
severe.5

16 / CLIMATE IMPACTS
Impacts on Water and Food
Over one-third (37%) of folks expressed concerns about 
drinking water and water quality. Some of their concerns 
included: reduced snowpack, decreased availability of 
freshwater, and loss of water quality (from pollution, 
hydro dams and more). Such changes are already being 
observed across so-called Canada and are predicted to 
worsen over time, although some changes are dependent 
on location (for example, annual streamflows are 
predicted to increase in the North but decrease in the 
Southern interior).6  
Rising ocean temperatures are harming important food 
sources for coastal communities. Other biomes are seeing 
that less rain is leading to trees and other vegetation 
dying, and for others warmer, dry weather is negatively 
affecting all life forms. 
Changes in water temperatures and levels have led to a 
significant decrease in the number of salmon returning to 
our rivers. Fewer salmon means less nutrients on land and 
harms the health of other animals and plants upstream. 
All this impacts food chains, causing food insecurity for 
those who partake in traditional hunting and gathering.
Climate change is affecting the migration patterns of 
animals, especially in the North. Cassidy Villeburn Buracas 
from K'atlo'deeche First Nation (Boreal Forest Biome) 
explained:
As the North warms, the land changes. Migration 
patterns of the caribou and the moose shift, as does 
the quantity and quality of fish. The caribou migrate 
thousands of kilometers from their calving grounds 
and their winter ranges, and the specific lichen they 
rely on to eat grows in specific conditions.

We All Take Care of the Harvest (WATCH) is a network of coastal First 
Nations working to develop an approach to monitoring seafood and 
climate change that all coastal First Nations can adapt for their own 
purposes. The goal is to help coastal communities and their members 
decide if and when their seafood is safe to harvest.

In the Boreal Forest Biome, the Essipit Innu First Nation formed the 
Caribou Collective to conserve woodland caribou habitat in their 
territories. Since 2015, they have worked with the Ministry of Forestry to 
close over 40 km of logging access roads to restore them as habitat and 
reduce their impact on the movement of the caribou.

ICA’s Climate Leadership Coordinator Carole Monture 
(Kanienkehá:ka [Mohawk] Wolf Clan from Six Nations of 
the Grand River) explained that similar impacts are being 
observed in her homelands in the Temperate Deciduous 
Forest Biome: 
Here at Six Nations, we've been finding winters are a 
lot shorter. Something my grandpa always used to say 
was ‘a green Christmas means a fat graveyard’ meaning 
like, when it's not snowing by Christmas, there's a 
lot of impacts that follow as a result. Without cold 
temperatures and enough snowpack, there’s microbes 
in the soil that don’t die off and this can damage 
crops. Pollinators don’t have enough protection and 
insulation from the cold while overwintering etc. It's 
been really dry here, much less rainfall than we're used 
to. And then it'll be a  deluge… And we've also had 
wildfire smoke down here from the fires in Ontario, 
Northern Ontario, and then Quebec, and the West as 
well. We have a lot of young people here, elders, people 
with disabilities as well. And that's been an impact. 
And we're finding it's impacting our ceremonial cycle 
as well. Like Maple ceremony … it's not really getting 
cold enough for the maple trees. And then like, it's, 
or they're coming it's much earlier, like people are 
tapping, able to tap in like, February because it's so 
warm. From what I just talked to my grandfather about 
and that's all off, everything is just off.
All these climate impacts are contributing to challenges 
to food security and food sovereignty, identified as an 
issue by nearly one-third (32%) of folks. Hanna Paul of the 
Métis Nation of Alberta (Boreal Forest Biome) told us that 
“flooding and fires have devastated my community and 
climate change has a massive hand in that. It’s impacted 
trap lines, hunting, and harvesting.” These events make it 
harder for people to get out onto the land, to hunt, to pick 
berries, and to find medicines.
At the Sioux Lookout Meno Ya Win Health 
Centre, a fully accredited 60-bed hospital and 
a 20-bed extended care facility, traditional 
foods are offered to all patients at least once 
a week. All food is donated to the program by 
local hunters, gatherers, and outfitters. These 
donations include foods like moose, caribou, 
small game, whitefish or walleye, geese, ducks, 
other waterfowl, blueberries, and wild rice.

CLIMATE IMPACTS / 19 
20 / CLIMATE IMPACTS
Participants note that these issues affect communities’ 
whole ways of life. Veronica Rose Waechter of Gitxsan 
and Gitanmaax (Mountain Biome) explained that “Our 
communities still rely on salmon for winter foods. So, it 
is not only the salmon that are dying, but our culture and 
people with them.”
Wild foods are less available, and climate change is 
creating new challenges for growing food as well. Jeff 
Corntassel, of the Cherokee Nation (Mountain Biome), 
explained that climate change is impacting their 
community’s ability to grow our traditional foods like corn, 
beans, and heirloom foods which are harder to grow with 
the changing weather patterns. All this leads to increased 
dependency on unhealthy, unaffordable industrially 
produced food.
Impacts on Health and Safety
Climate change is negatively affecting Indigenous 
communities’ safety and ability to travel in many ways. 
We heard that water level changes on Georgian Bay are 
making crossings harder for island communities. Changing 
temperatures are affecting ice roads which are the only 
means of winter travel for some communities. Severe 
weather events are causing erosion and damaging roads, 
affecting roads, creating risks for community safety.
Severe storms are putting homes at risk and will only 
grow more severe as climate change worsens. In some 
coastal communities, rising sea levels are forcing 
entire communities to relocate to higher ground. As an 
anonymous Plains Cree person (Boreal Forest Biome) 
pointed out, “people without homes will be exposed to 
extremes from climate change without proper safety.” 
These folks may have nowhere to escape the higher 
temperatures in the summer. They also face increased risk 
of injuries during the winter due to winter storms.
One person pointed out that building thriving economies 
– which can help rebuild our sovereign nations – will 
become more difficult as communities are dealing with 
the effects of climate change instead of being able to 
engage in economic activities that can help us prosper. 
Overall, climate change is creating issues which will 
decrease the ability of  communities to address our needs. 
As one of our Advisory Council members explained, “We 
are caught in a reactive cycle to climate impact, there is 
almost no room or time to mitigate and recover.” 
With all these impacts, climate change is negatively 
affecting our communities’ health. Extreme heat, forest 
fires, floods, drought, erosion, and other climate-related 
impacts are significantly affecting many communities’ 
mental and physical and spiritual health.

As an Indigenous person I see the first-hand impacts that damaging 
the land has on not only our day to day lives but also our spirit.”
Jordan Brown 
Inuit | Tundra Biome
Physical, mental, spiritual, economic, and ecological 
health are interconnected. As an anonymous Inuvialuit 
resident put it, “our livelihood and well-being is connected 
to the land's well-being.” An anonymous respondent of 
Ceg A Kin Nakoda Nation (Grasslands Biome) similarly 
wrote, “we are deeply connected to this Earth and 
witnessing the suffering impacts us – her trauma is our 
trauma which leads to a feeling of helplessness and 
hopelessness.” Kailey from Fisher River (Boreal Forest 
Biome) put it this way: “When the land is sick, we are sick.”
Everything is Connected
Many non-Indigenous accounts of climate change impacts 
group them by ecosystems, human health, infrastructure, 
economic, agriculture and other systems. However, the 
folks we spoke with articulated clearly that these are all 
interlocking and interwoven and must be understood 
holistically to address them effectively. 
Jeff Corntassel of the Cherokee Nation (Mountain Biome) 
spoke to these deep interconnections:
Our medicines are harder to find, which impacts 
our ceremonies and health. A strong language has a 
correlation to strong health. If we're not getting out 
on the land/water and speaking the language due to 
climate changes, our community health suffers.
Eriel Tchekwie Deranger, ICA's Executive Director 
(Dënesųłine from the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation 
[ACFN], Boreal Forest Biome), echoed these words, talking 
of the profound loss resulting from climate displacement. 
We were evacuated for almost an entire month 
because of [climate change caused] forest fires. [...] We 
were supposed to be gathering for our cultural days 
together as a community, where we have people that 
go out and harvest animals and berries and medicines, 
and they teach the kids about this. It is the time for 
us to come together. And we not only lost that time

together, people were in a state of traumatization. And 
we lost an entire month of harvesting and being in 
community together. 
With the land changing at a fast pace, communities 
are under pressure to reclaim cultural practices by 
passing down traditional knowledge and skills to the 
next generation. As Jayce Chiblow, ICA's Education 
and Training Manager (Anishinaabe from Garden River 
First Nation, Mixed Boreal & Deciduous Forest Biome) 
observed, “Species distribution is just way down. Species' 
health is way down. The things that we can harvest are 
barely edible, or they're sick or injured or diseased. [...] It 
makes it really difficult for youth that want to go out and 
learn those things.” 
An anonymous Inuvialuit resident (Tundra Biome) shared:
There are so many social issues, and climate change 
compounds all of them. I believe this because 
practising traditional activities, and connecting with 
the land and being with your family again is something 
that grounds us. It reminds us who we are and where 
we come from, bringing a sense of belonging, identity. 
However, with climate change, the travel paths we 
know, the subsistence hunting, trapping, and fishing we 
know, the berry-picking places, these are all changing. 
Suddenly what is our security, what brings us security, 
is changing. It is unpredictable in ways it never has 
been before. It is more dangerous. Increased storms, 
shifting seasons affecting things like ice-thickness, 
animals being forced into areas/habitats that they 
aren't usually in, etc. All of these things make practising 
our cultural activities harder, more expensive, more 
time-consuming. And overall, less and less accessible. 
This impacts the community/land relationship, creating 
more disconnect, and thus creating more social issues 
rooted in identity loss.
Rooted in Capitalism  
and Colonialism
Anishinaabe scholar Deborah McGregor and colleagues 
have written about the connections between colonialism 
and environmental injustices including climate change.7  
In our survey, folks stressed that the impacts of climate 
change add to the ongoing impacts of colonialism on 
our lives and lands. The impacts of climate on our water, 
housing, health, and access to food are worsening pre-
existing crises in our communities. Colonial crises faced 
by First Nation, Métis, and Inuit communities that were 
identified in our survey include biodiversity loss, settler 
encroachment, industrialization, and urbanization, mining 
and other forms of extractivism, unchecked development, 
clear-cutting of forests, invasive species, toxic dumps, 
urban sprawl, air pollution, ecosystem destruction, oil and 
gas production, mega projects, factory farming, privately 
owned lands, lands occupied by settlers, MMIWG+ and 
land theft.
These are described by Aleesha Jones from the 
Nlaka'pamux Nation (Mountain Biome) as examples of 
“colonial mindsets that don't consider the land as being 
a partner and instead an object to be exploited. This 
perspective is how colonizers have and continue to view 
Indigenous people.” 
Carole Monture contrasted Indigenous and settler 
worldviews. They said, “Our teachings encourage 
reciprocity with the land, only taking what you need, and 
wasting nothing. The current economic system is the 
opposite and doesn't just kill life – it depends on killing 
life. Climate change is a symptom of a broken system.” 
As Eriel Tchekwie Deranger, ICA's Executive Director puts 
it, “The ongoing impacts of climate change are just adding 
insult to injury that we're already experiencing from 
extractivism.”

26 / SETTLER CLIMATE POLICY IS HOLDING UP COLONIALISM
ndigenous Climate Action’s online survey of Indigenous folks across 
so-called Canada asked: “The mainstream, colonial definition of the 
word policy is ‘a course or principle of action adopted or proposed by a 
government, party, business, or individual.’ What does the word ‘policy’ 
mean to you? What does it bring up for you, as an Indigenous person?”
Over 100 responses have shown that Indigenous people think of policy in many 
different ways. Some folks spoke of policy as rules, legislation or regulation; as 
the work of governments. To others, policy is more broad; a way of working or 
principles for how things should be done. 
Policy is a set of guidelines and/or rules that have been implemented (either as a group or 
by a leader/s) to control how people do things, what approaches they will take and what is 
acceptable/not acceptable, as well as consequences for non-compliance”
Megan Dunne  
Peguis and Brokenhead Ojibway | Grasslands Biome
Some folks saw policy as so formal and bureaucratic that it is inaccessible 
and hard to influence, which can create barriers and complications for 
Indigenous communities trying to decolonize their ways of working. According 
to an anonymous Nehiyaw from Woodland Cree First Nation (Boreal Forest 
Biome), “sometimes policy is a barrier to taking action, and sometimes it can 
support action … or support the wrong kind of action.” And to an anonymous 
Neyasshiinigmiing Nishnaabekiing respondent (Temperate Deciduous Forest 
Biome), “policy… feels inaccessible and I know it as a tool to keep things away 
from Indigenous folks.” 
Several people described policy as inflexible, rigid, and limiting. Policy was 
written in non-Indigenous languages and often enforced by non-Indigenous 
speaking people.
As Katherine Morrisseau, Anisinabe (Boreal Forest Biome), put it, “the word 
policy to me means rule, which to me means inflexible.” Emily Mask, Métis 
(Temperate Deciduous Forest Biome), shared that policies “don't leave room 
for change in circumstance and context.”

A lot of the colonial policies are very human centric and about upholding universal human 
rights and freedoms to the individual. You know, some people pushing for a healthy 
environment. But ultimately, if we don't have species, and relationships on the land to support 
thriving communities, and cultures and nations, then those policies are just simply words on 
paper.” 
Eriel Tchekwie Deranger, ICA's Executive Director 
Dënesųłine from the ACFN | Boreal Forest Biome
As an Indigenous person, and knowing that policies are often centered around a very 
Eurocentric system, I know that there is already an underlying pseudo-language barrier. This 
systematic way is not often how we function/our natural way of understanding. To participate 
in this western-science conversion, we have to learn the western-science language. And 
that's what I think of when I hear policy."

Policy is Built on  
Non-Indigenous Worldviews
Kyla Pascal, of the Métis Nation of Alberta (Grasslands 
Biome), expressed that they “feel policies to be quite 
limiting,” and went on to explain that “I don't know how 
well the framework of policies relates to Indigenous ways 
of being.” Ashley Nadjiwon, ICA's Healing Walk Coordinator 
(Anishinaabe kwe from Wikwemikong Unceded Territory, 
Temperate Deciduous Forest biome) told us, 
I was taught how to pray to the water, I was taught how 
to do water walks. I was taught how to do offerings to 
the animals and to talk to them, to talk to the trees. …
The animals need policy, the water needs policy, they 
need policy to protect them. [Humans] constantly put 
ourselves at the center of attention, focused on what 
we need but all of these ones that don't have voices, 
they are just left there. 
Several others also described policy as tied to non-
Indigenous worldviews and governance approaches. 
Many spoke of the ways that policy has been used to 
support settler colonialism. Settler claims to these lands 
were based on the Doctrine of Discovery,8 and reinforced 
by the treaty-making process. The Government of Canada 
has violated their treaties with Indigenous Nations, 
showing that policies are only seen as valuable when they 
support settler colonialism. Indigenous laws, as described 
by Tanana Athabascan scholar Dian Million, directly 
oppose the laws and policies of settler governments 
because they are built on an Indigenous worldview which 
emphasizes responsibility and relations.”9 
Many folks shared that Canadian “policy” has been 
detrimental to Indigenous communities. Canadian policies 
have regularly violated Aboriginal and treaty rights, and 
climate policy is no exception. In an analysis of Canadian 
climate policy, Anishinaabe scholar Graeme Reed and 
his co-authors found that even though Canada’s climate 
policy documents give verbal recognition to the rights 
of Indigenous Peoples, “these rights are rarely respected 
or safeguarded in the design or implementation of the 
plans.”10
[Policy is] foreign law based on foreign values.”

28 / SETTLER CLIMATE POLICY IS HOLDING UP COLONIALISM
Policy is a Tool of Settler 
Colonialism in So-Called Canada 
Canadian policy development has too often been 
imposed on Indigenous Peoples. As one anonymous 
Anishinaabe person from the Temperate Deciduous 
Forest Biome stated “policy – often in Canada – is a 
set of unilateral rules usually developed without the 
participation of Indigenous Peoples, which is imposed on 
us. The process itself does not respect our sovereignty 
and ignores our right to self determination.”
Settler policy, by design, denies Indigenous sovereignty. 
As ICA’s Engagement Manager, Jamie Bourque-Blyan 
(Buffalo Lake Métis Settlement, Boreal Forest Biome) 
explained:
I was asked recently about why it’s important for 
Indigenous people to lobby federal policy in Canada. I 
found it to be a very harmful question because first of 
all, I don't identify as a Canadian. And it forces me to 
recognize a foreign sovereign as my sovereign. 
ICA's Education and Training Manager, Jayce Chiblow 
expressed a similar feeling: “I get angry… The fact that 
we are always trying to get our laws recognized by the 
colonial systems” (Anishinaabe from Garden River First 
Nation, Mixed Boreal & Deciduous Forest Biome).
For Jordan Brown, Inuit (Tundra Biome), the word policy, 
brings up a lot of intergenerational trauma. This term 
in Canada's context reminds me of the power that 
past and current governments have held over our 
Indigenous people to obtain resources, land, and rights 
over us. These ‘policies’ put in place have often been 
unjust and placed in order to control our communities. 
Several people pointed out that government policy can be 
hypocritical, and that in certain cases they do not follow 
their own policies, especially if those policies might hinder 
capitalistic goals. 
As Potawatomi scholar Kyle Whyte asks:
Will this just be another situation… where a call to 
urgency is used to justify solutions that ultimately 
harm Indigenous Peoples? That's how colonial power 
has been wielded in the past, that is, by using real or 
perceived urgencies to mask or justify privilege, harm, 
and injustice.11
Some people feel, as Gwen Bridge of Saddle Lake 
(Grasslands Biome) noted, that “policy is not a very useful 
tool for meaningful change, at least not change that 
addresses the needs Indigenous Peoples. Instead, we 
have to change the systems of governance.”

Moreover, as respondents identified, Indigenous Peoples 
have systematically been excluded from policymaking 
(see Chapter 3). 
For these reasons, Canadian policy “does not truly 
address our needs” points out an anonymous respondent. 
Instead, it “fills the pockets of those who actively gain 
from it.” 
Policy has been used to Oppress 
Indigenous Law and Protocols 
While colonial governments have unjustly imposed 
and enforced their own policies, they have also 
violently prevented us from making and enforcing our 
own decisions. As Veronica Rose Waechter (Gitxsan, 
Gitanmaax, Mountain Biome) put it, “Canadian policy has 
tried to stop us from practising protocol.” 
This conversation demonstrates the profound and 
enduring failure of Canadian policy to serve our 
communities. In face of this failure, some of the people we 
surveyed spoke of the need to decolonize as Indigenous 
Peoples and bring back the natural laws and support each 
other and the gifts the Creator gave to each one of us in 
order to survive. 
Others highlighted the differences between colonial 
policy and Indigenous protocols. A member of the 
Squamish Nation (Mountain Biome) noted that Indigenous 
governance systems don’t “enforce systems that restrict 
people in the detrimental ways colonizers do.” Jeff 
Corntassel (Cherokee, Mountain Biome) spoke of how 
“colonial governments and agencies regulate and police 
Indigenous lands and bodies,” meanwhile there are our 
“community protocols, which are grounded in respectful 
relations and responsibilities to those relationships that 
promote our health and well-being.”
To Veronica Rose Waechter, “protocol … is not like a 
policy/law that essentially restricts. Instead, protocol 
keeps you mindful of your agency as a person and the 
power each of us need to direct in a good way, for all. If we 
all practised protocol maybe the world would be a better 
place.”
Policy Can be a Tool for Change 
Folks have made clear that “policy” can be a bad word 
in Indigenous communities. It has been used as a tool 
to enforce harm and continues to do so. Despite all this, 
while “definitely a colonial construct [policy] can be a tool 
for change” (Emily Mask, Métis, Temperate Deciduous 
Forest Biome).
All of the reflections and insights shared in the survey 
teach us that policy can be rigid, inaccessible and 
hard to change. Policy is about maintaining colonial 
power, furthering capitalism and controlling Indigenous 
It makes me ask why non-Indigenous people are creating 
policies for Indigenous Peoples.”

communities. Policy is rooted in Canada’s history of settler 
colonialism and often perpetuates its priorities, over those 
of Indigenous communities. For all these reasons and 
more, most of the people we surveyed have a profound 
distrust of policy and policymaking in Canada. This needs 
to be heard loud and clear by policy and decision-makers 
in Canada. 
This section laid down a fierce and necessary critique, 
and it also pointed towards powerful, transformative, and 
beautiful ways forward; of reinstating and empowering 
our own ways of working together to decide on, 
implement and enforce our own protocols. Chapter 4 in

The ‘policy’ that helps to govern the 
lands came from the land. It came from 
the land, and it didn't need to be written 
down because it was based on symbiotic

order, when you broke natural law, then 
there were consequences that you could 
not run away from.”

SETTLER CLIMATE POLICY IS HOLDING UP COLONIALISM / 33 
For the last few decades, there has been a concerted effort to find ways to include Indigenous 
Peoples, our rights and values into colonial policies and structures. In other words, there 
has been a movement to Indigenize current colonial systems. For example, in 2016, the City 
of Vancouver committed to working with Indigenous peoples on climate policies. While 
Indigenous representation and revitalization of Indigenous systems is being recognized within 
colonial systems, little has substantially changed with respect to who assumes and holds 
powers over our lands and territories and ultimately our lives.
Indigenization that does not involve fair power sharing is tokenism and causes harm.
In short, there has been a lot of successful effort in Indigenizing colonial policies and 
systems but we need to move beyond this and work towards decolonizing these structures. 
Indigenizing fails short of systematic change, but rather maintains the status quo and 
centering of colonial structures and simply includes Indigenous perspectives and ways of 
being. 
Decolonization on the other hand involves the dismantling or undoing of colonial systems, 
including ideologies and power structures that have historically oppressed and suppressed 
Indigenous Peoples. This will require challenging the broader processes and systems of 
power that have oppressed Indigenous Peoples and actively working towards undoing the 
legacy of colonialism, including economic exploitation, extractivism, cultural assimilation, and 
political domination. While systems are being undone, there needs to be space and resources 
for the creation of something new that doesn't centre colonial systems but rather looks at the 
ancient wisdom held by our communities.
We have no interest in being further absorbed into colonial systems but want the opportunity 
to strengthen our own existing structures.
In order to truly support the self-determination and sovereignty of Indigenous Peoples we 
need to find ways to decouple Indigenous systems from colonial systems and restore and 
reclaim existing Indigenous knowledge systems and ways of being to guide our own "policy".

These are interconnected challenges caused by colonial systems and rules.
All of these challenges mean that although our 
participants expressed a desire to take action on climate 
change, some are not sure if they have the power to make 
a difference or how to do so. 
Colonialism causes Disconnection
Disconnected from the Land
As Muscogee scholar Daniel Wildcat writes, “The incredibly 
high cost of this climate change to our Mother Earth must 
be understood as related to humankind’s development of 
societies and cultures disconnected in fundamental ways 
from the landscapes and seascapes, the places where 
they are situated.”12

his chapter outlines the barriers to Indigenous-led 
solutions for climate policy and living in balance 
with the natural world. We identify them so that 
they can be overcome. These barriers were named 
in Indigenous Climate Action’s survey of Indigenous 
folks across so-called Canada as well as interviews with 
Indigenous youth. 
We heard three main sets of barriers to Indigenous-led 
solutions for climate policy:
1.	 Being disconnected from land, communities, and 
traditional teachings and knowledge;
2.	 Settlers (and settler institutions) ignoring, 
devaluing, or trying to silence Indigenous voices; 
and 
3.	 Living within settler colonial capitalism, and what 
that means for capacity and resources.
T
38 / INDENTYIFYING AND ADDRESSING BARRIERS TO INDIGENOUS-LED COLIMATE POLICY
Many Indigenous-led solutions for climate policy or 
Indigenous traditional protocols require access and use of 
our traditional territories. Indigenous communities have 
always lived in close connection to the land. However, 
colonialism has disrupted this.
Indigenous Peoples have been displaced by colonialism. 
Many respondents spoke about the impacts of colonial 
systems in disrupting their connection to the land. As 
Suzanne Brant (Mohawk, Temperate Deciduous Forest 
Biome) said, “We were moved from our ancestral lands 
and placed on a reserve.” The reserve system has meant 
that First Nations across so-called Canada have been 
separated from their traditional territories, often put on 
small plots of land away from quality water sources, with 
lower quality soil for growing and less forest cover. 
For Métis peoples, the colonial scrip system has limited 
access to land. Beginning in 1870, the settler Canadian 
government issued documents (scrip) to Métis people 
redeemable for land or money. Scrip was often given 
in exchange for land rights. This scheme effectively 
extinguished Métis title to land.13 As Jeff Baker (Métis/
apihtawikosisan from Saskatchewan, Grasslands Biome) 
described, “Being Métis, my ancestors all sold their scrip 
to speculators, so I am essentially landless.”
Settler governments today have continued to restrict 
access to traditional territories. As Robert Maytwayashing

our rights, our inherent rights, and laws that govern our people be upheld.”
Eriel Tchekwie Deranger

INDENTYIFYING AND ADDRESSING BARRIERS TO INDIGENOUS-LED COLIMATE POLICY / 39 
(Anishinaabae, Boreal Forest Biome) told us, “Our land has 
been taken over by private interests, and they don’t allow 
us access. Government has also restricted our access to 
crown lands by selling it off.”
Land has also been restricted through the settler creation 
of so-called conservation areas. For example, in Treaty 8 
Territory,  
The Alberta provincial government has created many 
‘Conservation’ hunting sites on traditional lands next 
to reserves and Metis settlements within Treaty 8 
Territory. The province regulates access and use. Most 
of these sites are walk-in only, and anyone can hunt on 
them. The use of the land should be co-managed with 
Indigenous governance and stewardship (Darrell Fors, 
Treaty 8, Boreal Forest Biome).
Darrell Fors went on to explain:
Some areas are also gated by private land ‘owners’ 
and logging/oil companies. Industrial areas that are 
accessible, like clear cuts, where blueberries grow, are 
being sprayed by unhealthy chemicals to increase the 
chances of the planted tree species to grow for lumber.
Settler governments have also mismanaged land and 
resources. This directly impacts traditional harvesting 
and kin relations with animals. As Jayce Chiblow, ICA's 
Education and Training Manager (Anishinaabe from 
Garden River First Nation, Mixed Boreal & Deciduous 
Forest Biome) recalls,
When I was younger and trying to go out and learn on 
the land, we were trying to trap some beavers, and 
some other animals, but they're all gone. They're gone. 
They're moving north, or they're not there because the 
government has mismanaged our lands and territories 
and our relatives in general. […] They've already 
clear-cut the entire area. And there's literally just rows 
of trees, and then they spray it with aerial herbicide 
spraying. […] They are mismanaging our relatives, and 
it's impacting our relationship with our relatives. 
Rules made by settler governments limit interactions 
and relations with the land. For example, an anonymous 
respondent living in the Temperate Deciduous Forest 
Biome told us, “Hunting and fishing are prohibited by laws, 
community and local laws prevent you from building a 
home or going where you would like as well.”
Another anonymous respondent similarly said, “We 
cannot harvest cultural logs except through [the] 
provincially regulated permit process. We cannot access 
some streams or culturally significant places because 
of being privatized or else provincially or federally 
quarantined for specific use.”
Increasing recreational settler land use often comes at the 
cost of traditional access. As Dana Strong (Anishinabe of 
Wauzhushk Onigum, Boreal Forest Biome) expressed, “In 
my original homeland in Treaty 3, it’s saturated with ‘cabin 
country’. That is a barrier.” 
Due to colonization, many Indigenous people now live 
far away from their home territories. It takes resources 
to spend time on their territories. As one participant 
(Temperate Deciduous Forest Biome) described, barriers 
to accessing traditional territory include having limited 
access to a vehicle or costs associated with travel, and 
taking time off work.
Another anonymous respondent (Tundra Biome) 
described similar challenges:
Going to Nunavut and Nova Scotia is too expensive. 
Where I live in Calgary, a lower socioeconomic 
community, I don’t have access to land, trees, or water. 
When I want access to land, I physically have to leave 
my community to access it [and go] into the richer 
areas of Calgary that have walking lanes, parks, trees 
etc.
As Gitxsan people, we access it [traditional territory] as we please, however, 
disenfranchisement and lack of jobs and funds do prevent many from reaching 
their own territories that require a lot of distance, resources, and time to access.”

Disconnected from community and 
traditional knowledge
Many folks described feeling disconnected from their 
communities, culture, traditional knowledge, and 
languages.
A legacy of colonialism is feelings of shame. Many 
respondents identified feelings of shame around culture, 
teachings, and traditional knowledge. As an anonymous 
respondent (Grasslands Biome) told us, “My family was 
ashamed of our heritage and lost touch with our culture.”
Similarly, Eriel Tchekwie Deranger expressed,
A lot of our people – particularly the people that we 
have in a lot of our leadership roles – have a lot of 
shame in the teachings that we have instilled, and they 
keep it just in our communities because [they believe] 
it doesn't have a place outside of the walls of our 
communities. And I think that's a common feeling.14  
Genocidal systems like the Indian Residential School 
System have limited access to traditional teachings. 
As Gwen Bridge from the Saddle Lake Cree Nation 
(Grasslands Biome) said, “I grew up off-reserve, but my 
mom and her sisters and brothers know some things, 
but it’s all so limited because of their residential school 
experiences.”
This echoes what Hanna Paul (Métis Nation of Alberta, 
Beaver First Nation, Boreal Forest Biome) told us: “Most 
[of my] knowledge is from Métis Elders but not my own 
Elders. I learn from books but not from my own Kokum as 
she does not have a wide extent of knowledge of the land 
due to mission schools and being taken from her mother.”
Physical distance to the land (also mentioned above) is 
another barrier to accessing traditional knowledge and 
teachings. As Sandi Boucher (Seine River First Nation and 
Thunder Bay Indigenous community, Boreal Forest Biome) 
shared:
I was not raised in the community, so I do not have 
access to that ancestral knowledge. Thanks to 
colonization, my Mother was also taught not to pass on 
14.	
One of our Advisory Council members noted while reading this section that many of us experience intergenerational fear of violence that may be aimed at us 
for practicing our culture. Our ancestors faced so much violence for this and this fear stays with us still.
42 / INDENTYIFYING AND ADDRESSING BARRIERS TO INDIGENOUS-LED COLIMATE POLICY
anything to do with our teachings. I did not come to my 
knowledge until much later in life.
Connecting to traditional knowledge is not easy. As 
Kyla Pascal (Métis Nation of Alberta, Grasslands Biome) 
described:
I have to do some labour in order to connect with 
elders and knowledge-keepers in my community. 
My family also works to ensure I am connected with 
my cultural practices, but they are getting older, and 
access to these practices and some of the land we use 
for harvesting is not as easily accessible.
Time is running out for Elders to pass on their knowledge. 
Respondents expressed concern that “Elders and family 
members keep dying. Many, like me, know little of our 
Indigenous language” (Darrell Fors, Treaty 8, Boreal Forest 
Biome).15  
15.	
It’s important to note that First Nations, Inuit and Metis people have a 
significantly lower life expectancy than settlers in so-called Canada. See

Silencing our Voices 
When we asked if Indigenous Peoples have been silenced 
in so-called Canada, we heard a resounding yes. Folks 
described the many ways settlers and settler institutions 
ignore, devalue, or try to silence Indigenous voices. This 
has been especially true for Indigenous women, land and 
water defenders, and northern and remote communities.
Folks also identified more explicit efforts by settlers and 
settler institutions to devalue or try to silence Indigenous 
voices. We divided these into 5 categories:
•	
Ongoing colonial violence
•	
Devaluing our knowledge
•	
Excluding from settler policymaking
•	
Hearing but not understanding or 
accepting 
•	
Lip service and empty promises
Often I hear the argument that ‘nobody is stopping Indigenous people from talking,’ but these 
are the same people that refuse to listen or to believe that Indigenous voices hold validity. If 
you speak over Indigenous voices, you're silencing them. If you're ignoring Indigenous voices, 
you're silencing them. If you fail to have Indigenous voices at ‘the table,’ you are silencing 
them. Plain and simple.”

Ongoing Colonial Violence 
As respondents made clear, colonialism and ongoing 
colonial violence silence Indigenous voices. As Veronica 
Rose Waechter (Gitxsan, Gitanmaax, Mountain Biome) 
described:
I believe that these historical acts of genocide by the 
canadian government were done out of fear of the 
power of Indigenous voices, and with that, instilling 
fear in our own ability to speak out. This has inter-
generationally affected our standing in places of 
power, including as teachers, within politics, and in any 
leadership.
Colonial laws have intergenerational effects on Indigenous 
communities. As Darrell Fors  (Treaty 8, Boreal Forest 
Biome) described: 
Assimilated and acculturated Indigenous voices 
perpetuate the colonial cycle as our relations follow the 
Indian Act Policies and Colonial Mind Sets. Traditional 
ceremonial ways of knowing and living can be silenced 
44 / INDENTYIFYING AND ADDRESSING BARRIERS TO INDIGENOUS-LED COLIMATE POLICY
and oppressed by this collateral violence and colonial 
system.
The implications of colonization and acts of genocide 
have had far reaching impacts on the futures that 
Indigenous Peoples can envision. As Veronica Rose 
Waechter reflected, “importantly [acts of genocide] have 
affected our ability to dream. To be able to see a better life 
for each other, to be able to speak our truths.”16 
Colonial violence takes many forms including, as 
anonymous respondent (Ceg A Kin Nakoda Nation, 
Grasslands Biome) lists: “brutal policing, fines, arrests, 
assaults, media blackouts or, worse, stories that spin 
in favour of industry/government.” An anonymous

When reading this, one of our Advisory Council members noted that addictions, brought on in response to generations of colonialism, can block our ability 
to connect with Spirit and this too can hinder our ability to envision other futures.

remembers how to just BE on this 
Earth without harm?”

respondent living in the Mountain Biome echoed this 
latter point, identifying “Social media blackouts and 
erasure of climate justice-related news media are another 
example of silencing Indigenous vocalizations on climate 
action.” 
Participants also named tactics of intimidation and 
retaliation that stop people from speaking up. An 
anonymous respondent (Mountain Biome) shared: 
If you don't have a large organization to represent 
you to keep your identity safe while talking about the 
hard stuff, [there is a] 200% chance the government 
will commence a personal attack until you stop. I've 
witnessed it many times.

We understand our land and are learning and adapting with it constantly, 
we understand how climate change is affecting our land and ourselves. It's 
the communicating with western scientists, it's the writing policies, it's the 
scientific methodologies that impede meaningful collaboration.”

Devaluing our knowledge
The above quote echoes Anishinaabe scholar Deborah 
McGregor, who writes, “Indigenous Peoples have been 
responding to change for centuries; there is a wealth of 
experience for how to respond and survive such changes. 
These experiences and stories are not recognized as valid 
knowledge.”17
Settler academic and technological knowledge have 
consistently been given more importance in climate 
policymaking. This was something many participants 
emphasized. For example, Kyla Pascal said, “I feel 
Traditional Ecological Knowledge/Indigenous knowledge 
is treated lesser than ‘Western’ knowledges in climate 
conversations.” 
Others similarly expressed an overreliance on Western 
science and expertise. As one anonymous participant 
(Temperate Deciduous Forest Biome) responded, settlers 
often forget “Indigenous Peoples are also experts in 
our relationship with Land and Natural world.” Another 
anonymous respondent in the same biome similarly said, 
“Our voices are being drowned out by so-called “experts” 
from think tanks, universities, and government.” 
Far from Indigenous knowledge and perspectives being 
welcomed, respondents identified systemic barriers 
such as learning how to navigate settler (climate) policy 
spaces in order to share their knowledge. This prevents 
meaningful participation. Indeed, as an anonymous 
respondent (Tundra Biome) described “I feel like to be 
taken seriously in climate change talks, we have to sound 
We are ignored as uncivilized in climate change discussions. Traditional knowledge is still 
seen as subpar to western science (white supremacy).”

a certain way, behave a certain way, and that takes away 
from addressing the issue first and foremost.” 
Other challenges reflect the importance and diversity 
of Indigenous languages and the limits of the English 
language. As Jamie Bourque-Blyan (ICA’s Engagement 
Manager, Buffalo Lake Métis Settlement, Boreal Forest 
Biome) shared, “My kokum always spoke to me in 
Nehiyawewin, and even though I speak in English, I 
struggle with that even though it's my first language, 
because I don't think in English – my thought process 
is in Nehiyawewin.” And as Eriel Tchekwie Deranger 
added, “We might be able to have a handle on the English 
language, but the ways in which we understand words, 
and their deeper meanings, is very diverse.” 
The devaluing of Indigenous knowledge also extends 
to education. For example, Jordan Brown (Inuit, Tundra 
Biome) has identified, “Those in charge of our educational 
system are withholding teaching our Indigenous heritage 
and the impact climate change has on our livelihood.”
These exclusions also occur in the media. As Megan 
Dunne (Peguis and Brokenhead Ojibway Nations, Boreal 
Forest Biome) put it, “Social media and the media at large 
ignores our stance and serves to protect the colonist 
(capitalist, for profit) narrative.” 
Exclusion from settler policymaking
As Secwepemc scholar Julian Brave NoiseCat writes, 
“Industrialism and colonialism have combined to produce 
climate change. Yet to date, climate action has largely 
failed to address colonialism and excluded Indigenous 
Peoples.”18
Our respondents discussed the many experiences with 
exclusion in settler climate policymaking. This starts 
with how climate change is understood. As Katherine 
Morrisseau (Anishinabe, Boreal Forest Biome) expressed, 
“We aren’t sitting at the table with those who are defining 
what and how climate change is defined and managed.” 
This exclusion is a form of silencing. 
Participants also identified a lack of access to decision-
makers. As an anonymous respondent told us: “I have 
actively sought information and have taken courses, but 
do not have a way to communicate with policymakers 
that really are dedicated to making a difference.” 
This lack of access is especially acute for northern and 
remote communities. As an anonymous respondent 
(Grasslands Biome) told us: “Many First Nation 
communities, particularly remote northern First 
Nations in Saskatchewan, are at the forefront of climate 
change, and their opinion and participation is not being 
considered when it comes to climate change policy.” 
Colonizers will talk over us on any given point”

exploited doesn't invite alternate perspectives, so even if 
we do sit at a table, it is to discuss their agenda, not the 
needs of this Earth or our peoples.”  
For these reasons, settler policy makers either cannot 
understand or refuse to accept Indigenous-led climate 
solutions require. As Michael Cheena of the Moose Cree 
First Nation (Boreal Forest Biome) described: “The white 
man's political process, judicial system, bureaucratic 
structure and economic logic will never understand or 
accept our custodianship concept over ancestral lands.”
An anonymous respondent of Keeseekoose First Nation 
(Grasslands Biome) stated similarly, “The climate crisis is 
rooted in capitalism – and the Indigenous perspective is 
not aligned with this. Therefore, the Indigenous Peoples’ 
solutions are ignored in favour of solutions that benefit 
the consumption-focused basis of our economy.” 
Hearing but Not Understanding or Accepting 
There has been growing attention from settlers to 
Indigenous knowledge, perspectives, and expertise in 
climate action. However, settler listeners often do not 
grasp what Indigenous Peoples are trying to convey. As an 
anonymous participant described:
I feel like there is an intention to give more attention 
to us today by settlers than ever before, and I see our 
beliefs and concerns being held and supported by 
settlers and settler governments, but it still seems 
there is a language barrier to be overcome. 
This barrier reflects different worldviews. As an 
anonymous respondent (Ceg A Kin Nakoda Nation, 
Grasslands Biome) identified, “The colonial worldview 
that sees the Earth as a source of resources to be 
[We are] Silenced, tokenized, misrepresented, and packaged to an audience to be seen in a 
certain way that serves the government's goals.” 
Anonymous Respondent,  
Ceg A Kin Nakoda Nation | Grasslands Biome
Lastly, settler governments appropriate and tokenize 
Indigenous Peoples and knowledges to suit their 
purposes. As Hanna Paul of the Métis Nation of Alberta 
and Beaver First Nation (Boreal Forest Biome) described:
Indigenous Peoples’ collective intellectual property 
are often co-opted while Indigenous Peoples are 
continuously disenfranchised. Often in western 
capitalist countries, Indigenous ideas are only deemed 
valuable if they can be commercialized/fit into the 
framework of western science. Western positivism 
and academic elitism perpetuate the issues of climate 
change.
Lip Service and Empty Promises
There is a longstanding gap between promises from 
settler governments and meaningful action. As Darrell 
Fors (Treaty 8, Boreal Forest Biome) described:
The government systems of collaboration have heard 
Indigenous heartfelt stories and pleas; unfortunately, 
little integration or interpretation of them has resulted 
in a true diverse partnership that includes collective 
Indigenous wisdoms and sovereign will. 
Similarly, Ellen Gabriel (Kanien’keháka, Temperate 
Deciduous Forest Biome) observed, 
I've been at the UN for a long time, and I don't see 
any benefits coming to my community, even after all 
that we've done – from the Royal Commission [on 
Aboriginal Peoples] to the Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission – that the work that we did benefited my 
community at all. 
Many also believe these empty promises are intentional. 
Karlene Leroux of Barren Lands First Nation (Boreal Forest 
Biome) said:
I believe that the Canadian government blatantly 
ignores Indigenous calls for action. They will address 
issues publicly through the media, but never actually 
put pen to paper [...]. They'll continue to shake hands 
with large corporations while making promises they 
never keep. 
INDENTYIFYING AND ADDRESSING BARRIERS TO INDIGENOUS-LED COLIMATE POLICY / 49

Anonymous Respondent,  
Dane-zaa, Tahltan, Blueberry River 
First Nations | Mountain Biome 
Biome) expressed: “Our chief is a tool of the Liberal & 
Conservative government and who silences those who 
speak out against him. It is like a dictatorship, the stories I 
hear from back home sadden my spirit.21  All information 
going out and in is controlled by the C&C.” 
As an anonymous participant told us, internal divisions 
may also prevent Nations from speaking out strongly and 
with a united voice: “Often our Nations’ voice is weakened 
against the voices of contradicting interests among our 
own families, or between our neighbouring Nations, or 
other settler private interest groups.” 
In addition to colonially-imposed governance systems, 
Nations also are constrained by capitalist incentives that 
limit their ability to take more transformative action. 
For example, in an interview, Breanne Lavallee Heckert 
(Métis, Grasslands Biome) noted that the Manitoba 
Métis Federation currently supports pipeline and hydro 
projects:22  
Imagine the Manitoba Métis Federation were to 
implement something like [Indigenous climate policy], 
I think it would be really, really transformative for 
my nation. But at the same time, the Manitoba Métis 
Federation is a corporate body and, at the end of the 
day, has investments and portfolios that need to have 
profit margins. And so that's really limiting.
Power is not only imposed by colonial governments, but 
by industry as well: 
I feel that the position of the oil and gas industry 
lobby (which profit from pumping greenhouse gases 
into the atmosphere) as buddy-buddy with provincial 
and federal governments as the biggest impediment 
here. Indigenous Peoples are the last line of defense 
in protecting the land, water, and air for our future 
generations, so you can bet that these corporate 
forces will be doing all they can to discredit our 
movements (Jeff Baker, Métis, Grasslands Biome).
Colonial Constraints on  
Capacity and Resources 
Many people identified the struggles of living within 
settler colonial capitalism as a barrier to effective climate 
organizing. This happens in many ways, including 
colonially-imposed weaknesses in governance, limited 
capacities and dependencies within Indigenous 
communities, and limited access to resources.
Governance and Power
Settler governments have weakened our Indigenous 
governance systems by imposing colonial forms of 
governance and restricting traditional practices. As 
Cassidy Villeburn Buracas from the K’atlo’deeche First 
Nation (Boreal Forest Biome) told us, “The Indian Act, 
Residential Schools, MMIW2S+,20  and other forms 
of genocide have eroded traditional governmental 
structures of many Indigenous Peoples, and replaced it 
with a chief and council system that emulates first-past-
the-post style politics of Britain.” 
Several respondents expressed frustration with the 
barriers this poses to effective climate action. For 
example, traditional governments are denied access to 
decision-making tables which limits their options. As Ellen 
Gabriel described, “Canada and Quebec only recognize 
band councils, not traditional governments, like the 
Haudenosaunee. We have to fight these issues in court, 
so it’s costly, whereas colonial governments have endless 
amounts of resources.”
Several respondents described corruption and a lack 
of trust in the colonially-imposed Chief and Council 
(C&C) system that lead to inaction. For example, 
Maistoo'awaastaan (Piikani, Niitsitapi, Grasslands

An Advisory Council member pointed out that this kind of dynamic is another manifestation of intergenerational trauma whereby residential schools sought 
to destroy familial relations.
22.	
An Advisory Council member shared that this is the case in her region as well where “oil and gas fund most bands… even going so far as to fishing out 
money for protected cultural areas. It’s everywhere, and makes me worried about future land grabbing.” 
Capacity and dependency  
The structures of settler colonialism and capitalism in 
Canada pose other kinds of constraints to Indigenous 
communities as well, by limiting internal capacities and 
imposing dependencies on settler systems. 
The challenges of simply existing within unjust systems 
of settler colonialism tend to draw our communities’ 
attention away from addressing climate change. They 
also force communities to become dependent on settler 
systems for survival. For example, as Ginnifer Menominee 
of Wasauksing First Nation in the Boreal Forest Biome told 
us: 
We’re so connected into settler towns that we 
don't actually have our own system of taking care 
of ourselves. And I find that it really bothers me, 
[…], we don't even have health care systems on our 
territory, you know, we have to wait 20 minutes for 
an ambulance to come in, and in that 20 minutes 
somebody could die. And so having the ability to 
take care of our land, take care of ourselves, and be 
interconnected with our land, and being able to be 
healthy from the land itself, I think is so needed.
These dependencies happen with food as well: “To feed 
ourselves, we need to protect the habitats of the deer, 
protect the waters of the fish, those are things that we eat 
anyways. But really, we rely on the grocery store” (Ellen 
Gabriel, Kanien’keháka, Temperate Deciduous Forest 
Biome). Ginnifer Menominee added, echoing an Elder, 
these dependencies “don't make us thrive, they don't 
make our spirits thrive, either.”
These dependencies also extend to energy. For example, 
Sharon Baptiste of the Poundmaker Cree Nation 
(Grasslands Biome) expressed frustration with having to 
rely on SaskPower23 for electricity:
The power goes out here a lot too. Saskpower can 
just shut it off anytime they want. And then there are 
people on breathing machines and different types of 
machines that they depend on to live and then they'll 
just shut the power off, like, shut it off for 15 minutes, 
half hour, sometimes for four hours, even in the 
wintertime. So we have to keep our vehicles plugged 
in and in good running order so we can go sit in our 
vehicles and warm up if the power goes out. They have 
total control. We don't.
As SaskPower runs primarily on fossil (‘natural’) gas, 
this forces communities to directly contribute to climate 
change, as much as they would prefer not to.
When our communities try to build internal capacity, 
it can be an uphill climb.24 As Ginnifer Menominee 
described: 
Indian Affairs is always like, ‘you need to pump out 
nurses, you need to pump out social workers, you 
The systems that are in place do not allow us to build our capacity as Indigenous people, 
and so it is hard for us to take the time to be engaged in such important matters. We have 
to be focused on issues of basic needs like survival and healing from trauma. I think that our 
cultures have a lot to add to addressing the issues of climate change, but our resources and 
time is limited, and our voices do not get heard.”

An Advisory Council member noted that this kind of uphill climb is made evident in Alberta’s recent moratorium on renewable energy development. For

INDENTYIFYING AND ADDRESSING BARRIERS TO INDIGENOUS-LED COLIMATE POLICY / 51 
conform with colonial policy, and so are ineligible for 
funding. So Indigenous people wanting to do things 
our way don’t get as far as they could with more 
support (monetary and otherwise).
Furthermore, the money and time that are available 
are desperately needed for many priorities. As Robert 
Maytwayashing (Bear Clan Anishinaabe, Boreal Forest 
Biome) described: 
In First Nation communities, leaderships spend 99% 
of their time running around putting fire out. It is crisis 
management. The resourcing to look at, say, even a 
recyclable programme in the communities, there's no 
resourcing for stuff like that. Because of that, there's 
very little, if anything that's happening in any of our 
communities with respect to those types of initiatives 
to try and address climate change. 
Still, as Eriel Tchekwie Deranger expressed, there is an 
urgent need for change and for settler governments to 
take responsibility:
We need this desperately because the systems and 
structures that we have been held to – colonial 
structures – have gotten us into this mess, and it's time 
for something different. [...] The government should be 
paying for this. And they should not be determining 
what our budgets are, we should be determining what 
it's going to cost for us. 
need to pump out because there's a shortage of this 
and that in your communities’, but I'm like, they never 
stay. You know, we do invest in our kids and our youth. 
But, you know, there are other opportunities, [but] 
that's not going to necessarily mean that they're going 
to have a thriving livelihood on reserve. So how do we 
keep all of our human resources? 
Limited Resources and High Costs
These challenges are especially important because 
speaking up and defending the land takes so many 
resources – including money and time. As an example of 
what it can cost to take action, Eriel Tchekwie Deranger 
described a time when her Nation created a water 
management plan for the Lower Athabasca Watershed: 
“Our proposal was $20 million. And that was 10 years 
ago, for one nation, one watershed plan. Imagine what 
it would take for us to develop a land- and rights-based 
management plans for the entire country, for every single 
nation.”
However, Indigenous communities have limited access to 
the necessary resources. As an anonymous participant 
from the Boreal Forest Biome expressed:
I think that a lot of ‘voice’ is given in the form of 
monetary support, and Indigenous Peoples’ initiatives 
are very often self-funded because they don’t always 
This is going to be expensive. Money is a barrier – our communities are dealing with so many 
different crises. This is just another thing that they will have to do.”

Unsure How to Take Action on Climate
All of these challenges together mean that although our 
participants expressed a desire to take action on climate 
change, some are not sure if they have the power to make 
a difference or how to do so. Many also fear violence and 
exclusion that may be brought on by leading their own 
climate work.
Some participants told us that they do not know what 
structures are in place and how to get involved. We 
asked survey participants whether their community 
has consultation protocols for matters that affect them, 
such as climate policy. Only 1 in 5 (20 respondents) said 
that their community did not have such protocols, while 
2 in 5 (40 respondents) were unsure. About 1 in 4 (28 
respondents) said that they were aware of a consultation 
policy or protocol in place for their community. 
These figures do not mean participants were not paying 
attention to such issues. For example, as one participant 
responded, “I am not sure if we have a policy in place 
or not, but we are certainly aware of the problem” (Jeff 
Baker, Métis, Grasslands Biome). 
For some, lack of access to power is the sticking point: 
“I do not know how to participate in climate action 
other than voting in elections which is a broken system 
anyway” (Emily Akerman, Georgian Bay Metis, Temperate 
Deciduous Forest Biome). Kusemaat-Shirley Williams of 
the Lummi Nation (Mountain Biome) similarly told us: “As 
an elder said, Truth and Reconciliation is great, but we still 
are not the decision-makers.”
Other participants feel that they do not have enough 
knowledge to make a difference. As April Star Francois 
Madden of the Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation (Boreal Forest 
Biome) said, “I don’t know if I possess enough knowledge 
to back my opinions.” Similarly, Karlene Leroux from the 
Barren Lands First Nation (Boreal Forest Biome) told us: “I 
wouldn't know where to begin, who to speak with, or how 
to speak on specific issues.” 
Nevertheless, people desire to take action: “I don’t know 
how it would get started, but I’d be happy to help as I’m 
passionate about the environment” (Torrie Nicholas, 
Splatsin from the Mountain Biome). And as an anonymous 
respondent (Ceg A Kin Nakoda Nation, Grasslands Biome) 
reflected: “I don't see myself as someone who knows 
traditional protocols enough to represent my nation. But 
I do see climate policy as critical and I am an activist for 
climate justice.”

Conclusion
his report has focused mostly on how colonization 
is negatively affecting Indigenous communities 
by causing climate change that affects us, and 
by limiting our capacities to take action. But by 
naming these issues, we also begin to see hints of how our 
communities can, and are creating change.
We heard from many people who generously shared 
their observations with us that climate change is having 
negative impacts on our communities. It is changing our 
weather and seasons, causing destructive events like 
wildfires and floods, affecting plants and animals, and 
damaging our health. We heard the pain of those who are 
directly affected by these changes, and who grieve the 
impacts on our lands and relatives. 
As Indigenous Peoples, we also understand that all these 
impacts are connected. Our foods, our ceremonies, our 
medicines, the ways we teach our young people – all of 
these are intertwined and therefore they are all affected 
by climate change. 
So many of our participants also told us of how climate 
change is not something that “just happens:” it is caused 
by and rooted in colonial, capitalist mindsets and systems. 
We heard that the root cause of climate change is the 
colonial mindset that the land is something to be used 
and exploited rather than, as in our understandings, a 
partner and a Mother. Though this might seem to make 
the problem even more discouraging,  understanding the 
root causes that lie behind climate change means that 
change is possible, and that our ways hold answers.
At the same time, we heard that a colonial approach 
to policy and policymaking is making it difficult for our 
communities to take action on these issues. Many told us 
that they see policy as inflexible, limiting, something that 
is not accessible to Indigenous Peoples because it is done 
in a way that does not align with our worldviews. Others 
told us that policy is actively harmful because it is used to 
exclude and oppress Indigenous Peoples. People spoke 
of a desire to respect natural law and return to Indigenous 
protocols that establish right relationships with the land 
and each other.
We also heard of other ways in which colonialism presents 
barriers to our communities when it comes to taking 
action. Some of our participants – though not all – told us 
that they experience disconnection from land, community, 
and culture as a result of colonialism. These impacts can 
make it hard for us to learn our traditional ways and speak 
confidently from our knowledges as Indigenous Peoples. 
When we do speak out, we are sometimes not heard. 
Colonial systems do their best to suppress, ignore, 
exclude, and silence us. They limit our access to power 
and to the time, energy, and money needed to take 
action. Naming all of these things is difficult. But over and 
over in our conversations, we also heard signs of hope. 
58 / CONCLUSION
T
Throughout the report, we have shared examples of ways 
that communities are already taking action to address 
the negative impacts of climate change and, even more 
importantly, address the colonial systems and structures 
that are causing it. In the next and final report in this series 
(Part 3), we will share the powerful stories and visions 
of what else is possible – how climate policies can be 
founded in ceremony, in Natural Law, and our Nations’ 
own unique governance systems. We will center the 
voices of the youth who are leading this fight and charting 
new ground. We will lay out a wealth of beautiful climate 
solutions already being enacted across the country, in 
both rural and urban communities, as First Nations, Inuit, 
and Métis Peoples are reclaiming our own systems and 
forging old and new ways of living in balance with the 
Land and with each other.

60 / OTHER FORMS OF CLIMATE POLICY
e want to end Part 2 of the report on an 
uplifting, inspiring, and empowering note. So 
we include a glimpse of the ideas and voices 
that will be shared in the next and final part of 
the report, coming soon. 
“I can look at policy in both ways. You can see it from 
the negative point of view – like as the very thing that 
pretty much brought us down. But also you could look 
at it another way and change it where we take back 
that power and make it into policy? Yes, I look at policy 
and I don't like that word. But I'm also like, we are 
totally going to be able to take it as our own and make 
it our own thing. We're gonna change policy to make 
it something that Indigenous People and people in 
general aren't scared of”

“Policy is so intimate for us. We've had a very abusive 
relationship with policy. Since we've had this lived 
experience of the abuses we face through the Indian 
Act and different ways of colonization, that means 
we're actual hardcore policy experts that deserve to be 
in those spaces to actually make them better and less 
colonial. There are already experts everywhere within 
the territories that know what needs to be done”

“We had policy within our ceremonies. We had policies 
in our day to day life. They were brought out from 
watching our natural world and looking at creation. We 
had original instructions given to us. How do we follow 
those now? How do we maintain that in a colonial 
state? I think it's really going back to listening to land, 
listening to our youth. Listening to our Elders. Where 
are they trying to take us? The land is telling us a whole 
bunch of things. Kids are telling us a whole bunch 
of things. Our Elders are telling us a whole bunch 
of things that are happening right now… We have 
these protocols for everything that we do in our lives, 
through day to day, work, through ceremony, through 
birth to death. We have these policies of how we are 
going to walk through life”

“I believe in all aspects of traditional teachings being 
tied to the land. Indigenous Peoples are the land. We 
are extensions of our territories and so climate policies 
would actually hold weight if they were specific to the 
land's needs, based on the people’s knowledge of 
the territories. This would appear as community-led 
initiatives, Indigenous-led projects, and upholding 
Indigenous land sovereignty”
