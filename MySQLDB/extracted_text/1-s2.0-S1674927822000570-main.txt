Abstract
Assessing hydrological consequences of climate change at the catchment scale is recently among key problems in hydrology. This study
focuses on the estimation of changes in the hydrological regime in the Fuglebekken catchment in SW Spitsbergen (Svalbard). For this purpose,
50 rainfall-runoff models were calibrated using available hydrometeorological observations. The models were validated based on archival ﬂow
and SWE observations, and proxy data from time-lapse cameras. Six models (FLEX-IS, GSM-SOCONT, PRMS, HBV, Nordic HBV, and GR4J)
with the best performance were applied to reconstruct the past hydrological conditions and analyse the trends in ﬂow regime in the period
1979e2020. Statistically signiﬁcant changes at 0.05 level in the ﬂow regime indicators were detected, including the number of days with the
active ﬂow during the calendar year (10.8 d per decade), during the mid-May‒November period (9.8 d per decade), the date of the ﬁrst day with
the ﬂow (4.7 d per decade), and the last day with the ﬂow during mid-May‒November (8.4 d per decade). A statistically signiﬁcant increase in
runoff was estimated for two periods from mid-May to the end of June and the second part of August till mid-November. The changes in the ﬁrst
period result from increases in air temperature and earlier snowmelt-driven ﬂoods. An estimated runoff increase in the second period corresponds
to large increases in rainfall. The increase in air temperature, earlier disappearance of snow, and decrease in precipitation in July and the ﬁrst part
of August result in runoff reduction. The presented results show that the Fuglebekken ‘catchment's hydrological regime has already changed. The
magnitude of the changes is larger compared to catchments located in lower latitudes.

1. Introduction
The dramatic change in the Arctic climate continues and
has strong impacts on the environment and society. During the
past few decades, the Arctic has warmed approximately twice
as rapidly as the entire Northern Hemisphere (Serreze and
Barry, 2011). Warming is predicted to continue, especially in
the Barents Sea area as an effect of extensive sea-ice reduction
that inﬂuences oceanic and atmospheric circulation (Chapman
and Walsh, 2007; Dahlke et al., 2020). It is widely reported
that the High Arctic is particularly vulnerable to changes in air
temperature and precipitation (Overeem and Syvitski, 2010;
Rawlins et al., 2010; Serreze and Barry, 2011; Nowak and
Hodson, 2013; Blaen et al., 2014; Przybylak, 2016).
The analyses of the long-term climatic variables at the
Polish Polar Station Hornsund in SW Spitsbergen (Svalbard)
indicated a warming of þ1.14 C per decade from 1979 to
2018 (Wawrzyniak and Osuch, 2020), which is more than six
times higher than the global average (þ0.17 C per decade) in
this period. The changes in air temperature are coupled with
an increase in precipitation (þ61.6 mm per decade) and the
reduction of snow cover (Osuch and Wawrzyniak, 2017b).
The analyses of changes in the ﬂow regime have been
performed for many rivers located in the lower latitudes

rivers were studied (Wu et al., 2018). The amount of hydro-
climatic data remains limited primarily due to extreme
weather conditions, difﬁcult accessibility and relatively small
data demands for commercial purposes.
Due to the complexity of cold region hydrological systems,
the functioning of the catchment varies as a result of climate
forcing and catchment properties. Many factors inﬂuence
these complex mechanisms, and despite numerous research
(Pulina et al., 1984; Jania and Pulina, 1994; Killingtveit et al.,
2003; Pohl et al., 2005; Sund, 2008; Nowak and Hodson,
2013; Sobota, 2014; Majchrowska et al., 2015; Franczak
et al., 2016; Shrestha et al., 2021), the hydrological identiﬁ-
cation of processes and physiographic factors that affect water
balance remain not fully understood.
Hydrological response to ongoing changes has been named
one of the most important research needs in the Arctic region
(Peel and Bl€oschl, 2011; IPCC, 2019; Hanssen-Bauer et al.,
2019; Retelle et al., 2020; Nowak et al., 2021). It is also
indicated as one of the most important and yet unresolved
questions in hydrology by Bl€oschl et al. (2019b).
Due to discontinuous, scarce or too short data series, direct
statistical analyses are difﬁcult to perform. Recent advance-
ments in hydrology and statistical analyses have led to the
emergence of diverse and complex hydrological models.
These models are tools that allow the detection of runoff
tendency, extend hydrological data in both space and time, and
estimate past and future hydrological regimes using climato-
logical data (Brocca et al., 2013; Dams et al., 2015; Knoben
et al., 2020).
Conceptual rainfall-runoff models are applied to recon-
struct the runoff in the High Arctic catchment with limited
ﬂow observations in the past. For this purpose, an ensemble of
hydrological models was applied. Such an approach is com-
mon in climate simulations and rarely used in hydrology
(Breuer et al., 2009; Refsgaard et al., 2014). As the models
differ in structure, their uncertainty can be assessed by
applying an ensemble of hydrological models (Refsgaard
et al., 2006; Breuer et al., 2009; Rojas et al., 2010;
Vansteenkiste et al., 2014a, 2014b; Knoben et al., 2020).
Available model intercomparison studies proved that a range
of hydrological models allow simulating river discharge with
similar accuracy, although there is no one perfect ‘model’. It is
recommended to use diverse models that differ in the con-
ceptualisation of the hydrological processes, the number of
storages, and parameters that describe the complexity of the
hydrological system (Dams et al., 2015).
The ensemble applied in this study consists of a set of lumped
rainfall-runoff models (RRMs) available from the MARRMoT
toolbox (Knoben et al., 2019) and additional lumped RRMs
(HBV, GR4J, and MILc) and semi-distributed Nordic HBV, that
were employed in previous studies (Osuch et al., 2015, 2017,
2018, 2019; Wawrzyniak et al., 2017; Piotrowski et al., 2017,
2019a, 2019b, 2021). The suitability of the models for simulation
of ﬂow in the Fuglebekken catchment was tested by validation
using archival in-situ runoff and snow water equivalent (SWE)
measurements and remote sensing data.
Despite the number of investigations in the Arctic so far,
the hydrological research on the non-glaciated catchments in
this region is rare. Owing to the complexity of cold environ-
ments and dramatic climate change, a better understanding of
hydrological response is crucial. Therefore, this study aims to
investigate changes in the regime of hydrometeorological
variables (air temperature, precipitation, snow water equiva-
lent) and estimate their inﬂuence on the ﬂow regime in a High
Arctic unglaciated catchment using multi-model ensemble
approach. Our integrated analysis allowed us to identify and
estimate changes in the hydrometeorological regime, taking
into account the uncertainty of hydrological models. Such
studies performed in the Arctic, with the fastest warming in
the world, help to determine what changes are expected to take
place in other regions.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study area
The unglaciated Fuglebekken catchment was selected as it
represents catchments consisting of sea terraces and coastal
mountains, common in SW Spitsbergen. As a consequence of
a negative mass balance of glaciers, resulting in deglaciation
and bare ground uncovering, this type of catchment is
becoming more common. Fuglebekken has been a research
and observatory catchment for multiple years (Wawrzyniak
et al., 2021).
Fuglebekken is located near the Polish Polar Station
Hornsund (PPSH, 77000N, 15300E) and up to the gauging
point (at 4 m a.s.l.) and occupies an area of 1.27 km2. It ter-
minates in the Isbjørnhamna, a bay in the northern part of the
Hornsund Fjord (Fig. 1). Its boundary is delimited by the
south-facing slopes of mountain ridge Ariekammen and
Fugleberget, and Fuglebergsletta coastal plain below.
The topography of the Fuglebekken catchment is hetero-
geneous. Its highest point is located at 522 m a.s.l., slightly
below the Fugleberget summit. Marine terraces of Fugle-
bergsletta Plain are covered with sea gravel and diverse tundra
vegetation, while the eastern part is occupied by the lateral
moraine of Hansbreen. The mountain slopes consist of the
bare solid rocks of the Hecla Hoek formation and washed
rubble sediments (Wawrzyniak et al., 2017).
Fuglebekken catchment is usually hydrologically active be-
tween late spring (MayeJune) and autumn (SeptembereOc-
tober). For the rest of the year, the river is mainly frozen, but
there are episodes of winter ﬂow due to positive temperatures
and rain on snow events. Flow magnitude is characterised by
signiﬁcant diversity, shaped by the melting of snow cover,
seasonality in the amount of precipitation, and active layer
thickness that regulates water inﬁltration (Osuch et al., 2019).
Due to the snowmelt, runoff is relatively high until mid-June,
then decreases in the middle of the summer. In recent years,
the inﬂuence of higher autumn precipitation has been reﬂected
in the subsequent high runoff period in late AugusteSeptember
(Wawrzyniak et al., 2017; Osuch et al., 2019).

2.2. Data
2.2.1. In-situ data
The availability and completeness of in-situ observational
data varied depending on the variable. Meteorological obser-
vations, including air temperature, precipitation, humidity, and
sunshine duration, have been conducted at the PPSH since July
1978. Observations of additional parameters, including snow
cover depth and SWE, were started in 1983. The summary of
the collected climatological time series was described by
Wawrzyniak and Osuch (2020). The availability of long-term
hydrometeorological observation data allows testing the
capability of hydrological models under variable climatic
conditions.
The meteorological data used for model calibration comes
from automatic measurements with sensor HMP155 (air tem-
perature data with 1-min interval) and Hellman rain gauge
(precipitation data with 6 h time step). Potential evapotranspi-
ration (PET) was calculated using the Hamon method (Hamon,
1961). Time series of air temperature, precipitation, PET, and
runoff is available at the Pangaea repository and were described
by Wawrzyniak et al. (2021). During the short Arctic summer,
mean air temperature is relatively stable, with the maximum
occurring in mid-July and steadily declining until the end of this
season. Mean daily air temperature from mid-June to mid-
September oscillates between 2.0 and around 5.0
C. The
daily sum of precipitation varies, usually not exceeding 10 mm.
The sum of precipitation from mid-June till mid-September
reached its maximum in 2018 (275.1 mm). The lowest sum
for this period was observed in 2017 (75.6 mm).
First measurements in the Fuglebekken stream were carried
out during the expedition to the PPSH in 1979/1980 (Pulina
et al., 1984). Runoff measurements with ﬂowmeter Nivus
PCM-F with Active Doppler sensor were started in 2014 in the
hydrological gauge located at 77.0053N, 15.5561E (Fig. 1).
This device provides high accuracy measurements with un-
certainty ±1% of the ﬁnal value of ﬂow velocity and 0.5% of
the ﬁnal value of the water level. Flow measurements strongly
depend on the channel geometry that in the case of cold
climate catchments may vary due to ice cover and sediment
transport. Adequate capturing of early-season runoff typically
is limited due to the ice-blocking of the channel at the
beginning of the melting season. The ﬂow measurements were
performed when the river cross-section was free of ice. Usu-
ally, a ﬂow meter is installed on the bottom of the stream in the
second part of June and deinstalled when the ﬁrst freeze-up
occurs (in the second part of September or in October).
An active Doppler sensor has been used to measure runoff
in the Fuglebekken stream with the 10 min interval. In the
period 2014e2020, the peaks of runoff were observed at the
end of June/the beginning of July, as a result of snow cover
melting, and in late summer, when the abrupt increase of
precipitation inﬂuences runoff. In between, after snow cover
disappearance, the runoff is usually low and stable.

2.2.2. Remote sensing data
Estimation of the dates of Fuglebekken river break-up and
freeze-up based on simulation results was compared with
time-lapse imagery. Continuous image acquisition has been
carried out with three automatic time-lapse camera systems set
on Ariekammen mountain ridge and facing the Fuglebekken
catchment since autumn 2016. A single daily cloudless image
was selected and visually analysed to assess the dates of ac-
tivity of the Fuglebekken stream.
3. Methods
3.1. Modelling scheme
We used the Modular Assessment of RRMs Toolbox for
hydrological simulations (MARRMoT), which includes 46
conceptual models (Knoben et al., 2019). These models differ
in how they conceptualise the hydrological processes and the
complexity of the hydrological system.
The models from the MARRMoT toolbox were supple-
mented by two versions of the HBV model and one version of
the GR4J model and MILc model (Brocca et al., 2013). We
applied versions of the HBV and GR4J models that were
employed in our previous studies (Wawrzyniak et al., 2017;
Osuch et al., 2019; Piotrowski et al. 2019a, 2019b) and the
Nordic version of the HBV (Bergstr€om, 1995; Beldring et al.,
2003) described by Hanssen-Bauer et al. (2019) and Lawrence
(2020). Supplementary materials Fig. A1 ssummarises the
applied models regarding processes taken into account, the
number of conceptual storages, and the number of parameters.
The included storages are snow, interception, surface depres-
sion, soil moisture, groundwater, routing store, routing func-
tion, and channel routing. Snow accumulation and melting are
included in 15 models. The number of parameters varies from
one (Collie1) to 24 parameters (Lascam model). Most of the
models are lumped, except the Nordic version of the HBV
(Sælthun, 1996), an example of a semi-distributed model
where the catchment is divided into homogeneous areas ac-
cording to elevation. As input variables, time series of air
temperature and precipitation from the Hornsund station were
applied together with calculated PET.
In the ﬁrst step, all models were calibrated based on runoff
only; however other ﬂuxes and several internal state variables
(including SWE) were assessed as an implicit validation of the
hydrological processes. PET was estimated using the Hamon
method based on the air temperature (Hamon, 1961). Due to
ﬂow data availability, the models were calibrated using ﬂow
observations from six seasons (2014e2019). These observa-
tions were conducted during the highest hydrological activity
of the stream (mid-July to the end of September). There were
no ﬂow observations during the early snowmelt period, which
made calibration of the parameters related to the snow reser-
voir difﬁcult. Therefore the ﬂow time series were supple-
mented with zero ﬂow with the help of the stream water
temperature model. For this purpose, a data-based mechanistic
approach was applied. The model was derived using a single
input (the ground temperature at 20 cm depth measured
continuously at the Hornsund station and streamwater tem-
perature as an output. The model was calibrated using obser-
vations from 2017 and validated on data from other years. In
the next step, this model was applied to observations from
2014 to 2019, and the simulation outcomes were applied to ﬁll
the missing ﬂow data. It was assumed that the ﬂow value was
equal to zero for each time step with the simulated stream
water temperature below freezing. This procedure signiﬁcantly
improved the performance of rainfall-runoff models and their
ability for the appropriate simulations of ﬂow regimes.
As a measure of the ﬁt between observation and simula-
tions, the Kling-Gupta efﬁciency (KGE, Gupta et al., 2009)
was applied. Different calibration methods were tested to
identify the best set of parameters. As a result modelling
scheme, one method SPS-L-SHADE-EIG was applied (Guo
et al., 2015). The soptimisation procedure consisted of ten
runs of the SPS-L-SHADE-EIG method for each of the 50
rainfall-runoff models.
Models were calibrated using meteorological input data
from the period 2013e2019. The ﬁrst year of simulations has
been skipped to avoid the inﬂuence of initial conditions, and
the objective function was calculated using ﬂow data during
the period 2014e2019. The initial conditions were set to zero
for all selected models, except the PRMS model, which
required a larger value of initial conditions (1000 mm) to
simulate the ﬂow.
3.2. Calibration and validation results
The calibration results of 50 rainfall-runoff models using
SPS-L-SHADE-EIG
and
fminsearchbnd
soptimisation
methods with KGE as an objective function are summarised in
Fig. A1. In the High Arctic, winter precipitation is stored in
snow cover and is released in spring and summer. Fuglebekken
catchment is largely dependent on snow cover melting;
therefore, snow modules are required for appropriate simula-
tion of the hydrological regime and stream activity, including
dates of break-up and freeze-up. Due to implementing zero
runoff to input data during the calibration stage, the results
were improved for all models that include snow modules.
According to the outcomes of the SPS-L-SHADE-EIG
calibration method, six best performing models with the
highest KGE were selected: Nordic HBV (0.67), GR4J (0.70),
HBV (0.76), FLEX-IS (0.77), PRMS (0.80), and GSM-
SOCONT (0.81). The performance of these models is visual-
ised in Fig. A2. Each model accurately illustrates the annual
run and ﬂow peaks. There are differences in the simulations
between models due to differences in their structure, number
of parameters and storages. Using hydrological modelling, we
extended the ﬂow data into a period without observations
when the ﬂowmeter was not installed.
In the second step, validation of the simulations was per-
formed using (a) ﬂow observation from the years: 2020,
1979e1980, and 2001 (Fig. A3), (b) time-lapse imagery
(Fig. A4 and A5), and (c) snow water equivalent (SWE) ob-
servations (Fig. A6). The validation results were visualised
and described in the supplementary materials. The outcomes
520
OSUCH M. et al. / Advances in Climate Change Research 13 (2022) 517e530
conﬁrmed the suitability of these models to simulate hydro-
logical conditions in the Fuglebekken catchment.
In the third step, the long-term simulations of ﬂow in the
period 1979e2019 were obtained using six selected models
with the best calibration and validation results. These models
are FLEX-IS, GSM-SOCONT, PRMS, HBV, Nordic HBV, and
GR4J. The long term simulations were performed for the best
parameter sets using observed inputs from the Hornsund
meteorological station.
3.3. Analysis of seasonality
For the analyses of seasonality, the Moving Average of over
Shifting Horizon (MASH, Anghileri et al., 2014) method was
supplemented with trend analysis (Sen's method (Sen, 1968)
for the slope of trend and modiﬁed ManneKendall (Hamed
and Rao, 1998) for the signiﬁcance of trend) was applied.
The MASH approach was previously successfully applied to
daily ﬂows by Anghileri et al. (2014) and daily air temperature
and the sum of precipitation (Osuch and Wawrzyniak, 2017a),
as well as snow cover variability (Osuch and Wawrzyniak,
2017b).
Due to the application of the MASH method, the small
scale variability of time series was ﬁltered out, allowing
analysis of trends and seasonality changes. The Fuglebekken
meteorological time series were averaged over 31 d to omit
signiﬁcant
day-to-day
variability
and
delineate
seasonal
patterns.
4. Results
4.1. Changes in atmospheric forcing to rainfall-runoff
models
The most important factors inﬂuencing ﬂow regime are
atmospheric variables: precipitation and air temperature. Fig. 2
shows a smoothed air temperature obtained with w ¼ 15 d and
Y ¼ 10 years. The original time series covers the period from
1979 to 2020 (Ny ¼ 42). The ﬁltered data consists of Nh ¼ 33
patterns that are visible as several lines in Fig. 2a and the
number of cells in the X direction in Fig. 2b. The changes in
air temperature are visible as differences in the annual run for
different 10 years-long periods (Fig. 2a) or differences in the
number of cells with particular colours (Fig. 2b). In general,
changes (warming) are visible for almost all months except
March, with signiﬁcant differences between seasons. The
largest increases in air temperature are observed during the
cold period from November to February. From the hydrolog-
ical perspective, changes in the length of the period with
positive air temperature are very important. A prolongation of
such a period is visible. In the 1980s, the period with positive
air temperature lasted from the ﬁrst part of June till the second
part of September, while for the last decade, it started in the
second part of May and lasted till the ﬁrst part of October.
The changes in the seasonality of precipitation from 1979
to 2020 are presented in Fig. 3. In the ﬁrst decade, shown as
lines with dark blue colour, precipitation was evenly distrib-
uted throughout the year. The data from the last few years
indicate large changes in precipitation seasonality. The period
from mid-August till November is characterised by a much
higher precipitation amount that almost reached 4 mm d1
compared to 1.5 mm d1 observed in the 1980s.
Positive trends in air temperature are statistically signiﬁcant
at 0.05 level throughout the year except for two days in March
(see Fig. 4). The largest trends (more than 2.0 C per decade)
were found from December to February. An increasing ten-
dency (1.0e1.5 C) is noted in April, October and November.
The smallest (less than 0.5 C per decade) was found in March
and summer months (JuneeAugust).
The changes in precipitation are statistically signiﬁcant for
some periods of the year. Statistically signiﬁcant increases
were estimated from mid-August till mid-November and from
mid-December to the beginning of February. Decreases in
precipitation amount were found in the three periods: from
mid-March till mid-April, in June and the second part of July.
The largest trends (more than 0.5 mm per decade) are
observed from mid-August till the end of September.
4.2. Changes in snow water equivalent
At the Hornsund station, snow cover has been monitored
since August 1982 (Osuch and Wawrzyniak, 2017b). Fig. 5
shows a smoothed time series of SWE at the PPSH in the
period 1983e2020. The maximum SWE was observed from

the end of March till the beginning of June, with a signiﬁcant
decrease at the 0.05 level from almost 150 mm in the 1980s to
less than 75 mm after 2005. Large changes in snow cover
duration, later onset, and earlier disappearance are observed.
Such changes inﬂuence the timing and magnitude of snowmelt
driven ﬂoods that recently appear earlier in the season.
Negative trends in SWE were estimated for the whole year,
except July and the ﬁrst half of August (Fig. 6). We attributed
this trend to the observed increase in air temperature, which
directly impacts the phase of precipitation and development of
snow cover. The largest decrease (>20 mm per decade) is
noted in the period with maximum snow cover (end of March‒
beginning of June). The summer season lasts longer, melt
onset appears earlier, and freeze-up starts later, extending the
hydrologically active season.
4.3. Flow regime indices and their changes
The analysis of simulations of six rainfall-runoff models in the
period 1979e2020 was performed and is presented in Fig. 7.
Four indices describing the ﬂow regime were derived a) the
number of days with the ﬂow exceeding 0.005 m3 s1 throughout
the whole year, b) the number of days with the active ﬂow during
the typical period with the active ﬂow between the mid-May and
the end of November, c) the ﬁrst day with the ﬂow, and d) the last
day with the ﬂow in mid-May‒November.
These indices quantify the ﬂow activity in the whole cal-
endar year and during the period with the typical ﬂow
occurrence in the analysed 42 years. In recent years, Fugle-
bekken has been active for a signiﬁcantly longer period. For
this reason, mid-May‒November was chosen as the typical
period of activity.
There is a large variability of the Fuglebekken activity,
quantiﬁed by indices, between models and years. The lowest
values of (a) and (b) indices resulted from the simulations of
the PRMS model and amounted to 28 d in 1987 (both annual
and seasonal values). The largest number of days with ﬂow
resulted from the HBV Nordic model. In that case, the out-
comes reached 173 d in mid-May‒November of 2016 and
197 d during the whole year 2016. The reason for such a large
annual number of days with the active ﬂow was the occurrence
of a surface ﬂow in the winter of 2016, when the positive air
temperature was accompanied by intensive liquid precipitation
for several days in a row. The statistically signiﬁcant trend at
the 0.05 level varies from 4.5 d per decade for the PRMS
model to 15.7 d per decade for Nordic HBV for annual
analysis and from 4.0 d per decade (PRMS) to 14.2 d per
decade (GR4J) for the mid-May‒November. The mean slope
of the trend from the six models is 10.8 d per decade for the
whole year and 9.8 d per decade for the period mid-May‒
November. That means that the hydrologically active season in
recent decades lasted over 40 d longer than forty years ago.

Similar ﬂow trends were described by Hanssen-Bauer et al.
(2019) for other catchments in Svalbard.
The difference between (a) and (b) indices denotes the
number of days with the ﬂow in December‒mid-May that
occurred due to positive air temperatures and rain on snow
events (Sobota, 2020). Such thawing events occurred sporad-
ically in the 20th century. Analyses of simulated ﬂow time
series indicated three years with such events, 2 d in 1984
simulated by HBV Nordic only, 2 d in 1993 simulated by HBV
Nordic and 3 d by HBV, and 6 d in 1995 simulated by the
HBV. In the 21st-century, ﬂow activity in winter months
became common and was simulated by all models in 2002,
2005, 2006, 2011e2018, and 2020. The highest number of
days with winter ﬂow were found in 2016 (22 d simulated by
GR4J and more than 6 d by other models) and 2006 (21 d
simulated by HBV Nordic and more than 6 d by other models).
Based on the simulations obtained from different models
for mid-May‒November, the earliest ﬂow onset date occurred
on the 15th of May 2016, while the latest day with the ﬂow in
mid-May‒November was estimated on the 30th of November
1998, 2016, 2018 and 2020. In other years the onset occurred
later and the cessation of ﬂow period was earlier. The latest
start of ﬂow was simulated by the HBV model on 9 July, 1996.
The earliest end of the active ﬂow season was simulated by the
GR4J model on 31 July, 1987.
A statistically signiﬁcant trend ( p < 0.05) was obtained for
all models and four ﬂow indices except the annual number of
days with the active ﬂow in the calendar year and mid-May‒
November estimated by PRMS and the last day with ﬂow
simulated by FLEX-IS (Table 1). The slope of the trend for the
ﬂow onset date was the smallest for both HBV models (4.1 d
per decade) and the largest for the three models FLEX-IS,
GSM-SOCONT, and GR4J (5.0 d per decade). The cessa-
tion of the ﬂow has been postponed from 5.9 d per decade
(FLEX-IS) up to 10.6 d per decade in the case of the PRMS
model. The statistically signiﬁcant trend of runoff prolonga-
tion was identiﬁed by all models except FLEX-IS. Taking into
account the average of trends calculated by six models, the
mean onset of ﬂow season occurs earlier at the rate of 4.7 d per
decade, whereas the mean cessation of the runoff is observed
approximately 8.4 d per decade later.
4.4. Changes in the ﬂow regime
Based on calculated KGE values, six models were selected
with the best model performance at the calibration and vali-
dation
stages.
These
models
include
FLEX-IS,
GSM-
SOCONT, PRMS, HBV, Nordic HBV, and GR4J. The per-
formance of these models conﬁrms their suitability for simu-
lations
of
hydrological
conditions
in
the
Fuglebekken
catchment. These models were applied to reconstruct past
hydrological conditions in the Fuglebekken catchment in the
period 1979e2020. As the inputs to the models, the observa-
tions from the Hornsund station were taken. Fig. 8 shows
smoothed ﬂow time series simulated by the six models. The
ﬂow values were averaged in the two dimensions over years
and days simultaneously. The outcomes from the six selected
models are similar regarding the earlier occurrence of snow-
melt ﬂoods, increases in autumn ﬂow due to an increase in
precipitation, prolongation of the hydrologically active season
and occurrence of rain on snow events.
The maximum smoothed value of the runoff was obtained
with FLEX-IS and HBV models, reaching approximately
0.09 m3 s1, slightly less with GSM-SOCONT (0.08 m3 s1),
Nordic HBV and GR4J (both around 0.07 m3 s1). The PRMS
model estimated the ﬂow peaks to be ﬂatter, not exceeding
0.05 m3 s1. According to the results of each model, the ﬂow
onset date shifted from the second half of June to the begin-
ning of June. Another characteristic feature is a decrease in
ﬂow from the second half of July to the second half of August
after the snowmelt period. As a consequence of increased
precipitation from the second part of August till November
and positive air temperatures, higher ﬂows are observed. In
recent years the shift in ﬂood seasonality is visible from
snowmelt dominated in the 1980s to a bi-modal ﬂow regime
with two peaks within the annual run. One peak is observed in
June/July due to snowmelt and one in September/October due
to rainfall events. The prolongation of the hydrologically
active season is also visible, as the freeze-up has been delayed
in the last decade in comparison to the seasons of the 1980s.
Figure 9 presents smoothed ﬂow simulated using FLEX-IS,
GSM-SOCONT, PRMS, GR4J, HBV and Nordic HBV models
in the form of the matrix. The colour scale differs between

models. In this way, we highlighted the similarities between
simulations. The period with a hydrologically active stream is
indicated by colours different from red. Comparing colour
patterns, the changes in ﬂow regime are visible. In all cases,
the ﬂows start earlier and last much longer in the last decades
compared to data from the 1980s.
Based on the averaged with MASH tool mean daily ﬂow
simulations, the ManneKendall test was applied to detect
trends of ﬂow time series. Fig. 10 shows statistically
signiﬁcant trends in the ﬂow regime estimated for six models.
The presented results indicated similarities in the estimated
trends between models. The shape of these lines is similar.
Statistically signiﬁcant increases in streamﬂow larger than
0.01 m3 s1 per decade are visible from mid-May till the end
of June and the second part of August till mid-November. The
changes in the period from mid-May to the end of June result
from increases in air temperature and connected decreases of
SWE and earlier snowmelt-driven ﬂoods. The second period
with estimated increases in streamﬂow (second part of August
till mid-November) corresponds well to large changes in
precipitation (Fig. 3).
All selected models simulated decreases in streamﬂow in
July and the ﬁrst part of August. Such changes result from the
earlier disappearance of snow, increases in air temperature and
decreases in precipitation for this period.
Besides similarities in the results, there are also differences
in the estimated slope of trend between models, presented in
Fig. 10. These differences are mainly visible in the magnitude
of these changes. The largest changes (more than 0.01 m3 s1
per decade) were estimated for mid-June by HBV and GSM-
SOCONT. The outcomes from other models are lower and
amount to around 0.007 m3 s1 per decade.
In the second period, with the estimated increase in
streamﬂow, the results were grouped into two categories. The
outcomes
from
FLEX-IS
and
PRMS
indicated
smaller

increases in autumn ﬂows (around 0.002 m3 s1 per decade)
than other models (more than 0.005 m3 s1 per decade).
Negative trends in the ﬂow magnitude have been found for
a period between the beginning of July and the ﬁrst half of
August. The decrease of the runoff is estimated to reach
0.01 m3 s1 per decade. A slightly lower trend was detected by
the PRMS model (0.005 m3 s1 per decade). Flow decline is
related to the reduction of liquid precipitation in the middle of
summer, coupled with a diminished snow cover depth at the
beginning of the ablation season. Less intense accumulation of
snow in winter and spring months melts faster and contributes
to runoff mainly in June when rapid air temperature rise
transforms snow cover into water. The shift in the onset of
positive air temperature, which tends to occur 10 d earlier per
decade, is responsible for accelerated snow cover melting and
a lack of this source of water supply in the middle of the
summer season. As the Fuglebekken catchment is non-
glaciated, precipitation and snow cover are key factors inﬂu-
encing the ﬂow regime.
There are visible differences in the prolongation of the
hydrologically active season. Statistically signiﬁcant increases
in autumn streamﬂow until mid-November were found for
FLEX-IS, GSM-SOCONT, PRMS, and HBV. The outcomes
from HBV Nordic and GR4J indicate a much longer occur-
rence of ﬂow until March. Such results are related to the
applied smoothing (averaging) of simulated time series over
years and days. Events of a few consecutive days with positive
air temperature in the winter season are more common in
recent years, resulting in presence of surface ﬂow in the
simulations. The runoff activity in the middle of the winter
detected by each model, lasted even up to 18 d. Intensive rain
events accompanied unusually high air temperatures in these
periods.
5. Discussion
5.1. Rainfall-runoff modelling
In the High Arctic, the rainfall-runoff modelling ap-
proaches, and especially multimodel studies, are very rare.
Previous studies conducted in Svalbard have mostly focused
on reporting of observed hydrological conditions (Nowak
et al., 2021). Recent enhancement of computational power
has led to the development of models that represent the hy-
drological system in detail through the consideration of
numerous processes involved. When hydrological models are
applied for the reconstruction of the past and projections of
future hydrological conditions, the model structure is likely to
be the main source of uncertainty (Dams et al., 2015). There is
no perfect model, and all of them are conceptual and represent
simpliﬁed descriptions of catchment conditions and hydro-
logical processes. Therefore we analysed multiple models and
selected
the six best-performing ones FLEX-IS, GSM-
SOCONT, and PRSM from the MARRMoT toolbox, and
HBV, Nordic HBV, and GR4J. With help of these models we
were able to reconstruct ﬂow conditions in the period
1979e2020 and estimate changes in ﬂow regime.
Due to the limited availability of ﬂow time series and lack
of data from the beginning of the snowmelt period, the
appropriate calibration and performance of hydrological
models may be uncertain. Combining in-situ runoff measure-
ments with remote sensing techniques helps to improve the
recognition of the catchment functioning. Classiﬁed time-
lapse images provided information on the activity of the
catchment under study and helped verify runoff simulations
beyond the period with in-situ ﬂow measurements. Flow peaks
simulated by hydrological models in spring (before the
installation of the ﬂow meter) and late autumn (after the
deinstallation) were conﬁrmed by the images. This study
demonstrates that the time-lapse imagery with a ﬁxed camera
can be a cost-effective and reliable tool for validating runoff
simulations. Further advancement of satellite- and airborne
remote sensing with higher spatial resolution sensors may
complement
hydrological
investigations
of
small
Arctic
catchments with relatively short and narrow streams, such as
Fuglebekken.
Snow cover duration, accumulation, and disappearance are
very important for modelling hydrological conditions in the
High Arctic. The validation procedure also included a com-
parison to SWE measurements and simulations. This pro-
vided additional information on the hydrological regime,
especially on the timing and magnitude of snowmelt driven

ﬂoods. Snowmelt driven ﬂoods recently appeared earlier and
with a smaller magnitude due to a decrease of SWE observed
in SW Spitsbergen (Osuch and Wawrzyniak, 2017b) and
other Arctic locations (Callaghan et al., 2012; Bring et al.,
2016).
5.2. Flow regime changes
This study conducted for the High Arctic unglaciated
catchment revealed the prolongation of ﬂow season, an earlier
ﬂow onset, and a delay of its cessation. The MASH procedure
allowed detection changes in the hydrometeorological data by
ﬁltering out the effects of periodicity of the variables and their
small-scale variability. Due to data ﬁltering, long-term vari-
ability was emphasised, enabling recognition of the trends and
seasonality in hydrometeorological conditions in the Fugle-
bekken catchment in the period 1979e2020.
Autumn events of intense precipitation that activate the
ﬂow in the catchment after initiatory freeze-up in the last two
decades have become more frequent. An increase in rain-on-
frozen-ground events, occurring from December to April, is
expected to be even more signiﬁcant in the next decades
(Vikhamar-Schuler et al., 2016; Łupikasza et al., 2019; Sobota
et al., 2020). Simulation results of runoff variability in the
Fuglebekken stream correspond to the conclusions raised by
Nowak and Hodson (2013), describing changes occurring in
the Bayelva catchment in 1989e2010, located in the NW
Spitsbergen. Despite its glacierised character, it is also
affected by the increased liquid precipitation in autumn,
resulting in shifts in the ﬂow regime. Similar results have been
recently described by Nowak et al. (2021). These ﬁndings
correspond very well with studies by Arheimer and Lindstrom
(2015), Matti et al. (2016), and Vormoor et al. (2015) that were
carried out for the catchments in the Nordic countries. These
studies have shown that the hydrological regime shifts due to
climate change and varies with location. Our results show that
the ongoing change in ﬂow regime in the highly vulnerable
High Arctic is larger than in lower latitudes.

5.3. Limitations
Hydrological modelling in such remote regions with
limited data together with varying climate conditions involves
larger uncertainty of the results compared to the studies in
lower latitudes mainly due to input data and stationarity of the
model parameters when the model is applied under transient
cryo-hydro-climatological conditions. The greatest limitations
and uncertainties of this study are related to the input data.
Arctic catchments are scharacterised by the limited availabil-
ity of in-situ measurements, and Fuglebekken is not an
exception. The available time series are relatively short, with
gaps in the observations. In addition, the available observa-
tions are subject to large uncertainty. Precipitation, particu-
larly snowfall, is one of the most challenging variables to
measure appropriately. The
quality of the precipitation
measurements depends on site characteristics and environ-
ment, gauge type, and collection method. The systematic
biases include wind-induced undercatch, wetting loss and
underestimation of trace precipitation (Wolff et al., 2015) that
in the rainfall-runoff models are corrected by the precipitation
correction factors. The other input variable, PET and related
evapotranspiration remain one of the least srecognised com-
ponents of the hydrological cycle in the Arctic (Woo et al.,
2008). Although some regional studies in coastal wetlands
of the Canadian Arctic and Alaska do exist (Liljedahl et al.,
2011), they produce contrasting results. Therefore, it is difﬁ-
cult to apply evapotranspiration rates from lower latitudes to
hydrological models in the Arctic environment, such as in
Svalbard, and almost impossible to predict evapotranspiration
changes in hydrometeorological models without appropriate
in-situ measurements.

527

The other limitations result from the lack of long term soil
moisture and groundwater measurements. Models were cali-
brated and validated only on streamﬂow, which may cause
problems identifying model structure and model parameters.
The maintenance of modern hydrometeorological monitoring
in the upcoming years will provide additional time series (e.g.
evaporation, active layer thickness, soil moisture, groundwater
level). The extension of the length of the data series will allow
the improvement of parameter representativeness and hence
the reduction of parametric uncertainty.
6. Conclusions
This study investigated the impact of changes in hydro-
meteorological conditions on the ﬂow regime in a High Arctic
unglaciated catchment. It was simulated with the help of an
ensemble of different rainfall-runoff models. The applicability
of the models was tested by validation of simulations using
archival ﬂow observations, time-lapse imagery and SWE ob-
servations. The calibration and validation results indicated that
multiple rainfall-runoff models describe well present and past
hydrological conditions in the Fuglebekken catchment.
The presented results document that the hydrological
regime of the Fuglebekken catchment has already shifted due
to changes in the climate of this region. A statistically sig-
niﬁcant increase in runoff was detected for two periods from
mid-May to the end of June and the second part of August till
mid-November. The changes in the ﬁrst period result from
increases in air temperature and earlier occurrence of
snowmelt driven ﬂoods. An estimated runoff increase in the
second period corresponds to large changes in precipitation.
A decrease in runoff was estimated in July and the ﬁrst part
of August as a consequence of the increases in air temper-
ature, earlier disappearance of snow and decreases in
precipitation.
In addition, statistically signiﬁcant changes were estimated
in the number of days with the active ﬂow during the calendar
year (10.8 d per decade), and during the mid-MayNovember
period (9.8 d per decade), the date of the ﬁrst day with the ﬂow
(4.7 d per decade) and the last day with the ﬂow during mid-
May-November (8.4 d per decade).
The present hydrological regime differs signiﬁcantly from
that observed in the past. The magnitude of the changes is
larger compared to lower latitudes as these analyses were
performed for the area with one of the fastest-warming on
Earth.
