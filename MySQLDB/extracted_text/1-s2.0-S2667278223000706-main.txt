Introduction: Community satisfaction and risk perception are important in addressing the challenges posed
by climate change and developing comprehensive and equitable climate policy. This study focused on under-
standing the relationship between the risk perception of future local devastation due to climate change and
community satisfaction in British Columbia, Canada.
Methods: Using British Columbia Climate Distress Monitoring System data, we conducted a multivariate
logistical analysis to examine this association while considering confounders and independent predictors,
including age, gender, income, education, ethnicity, population density, and political orientation.
Results: The results revealed that the perception of an increased risk of future local devastation due to climate
change was negatively associated with neighborhood satisfaction. However, no statistical relationship was
found between housing satisfaction and risk perception. Furthermore, individuals who had experienced dis-
placement from natural disasters, identiﬁed as women, belonged to Indigenous communities, or held liberal
political views were more likely to perceive higher climate risks. In contrast, a higher income level (above
$90,000) and increased population density had the opposite effect on such risk perception.
Conclusions: These ﬁndings emphasize the importance of community satisfaction in shaping the perceived risk of
climate disasters and informing the development of climate mitigation and adaptation policies. A cohesive commu-
nity can help individuals cope with climate disasters mentally, physically, and ﬁnancially. It is essential for equitable
policy-making processes to address disparities in race, age, gender, income, and political orientation when consider-
ing the impact of climate change and policy readiness. Building climate-resilient communities involves strengthen-
ing social connections, integrating community resources, and supporting vulnerable populations.

1. Introduction
The increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters
induced by climate change, such as heatwaves, storms, droughts, and
ﬂooding, pose considerable threats to human health, local communi-
ties, and the environment [1−3]. In the best-case scenario modeled
by scientists in which carbon reductions exceed carbon emissions,
the average global temperatures are predicted to reach at least 1.5 °C
above pre-industrial levels by 2040 and could rise to 1.6 °C by 2060
[4].
The latest report from the 27th Conference of the Parties (COP27)
implies that the goal to limit the global average temperature rise to
1.5 °C is losing viability as many countries and corporations fail to
reduce their carbon emissions [5]. Scientists forecast a worrying
future in which heatwaves and storm-induced ﬂoods will likely hap-
pen more frequently and intensely [1,2,4].
British Columbia (B.C.), Canada, also faces a signiﬁcant threat from
climate change-induced disasters. In 2021, two natural disasters
intensiﬁed by climate change wreaked havoc on the communities in
British Columbia, Canada. The 2021 Western North America heat-
wave was an unprecedented extreme weather event, breaking the
highest temperature records in multiple cities in British Columbia. At
the end of the weather event, 619 excessive deaths in B.C. were
caused by the extreme heat dome [6]. The 2021 Paciﬁc Northwest
ﬂoods in November affected B.C., Canada, and parts of Washington
State in the United States, causing more than 600, 000 deaths of farm
animals and at least $CDN 450 million in insured damage [7]. The
ﬂoods disrupted the supply chain in B.C., causing shortages of tempo-
rary goods, food, and gas. Studies suggest extreme ﬂoods driven by
atmospheric rivers in Paciﬁc Northwest will be more substantial, fre-
quent, and hazardous due to a rapidly changing climate [8−10].
As the impacts of climate change will likely become more intensi-
ﬁed in the near future, it may be important to improve individuals’
climate preparedness and resiliency, particularly through the lens of
community.

concept referring to the strength and number of social relations and
the level of social trust and satisfaction among members of the same
neighborhood, is linked to physical and mental well-being [11−16].
Neighborhood cohesion can increase community resilience and
serve as a stress buffer during natural disasters [11,17,18]. In cohesive
communities, there is a higher propensity for resource and informa-
tion sharing, which can help community members better cope with
traumatic events [16,19]. Studies conducted in ﬂood-prone areas of
England, the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and the 2005
Hurricane Katrina in the United States have shown that individuals
residing in communities perceived as more cohesive experienced
less psychological and ﬁnancial distress and recovered faster from
natural disasters [17,20−23]. These ﬁndings underscore the necessity
of building cohesive and close-knit communities when facing
unprecedented climate-related disasters.
In addition to community cohesion, housing, and neighborhood
factors, though generally relegated as planning issues are important
to consider as socio-environmental drivers that can inﬂuence the
experience of climate impacts [24]. For instance, the design and oper-
ation of green housing and neighborhood can impact the vulnerabil-
ity of a population to climate change [25]. While the effects of
climate change may vary across different neighborhoods and com-
munities, research suggests that climate change vulnerability is exac-
erbated in more deprived and peripheral areas, which often include
higher numbers of homeless individuals, elderly residents, children,
and ethnic minority groups [26−28].
Furthermore, risk perception of climate change plays an integral
role in climate mitigation and adaptation policies, as well as migra-
tion and home-purchasing decisions [1,29,30]. Studies have consis-
tently shown that the perception of a greater risk leads to increased
advocacy for and implementation of climate-related policies [1,31
−33]. Various sociodemographic factors, including age, gender, edu-
cation, personal experience with extreme weather events, political
orientation, and geographical proximity to climate-affected areas,
have impacted individuals’ perception of climate change risks [34
−38]. These factors, especially income and education, are often asso-
ciated with the type of community individuals reside in and their
level of community cohesion and satisfaction [39,40]. Thus, under-
standing the determinants linked to climate risk perception and com-
munity
satisfaction
may
be
imperative
for
enhancing
the
preparedness of individuals and communities in the face of climate
change.
Consequently, our study aimed to examine the effects of commu-
nity satisfaction, along with other perception-related predictors, on
the perceived likelihood of future local devastation due to climate
change. Within the context of our research, community satisfaction
comprises two components: housing satisfaction and neighborhood
satisfaction. The perception of local devastation caused by climate
change serves as a projection based on future scenarios. We hypothe-
sized that individuals experiencing lower levels of community satis-
faction might perceive a greater risk of future local climate-induced
devastation, potentially due to social and ﬁnancial deprivation, as
well as limited community cohesion, rendering them more suscepti-
ble to the impacts of climate change. On the other hand, higher levels
of housing and neighborhood satisfaction may correlate with higher
income and more abundant community resources, contributing to
the perception of lower risk.
2. Methods
2.1. Data Collection
We used pooled data from the British Columbia Climate Distress
Monitoring System (BC-CDMS), an ongoing serial online survey-
based study assessing the mental health impacts of climate-related
events among British Columbia (B.C.), Canada, residents [41]. Data
were collected via the Survey Monkey Platform.
Online paid advertisements on Facebook and Instagram were
used to recruit participants. Participants were eligible for the survey
if they were over the age of 16, residing in B.C., provided informed
consent, and could complete the survey in English. Participants were
excluded if they had repeated responses over the three waves to
ensure the samples were independent.
The data used for this study were pooled from three BC-CDMS
survey waves. Wave one was conducted shortly before the 2021
Western North America heat wave (between May 12, 2021, and Jun
21, 2021) [41]; wave two was conducted after the same heat wave
(between Jul 15, 2021, and Jul 18, 2021); and wave three was con-
ducted after the 2021 Paciﬁc Northwest Atmospheric River and
Flooding (between Nov 30, 2021 and Dec 4, 2021) [41].
Each survey wave conducted as part of the BC-CDMS was
reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Board at Simon Fraser
University (Protocol #30000309).
2.3. Variables
The outcome variable was the self-reported perception of the risk
of local devastation due to climate change. Participants were asked,
"Thinking of where you currently live, how likely or unlikely is it that
your region will be devastated due to climate-related changes? (e.g.,
ﬂoods, forest ﬁres, drought, loss of agriculture)" and responded on a
5-point Likert Scale ranging from "Very unlikely" to "Very likely." We
dichotomized this variable (very/somewhat likely vs. unsure/some-
what unlikely/very unlikely) based on the response distribution.
It is worth noting that the concept of local devastation was not
deﬁned in the survey due to the assumption that participants were
likely to have personally experienced the unprecedented heatwave
and ﬂooding in 2021 and understood what local devastation caused
by climate change meant.
The exposure variables were neighborhood and housing satisfac-
tion scores. The questions were asked initially as "Overall, how satis-
ﬁed are you with your current housing?" and "Overall, how satisﬁed
are you with your current neighborhood?" The response to the two
questions was on a Likert scale: very satisﬁed, satisﬁed, neither satis-
ﬁed nor dissatisﬁed, dissatisﬁed, very dissatisﬁed. We reversed the
response order and treated the two variables as discrete values, in
which a higher score denoted higher satisfaction.
We also controlled for self-reported age group, gender, ethnicity,
income level, education, employment, family/relationship status, pre-
vious history of environmental displacement, number of media sour-
ces people acquire news from, political orientation, and population
density at the postal code level [34−38]. The categories for each of
these variables are outlined in Table 1. The unit of population density
was the number of people per square kilometer. This variable was
applied to the 2016 Canadian census data at forward sortation area
(people / square km): < 300 = "Rural", 300 −1500 = "Suburban",
and >= 1500 = "Urban". Design effects of the survey wave and time
spent on social media per day (less than 2 h, 2 h or more) were also
included as potential confounders.
2.4. Data analysis
All statistical analyses were completed in RStudio. Missing values
within all variables were excluded (n = 798). Descriptive statistics
were stratiﬁed by the two levels of the outcome variable, provided
with x2 statistics for categorical variables and Kruskal−Wallis tests
for continuous variables. We applied a multivariate logistic regres-
sion model to explore the associations between the outcome (i.e.,
risk perception of local devastation due to climate change) and the
two exposures of interest (i.e., neighborhood satisfaction and housing
satisfaction) and controlled for covariates and confounders. Adjusted

odds ratios and 95% conﬁdence intervals were reported accordingly.
Moreover, we reported the cross-tabulation between the perception
of potential relocation due to climate disasters in the future (wave
three only) and the perceived likelihood of local devastation.
3. Results
906 participants were included in pooled analyses based on the
three waves of data collection (N₁= 365, N₂= 1291, N₃= 246). Among
all the participants, 54.5% believed it was very or somewhat likely
that the neighborhood they lived in would be devastated by climate
change.
Table 1 displays the studied population’s demographic character-
istics and bivariate associations between these descriptive factors.
Most participants were white (79.9%), employed (86.2%), partnered
(75.2%), aged from 25-64 years (75%), and somewhat satisﬁed with
their neighborhood (84%) and housing situation (75.4%). Approxi-
mately half of the participants were liberal (55. 4%), had at least a
bachelor’s degree (52.8%), followed the news somewhat closely
(47.6%), reported annual income between $30,000 to $89,999
(44.9%), and spent less than 2 h on social media (52.9%). Men (48.2%)
and women (47.2%) were approximately equally sampled.
3.1. Logistic regression
The multivariate logistic regression model (see Table 2) suggested
that perception of a greater (i.e., "very/somewhat likely) risk of local
devastation due to climate change was associated with a greater

neighborhood dissatisfaction score (AOR=
0.78 [0.63−0.96]). How-
ever, housing disapproval did not signiﬁcantly affect risk perception.
Additionally, perception of a greater climate risk was also found to be
positively associated with a previous history of being displaced due
to natural disasters (AOR= 2.39 [1.32−1.42]), those identifying as a
woman (AOR=
1.51 [1.05−2.16]), Indigenous identity (AOR=
3.01
[1.30-7.35]), and liberal political orientation (AOR=
1.82 [1.63
−2.04]). In contrast, the income level at $90 000 or more (AOR= 0.36
[0.22−0.61]) and population density (AOR= 0.99 [0.98−0.99]) were
associated with the perception of lower climate risk.
4. Discussion
4.1. Primary ﬁnding
This study’s primary ﬁnding suggested that the perception of a
greater risk of local devastation due to climate change was associated
with higher neighborhood dissatisfaction. In other words, those less
satisﬁed with their neighborhood perceived higher risks from climate
change.
This aligns with previous studies indicating a positive association
between risk perception of natural disasters and neighborhood dis-
satisfaction [11,17,18]. However, we did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant associa-
tion between climate risk perception and housing disapproval. This
suggests that climate change risk perception may depend more on
one’s perception of community satisfaction than their housing situa-
tion alone.
4.2. Implications
One possible explanation for our primary ﬁnding could be related
to social capital, which is associated with greater resilience to natural
disasters [21]. Social capital encompasses community resources, such
as trust, resource sharing, community centers, and a sense of collec-
tive identity, all of which have been well-studied as determinants of
health-related outcomes [42−44].
Neighborhoods with higher levels of social capital may be better
equipped to respond to and recover from climate-related natural dis-
asters. This greater community capacity could contribute to the per-
ception of lower risk. Within these communities, the social resources
and support networks may help buffer against the perceived threats
posed by climate-change-related weather events and disasters. In
contrast, those residing in communities with limited social capital
and community support may feel more vulnerable to the impacts of
climate disasters, therefore perceiving the risk to be higher.
Furthermore, neighborhoods are often closely related to individu-
als’ education, income, and other sociodemographic characteristics
[39,40]. Wealthy neighborhoods may have more public resources
available for collective activities and better-developed social infra-
structure, whereas disadvantaged neighborhoods may suffer from
underfunding and a lack of organization and management. In this
context, the concept of community can serve as a proxy for an indi-
vidual’s socioeconomic status, which may play an important role in
shaping their perception of risk during emergency events.
In addition, people more attached to and satisﬁed with their
neighborhood may perceive it as safer and more resilient. Commu-
nity is not merely a physical or geographical space but often repre-
sents a sense of cultural, psychological, and resource connection
[42,45]. Lack of community satisfaction can reinforce the hyper-indi-
vidualistic nature of society and contribute to psychological distress
over social inequity and exclusion as well as marginalization [42,46].
Studies in British Columbia and Canada have indicated that
greater neighborhood cohesion and housing stability are linked to
better health outcomes [42,47]. On the other hand, neighborhood

rezoning, gentriﬁcation, and unaffordability consistently create social
and economic barriers and reinforce the stigma of marginalized pop-
ulations [42]. For instance, social isolation, lack of urban greenery,
and neighborhood deprivation were signiﬁcantly associated with
excess mortality during the catastrophic 2021 heat dome in B.C. [48].
Our study and others have shown that improving community sat-
isfaction and cohesion should be included in climate policy, as collec-
tive action is more likely to help community members withstand
climate disasters. Also, future domestic and international climate ref-
ugees may transform the neighborhood landscape and resource
availability, requiring policymakers and urban planners to allocate
resources equitably and create more robust and cohesive communi-
ties.
4.3. Limitations
The cross-sectional online data in this study was not randomly
sampled, which may introduce information and selection biases,
thereby potentially compromising the reliability and reproducibility
of our ﬁndings. Moreover, the survey itself was relatively short and
lacked comprehensive details concerning climate risk perception and
community satisfaction, which restricts the extent to which we could
delve deeper into these topics.
Furthermore, the survey did not provide a clear deﬁnition of the
term "local" and failed to specify the timeline regarding perceived
risk associated with climate change. As such, it may be helpful for
future research to include clearer deﬁnitions and more precise meas-
urements of these terms.
4.4. Future research
To better understand the relationship between community satis-
faction and climate risk perception, future research could use more
comprehensive surveys to capture the nuances of these concepts.
More detailed questions and complex scales could better measure
community satisfaction, climate risk perception, and their determi-
nants.
Also, to ensure that the ﬁndings are generalizable to the broader
population in B.C., future studies could use random sampling techni-
ques for data collection. This would help to produce more representa-
tive samples, allowing for more accurate and reliable conclusions.
5. Conclusion
The impact of climate change on the daily lives of people in B.C. is
expected to escalate over time. Our study found that neighborhood
dissatisfaction was associated with the perception of greater climate
risk.
Additionally,
sociodemographic
factors,
including
gender,
income, and political and racial identities, were found to inﬂuence
this risk perception among the survey participants in B.C.
These ﬁndings may carry insights for policymakers and planners
who aim to enhance climate resilience at the community level. By
investing in collective preparedness and fostering climate-resilient
communities, policymakers and community stakeholders can pro-
mote climate preparedness and resilience more effectively. This
accentuates the importance of a proactive approach in building a
more resilient and robust future in the face of climate change.
