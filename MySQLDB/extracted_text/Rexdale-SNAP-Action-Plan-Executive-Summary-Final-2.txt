THE REXDALE SNAP 
“A Thriving Community Growing in Harmony with Nature and Neighbours” 
The Rexdale Sustainable Neighbourhood Action Plan (SNAP) is a comprehensive plan for neighbourhood 
resilience and revitalization that integrates local community interests, sustainability objectives, and climate 
adaptation strategies under the overarching theme of “a thriving community growing in harmony with nature 
and neighbours”. 
Rexdale was selected for the SNAP program through a neighbourhood screening process that was led by 
Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) and multiple divisions within the City of Toronto. The 
screening process identified geographical areas with overlapping climate vulnerabilities and environmental and 
urban renewal priorities that required intensified action and a collaborative approach for action. 
Key priorities that make Rexdale a well-suited neighbourhood for the SNAP program include: 
• 
Neighbourhood Improvement Area (NIA) – Rexdale is an area with vulnerable populations, concentrated 
poverty, and serious food insecurity.  
• 
Residential Retrofit Needs – Rexdale has seen almost no development/redevelopment in the last 60 years, 
and the residential sector offers significant opportunities for both climate mitigation and resilience, and 
overall housing improvements.  
• 
Low Tree Canopy – Rexdale has a low tree canopy cover compared to the rest of Toronto.  
• 
Flooding – Areas within Rexdale are subject to riverine flooding, with some residences located within the 
regional/100-year flood plain and vulnerable to basement flooding. 
• 
Low Impact Development (LID) Priority Area – Rexdale’s location within the watershed, the presence of 
medium-high impervious soils, and a depth to water table (conducive to infiltration) make it a high priority 
area for LID retrofits.  
• 
Erosion – Rexdale has various erosion and restoration opportunity sites along branches of the Humber River.  
• 
Sensitive Target Fish Species – Sensitive target fish species have been identified in sections of the Humber 
River crossing through the neighbourhood. 
• 
Discharges to Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) – Rexdale’s stormwater system discharges to a 
downstream ESA. 
• 
Urban Heat Stress – Areas within Rexdale are vulnerable to urban heat stress.  
• 
Aging Park Infrastructure – Aging park infrastructure and changes in neighbourhood demographics present 
an opportunity for park revitalization.  
• 
Humber as a Canadian Heritage River – This designation offers an opportunity to work with Indigenous 
communities and multiple levels of government to enhance nature-based and history education.  
• 
Planned Capital Projects – Through the SNAP program, a series of planned capital projects can be leveraged 
to achieve environmental resilience and social impacts.  
• 
Existing Programs and Strategies – Community initiatives and great collaboration are already taking place in 
Rexdale, offering opportunities to join forces to achieve efficiencies and maximize impact in the community.

THE ACTION PLAN CO-DEVELOPMENT PROCESS 
The SNAP planning process uses a highly collaborative approach, bringing together community members with 
technical staff for the co-creation of an Action Plan with shared outcomes. 
Figure 2: Who Is Involved? 
 
The SNAP action plan was developed in parallel to a neighborhood-based climate resilience strategy using a 
three-phase approach. In phase 1, analysis of baseline conditions and scoping of issues and opportunities was 
undertaken. Climate trends and associated local risks were also studied. In phase 2, motivational themes for 
the community were identified and guiding principles co-developed. In this phase, perceptions of local risks and 
assets from the community’s point of view were also documented and a vulnerability assessment was 
completed. In phase 3 the overall action plan was co-developed, including recommendations for all action 
areas, climate adaptation strategies, and measures of success.

Figure 3: SNAP Action Planning Process 
 
Rexdale’s SNAP planning process was coordinated with the Rexdale Community Hub’s (RCH) Northwest Toronto 
Neighbourhood Engagement Initiative (NTNEI), which looked at opportunities to improve both indoor and 
outdoor community spaces in addition to a food mapping analysis. As such, engagement activities were 
coordinated between the RCH and TRCA and designed to achieve both groups’ objectives. Recommendations 
from the NTNEI were incorporated into this Action Plan, and vice versa.

LOCAL SUSTAINABILITY THEMES 
Through the technical analyses completed as part of the action planning process and based on robust staff and 
community engagement, six local sustainability themes that reflect the “flavour” of the Rexdale community and 
the vision of the Action Plan were identified. These themes are based on local sustainability priorities, 
community interests, and technical objectives. Each theme characterizes a specific environmental or social 
focus.  
Within each theme, a set of guiding principles and domains have been identified and, collectively, these themes, 
principles, and domains have guided the development of the Action Plan. These themes will also inform the 
design of specific projects and initiatives that are carried out under this plan moving forward, with each project 
or initiative striving to integrate as many themes and guiding principles as possible.  
Strong Infrastructure and Community Service: The community feels that the infrastructure in the 
neighbourhood, including housing, is not as well maintained, safe, or beautiful as in other parts of Toronto. 
Residents want to improve user experience through partnerships with government and other sectors. Climate 
vulnerabilities from the built environment in this neighbourhood should also be promptly addressed. 
Healthy Environment for Outdoor Enjoyment: The community loves to spend time in nature and is interested in 
improving access and offering nature-based education. Habitat and urban forest should be enhanced, and 
erosion in the Humber Valley must be addressed. On-site stormwater management, through LID measures, 
should be implemented across the neighbourhood. More programming should be delivered. 
Skills and Capacity for Jobs, and Affordability: The community expressed its struggles with the cost of living in 
Toronto and is interested in approaches and supports to achieve cost savings and enhanced opportunities for 
income generation. 
Community Connections, Empowerment, and Pride: The community strongly values unity and neighbourhood 
relationships, and therefore wants additional support to enhance and celebrate community cohesion. 
Community Health and Well-Being: Mental and physical health, and food security, are very strong priorities for 
the community and should be addressed through all Action Areas in the Action Plan. The community has strong 
family values that should be supported and celebrated. 
Spiritual Values: Rexdale is a spiritual community. Residents often mentioned how they translate their religious 
values into their day-to-day life. The community is especially interested in expanding its current mutual aid 
practices and facilitating mind-body activities for all ages.

prioritizing areas of heat stress.  
• 
Consider delivering the GreenforceTO program in Rexdale. 
CLIMATE VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT AND RESILIENCE 
STRATEGY 
A “High-Level Climate Resilience Strategy for Rexdale” was developed in parallel with the Action Plan. The 
resilience strategy has been published under a separate report, and key climate adaptation recommendations 
have been incorporated into the four Action Areas of the Rexdale SNAP Action Plan. This section provides a 
summary of the “High-Level Climate Resilience Strategy for Rexdale”. 
Climate Trends 
• 
Under a high emissions scenario, air temperature in Toronto is expected to increase in all seasons and on 
average across the year.  
• 
Warmer winter temperatures can lead to more precipitation falling as rain instead of snow. Warmer 
temperatures can also increase the frequency, intensity, and severity of storms as warmer air can hold 
more moisture to produce storms.  
• 
Projections also indicate an increase in the average number of extreme heat days in a year.  
• 
As temperatures warm, the number of extreme cold days are expected to decrease.  
Rexdale SNAP Action Plan Executive Summary 
Toronto and Region Conservation Authority    |    12 
• 
Precipitation is expected to increase on an annual basis in Toronto. Spring and winter precipitation are 
expected to see the greatest percentage increase by the end of the century, coupled with warmer 
temperatures, can increase the risk of flooding. 
• 
On average, a slight decrease in summer precipitation is anticipated, making hotter and drier summers 
possible.  
Vulnerability Assessment 
A vulnerability assessment conducted for the neighbourhood provided insight into the level of specific 
community risks posed by climate change, identified existing vulnerabilities within the neighbourhood, 
incorporated local knowledge on risks and assets, and was used to inform resilience strategies. The climate 
change vulnerability assessment recognizes climate change risk as a confluence of multiple factors including 
hazard, exposure, vulnerability, and adaptive capacity.

Adaptation and Resilience Strategies 
A total of 32 strategies were identified across the five phases of the Disaster Management Cycle, based on 
technical analysis and public engagement. Each strategy was evaluated, based on 1) its impact addressing one or 
more climate impacts, and 2) the level of effort required to implement it. A potential implementation lead was 
also identified for each strategy. Key strategies were integrated into the four Action Areas of the Action Plan. A 
complete list of the 32 strategies is included in Appendix C of the Action Plan Report.  
Following is a summary of key opportunities for climate adaptation that were identified in Rexdale’s 
Neighbourhood Resilience Strategy. Many of these opportunities also address other sustainability goals, like GHG 
reduction. 
 
• 
Tower revitalization: most of the housing stock in Rexdale is comprised of apartments (61% of the housing 
stock) and most were constructed before 1980. Many have outdated, vulnerable energy systems, poor 
ventilation and air conditioning, drainage/ flooding issues and lack of spaces to meet. 
• 
Public transit accessibility and active transportation: currently, most people within the neighbourhood 
commute by car. Overall, transit accessibility is low in this northwest corner of the city, though some 
improvements are being made (e.g., Finch West LRT). There is a lack of cycling infrastructure in the 
neighbourhood, particularly in the East-West direction. 
• 
Enhanced knowledge and awareness of climate change-related risks such as flooding, risks related to 
extreme heat, vector-borne diseases, and winter storms, while building on the lessons learned through the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 
• 
Flood risk reduction by encouraging site-level flood prevention and stormwater management measures, 
regularly inspecting SWM infrastructure, and relocating structures from the flood plain (where possible). 
• 
Tree canopy cover and access to greenspace, especially in the northern part of the neighbourhood and 
areas with heat stress. Improvements can also be made to improve pedestrian experience and wayfinding. 
• 
Sense of community, mutual aid, and the sharing economy by creating more opportunities for residents to 
meet one another and maintaining and strengthening the mutual support and sharing already in place. 
• 
Food access by growing and preserving food locally and increasing affordable (or free) food outlets. 
• 
Development of a resilience hub where residents can go for shelter and basic needs during an emergency, 
and on an ongoing basis during normal periods for increased community resilience. 
MEASURING SUCCESS 
The Rexdale SNAP has been designed to address core environmental and socio-economic priorities, which 
support numerous municipal and TRCA plans and strategies. To measure impact and success over time, a 
framework of long-term neighbourhood-scale outcomes has been identified based on the Action Plan’s shared 
objectives.
