Background: Heat is becoming a global public health concern. This paper presents a comprehensive Twitter
data analysis (2011−2023) to gain insights into public perceptions of heatwaves and their health-related
concerns.
Methods: A number (N = 2,070,197) of ﬁltered tweets were included for analysis after preprocessing.
Utilizing the Extractor of Demographic Characteristics (EDC) module, we extracted demographic attrib-
utes, including user type, gender, and age, highlighting the diverse voices in the Twitter conversation.
Sentiment and emotional analyses were conducted utilizing BERT models. An active learning content
analysis approach was employed using the GPT-3 model to identify health outcomes and concerns
related to heat waves.
Results: Our results show that joy and anger were the dominant emotions, reﬂecting positive and negative
sentiments surrounding heat waves. Public sentiment varied, revealing concern and optimism in response to
changing weather patterns.
In terms of health outcomes, the paper categorizes and analyzes a wide range of concerns during heat waves,
from heat-related illnesses to mental health issues. These ﬁndings provide valuable insights into how differ-
ent health concerns are distributed across gender, user type, and age categories. An overview of the measures
people took to control these issues was also given.
Conclusions: This study illustrates the evolving dynamics of public emotional responses to heat waves,
offering a holistic view of the various health-related concerns raised by the public during these extreme
weather events. Such insights are essential for informing public health strategies and emergency responses
to mitigate the adverse effects of heat waves and protect vulnerable populations.

1. Introduction
Earth’s climate has dramatically changed throughout history [1].
With a recorded temperature rise of about 1.8°F (1 °C) from 1901 to
2020, as reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis-
tration [2], it is predicted to be 2−4° ( °C) higher than pre-industrial
levels by 2100 [3]. This planet-warming has resulted in severe and
more frequent extreme weather events (e.g., ﬂooding, intense
storms, droughts.) [4]. Some are even happening faster than scientists
previously assessed and predicted [5,6]. Based on the National Aero-
nautics and Space Administration reports, scientists have high conﬁ-
dence that global temperature will continue to rise for many
decades, resulting in more intense and longer heat waves [7].
Studies have shown that this heat is becoming a public health
concern [8−10] and one of the "most underappreciated hazards of
climate change," as stated by Philip, S.P. in Nature’s editorial [8].
NOAA described it as one of the most deadly weather phenomena
[2]. More than thirty million people have died because of the occur-
rence of extreme weather events in the last 30 years in urban and
non-urban areas [11] and increased populations’ exposure to mor-
bidity and mortality from extreme heat and related heat illnesses
[12,13]. Some regions are predicted to become uninhabitable due to
the already exceeded life-threatening thresholds during heat waves
[14]. Heat impacts on human health vary from direct impacts such
as fatigue, headaches, malnutrition, changes in disease transmission,
and death to indirect impacts such as productivity drop and violence
and crime [15−19]. However, public recognition of climate change
and its impact on economics and the environment is still an issue
with signiﬁcant societal and even political implications, which urges
research on heat adaptation and awareness [20].

Heat adaptation research remains limited to developed countries,
particularly metropolitan areas [21]. The limitation is mainly due to
the scarcity of data directly linking heat waves to health issues. For
instance, researchers have resorted to data from occupational acci-
dent reports and ambulance call-outs to overcome data shortages
[22,23]. However, people do not necessarily report to their doctors
and local hospitals when they are subject to mild symptoms of issues
caused by extreme heat events [24], which limits the generalizability
of the ﬁndings. Few studies have also resorted to surveys to collect
data on the measures people take to adapt to heat waves [25]. How-
ever, little attention has been paid to data coming from social media
expressing people’s concerns about heat waves affecting their health.
Twitter, currently named X, is one of the most frequently used social
media platforms in research [26] and has been shown to be a useful
tool for public health research in surveillance, event detection, and
disease tracking and forecasting [27].
In this study, we aimed to explore the potential utility of large
available social media data in determining the impact of heat waves
on health outcomes. We collected Twitter text data to (1) explore the
reactions and health issues that people admitted having as a result of
heat waves, (2) investigate the measures taken by both people and
organizations to overcome these impacts, and (3) investigate the dif-
ferences in reactions across different types of users (based on gender,
age, and account type). Our paper contributes to extending the appli-
cations of disaster-related Twitter studies to heat waves, which are
severe and destructive natural hazards.
2. Data and methods
2.1. Data collection
Twitter, currently named X, is a social network with around
313 million monthly active users in 2020 [28]. To build the database
for this study, we utilized the functionalities of the Twitter API v2
through a developer account. The data collected was limited to
tweets written in English and posted over 13 years (January 2010 -
May 2023). We used the following keywords to select Tweets that
conveyed
only
perceptions
about
heat
waves:
’heat
wave’,
’heatwave’, ’sweltering heat’, ’unbearable heat’, ’torrid heat’, ’heat
warning’, ’heat watch’, ’heatstroke’, ’heat stroke’, and ’extreme
temperature’. This list was built based on the keywords used in other
systematic reviews capturing heat waves’ impact on health [29−33].
We excluded retweets and replies [34,35].
2.2. Data preprocessing
Subsequently, the dataset of fetched tweets (6,647,792 tweets)
underwent preprocessing, which involved the following steps: dupli-
cation removal, lowercasing, format-noise cleaning, and topic-noise
cleaning. The ﬁnal dataset of clean, relevant tweets consisted of
2,070,197 data instances. More information on the preprocessing is
available in Appendix 01.
2.3. Extractor of demographic characteristics
The Extractor of Demographic Characteristic (EDC) module was
utilized to extract three demographic attributes, namely user type,
gender, and age, by analyzing proﬁle images, screen names, names,
and biographies [36]. User type and gender were modeled as binary
classiﬁcation tasks, while age was categorized into four classes: ≤18,
19−29, 30−39, and ≥40 years [36]. Fine-tuning was performed across
all pipelines to ensure accurate extraction of demographic features.
More details about this methodology can be found elsewhere [37,38].
2.4. Sentiment analysis, emotion analysis, and text classiﬁcation
We utilized RoBERTa and SiEBERT to conduct sentiment analysis
and the BERT model for emotion classiﬁcation [39−41]. We also uti-
lized GPT-3 for text classiﬁcation to identify the main topics or health
issues covered in the tweets [42]. The authors manually coded a sam-
ple of 30,000 tweets, and then the model was trained to consider the
initial codes identiﬁed. The label creation was done in a qualitative,
inductive way. Saturation was reached after coding 1208 tweets.
3. Results
3.1. General statistics
Table 1 presents a breakdown of the tweets collected for a study
focusing on heatwaves and their impact on people. The dataset con-
sisted of a total of 2,070,197 tweets. Most of these tweets (76.06 %)
were written by individuals, while 24.04 % came from corporate
accounts.
Across the individuals, 70.22 % of the accounts that tweeted about
heatwave belonged to men, while only 29.78 % belonged to females.
A majority of 56.93 % were over 39 years old, and 20.49 % were
between 19 and 39 years old. Only 13.07 % of the account holders
were under 19 years old.
Regarding emotions expressed in these heatwave-related tweets,
joy emerged as the emotion (38.81 %), closely followed by anger
(33.15 %). Fear was conveyed in 11.45 % of the tweets, while sadness
comprised around 10.55 %. Love was mentioned in 5.54 % of the
tweets, whereas surprise was observed in about 0.53 %. Moreover,
when examining the sentiment of tweets regarding heatwaves, it is
evident that the average sentiment score is 0.608, with a deviation of
0.4647. The data indicates that slightly over half of the tweets
(53.04 %) express a positive sentiment, while the remaining tweets
(around 46.96 %) convey a negative sentiment.
3.2. Twitter’s sentiment polarity perspective
Analyzing the sentiments over time in Fig. 1 reveals discernible
seasonal patterns, particularly during summer, where peaks in both
negative and positive sentiments are evident. This observation aligns
with the anticipation that heat waves are more prevalent during

summer. It suggests that individuals may be more inclined to express
their sentiments about heat waves when they personally experience
them rather than merely commenting on distant occurrences in other
locations. The ﬂuctuations in sentiment throughout the summer
months underscore the importance of considering the actual experi-
ences individuals have with heat waves, as reﬂected in their willing-
ness to engage in tweeting about these climatic events. In the years
of famous heat waves, sentiment appeared consistently negative, as
shown in Fig. 1, with a signiﬁcant dip in 2021, 2013, and 2022, sug-
gesting potentially severe or impactful heat waves. These events
coincide with three important heat events. First, the Summer 2012
North American heat wave was one of the most severe heat waves in
modern North American history and resulted in many deaths as it
was not well predicted, which could explain the dip in negative emo-
tions but the low positive reactions by tweeters [43]. Second, the
year 2013 is the fourth warmest year globally since records began in
1880 [44]. However, it recorded more positive tweets. This could be
explained by how "less surprised" people were this year compared to
the year before, considering that 2012 was already hot. Additionally,
NASA rated 2022 the ﬁfth-warmest year on record. This could explain
the abundance of negative tweets for these two years [45]. However,
over the years, the positive sentiment rates grew more importantly
to align with the negative sentiment rates. This could indicate
improved responses to heatwaves, mitigation efforts, and personal
preparedness for heatwaves, highlighting the evolving dynamics of
how people perceive and respond to this environmental challenge.
The recent positive sentiment on Twitter towards heatwaves
appears to stem from an ironic or satirical reaction, skewing senti-
ment analysis results towards positivity. This irony, particularly in
the context of extreme heat, highlights the nuanced public reaction
captured over recent years. Analysis of sentiment during signiﬁcant
heatwaves across different years reveals a complex interaction
between extreme weather and public sentiment. For instance, nega-
tive sentiment spikes during 2012, 2013, and 2015 heatwaves in
North America and Europe correlate with these severe events. In con-
trast, the notably negative sentiment in 2014 reﬂects its status as the
hottest year on record, whereas the positive sentiment in years like
2017, 2018, 2021, and 2022 suggests either better responses to heat-
waves or milder weather conditions in affected regions.
3.3. Emotional responses to heatwaves
Analysis of the emotional sentiment data about heatwaves from
September 2011 to September 2021, as shown in Fig. 2, reveals
intriguing insights into how people’s emotions and perceptions
evolved during this decade. In September 2011, tweets exhibited
mixed emotions, with sadness at 20 % ("Me watching little Mexican
kids nearly pass out from heatstroke cause their mom decided to make
caldo on the hottest day of the year"), joy at 25 % ("Even though it’s hot
outside I am enjoying my summer. Try to stay cool guys and drink plenty
of water. I hope your heatwave ends soon", and "Good news is, we won
our ﬂash football tournament even though it may not a good idea to

play in the heat"), and fear at 18 % ("I was pronounced dead for three
minutes after heatstroke and now spooky things happen to me.."). This
emotional diversity potentially reﬂects the uncertainty and emo-
tional impact of early heatwave experiences. However, as we move
forward in time, a noticeable trend emerges. By September 2015, joy
had steadily increased to 35 %, indicating a growing resilience or
adaptation to heat waves, sadness, and fear. However, it ﬂuctuated
and remained relatively elevated (sadness at 28 % and fear at 22 %).
This suggests a persistent emotional impact associated with heat-
waves that people were still grappling with.
Furthermore, love remained stable in tweets, consistently around
15 % throughout the decade, indicating a lasting sense of community
and support during these challenging times. While ﬂuctuating between
8 % and 15 %, anger did not exhibit a signiﬁcant upward trend, suggest-
ing that people were not attributing blame for heat waves to a particu-
lar source or entity but rather expressing frustration at the situation
("Am tired, but I can’t [curse] sleep because of this heatwave"). Interest-
ingly, the expression of surprise was minimal throughout the years,
hovering around 5 %, indicating a general expectation or awareness of
the occurrence of heatwaves, likely due to increasing climate change
awareness and integrating weather forecasts into daily life.
The observation that a heatwave occurs annually during July and
August, accompanied by a signiﬁcant increase in tweets, raises inter-
esting questions about the potential link with emotional sentiments.
The data on emotions previously discussed indicates that emotions
like sadness and fear remain relatively elevated throughout the years,
even when not in the immediate presence of a heatwave. This could
suggest a lingering emotional impact from past experiences with
heatwaves.
The fact that sadness and fear remain at relatively elevated levels
outside of July and August, even during years without heatwaves,
suggests that people may carry forward the emotional impact of pre-
vious heatwaves. This lingering emotional response could contribute
to tweets’ consistent sadness and fear. This emotional phenomenon
may be explained by the climate fatigue experienced by people as a
result of climate change. Climate fatigue is a psychological state char-
acterized by the weariness or emotional exhaustion of climate-
related information and challenges [46].
Additionally, the increasing joy observed in September 2015 may
indicate that people were experiencing relief and happiness as the
heat waves of that year receded.
The stable presence of love throughout the years may indicate
that during the annual heatwave periods, people come together and
show support for one another, leading to a consistent level of positive
emotion. Conversely, the relatively low levels of surprise may indi-
cate that the annual occurrence of heatwaves had become an
expected event, with people not expressing surprise but responding
with emotions tied to their experiences and adaptations.
3.4. Classiﬁcation of healthcare concerns during heatwaves
3.4.1. Health-related issues
In the thematic analysis, a list of themes emerged that we classi-
ﬁed into main topics. Table 2 summarizes the themes.
Fig. 3 details the distribution of tweets across the different
themes.
Most people tweeting about heat waves expressed their reaction
regarding a heat-related illness (e.g., heat stroke, dehydration, head-
ache) (44.3 %). The second emerging category was the methods of
addressing health-related issues (30.1 %). Only 11 % and 7 % of the
tweets showed that people were suffering from organ failure or men-
tal health issues as a result of the heat waves. Fig. 4 breaks down
each subcategory with the associated number of tweets.
Heat-related illnesses
Most tweets (44.3 %) complained about how the heatwave
negatively impacted tweeters’ health, inducing heat-related issues.
Mainly, as shown in Fig. 4, 84.4 % of them experienced or were
exposed to heat strokes, while the rest experienced heat exhaustion
(8.19 %), dehydration (4.51 %), and headaches (1.31 %). Some other
tweeters experienced other heat-related issues, such as heat cramps,
fainting, nausea, and hay fever.
"I forget how bad it is every year until the ﬁrst heatwave hits, and my
body is like, OH GOD! It’s summer, so air pressure headaches, feeling
faint, and constantly getting heat exhaustion season.”
Respiratory issues, organ failure, and cardiovascular concerns
Although only 3 % of the tweets acknowledged having a cardio-
vascular issue due to heatwave, it is noteworthy that such chronic
conditions should be looked at seriously considering their negative
impact on health.
"Heart ache, perspiration. . . Just some of the wonderful symptoms I
am experiencing today.”
For instance, 79.6 % of the patients had increased heart rates,
12.9 % of them experienced annoying heart palpitations, and ranges
between 2.29-2.71 % of them had perspiration, hypertension, and
experienced extreme cardiovascular events.
A rate of 11 % of the tweets showed that tweeters experienced
organ failure as a cause of heatwaves, and 1.53 % of them had organ
failure that included problems with the kidneys, stomach, and lungs.
Among this population, 61.9 % of the tweeters experienced trouble
breathing and 26.6 % experienced asthma exacerbations due to heat.
"Am alarming patients like me suffering from asthma and hyperten-
sion. This heat is serious.”
"Kidney failure, heatstroke cases up in hospitals amid heat wave.”
Skin and hair conditions
Among the 1.05 % of tweets that reported harmed skin or hair due
to heat waves, 63.7 % of the tweeters admitted having sunburns,
8.93 % said suffering heat rash, and 15.5 % reported that heat waves
damaged their hair.
"It was a hard day today. I am sunburnt. I got a heatstroke. Back to
reality.”
"My hair is getting pretty greasy in this heatwave.”
Mental health and well-being
Heat waves did not only impact tweeters’ physical well-being but
also their mental health (7.5 %). Stress induced by this extreme
weather was complained about by 41.2 % of the tweeters. Heat waves
also cause mood changes (5.29 %), anxiety (18.5 %), mental fatigue
(8.51 %), panic attacks (7.52 %), and sleeping troubles (18.9 %).
“With every tortured breath, I feel my will to live sliding inexorably
away and the approach of my surely imminent death by heatstroke.”
Vulnerable populations
Heatwave is critical for some of the vulnerable populations. For
instance, 29.4 % of the tweets expressed concerns about the vulnerabil-
ity of older adults who cannot bear extreme weather. Older adults are
more vulnerable to health risks such as dehydration and heart attacks.
“With the heatwave beginning, it’s important to remember that some
countries have no infrastructure for extreme heat, putting the elderly
at risk.”
It also impacted infants (19.8 %), pregnant females (15.5 %), people
with immunization issues (2.14 %), people with chronic diseases
(6.95 %), marginalized communities (13.9 %), and people with preex-
isting heatwave-related conditions (21.3 %).

“Any other autistic people ﬁnd the heat just completely takes the spoons
out of you?? Like I usually have a good amount of energy, and this heat
wave has just burned that to a crisp- I can barely do anything.”
“You need to leave this man alone. Heat impacts everyone differently. He
could be on medications that make him more susceptible to heat stroke.”
“Our heat wave in the last year killed homeless people, and everyone
still made jokes.”
3.4.2. Methods of addressing the heat-related issues
Tweets did not only enumerate health concerns resulting from
heat waves, but 30.1 % also talked about preventative and corrective
methods to these consequences.
Adaptation and coping strategies, and personal measures
As shown in Fig. 4, most tweets shared insights into adapting to
heat waves and coping with extreme heat events by staying hydrated
(44.9 %).
“Try to stay cool, guys, and drink plenty of water. I hope your heat-
wave ends soon.”
Some Tweets were posted to share advice based on the personal
measures that helped them overcome heat wave impacts (8.85 %).
“I stayed in my room to stay cool today because the house is boiling.”
Public health response
Tweets also covered insights into the response of public health to
the heatwaves (21.28 %). Mainly, most of them covered (15.6 %) dif-
ferent calls for action and awareness.
“CHP reminds public on precautions against heat stroke during very
hot weather. . .”
“This doctor explains why heatwaves are worse in the UK. . .”

Through Twitter, information on emergency response plans was
distributed to the public, covering conversations about emergency
services and plans and information on cooling centers and shelters
(3.26 %).
"Keep your family safe this summer. Know the signs and call 911 if
you or a loved one are suffering from a heat stroke.”
A rate of 6.04 % of the Tweets shared alerts about upcoming
weather hazards and issues.
“Are you enjoying the sunshine and heat? Whilst many of us can
enjoy our current heatwave, there are thousands of people who are
vulnerable to these conditions. A new heat-health alert (HHA) service
has been launched in England.”
Media and public discourse
Some tweets (3.21 %) portrayed experts’ analysis of heatwave
impacts and corrections of public misconceptions.
“We have developed resources for members to use to support
patients during the heat. Find out more and download the full
resource here. . .”
Other measures
Some other tweets talked about the indirect impact of heat waves
on patients’ well-being by covering economic loss, job productivity
issues, and the geographic disparities related to shaded areas.
3.5. Distribution of the topics across different types of users
Different types of users tweeted about the heat wave health
issues, as shown in Table 3. Heat exhaustion (59 %), headaches, heat
edema, and hay fever were experienced by more male than female
tweeters. Females suffered from more dehydration (71 %) and heat
strokes (65 %). More females admitted having had difﬁculty breathing
(87 %), increased heart rates (81 %), heat rash (80 %), stress (80 %), and
sleeping issues (74 %). More females tweeted about the vulnerability
of infants (68 %), older adults (69 %), and pregnant females (93 %).
Older adults were more likely to tweet about almost all health
issues, showing that vulnerability increases with age.
Based on our ﬁndings, although many organizations tweeted
about the impacts of heat waves on health status, most of the tweets
were from personal accounts. Organizations shared mainly informa-
tion about shelters and cooling centers (85 %) and public health advi-
sories (65 %).
4. Discussion
In this study, we aimed to explore the potential utility of large
available social media data in determining the impact of heat waves
on health outcomes. We collected Twitter text data to (1) explore the
reactions and health issues that people admitted having as a result of
heat waves, (2) investigate the measures taken by both people and
organizations to overcome these impacts, (3) investigate the differen-
ces in reactions across different types of users (based on gender, age,
and account type). The built dataset, consisting of over 2 million
tweets, offers valuable insights into various aspects of this topic.
The distribution of the tweets (76 % personal accounts vs 24 % cor-
porate accounts) suggests that heat waves are growing as a subject of
concern for both individuals and organizations. Moreover, there is a
signiﬁcant gender disparity among individual users, with 70.22 % of
accounts belonging to males and only 29.78 % to females. This dispar-
ity could be explored further to understand gender-speciﬁc heat
wave responses and potentially inform public health campaigns to
personalize mitigation strategies to the needs of the different
subgroups.
The age distribution is also noteworthy, with 56.93 % of the
accounts belonging to individuals over 39 years old. This suggests
that older individuals are more active in discussing heatwaves on

Twitter, possibly due to increased vulnerability to extreme heat,
which is also consistent with other literature [47].
According to the sentiment analysis, the primary emotions exhib-
ited in heatwave-related tweets are joy (38.81 %) and anger
(33.15 %). The frequency of joy may suggest that humor and sarcasm
play an essential role in how individuals cope with high heat, particu-
larly in recent years. This observation was substantiated during the
systematic quality check of the analysis of the diverse tweets catego-
rized under "joy," such as "Absolutely loving this scorching weather!
It’s not like we needed a break from mild temperatures or anything. Who
needs comfortable outdoor activities anyway? Embracing the joy of
being roasted alive!".
This could be related to growing awareness of climate change and
the need to solve its issues. Observing seasonal sentiment patterns
aligning with heat waves highlights the strong connection between
weather events and public sentiment. Negative sentiment peaks in
speciﬁc years correlate with severe heat waves, emphasizing the
emotional impact of such events.
Conversely, positive sentiment in some years may indicate
improved responses or milder conditions, reﬂecting the evolving
dynamics of how society perceives and responds to heat waves. The
overall presence of emotions tied to people’s experiences with heat
waves suggests that people are developing coping strategies and
community support in dealing with extreme weather events.

The ﬂuctuations in sentiment throughout the summer months
underscore the importance of considering the actual experiences
individuals have with heat waves, as reﬂected in their willingness to
engage in tweeting about these climatic events. This nuanced per-
spective adds depth to our understanding of the interplay between
personal experiences and expressing sentiments about heat waves
on social media.
Understanding these perspectives shared in conversations can be
pivotal in developing strategies for mitigating and responding to heat
waves speciﬁcally and climate change generally. People come to
social media to support one another, seek help, and share opinions
and experiences [48,49]. Our study also highlighted and classiﬁed the
main health issues that may result from extreme heat waves (mental
and physical health-related problems). These issues generated the
negative emotions of sadness, stress, anxiety, and anger spotted in
the Tweets. For example, heat-related illnesses, such as heat strokes
and dehydration, were the most commonly mentioned health con-
cerns, affecting a substantial portion of the tweeters. Many studies
have shown associations between strokes and extreme heat weather
[50,51].
Additionally, mental health concerns, including stress and anxi-
ety, were prevalent among tweeters, highlighting the psychological
toll of heat waves. These ﬁndings could help identify tweet patterns
related to health vulnerabilities, which can contribute to developing
early warning systems. Monitoring social media can help anticipate
and respond to potential health crises during extreme heat events,
allowing for timely interventions and resource allocation. Addition-
ally, health authorities can use this information to design targeted
awareness campaigns and public health interventions, distribute
resources, and implement strategies to mitigate the impact of
extreme heat on vulnerable populations. Understanding the speciﬁc
health issues identiﬁed in this study can aid in more efﬁcient
resource allocation. Emergency services can use such information to
prioritize areas and communities most at risk during extreme heat
events and other extreme weather events related to climate change.
Understanding the health vulnerabilities highlighted on social media
can guide the incorporation of health considerations into broader cli-
mate resilience plans at the local and regional levels.
The summary of the vulnerable populations that heat waves could
impact can serve as a repertory to patients and organizations aiming
to issue information on preventative measures before heat waves
and extreme weather events related to climate change. Consistently
with previous studies, our ﬁndings suggest that social media data can
be used to advance our understanding of public attention and reac-
tions to severe weather [52]. Our results can, thus, provide a refer-
ence for developing and improving relevant public health awareness
strategies and campaigns and early extreme weather and health
warning systems to prevent and reduce the health risks due to
extreme weather and climate change, accounting for mental and
physical health safety [51]. Finally, through the difference in response
across groups, we shed light on the importance of understanding
disparities to help tailor the preventative and corrective public health
initiatives related to heatwaves to target the speciﬁc groups needed
effectively.
In summary, this study analyzes Twitter data related to heat
waves and delves into the emotional and health-related aspects of
the public’s response to extreme heat. These ﬁndings can inform poli-
cymakers, healthcare professionals, and organizations working on cli-
mate
change
mitigation
and
adaptation,
helping
them
better
understand the public’s concerns and responses to heat waves and

develop strategies to protect vulnerable populations and mitigate the
health impacts of extreme heat.
5. Limitations
This study has limitations, notably its focus on Twitter users, who
may not represent the broader population due to unique demo-
graphics and interests. Bias may arise from selecting tweets based
only on speciﬁc heatwave-related keywords and excluding non-
English tweets, limiting the diversity of perspectives. Additionally,
the
inability
to
differentiate
between
personal
and
corporate
accounts and to analyze tweets by demographics, like gender, due to
Twitter’s privacy policies also restricts the study. Lastly, the lack of
precise tweet location data hampers regional analysis of heatwave
discussions.
6. Conclusion
Our analysis of over 2 million tweets has unveiled signiﬁcant
insights
into
the
public’s
reactions
to
heat
waves. We
have
highlighted the prominent emotions expressed, with joy and anger
standing out, suggesting humor and sarcasm as coping mechanisms
during extreme heat. The study has also identiﬁed signiﬁcant health
concerns related to heatwaves, such as heat-related illnesses and
mental health issues, underlining the multifaceted impact of extreme
heat on well-being. These ﬁndings have practical implications for
public health awareness campaigns and early warning systems.
