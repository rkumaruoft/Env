Climate change and malnutrition: we need to act now
William H. Dietz
Milken Institute School of Public Health, George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA.
Climate change and malnutrition in all its 
forms, including obesity and undernutri-
tion, constitute two of the greatest threats 
to planetary and human health. As recently 
described (1), obesity and undernutrition 
each affect approximately 2 billion people 
worldwide, and in 2017, over 150 million 
children were stunted. The costs of obesity 
account for almost 3% of the world’s gross 
domestic product (GDP), and the costs of 
undernutrition in Asia and Africa range 
from 4% to 11% of GDP (1). The costs of 
unmitigated climate change, which will 
disproportionately 
affect 
low-income 
countries, may exceed 7% of the world and 
10% of the US GDP by 2100 (2).
The future of our health and that of our 
planet depend on our ability to massively 
reduce our contribution to climate change, 
and we have a limited amount of time 
in which to do so. No single solution will 
suffice. Nonetheless, changes in the food, 
agriculture, and transport systems can 
mitigate climate change and reduce obesi-
ty, undernutrition, cardiovascular disease, 
and colon cancer (Figure 1). We know 
some steps that can be taken, but how to 
overcome policy resistance and inertia is 
the challenge.
Interacting pandemics
The pandemics of obesity, undernutrition, 
and climate change constitute a syndemic 
(3): they interact in time and place, have 
synergistic adverse effects on each other, 
and importantly, share common underly-
ing social or economic determinants and 
policy drivers. These three pandemics 
are driven by the underlying systems of 
agriculture and food production, urban 
design, land use, and transport. For exam-
ple, methane is a particularly potent GHG. 
The methane produced by cattle to meet 
the demands for meat consumption is 
associated with environmental degrada-
tion and generates approximately 9% of 
increased GHGs in the United States (4), 
and beef consumption is associated with 
obesity, cardiovascular disease, and colon 
cancer. Additionally, urban design and 
land use patterns foster reliance on car 
use, which leads to obesity by displacing 
physical transport, like biking and walk-
ing, and generates approximately 29% of 
GHGs in the United States (4). Food waste 
in the United States has been estimated to 
account for almost 1 pound of food per day 
and to generate 8% of global GHG emis-
sions (5). Also of note, the global warm-
ing caused by increased GHG production 
increases catastrophic weather events 
and reduces protein and micronutrients 
in crops (6, 7), all of which contribute to 
food insecurity and undernutrition in low- 
and middle-income countries (LMICs). 
In turn, low birthweight in LMICs may be 
associated with later obesity, and over 10% 
of children in LMICs are stunted and have 
obesity (8). The advantage of the syndem-
ic perspective is that it offers triple-duty 
solutions. For example, reduced meat 
consumption will improve human health, 
reduce GHG emissions, and in the longer 
term, reduce food insecurity in LMICs.
Dietary recommendations 
addressing health and climate 
change
The United States bears a major obligation 
to address climate change. We rank second 
in the world in CO2 emissions and fourth 
behind mainland China, India, and Bra-
zil in terms of our per capita diet-related 
GHG footprint (9). Therefore, the chang-
es we make in our food, agriculture, and 
transport systems can play a significant 
role in the reduction of our GHG genera-
tion and its contribution to climate change. 
Because the effects of these changes are 
context specific (10), I will focus on their 
impact in the United States.
Meat production as practiced today 
is the single largest contributor to GHGs 
from agriculture. Compared with the aver-
age US diet, diets lower in meat, such as 
the Mediterranean diet, have been esti-
mated to decrease GHGs by 72%, land 
use by 58%, and energy consumption by 
52% (11, 12). These and other observations 
were incorporated into the 2015 Dietary 
Guidelines for Americans Advisory Com-
mittee (DGAC) report, which concluded 
that “Consistent evidence indicates that, 
in general, a dietary pattern that is higher 
in plant-based foods, such as vegetables, 
fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and 
seeds, and lower in animal-based foods is 
more health promoting and is associated 
with lesser environmental impact (GHG 
and energy, land, and water use) than is 
the current average US diet” (13, 14).
Similar recommendations for sustain-
able diets were made by the EAT–Lancet 
Commission (15). Diets with reduced meat 
intake, such as the Mediterranean and 
Dietary Approaches to Stop Hyperten-
sion (DASH) diets, not only are better for 
the planet but also improve health. The 
Mediterranean diet was associated with 
decreased severe cardiovascular events 
among individuals with significant risk 
factors for cardiovascular disease (16), 
and the DASH diet was associated with 
decreased all-cause mortality in adults 
with hypertension (17). Estimates suggest 
that plant-based diets could reduce mor-
tality from the diet-related diseases of 
stroke, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary 
heart disease, and cancer by 6%–10% and 
reduce diet-related GHGs by 29%–70% by 
2050 compared with a reference diet (18).
Reductions in GHGs and cost savings 
from reductions from the four diet-related 
diseases increase as diets are increasingly 
plant based. The majority of these benefits 
are attributable to reductions in meat intake. 
Shifts from cars to public transport, biking, 
and walking will have a similar impact on

In addition to individual efforts, the 
health care sector is a logical target for the 
promotion of plant-based diets and efforts 
to reduce the sector’s contribution to climate 
change. The health care sector contributes 
an estimated 4%–8% of our country’s GHGs 
(20, 21). In 2019, the American Medical 
Association and over 100 other organiza-
tions signed a call to action (CTA) to address 
climate change and health (22). More than 
half of the health sector’s emissions are 
attributable to energy use. The incorpora-
tion of climate solutions into health care and 
all public health systems was one of 10 prior-
ity actions the CTA recommended.
Strategies that improve the health of 
the planet and the health of our employ-
ees include subsidizing employees for the 
use of mass transit, using procurement 
policies to provide sustainably produced 
foods in our cafeterias, and increasing the 
price of foods with high environmental 
footprints to discourage their consump-
tion. Model programs include Kaiser Per-
manente’s 2016 pledge to remove more 
carbon than their organization emits by 
2025 by utilizing clean energy, purchasing 
sustainably produced foods, moving zero 
food waste to landfills, and recycling, reus-
ing, or composting 100% of their nonhaz-
ardous waste (23).
crops and fossil fuels, along with adding 
the costs of environmental degradation 
to the price of beef, other GHG-intensive 
foods, and fossil fuels will reflect their 
true costs. Increased costs will reduce 
beef intake, move consumption to more 
plant-based diets, and increase public 
transport, walking, and biking. In many 
places, the shifts in transport will need to 
be accompanied by long overdue shifts in 
community infrastructure. However, the 
lack of political will to make the necessary 
radical changes is reflected in the feder-
al response to the dietary guidelines, the 
policy resistance of the meat and fossil 
fuel industries, and the denial of the US 
responsibility for climate change at the 
highest levels of our government.
The absence of widespread public 
awareness and outrage in response to the 
secretaries’ decision emphasizes the need 
to build a greater base of grassroots sup-
port for policies that promote sustainable 
dietary practices and changes in physical 
transport. To generate political will, we 
must empower individuals to recognize 
that they can make a difference. That dif-
ference should begin with changes in our 
own diets and transportation patterns, and 
then we should extend these efforts to our 
families, institutions, and communities.
reducing chronic diseases like obesity, cor-
onary heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, as 
well as reducing GHG emissions.
Adoption of the DGAC’s recommen-
dation that sustainability be incorporated 
into the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 
(DGAs) would have instituted sustainable 
dietary practices in federal policy. How-
ever, the recommendation was met with 
vigorous opposition from the beef indus-
try, and that opposition led the secretar-
ies of the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services and U.S. Department 
of Agriculture to announce that sustain-
ability was outside the scope of the DGAs 
(19). As a result, the recommendation 
was stripped from the final version of the 
DGAs. Given the need for behavioral and 
policy change to mitigate the production 
of GHGs from the food and agriculture 
systems and improve human and plane-
tary health, the secretaries’ decision was 
the modern equivalent of Nero fiddling as 
Rome burned, only in this case, it will be 
the planet that suffers.
Now is the time for action
Because we have a limited amount of time 
in which to mitigate climate change, rad-
ical strategies are required. For example, 
elimination of subsidies for commodity 
Figure 1. Strategies to mitigate the global syndemic. There are several triple-duty solutions to the global syndemic of obesity, undernutrition, and climate 
change. Solutions include elimination of subsidies for commodity crops, which will increase the price of beef, reduce demand, decrease beef production, 
and prevent obesity, colon cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Reduced beef production will also reduce the generation of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which 
will preserve the nutrient content of crops and reduce food insecurity. Changes in urban design to reduce car use and increase physical and public transport 
will increase physical activity, prevent obesity, and reduce GHGs. However, these scenarios are disruptive and have already encountered political inertia and 
strenuous resistance by powerful vested industries. The foundation for federal policy change must begin locally with awareness of the links between our 
current dietary and activity practices and build from individual behavioral change to changes in our hospitals, schools, and municipal governments. Urgent 
action is required now to preserve human and planetary health.

A 2018 Gallup poll showed that 70% 
of respondents aged 18–34 are worried 
“a great deal/fair amount about global 
warming” compared to 56% of those 55 
years or older (24). Millennials and Gen Z 
members should mobilize and advocate in 
their colleges, universities, and work sites 
for changes in procurement policies, for 
labeling sustainably produced foods, and 
for food waste recycling. Many of these 
strategies are already being employed at 
the municipal level through programs such 
as the American Cities Climate Challenge 
(ACCC) funded by Bloomberg Philanthro-
pies (25). The 25 ACCC cities’ goals are to 
reduce emissions from buildings, trans-
portation, and food waste.
Concluding remarks
One of the more sobering conclusions is 
that multiple interventions directed at 
the food system will not likely achieve the 
goal of reducing the rise in mean surface 
temperature by 2°C by 2050 (18). Further-
more, dietary interventions will reduce 
but not eliminate increases in GHGs. A 
relevant analogy is that of a bathtub fill-
ing with CO2. The bathtub of CO2 is near-
ly full, and unless the drainage from the 
bathtub increases, it will overflow (26). 
One of the most important agricultural 
sinks is sustainable land use. Regenerat-
ing and reforesting the land freed by the 
reduced demand for beef will contribute 
to carbon sequestration, but unless we 
also replace our reliance on fossil fuels 
by changing the energy use of buildings 
and transportation systems, the outlook 
is grim. Hopeful developments include 
growing interest in vegetarian diets, meat 
alternatives, the rapid growth in sales of 
sustainably produced and better-for-you 
products, and the participation by youth 
in demonstrations to protest climate 
change. Will these unconnected efforts 
transform to a unified social movement? 
Only time will tell.
