Welcome!
Welcome to Planning to be part of my Region! A series of lesson plans aimed at 
educating Grade 9 students about Climate Change in the Region
of Peel. 
The lesson plans focus on building an understanding of regional climate change
and  how people can mitigate and adapt to these impacts. Students will be asked to
make decisions and voice their opinion  about climate change. They will also be
asked to share their thoughts on how to build a sustainable Region to combat climate
change.
We hope that  through teaching these lessons, students will become more
aware about the Region they live in and be empowered to make decisions that will impact 
their future.
Objectives
The Region of Peel Integrated Planning Division has a variety of objectives in the
development of these lesson plans:
1.
To build an awareness of Region of Peel’s planning research projects and initiatives 
through the development of educational resources and lesson plans for use by 
teachers and students. 
2.
To link Regional Planning initiatives to Grade 9 Ontario curriculum expectations.
3.
To create hands-on, minds-on, integrated lesson plans to support student learning and 
understanding of climate change.
Grade 9: Climate Change

The Region of Peel
The following introduction provides background 
information regarding the geographic Region of Peel 
and is intended to help you prepare for teaching of 
the lessons. 
Situated in the heart of southern Ontario's major 
urban centres, the Region of Peel is the second 
largest municipality in Ontario, with a population of 
over one million. The Regional municipality of Peel 
consists 
of 
three 
municipalities 
–
cities 
of 
Mississauga, Brampton, and town of Caledon. 
The Region of Peel has an urban and rural system. Brampton and Mississauga make up the urban 
system where the majority of growth has occurred in Peel. Currently, Mississauga comprises the 
majority of Peel’s population, but the significant growth in Brampton is expected to close the gap. 
Both Brampton and Mississauga have experienced rapid population growth and commercial 
development which has transformed what was primarily a rural area of natural landscapes, farms and 
villages into a dynamic blend of urban, industrial and residential areas.
Rapid growth in the Region will potentially contribute to the impact of climate change. An increase in 
population means an increase in carbon emissions to the area. Increasingly, humans are releasing 
carbon into the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels, the atmosphere now contains 32% 
more carbon dioxide than it did at the beginning of the 20th century. These actions result in an increase 
of global temperatures.
Climate change may result in an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events in 
the Region. It is difficult to determine to what extent these impacts may have, but it is known that the 
Region of Peel will experience some shifts in climate. These impacts may result in declining 
availability of water supplies or damage to property due to severe storms. Given the unpredictable 
nature of these effects the Region of Peel is taking a proactive approach to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions (GHG) now and adapt to these changes in hopes of reducing the impact of climate change 
in the future.
Communities in the Region of Peel can play an important role in combating climate change through 
the reduction of carbon emissions also known as greenhouse gas (GHG). Taking steps to reduce 
carbon emissions and preparing to adapt to the impact of climate change will help communities 
improve their resiliency to climate change.
Providing knowledge about climate change is an important topic for study by youth. Youth are 
stakeholders of the Region, and therefore need to be engaged in meaningful dialogue that will 
contribute to decision making pertaining to regional and global climate change. The way we plan and 
adapt to climate change will have a positive impact in ensuring the Region of Peel is a place where 
our children can grow up feeling safe and healthy. We must recognize the capacity of students to be 
authentic participants and stewards in planning for climate change.

INTRODUCTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE
In this first lesson of regional climate change, students will show what they know or think 
they know about climate change. Students will read and discuss articles about climate 
change, enabling them to build their current understanding of the issue. In doing so, they will 
acquire understanding of key concepts and terms needed to better understand climate change 
and its regional and global impacts.

Time
Targeted Curriculum 
Expectations
-describe the characteristics (e.g. complex, 
Interconnected, life supporting, driven by solar 
Energy) of natural systems (e.g., climate, biomes, 
the lithosphere, the hydrosphere);
-explain how human activities affect, or are affected
by, the environment
Minds On J Pre-assessment Graffiti activity. Show what they know.
Provide groups with large sheet of paper and markers. Have group members think for one
minute about what they know about climate change. After thinking, students have one 
minute to record what they know or think they know. Share. Post collection of knowledge
on the wall to be added to or revised as needed.
ACTION! Whole Class J Group read and share
1.
Working in groups of three or four students read one article on climate change (BLM 
1.1,1.2,1.3,1.4). Tell groups to be prepared to explain what they have learned from the 
reading. Allow students three minutes to record by drawing, labeling or writing what 
they have learned in the article using the placemat (BLM 1.5). Next, students will do a 
round table sharing their visual interpretation of what they have learned. Each member 
has two minutes to share. 
2.
Following readings have students count off from 1-4 to form new groups. Newly formed 
groups should have members who have read different articles. Do a round table, each 
member has three minutes to share what they have learned. 
3.
Group share- Pick one student from each placemat section to share his or her visual 
interpretation of the reading. Teacher circulates to assist and clarify misconceptions.
4.
Cut placemats sections into four, grouping similar article information into a collage. 
Post on the placemat sections as a collective collection of  ideas and knowledge gained 
regarding climate change.
Consolidation and Connection J Individual Activity 
Provide copy of readings to students (BLM 1.1,1.2,1.3,1.4). Students use readings to
individually complete introduction to climate change questions (BLM 1.6). Assess students
understanding of Climate change, provide additional resources if further understandings are
needed.

Background Information
Teaching/Learning Sequence
What is climate change?
Climate change is a variation or change in the 
climate 
(temperature, 
wind, 
precipitation 
patterns) in a specific location, region, or of the 
entire planet. This change in weather patterns 
persists for a long period of time ranging from 
decades to millions of years. Climate change 
may be caused by a variety of factors including 
natural 
processes; 
however, 
scientific 
evidence shows that the current period of 
climate change is caused by human activities. 
Study the graph to the right. When on the 
graph do you see a rapid increase in carbon 
emissions and carbon concentrations? What 
human activities were happening during this 
time period? What happened to the average 
global temperature during this same time 
period?
What is the greenhouse effect?
The greenhouse effect refers to the role of our atmosphere in insulating the planet from heat 
loss. Sunlight enters our atmosphere and a portion is absorbed by the earth’s surface. A 
large amount of this sun’s energy is reflected back or bounces off the earth’s surface as 
thermal infrared radiation and travels toward the atmosphere. At this point, greenhouse gases 
(water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) in the atmosphere trap the 
thermal radiation and reflect it back toward the earth’s surface. These gases are acting as a 
blanket to keep the earth warm. Under normal conditions, where the atmosphere contains 
naturally occurring concentrations of greenhouse gases, this effect keeps the average global 
temperature at 14°C instead of a very cold -19°C. We definitely need this blanket to keep us 
warm. But unfortunately, humans are increasing the concentrations of these gases in the 
atmosphere contributing to an increase in global temperatures. Humans are causing the 
blanket to keep us too warm!
This figure illustrates the interaction between human 
generated carbon emissions, atmospheric carbon dioxide 
content and average global temperatures (ACIA, 2004).
BLM 1.1
Grade 9: Climate Change

How do humans contribute to climate change?
Humans contribute to climate change by artificially increasing the levels of 
greenhouse gas occurring in our atmosphere. Burning fossil fuels such as natural 
gas, gasoline and coal release a large amount of carbon dioxide, methane, and 
nitrous oxide into the atmosphere where it collects. This activity thickens the 
insulating blanket around the earth and traps a higher percentage of the thermal 
infrared radiation reflecting off the earth’s surface, increasing average global 
temperatures.
Humans have released so much carbon into the atmosphere through the burning of 
fossil fuels and deforestation that the atmosphere contains 32 percent more carbon 
dioxide today than at the beginning of the 20th century!
Burning fossil fuels for transportation is the most common source of greenhouse 
gas release by humans. Other forms of greenhouse gases including methane and 
nitrous oxide which is often produced by humans through waste disposal and 
industrial practices. The release of any of these gases is known as Greenhouse 
Gas (GHG) emissions. Most activities that humans do at home, school and work 
need power. That means each time you turn on a light, use an appliance or ride in a 
car you are directly adding to the concentration of greenhouse gases in the 
atmosphere. This is not very good news. The good news is that we can make 
changes in our communities to reduce the amount of GHG released. What can you 
do?

Regional Impact of Climate 
Change
In the Region of Peel, climate change could 
mean warmer winters, hotter summers and 
more 
frequent 
extreme 
weather 
events. 
Scientists predict that there will be long-term, 
damaging impacts to our built, natural and 
human systems. Scientists also know that 
there will be times when we can find benefits 
and local opportunities with a changing 
climate. Some examples of both of these 
negative and positive impacts of climate 
change are illustrated below.
BLM 1.3
Climate Facts….
•In southern Ontario, the number of 
days exceeding 30°C will more than 
double by the 2050s
•Extreme daily precipitation events 
(such as thunderstorms) will become 
more frequent and severe
•UV levels will increase
Human Systems
1. Increased  risk to human
health (higher health care
costs: increased heat stroke,
allergens, respiratory
complications,  and disease) 
2. Higher demand for public
cooling centres
3. Potential for displaced people
and injuries due to flooding
4. Residents may be isolated
and without power due to
extreme weather events (e.g.
ice storm 1998)
Built System
1. Increased temperatures 
could lead to higher 
demand for cooling units; 
increased utility bills and 
brown/black-outs.
2. Increased water use 
could lead to increased cost 
in water bills and increased 
cost to deliver and repair 
water systems
3. Storm damage may 
cause building damage and 
increased clean up costs 
4. Frequent weather events 
may increase costs to 
maintain buildings, roads, 
bridges and other public 
structures.
Natural Systems
1. Changes in 
temperature and 
precipitation patterns may 
cause: loss and/or shift in 
plant and animal species
2. Increase erosion, 
flooding
3. Reduced lake levels 
and river levels,
4. Increased damage and 
mortality to trees
5. Increased loss of 
agriculturally productive 
land leading to loss of 
food production
6. Increased abundance 
of invasive species and 
pest infestations.
CLIMATE
CHANGE
IMPACTS
The debate is over about whether or not climate change 
is real. Irrefutable evidence from around the world –
including extreme weather events, record temperatures, 
retreating glaciers, and rising sea levels – all point to the 
fact climate change is happening now and at rates much 
faster than previously thought.

A Global Problem that has A 
Regional Solution
Climate change is here and it is time to take 
action! We as citizens in the Region of Peel 
must recognize that while it is up to each 
community, region, province and nation to do 
their part in dealing with the effects of climate 
change. The impacts of climate will impact your 
future, where you live, work, and play. 
We can respond to climate change by reducing 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This act of 
reducing 
greenhouse 
emission 
is 
called 
mitigation. The federal government estimates 
that 80% of Canada’s greenhouse gas 
emissions are associated with the production 
of or consumption of fossil fuels for energy 
purposes. We can mitigate by:
1. Reducing energy use 
2. Switching to renewable sources of energy 
(solar, wind, thermal energy) 
3. Capturing landfill gases, and 
4. Increasing use of public transit. 
Mitigation reduces the build-up of greenhouse 
gases in the atmosphere and slows climate 
change over the long term.
I can Mitigate by…
1.
Walking to school, friends, parks
2.
Taking public transit
3.
Turning off lights
4.
Turning down the heat by 1 or 2 degrees 
in my house
5.
Using fans instead of air conditioning
6.
Finding recreational activities that do not 
involve using electricity
I can mitigate and adapt by…
1.
Taking shorter showers (water conservation)
2.
Planting a tree
3.
Growing a garden
4.
Buying local food 
5.
Volunteering to restore plant and animal habitat
What Can You Do to Combat Climate Change?
I can help Adapt to Climate Change by…
1.
Not buying a house on the flood plain
2.
Listening for heat alerts, flood and storm 
warning and advisories
3.
Drinking lots of water when out in the heat
4.
Getting  involved in committees dealing with 
climate change issues.
5.       Building awareness of my own carbon footprint 
to make lifestyle changes
BLM 1.4
Visit  http://www.peelregion.ca/planning/ecofootprint/ to take a Carbon footprint test.
We can also take action to prepare for the 
impacts of climate change. Adaptation are 
actions to reduce the negative impacts of 
climate change or take advantage of 
potential new opportunities. Adaptation 
actions include programs that reduce the 
impacts of severe storms or weather events 
that cause flooding, heat waves, ice 
storms, high winds, erosion, change in lake 
levels and pest infestations. Adaptation 
activities include:  
1. Upgrading storm sewer systems
2. Developing emergency alert systems 
3. Providing “cooling centers”
4. Using thermal energy to heat and cool
buildings, and 
5. Building storm resistance structures.
There are also actions that will both reduce 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions 
and 
help 
prepare for climate change (mitigation and 
adaption). These actions include planting 
trees, building green roofs, buying local 
food, and reducing water use (saves 
electricity to pump water and saves water 
for use during dry spells). Can you explain 
why these actions both mitigate and adapt 
to climate?

IMPACT,MITIGATION AND 
ADAPTATION
This lesson will help bring meaning to the concepts of climate change impacts, 
mitigation, and adaptation. It is anticipated that even small shifts in normal climate 
conditions will have potentially large impact in the Region of Peel including increased 
amount of extreme weather events. Floods, wind storms, ice storms will have negative 
effects on the built, natural and human systems in our communities. Addressing the 
impact of climate change requires two complementary actions: reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions (mitigation) and reducing harm to living things and their environment 
(adaptation) .

1.
Place the words “Impacts of Climate Change” and “Actions to Combat Climate 
Change” on the walls on either side of the classroom.
2.
Hand out the series of Climate change prompts to pairs of students (TR 2.1). 
After reading and thinking about the prompt, ask students to justify their 
reasoning by moving closer to the wall that best fits their prompt.
3.
Place a VENN diagram on the board (TR 2.2). Have students with the Actions 
to combat climate change come up and place it in the VENN either in 
Mitigation, Adaptation or both.  Have students with impact statements decide if 
these actions would combat their impact statement. Ask student to be prepared 
to justify why.         
Mitigation = Actions to reduce GHG emissions
Adaptation = Actions that reduce harm to living things 
and their environment.
Middle of VENN= Actions that both mitigate and adapt 
(mostly actions that involve greening the environment)  
i.e. Planting trees both reduces GHG emissions and is an 
action to adapt to the impact

MINDS ON…
Group Discussion on Adaptation
J Whole Class
1. Ask students to think of a time when change or a new event was happening in 
their lives. What did they do to adapt to this change or event.
Possible scenario ideas : 
a) Think about the transition  from elementary to high school. How did you adapt to
the changes in teachers, workloads, school environment? How did your adaptations
have negative or positive impacts in your life? Did you react proactively or reactively
to the situation? How are you going to adapt to entering the workforce?
b) Joining a team and learning a new sport. They need to adapt to learn the rules, the
new position, how to work as a team, constantly change and improving your strategy
to be the best you can be. How can your adaptations as a player have negative or 
positive impacts on you and your team? When do you react proactively and reactively 
when playing sports?
c) Relate this discussion to climate change adaptations. Human, natural and built
systems are going to need to adapt to climate change.
Teaching/Learning Sequence
This survival activity provides students with the opportunity to work collaboratively to 
develop critical thinking skills. They will be asked to link a series of climate change events 
into a logical sequence that incorporates mitigating and adapting to the impacts of climate

Survival Game J Small Group Activity
1.
Form groups of three or four. Provide students an envelope full of the climate 
change scenario cards (BLM 3.1). Write the title on the front of the envelope.
2.
Allow students 10 – 15 minutes to sort through cards and place them in 
logical sequence. Indicate that most cards will have natural links to other 
statements. There are climate events leading to impacts, and the eventual need 
to mitigate and/or adapt to the situation. There are some cards with no real 
relevance to their survival (tester cards are intentionally placed as tester to 
assess understanding).
3.
Circulate to determine student understanding; provide guidance and feedback 
as required. Discuss their sequence and conclusions.

Teaching/Learning Sequence
Students reflect on how their everyday actions and the community around them can impact 
climate change. Students are asked to examine their daily actions and minor adaptations in 
lifestyle can make a difference. Students will complete a climate change self-awareness audit 
and take a community walk to identify natural, human, and built systems that impact climate 
change. They will look for evidence of systems or features that have been adapted and/or 
mitigated to climate change.  
Individual Activity J Climate Change Home Audit
a)
As a home assignment,  ask students to  complete the Climate Change Self 
Awareness Audit BLM 4.1. Students must choose morning routine, during school 
hours, after school activities, or night time routines. 
b)
In small group ask students to share their results. Discuss the combined impacts 
of over one million people living in the Region of Peel. Ask students if  they can 
quantify the impacts and adaptations? e.g. A regular flush toilet uses 13 litres of 
water X 1 million people versus a low flow toilet which uses 4 litres X 1 million 
people.

Glossary (of terms used in this Lesson Plan)
Active Transportation: using human power to get from place to place. Walking, cycling and 
in-line skating are all forms of active transportation. 
http://www.walkandrollpeel.ca/about/what-is.htm
Adaptation: Adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected 
climate stimuli and their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities. 
There are various types of adaptation, including anticipatory, autonomous and planned 
adaptation. (From Impacts to Adaptation : Canada in a Changing Climate, 2007, 
http://adaptation.nrcan.gc.ca/assess/2007/ch11/index_e.php#R) 
Blackout: A power loss affecting many electricity consumers over a large geographical area 
for a significant period of time. www.energy.ca.gov/glossary/glossary-b.html
Brownout: A controlled power reduction in which the utility decreases the voltage on the 
power lines, so customers receive weaker electric current. Brownouts can be used if total 
power demand exceeds the maximum available supply. The typical household does not 
notice the difference.  www.energy.ca.gov/glossary/glossary-b.html
Built Systems: Involves land use planning, community design, development, and
construction of the built environment and neighborhoods. It also involves maintenance of 
existing buildings and retrofitting.

Climate change: Climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be 
identified (e.g. by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its 
properties, and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer. Climate 
change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcing factors, or to persistent 
anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use. Note that the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) defines climate 
change as “a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that 
alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate 
variability observed over comparable time periods. ” The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction 
between climate change attributable to human activities altering the atmospheric 
composition, and climate variability attributable to natural causes. (From Impacts to 
Adaptation : Canada in a Changing Climate, 2007,

Greenhouse effect: Greenhouse gases effectively absorb infrared radiation, emitted by 
the Earth’s surface, by the atmosphere itself due to the same gases and by clouds. 
Atmospheric radiation is emitted to all sides, including downward to the Earth’s surface. 
Thus, greenhouse gases trap heat within the surface-troposphere system. This is called 
the greenhouse effect. 
http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg3/en/annex1sglossary-e-i.html
Greenhouse gas (GHG): Gaseous constituents of the atmosphere, both natural and 
anthropogenic, that absorb and emit radiation at specific wavelengths within the 
spectrum of infrared radiation emitted by the Earth ’s surface, by the atmosphere itself 
and by clouds. Water vapour (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane 
(CH4) and ozone (O3) are the primary greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere. In 
addition, there are a number of entirely human-made greenhouse gases in the 
atmosphere, such as the halocarbons and other chlorine- and bromine-containing 
substances. (From Impacts to Adaptation : Canada in a Changing Climate, 2007, 
http://adaptation.nrcan.gc.ca/assess/2007/ch11/index_e.php#R)
Mitigation: Initiatives and measures to reduce the vulnerability of natural and human 
systems against actual or expected climate change effects. (IPCC, 2008)
Natural Systems: Includes the natural environment (forests, wetlands, wildlife, etc.) plus 
human activities to monitor, protect and enhance the natural environment and educate 
the public on the current and future state of our natural systems. 
http://www.peelregion.ca/planning/climatechange/reports/pdf/climate-chan-strat-bgr.pdf
Public Health: Involves the combination of programs, services and policies that protect 
and promote the health of all. Public health is involved in the enhancement of the health 
status of the population; reduction of disparities in health status among individual/groups 
within that population; preparation for and response to outbreaks and emergencies; and 
enhancing the sustainability of the healthcare system.
http://www.peelregion.ca/planning/climatechange/reports/pdf/climate-chan-strat-bgr.pdf
Urban forest: The trees, forests and associated organisms that grow near buildings and 
in gardens, green spaces, parks and golf courses located in village, town, suburban and 
urban areas. http://canadaforests.nrcan.gc.ca/glossary/u
