Part 3: The 
Opportunities
9. Financial Analysis
9.1 FINANCIAL CONCEPTS
The direct, community-wide, financial impacts  of Toronto’s net zero pathways provide important 
context for local decision-makers. However, direct financial impacts should be seen as a secondary 
benefit of reducing GHG emissions. First and foremost, GHG reductions are a critical response 
to the global climate emergency. In addition, most measures included in the pathways provide 
economic and social goods to the community, such as net job creation and positive health 
outcomes, which are only reflected in this financial analysis as the cost of carbon emitted.91
Key concepts that are used to analyze the financial impacts of the pathways are summarized 
below.92
COSTS ARE RELATIVE TO THE DO NOTHING SCENARIO
This financial analysis tracks projected costs and savings associated with low-carbon measures that 
are above and beyond the costs in the Do Nothing scenario. 
DISCOUNT RATE
The discount rate is the baseline growth value an investor places on their investment dollar. A 
project is considered financially beneficial by an investor if it generates a real rate of return equal to 
or greater than their discount rate. 
An investor's discount rate varies with the type of project, duration of the investment, risk, and the 
scarcity of capital. The social discount rate is the discount rate applied for comparing the value 
to society of investments made for the common good and, as such, it is inherently uncertain and 
difficult to determine. Some argue that a very low or even zero discount rate should be applied in 
the evaluation of climate change mitigation investments. In this project, we evaluate investments in 
a low-carbon future with a 3% discount rate.93
91	 The Social Cost of Carbon is an estimate of the damage caused to society by climate change, including impacts 
on health and lost jobs. 
92 Detailed financial assumptions are described in the Data, Methods and Assumptions Manual.

NET PRESENT VALUE
The net present value (NPV) of an investment is the difference between the present value of the 
capital investment and the present value of the future stream of savings and revenue generated by 
the investment. 
Five aggregate categories are used to track the financial performance of the low-carbon actions 
in this analysis: capital expenditures, energy savings (or additional costs), carbon cost savings 
(assuming the carbon price reaches $170/tonne CO2e in 2030 and is held constant thereafter), 
operation and maintenance savings, and revenue generation (associated with renewable energy 
production facilities and some transit actions). Administrative costs associated with implementing 
programs are excluded, as well as any energy system infrastructure upgrades that may be required. 
Similarly, the broader social costs that are avoided from mitigating climate change are not included 
in this financial analysis, such as avoided health costs, or avoided damages from climate change.
ABATEMENT COST
The abatement cost of an action is the estimated cost for that action to reduce one tonne of GHG 
emissions, which is calculated by dividing the action’s NPV by the total GHG emissions reductions 
(tCO2e) resulting from the action. For example, if a project has a NPV of $1,000 and generates 
10 tCO2e of savings, its abatement cost is $100 per tCO2e reduced.
AMORTIZATION
The costs of major capital investments are typically spread over a period of time (e.g. a mortgage 
on a house commonly has a 25-year mortgage period). Amortization refers to the process of paying 
off capital expenditures (debt) through regular principal and interest payments over time. In this 
analysis we have applied a 25-year amortization rate to all investments. 
ENERGY AND CARBON COST PROJECTIONS 
Energy cost projections were derived from:94
•  the Independent Electricity System Operator’s (IESO) Long-Term Energy Plan (electricity); 
•  the US Energy Information Administration (propane); and
•  the Canada’s Energy Regulator (all other fuels).
The financial analysis is sensitive to electricity and natural gas costs. Electricity costs are projected to 
increase more rapidly than natural gas; if natural gas costs increase more rapidly, then the financial 
benefit of many of the actions increases. 
An escalating cost of carbon based on federal regulation was applied out to 2030, then held 
constant. 
94 For more details on the financial assumptions see the TransformTO Data, Methods and Assumptions Manual.

A PROSPEROUS CITY
Economic prosperity is the capability to flourish, according to a definition developed by the UK 
Sustainable Development Commission.95 In articulating this definition, the authors cite broad 
questions posed by the economist Amartya Sen about how people are able to function: Are 
they well nourished? Are they free from avoidable morbidity? Do they live long? Can they take 
part in the life of the community? Can they appear in public without shame and without feeling 
disgraced? Can they find worthwhile jobs? Can they keep themselves warm? Can they use their 
school education? Can they visit friends and relations if they choose?96 The notion of the capability 
to flourish as a definition of economic prosperity is consistent with the intention of key City 
documents, such as One Toronto and TO Prosperity: Toronto Poverty Reduction Strategy. It is 
complementary to the categories on health and social equity discussed elsewhere in this report, 
and, as the UK Sustainable Development Commission argued, is also consistent with the intention 
of preventing dangerous levels of climate change. 
In considering potential co-benefits and co-harms of efforts to reduce GHG emissions, the aspects 
of economic prosperity which will be considered include employment, household incomes, 
enterprises, public finance, environmental capital, and social capital.

97	 While the capital investments in the NZ scenarios all occur by 2050, the savings and revenue from many of those 
investments continue well beyond 2050 and are tracked in this analysis to the year 2089. This also accounts for 
why the gap between the NPV and undiscounted totals is higher for the non-capital categories.
98	 Revenue losses are a result of mode shifts to walking and cycling, and, in the NZ Pathways, from making transit 
free. See Figure 51 and its description for a more detailed explanation of this.

The financial impacts of the scenarios were explored in detail. At a high level, the investments in 
NZ40, which has the highest near-term investments, hover around 5% of annual GDP for a decade 
before declining to 2% in the subsequent decades. Figure 45 illustrates the scale of investments 
relative to a projection of the annual GDP, which is escalated at 1% to illustrate the scale of 
investments is relatively small in comparison to the overall GDP of the city.
  
Figure 45. Investments relative to projected GDP (annual growth of 1%).
The investments in the NZ scenarios generate financial returns, the net impact of which is illustrated 
in Figure 46. Notably, the NZ40 generates financial returns (beginning in 2040) prior to the NZ50 
City of Toronto Net Zero Strategy – Technical Report
112 
scenario (beginning in 2045), while the BAP generates financial benefits by 2032. The suite of 
actions in the BAP scenario generate financial returns because investments are low and returns are 
relatively high, but the BAP is not a viable scenario in terms of achieving the City’s GHG targets.

Each of the lines in Figure 46 represent the addition of investments and savings. For illustrative 
purposes, in an early year in a net zero scenario, investments might total $7 billion, while savings 
total $1 billion. This results in a net cost of $6 billion (7-1=6). Later in the study period, investments 
might total $5 billion, while savings total $6 billion, resulting in net savings of -$1 billion (5-6=-1). 
There are many underlying dynamics at play that result in these curves. Both the NZ40 and NZ50 
scenarios have higher initial investments and NZ40 has higher investments in vehicles than NZ50. 
As a result of the earlier investments in EVs, greater savings occur in NZ40 earlier, pushing the NZ40 
line down to zero earlier than the NZ50 line. The investments in NZ40 and NZ50 generate greater 
savings than the BAP post 2050. In the post-investment period after 2050, the benefits continue for 
as long as the measures deliver savings.

9.3 A MIX OF ABATEMENT COSTS 
AND SAVINGS
Abatement costs provide an indication as to whether a measure generates financial returns over its 
lifetime. A negative abatement cost indicates an action generates financial returns, while a positive 
abatement cost indicates the cost of an action that exceeds financial returns. The width of each bar 
on the x-axis indicates the amount of GHG emissions that it saves. 
The marginal abatement cost for the NZ40 actions are provided in Figure 47. Active transit 
infrastructure has the highest marginal abatement cost at $14,567 for every tonne of GHG reduced. 
Increasing tree canopy follows with a marginal abatement cost of $6,506. Both of these are 
interesting examples because, unlike other actions, GHG emission reductions are not always the 
primary motivator for these projects. In addition, these actions deliver significant benefits (improved 
health in the case of active transportation and ecology and shade in the case of trees) that are not 
factored into the calculation as financial benefits. 
More compact buildings have the lowest cost, generating financial returns (savings) $10,474 per 
tonne of GHG reduced. Electrification of vehicles consistently generate savings including personal 
vehicles (savings of $205/t), transit (savings of $566/t), and the City fleet (savings of $592/t). These 
measures deliver a third of the GHG reductions while generating financial savings that could help to 
pay for building retrofits.

THE CRITICALITY OF A SYSTEMS APPROACH
The abatement costs provide an important insight: the electrification of transportation generates 
financial savings, which, given the deployment of appropriate financial mechanisms, can be used 
to finance building retrofits, which are more costly. Building retrofits are critical to minimizing the 
burden on the grid to enable electrification of transportation.

feedback cycle.
 
Figure 48. The electrification feedback cycle. 
While a marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) illustrates the financial profile of the suite of actions, 
it is an imperfect indicator. The presentation of the MACC implies that the actions are a menu from 
which individual actions can be selected. In fact, many of the actions are dependent on each other. 
For example, the district energy cost increases without retrofits. Another important message is that, 
in order to achieve the City’s target, all the actions must be undertaken as soon as possible. While 
there can be a tendency to wait for technological improvements, this has the effect of reducing the 
value of the savings that can be achieved for households and businesses, and the new employment 
opportunities that can be created.

116 
USING ABATEMENT COSTS TO GUIDE POLICY
Figure 49 illustrates an abatement curve of actions. Actions on the left save money and are 
therefore financially interesting to investors. Actions in the middle have a net present value that is 
either slightly negative or slightly positive and may require credit enhancements to be compelling. 
Finally, on the right, those actions which are NPV negative will require subsidies. A capital-
constrained public sector must concentrate on the expensive projects while relying on the private 
sector for the rest. A capital-rich public sector can invest in projects that are more expensive and 
those that may generate more interesting financial returns.

Figure 49. Aligning the abatement costs with investor interest.
Many of the actions in the NZ scenarios have positive net present values. Figure 50 shows the 
present value of the major components of the three scenarios: investments; operations and 
maintenance savings; fuel and electricity savings; avoided costs of carbon; and revenue from transit 
and local energy generation. After discounting at 3%, the investments in both NZ scenarios have a 
present value of $57 billion (the light green bar), meaning there is no substantial financial difference 
between these two scenarios. It is important to highlight the fact that capital investment for the plan 
ends in 2050, however the NPV includes the energy, maintenance, and carbon costs savings as well 
as revenue projected over the full life of the measure, which, in some cases, extend as far as 2089.

The annual costs, savings, and revenue associated with fully implementing the actions in the NZ 
scenarios are shown in detail in Figure 51, with capital expenditures shown in full for the years in 
which they are incurred. As is characteristic of low-carbon transitions, the capital expenditures in the 
early years of the transition are significantly greater than the savings and revenues generated, and 
by 2040 savings are beginning to exceed investments in the NZ40 scenario.

Note that revenues show up as a cost (positive numbers), rather than as savings (negative numbers), 
contrary to what would be expected with the significant additions of renewable energy and district 
energy that generate new revenues. This outcome results because the reduction in revenues 
from transit relative to the Do Nothing scenario (as transit is free) exceeds the new revenues from 
renewable energy and district energy systems, generating a net cost (Figure 52). 
119 
December 2021
Figure 52. Impact of free transit on avoided annual revenues, relative to revenues from 
renewable electricity generation, NZ40. 
In addition to the reduced revenue as a result of making transit free, transit investments are also one 
of the three major capital investment areas in the NZ scenarios, totalling $92 billion over the period. 
Transit plays a similar role to building retrofits by reducing the overall energy demand on the grid 
resulting from the electrification of transportation, as transit is more efficient than personal vehicles. 
Residential and non-residential buildings are the other major sources of investment, accounting for 
$74 and $42 billion, respectively (Figure 53). 
The stacked area charts in Figure 53 represent the investments in the year in which they are made, 
which results in spikes and peaks depending on which actions are implemented in which year. For 
example, there is a spike in local energy investments in 2027 when renewable energy capacity is 
added. There is also an incremental capital expenditure relative to the Do Nothing scenario in 2030 
when EVs are added, reflecting the early retirement of ICE vehicles. Expenditures on vehicles are 
greater in the NZ40 scenario than the background replacement rate in the Do Nothing scenario. 
Because of the early replacement, fewer vehicles are purchased in the NZ40 scenario than the Do 
Nothing scenario between 2038 and 2044, resulting in a reduction in capital expenditures in this 
category. Similar blips can be observed in the NZ50 scenario but later on in the time period. The 
investment in transit and the building stock in the NZ scenarios is apparent relative to the BAP 
scenario.

Figure 54 presents costs and revenues, but with the capital expenditures amortized over 25 
years with 3% interest. With this approach, which presumably would reflect actual approaches 
for financing the transition, the annualized capital payments are about equal to the savings and 
revenue generation, right from the beginning of the program. By 2045 the annualized capital 
payments begin to decline as the earliest investments are paid off. On an annual basis, the NZ 
scenarios have an annual deficit, and annual savings only exceed annual costs by a small amount 
after 2070, as illustrated by the black line.

Figure 54. Investments amortized over the period for each of the three scenarios over the Do

Amortization reduces the requirement for capital in the short term and smoothes out the trajectory, 
resulting in a longer tail of payments out until 2070 (Figure 55).  
City of Toronto Net Zero Strategy – Technical Report
122 
Figure 55. Impact of amortization on capital requirements for the NZ40 scenario.
Household expenditures on energy—natural gas, electricity, gasoline, and diesel—are projected to 
decline slightly in the BAP and decline significantly in the net zero scenarios (Figure 56). In the BAP, 
household energy expenditures are relatively flat because vehicles become more efficient due to 
national fuel efficiency standards and because of decreased heating requirements as the climate 
becomes hotter due to climate change. The net zero scenarios involve shifting away from natural 
gas and gasoline to electricity, a more costly energy source. The increased cost, however, is offset 
by the increased efficiency of homes as required by building codes, and in the case of electric 
vehicles by the high efficiency of the electric motors as compared to internal combustion engines. 
The carbon price also adds to the cost of using fossil fuels for heating and transport. In the net zero 
scenarios, an average household in 2050 spends less on fuel and electricity (household energy and 
transportation expenditures) than they would have in the Do Nothing scenario. Depending on the 
business, policy, and financing strategies used in the implementation of the actions, these savings 
will be partly offset by the incremental capital expenditures required.

THE IMPACT OF THE CARBON TAX
The carbon price is currently projected to climb to $170/tCO2e by 2030. This has the impact of 
increasing the cost of gasoline and natural gas relative to electricity. As a result, gasoline is more 
expensive than electricity on a per-unit-of-energy basis by 2028 (note that the carbon price has 
not been factored into the electricity cost as it is negligible). This benefit is compounded by the 
fact that electric vehicles can go further per unit of energy than gasoline vehicles. Natural gas is 
still more affordable than electricity on a per unit basis over the period. Heat pumps, however, are 
three times more efficient than natural gas heating and home heating with an electric heat pump 
becomes more affordable than heating with natural gas in 2027 (Figure 57).

Transitioning to a low- or zero-carbon economy is expected to have four categories of impacts 
on labour markets: additional jobs will be created in emerging sectors, some employment will 
be shifted (e.g., from fossil fuels to renewables), certain jobs will be reduced or eliminated  (e.g., 
combustion engine vehicle mechanics), and many existing jobs will be transformed and redefined. 
The NZ40 scenario adds 1.5 million person-years of employment over the Do Nothing Scenario 
between 2020 and 2050 (Figure 58). As seen in the figure, this amounts to approximately 40,000-
60,000 jobs annually with the majority in residential and commercial building retrofits and 
infrastructure investments, averaging 10,000-20,000 in each of these three areas.

10. Co-Benefits
As has been discussed, the benefits of GHG mitigation actions go well beyond emissions 
reductions, also helping to advance City objectives around health, equity, prosperity, and climate 
resilience. Recognizing this, in 2019 the City’s Environment and Energy Division commissioned three 
reports to explore how these benefits from climate actions could be quantified. This section draws 
on this work, analyzing metrics related to health, equity, and resilience and comparing them across 
the four scenarios to shed light on the relative impacts of each. The analysis shows that, across the 
board, the City could expect to see demonstrable improvements in the NZ scenarios over the BAP 
and Do Nothing scenarios.

10.1 ADVANCING HEALTH
CLEANER AIR
In 2020, approximately 232 GJ of fossil fuels were combusted in the City of Toronto. The 
combustion of these fossil fuels releases air pollutants, such as sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, 
particulate matter, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, and others, and can create 
ground-level ozone, all of which have adverse impacts on human health. Air pollution from traffic 
has resulted in cases of neurological disorders including Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease 
and other dementias,99 acute bronchitis in children, asthma and respiratory illnesses, among 
other impacts.100 In addition, low income residents experience a greater burden of air pollution.101 
Toronto Public Health estimates that 1,300 premature deaths and 3,550 hospitalizations for heart 
and lung disease in Toronto can be attributed to air pollution each year.102 According to one 
study, “eliminating tailpipe emissions, especially in large metropolitan areas, represents a unique 
opportunity to reduce the health burden of PM2.5 in the U.S.”103 The study quantified the benefit 
at between US$0.02 and US$0.12 per mile; at $0.056 per mile, the reduced air pollution can be 
valued at $750 million per year, or $7.5 billion between 2040 and 2050 when ICEs are phased 
out. The actual value per mile for Toronto would be higher, due the benefits between 2025 and 
2040 when EVs are phased in, cleaner electricity to power the vehicles than in the study (less air 
pollution), and the exposure levels due to the urban environment of Toronto.
There is also increasing evidence about the impacts of using natural gas stoves and fireplaces 
indoors on health impacts, particularly on children.104 In the NZ scenarios, natural gas appliances are 
phased out and replaced with electric appliances. Reducing the combustion of fossil fuels can help 
alleviate a wide range of air quality health impacts and result in a more livable indoor and outdoor 
environment in Toronto.
By 2050, the NZ scenarios see a 99% reduction in local fossil fuels combusted compared to the Do 
Nothing scenario, primarily from switching vehicles and building heating systems to electric sources.

PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
Actions in both NZ scenarios result in increased active travel. They increase bike lanes and 
pedestrian infrastructure, increase the number of transit trips through promotional campaigns, and 
encourage alternative forms of travel over vehicle use through road tolls and e-bike programs. 
With active transportation being the most common form of physical exercise, increasing walking 
and biking has been identified as one of the most significant ways to improve a city’s public 
physical health.105 Health benefits from routine physical exercise include reductions in incidence of 
diabetes,106 cancer, and heart-related illnesses, as well as improvements to mental health.107
The NZ scenarios result in a doubling of average walking kilometers per person per year and sixfold 
increase in average yearly cycling kilometers per person annually by 2050 compared to the Do 
Nothing scenario.

While nearly every neighbourhood experiences increases in active transportation, the increases are 
not evenly distributed. For example, neighbourhoods in a ring around the downtown experience 
increases 2-4 times higher than other parts of the city, due to their proximity to services. Large areas 
of geography experience increases that average 0.5 to 1 km per person per day, while a smaller 
number of zones experience little or no growth. These walking and cycling deserts require more 
targeted interventions.

NOISE POLLUTION AND TRAFFIC
Noise pollution is reduced in the NZ Scenarios, in part through reduced vehicle kilometers travelled 
(14% fewer than Do Nothing in 2050), but primarily through conversion of internal combustion 
engine vehicles to quieter electric vehicles. By 2050, in the NZ scenarios, there are approximately 
1.3 million fewer internal combustion engine vehicles and 125,000 fewer commercial internal 
combustion engine vehicles on Toronto’s roads compared to Do Nothing. Noise pollution from 
traffic has been associated with a number of health impacts including cardiovascular disease,108 
annoyance,109 sleep disturbance, and heart attacks.110

Figure 61 illustrates that the decrease in VKT in the NZ40 scenario due to mode shifting and 
changing transportation patterns is not concentrated in one area of the City but rather is 
widespread. Figure 62 shows how VKT is reduced by 30% in some zones, from 50 million VKT per 
year to 35 million VKT, for example. The benefits are multiple in terms of reduced air pollution, 
noise, increased safety, reduced social isolation, and other factors.

INDOOR ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
According to the City’s buildings projections, over 80% of the floorspace that will exist in 2050 has 
already been built. With people typically spending 90% of their time indoors,112 the condition of 
these spaces significantly impacts the physical and mental health of residents. Retrofits to reduce 
GHGs include improvements to building envelopes, as well as to heating, ventilation, and air 
conditioning systems. These retrofits can reduce indoor air pollutants (i.e., NOx, CO, and VOCs), 
reduce mould and dampness, and improve thermal comfort of buildings. Health benefits from 
these changes can include reduced risks of cardiovascular, endocrine, respiratory, cancer, and 
cardiopulmonary illnesses, as well as decreased mental disorders and improvements to mental 
health.113,114,115
In the NZ Scenarios,100% of buildings are retrofitted by 2050, water and space heating systems are 
all converted to heat pumps, and all natural gas appliances are phased out. By 2050, approximately 
804,000 more dwelling units and 10,000 more square meters of non-residential floor space have 
been retrofitted in the NZ Scenarios compared to Do Nothing. These retrofits result in 93% fewer 
GJ of fossil fuels being used in residential buildings, and 97% fewer in non-residential buildings.

SOCIAL INTERACTIONS
In the Net Zero Scenarios, people spend approximately 80 hours walking and cycling annually in 
2050.116 This is just over three times greater than the 26 hours spent in the Do Nothing Scenario 
in 2050. Time spent outside walking and cycling increases the number of conversations and 
connections amongst residents, which can increase individuals’ mental health, sense of community 
within a neighbourhood, and neighbourhood safety.117
10.2 ECONOMIC PROSPERITY
LOCAL ECONOMY
Economic impacts of the NZ Scenarios have been discussed in detail in the Financial Analysis 
section. Overall, the NZ Scenarios result in $140 billion (NZ50) and $146 billion (NZ40) in 
investments over the next 30 years compared to the Do Nothing Scenario. These lead to 1.25 
million and 1.26 million new person years of employment, respectively. In addition to this, local 
businesses see a 32% decrease in fuel costs to heat and cool their buildings due to efficiency 
116	This estimate is calculated based on a walking rate of 4 km/h and a cycling rate of 15 km/h.

improvements, freeing up money for other purposes such as improving business competitiveness or 
for reinvestment in the economy.  
Reduced household costs for energy and transportation also represent opportunities for residents 
to spend money locally, resulting in more resilient neighbourhoods. Other benefits to the local 
economy are seen from changing travel patterns and modes in the NZ scenarios, resulting in more 
visits and spending at local shops.118 Providing free transit, as is done in the NZ scenarios, has been 
shown to result in an increase in leisure and shopping trips,119 while businesses have also seen 
increased retail sales from the addition of nearby bike lanes.120

COST OF LIVING
GHG reduction measures result in reduced household energy costs as buildings are built and 
retrofitted to be more energy efficient. NZ Scenario household energy costs are nearly 50% less 
in 2050 compared to the Do Nothing Scenario. Transportation costs are also reduced in the NZ 
Scenarios, as more automobile trips are replaced by walking, cycling, and transit trips and as 
transit becomes free. Transportation costs decrease from $214 per household per month in the Do 
Nothing Scenario to just $23 per month in the NZ40 Scenario. Taken together, this results in a 77% 
decrease in household monthly energy expenditures in the NZ Scenarios compared to Do Nothing 
by 2050, an average reduction of nearly $2,850 per household per year when transit fares are 
considered, or $1,030 per household per year when transit fares are not considered.

MUNICIPAL FINANCES
The table below summarizes net municipal costs across the four scenarios. It is important to note 
that these numbers were drawn from a city-wide analysis and thus are broad estimates. A detailed 
analysis of corporate actions, investments, and savings should be undertaken to gain further 
insights. The costs included in this calculation of municipal finances are: transit infrastructure capital 
costs (assuming 27% of total investments are incurred by the City, the rest are from Provincial, 
Federal or other sources), transit bus maintenance and fuel costs, transit revenues, transit vehicle 
capital costs, wastewater and water treatment, waste management, and road toll revenues. Costs 
and savings related to new buildings, building retrofits, and renewable energy investments are not 
included (these are aggregated into the city-wide commercial numbers), nor are costs for staff time 
for development and deployment of programs to deliver the actions. By 2050, costs increase by 
approximately $2.2 billion in the Net Zero Scenarios compared to Do Nothing.

10.3 BIODIVERSITY
ECOSYSTEM ENCROACHMENT
All forms of energy generation—including renewables—require land121 that could otherwise be used 
to maintain biodiversity or for agriculture or forestry. This land, known as the energy footprint, is 
required for exploration, fuel extraction, generation, transmission, and distribution, and is primarily 
located outside of Toronto’s geographic borders. For example, the energy footprint traces the land 
use impact of gasoline to the oil sands, or the source of natural gas to shale formations, or the 
source of electricity to wind farms. Through reduced fossil fuel consumption and efficiency gains, 
the latter of which reduces the capacity required, the NZ scenarios result in an energy footprint 
1,392 km2 smaller than that of the Do Nothing scenario—an area more than double the size of the 
City of Toronto.

HABITAT CONNECTIVITY
As development continues throughout the GTA, so too does the importance of preserving and 
restoring local habitats and biodiversity. The BAP and NZ Scenario targets align with the City’s 
Strategic Forest Management Plan goal of increasing tree canopy cover in the city from 30% to 
40%. Additional benefits of increased tree canopy and greenery in cities can include improvements 
to mental health, reduced heat island effect, improved air quality, and improved stormwater 
infiltration during extreme rainfall events.123

10.4 EQUITY
While consideration of equity is woven through the sections above, this section addresses specific 
equity considerations. 
INTERGENERATIONAL EQUITY
Climate change represents a burden on future generations that increases the longer that action is 
delayed. Recent years have seen increased demand from youth for government action on climate 
change, including school walk-outs, protests, and lawsuits against their governments for inaction on 
climate change.124 
The social cost of carbon (SCC) has been used in regulatory processes in Canada and the US to 
reflect the impacts of climate change on society. The SCC attempts to add up the quantifiable costs 
and benefits of a tonne of carbon dioxide on society, incorporating assumptions around future 
conditions such as population size, economic growth, rate of climate change, and the impact of 
climate change on these conditions.

www.ourchildrenstrust.org/us/federal-lawsuit/ 
141 
December 2021
The cumulative cost of the Do Nothing Scenario between 2020 and 2050 using the Social Cost of 
Carbon (SCC) is $94 billion. Under the BAP, this declines to $76 billion. Under the NZ40, it declines 
to $35 billion, as illustrated in Figure 68.125 
IMPACTS ON LOW-INCOME POPULATION
Climate change is affecting individuals and communities at varying rates and to varying degrees.126 
Climate change is amplifying vulnerability and hindering adaptive capacity of persons with low 
incomes, Aboriginal Peoples, LGBTQ2S communities, undocumented individuals, immigrants and 
refugees, diverse women, seniors, children, persons with disabilities, and racialized groups. These 
groups often lack power as well as access to resources, adequate urban services, and reliable 
infrastructure. For example, poverty and marginalization not only leave people vulnerable to rising 
food, water, and energy prices, but also limit their ability to invest in resources and prepare for the 
impacts of climate change. Following a disaster, it is much harder for low-income and marginalized 
communities to rebuild, as these groups are less likely to have the social capital and resources to do 
so.
The figure below shows the decrease in household energy costs, which occurs in nearly every 
zone across the city. Neighbourhoods with the greatest populations of low-income individuals 
are highlighted. These areas see reductions of up to $2,000 in yearly household energy costs in 
the NZ40 Scenario compared to Do Nothing Scenario. Ensuring that the benefits of these savings 
reach low-income populations (e.g., renters rather than building owners), however, is dependent on 
policies to ensure that this occurs. Similarly, programs to provide or assist with capital for renewable 
energy and energy efficient construction and retrofits for low-income earners and housing will 
also be important to ensure that they can participate in and reap the benefits of the low-carbon 
transition.

Figure 66. Change in yearly household energy costs (vehicle fuel and home energy) in the NZ40 
scenario compared to Do Nothing in 2050. Neighbourhoods housing low-income populations 
greater than 10,000 people are highlighted. In nearly every zone, energy costs decrease, to a 
maximum of $2,192/year saved, which occurs in a low-income neighbourhood. Savings are even 
greater when the impact of free transit is also considered.
TRANSIT AND ACTIVE TRAVEL ACCESSIBILITY
The NZ Scenarios call for significant investments in transit, including converting one lane of traffic 
to exclusive bus lanes on all arterials, increased service frequency on all transit routes (bus by 70%, 
streetcar by 50%, subway off-peak service to every 3 minutes), and expanding the rapid transit 
network. The cost of making transit free in the NZ Scenarios is partially offset by tolls of 
$0.66/km on all arterial roads. As a result, alongside increases in active transportation (see the 
previous section on physical activity), per-household transportation costs decrease by 76%. This is 
even more significant for people who do not own a car and for whom costs are reduced by 100%.  
From an equity perspective, this is significant, as it frees up money for low-income populations to 
meet other needs and provides them with access to services and job opportunities that might have 
otherwise been out of reach. Infrastructure investments need to be distributed and directed to 
low-income areas to ensure that these benefits do in fact reach low-income residents.
143 
December 2021
QUALITY AFFORDABLE HOUSING
In 2010, 44% of renter households and 28% of owner households faced affordability issues in the 
City of Toronto.127 Households facing energy poverty or energy insecurity face challenges such as 
"pay the rent or feed the kids," "heat or eat," or "cool or eat.”128 Low-income households stand to 
benefit greatly from the improved housing quality and energy cost savings resulting from the NZ 
Scenario actions. Affordable housing units and units occupied by low-income earners in Toronto are 
more likely to be in need of repair,129,130 with these buildings often being older, less energy efficient, 
and lacking proper ventilation. 
In the NZ Scenarios, 100% of dwelling units are retrofit to net zero standards, presenting 
opportunities for improved health and living conditions for residents, and energy savings for 
households. Prioritizing the retrofit of affordable and low-income housing, particularly that which 
is in need of repair, can help to improve the living conditions of Torontonians who need this most. 
Energy retrofits can result in improved thermal satisfaction, fewer reported financial difficulties, 
increased satisfaction among participants with the repair of their homes, fewer reported housing-
related problems and more social interactions.131 Care will need to be taken to ensure that adverse 
impacts from these efforts, such as increased housing costs or rents, are managed or avoided. 
Focussing retrofit initiatives on low-income households will mean the financial and health benefits 
from the NZ actions are seen sooner for those in need.  
Retrofits can also increase the resilience of affordable housing by incorporating measures for 
extreme heat and power outages. Relative death rates can begin to increase at temperatures as 
low as 20°C, rates which are influenced by pre-existing health conditions, social isolation, living 
conditions and other factors.132 A 2010 survey found that 15% of Toronto residents do not have air 
conditioning, and for those with low incomes, 33% did not have air conditioning.133 Deep retrofits 
can increase the passive survivability of the dwelling while the installation of electric heat pumps 
provides cooling.

GLOBAL EQUITY
Climate change is directly killing people.134 A recent paper in Nature developed a new metric, the 
mortality cost of carbon (MCC), which quantifies the number of deaths per ton of GHG emissions 
released in 2020.135 Adding 4,434 tons of carbon dioxide in 2020 causes one excess death globally 
in expectation between 2020-2100. Using this number, the NZ40 scenario results in 59,539 fewer 
deaths globally than the Do Nothing scenario. As the authors point out, not all people have 
an equal impact—the lifetime emissions of 3.5 Americans cause one excess death globally in 
expectation between 2020 and 2100, the same impact that results from the lifetime emissions of 
100 Indians. 
10.5 SAFETY & RESILIENCE
RESILIENCE TO OUTAGES AND CLIMATE IMPACTS
Many GHG mitigation efforts have been shown to increase adaptive capacity to the impacts of 
climate change. These synergies exist at many levels.136 While all these benefits are not captured 
here, some key improvements to resilience in the city from the NZ scenarios include: 
•  safer buildings during extreme weather events (flooding, extreme heat/cold) from older 
buildings having been retrofitted;
•  decreased impacts of power outages from homes having been fitted with renewable 
energy and storage systems;
•  decreased impacts of power outages for homes that are connected to district energy 
systems;
•  decreased stress on water and wastewater systems from retrofits and more stringent 
efficiency standards for new buildings;
•  decreased heat island effect and flood stress from greater tree canopy cover; and
•  increased back-up power from EVs.

CYCLING AND PEDESTRIAN SAFETY
Cycling and pedestrian safety is improved in the NZ Scenarios by:
•  increasing cycling and pedestrian infrastructure to provide safer travel and crossings;
•  reducing opportunities for collisions with vehicles as VKT decrease; and
•  increasing the “safety in numbers” effect from a greater prevalence of pedestrians and 
cyclists on roads.137
The table below shows that the NZ Scenarios result in 2,140 more kilometers of cycling/multi-use 
trails and 108 more kilometers of sidewalks compared to the Do Nothing Scenario.

11. Implementation
This section provides key insights for the City as it begins implementing its Net Zero Strategy. These 
insights have been used in the development of the Net Zero Strategy, which details the City’s key 
implementation actions and targets over the next decade.

December 2021
11.1 THE QUESTION 
OF FEASIBILITY 
The City has posed the question as to whether or not achieving net zero by 2040 is feasible. 
Broadly speaking, feasibility is defined as whether something can be made, done, or achieved. The 
modelling demonstrates that there is a pathway for Toronto to achieve NZ40 in physical terms. The 
pathway also provides a number of insights with respect to feasibility: 
1.	 The pathway is technologically feasible: The core of the actions 
evaluated rely on current technologies; in other words, there are no magic or untested 
solutions that contribute to the NZ40 pathway. Note that some emerging technologies 
are included, such as green hydrogen, but they are not critical to the pathway, and 
technological developments could speed up the pathway even more.
2.	The financial resources can be mobilized: The investment required 
is approximately 5% of the City’s GDP for a decade, or significantly less if the investments 
are amortized. In addition, many of these investments generate returns. The mechanisms 
for mobilizing these investments and which entity makes the investment will influence the 
timing and scale of funds that can be raised. 
3.	Political will is required: The implementation of the NZ40 pathway will require 
new and innovative policies which will disrupt the status quo. Given the lag time to develop 
and deliver policies, there is no time to delay.
4.	The grid needs to decarbonize: The emissions intensity of the provincial 
electricity grid is currently projected to increase. For the city to get to zero, the grid needs 
to become clean by 2040. Failing this, the city can rely on the “net” part of the target and 
purchase carbon offsets or renewable energy certificates, both of which add to the costs of 
the pathway and deliver limited co-benefits. 
There are other conditions that will need to be satisfied in order to implement the NZ40 pathway: 
1.	 Action must begin now: The NZ40 pathway requires ambitious action to begin as 
early as 2021. Swift action not only allows financial benefits to accrue sooner and results in 
fewer GHG emissions released in the long run, but also sets the stage for ambition to ramp 
up as the target year approaches and for the City to ultimately meet it by 2040.
2.	The electricity system needs to be adapted: In addition to 
decarbonizing the grid, the electricity system needs to be able to adapt to new loads as 
heating and transportation are electrified. At a high level, the NZ40 scenario mitigates 
City of Toronto Net Zero Strategy – Technical Report
148 
this challenge by emphasizing efficiency first to minimise the increase in annual electricity 
consumption; however, hourly peaks will vary. 
3.	The labour market must shift: The skills mix and capacity of the labour force 
will need to scale up rapidly in order to deliver the actions in NZ40. 
4.	New and innovative delivery mechanisms must be adopted: 
Conventional delivery mechanisms are likely too slow and costly to deliver the 
transformation envisioned in NZ40. For example, the model of delivering retrofits one house 
at a time will need to be replaced by a bulk retrofit program.   
5.	Impacts on material and land resources should be accounted 
for: The economy will need to produce large numbers of electric vehicles and deliver 
building retrofits and renewable energy in short order. In addition to supplying or 
manufacturing these resources, there are also material requirements for concrete, wood, 
insulation, batteries, and land. The environmental, social, and economic implications 
will need to be carefully considered to ensure that there is not a negative feedback that 
stimulates additional GHG emissions. 
11.2 A CARBON BUDGET FOR 
THE CITY OF TORONTO
The historical practice of carbon management has been to identify GHG emissions reduction 
targets for specific years, such as targets set for 2030 and 2050. The more recent emerging 
paradigm, however, indicates that every tonne of GHG matters and, therefore, the trajectory of 
GHG emissions, not just the end point, must be managed. The City of Toronto’s Climate Emergency 
Declaration (2019.MM10.3) also includes direction to investigate and report back on the feasibility 
of creating a carbon budget for the City of Toronto to aid in the implementation of TransformTO.138
A carbon budget provides a theoretical limit to the total GHG emissions that a community or 
organization can produce; the budget is directly aligned with the remaining global carbon budget 
for 1.5°C of warming. Governments and cities around the world, such as the United Kingdom, the 
City of Oslo, and several Canadian cities, are implementing self-imposed carbon budgets.

Figure 67. Hypothetical illustration for delayed versus immediate GHG mitigation reductions 
towards meeting a carbon budget. 
Figure 67 demonstrates how a carbon budget can act as a key climate action planning tool. Both 
pathways result in the same cumulative emissions over the 30-year period; however, by year 
15, the delayed action pathway has spent 90% of the carbon budget compared to only 70% for 
the pathway with immediate action. The delayed mitigation scenario results in GHG emissions 
continuing to grow until they peak around Year 11, at which time steep reductions are required to 
stay within the carbon budget. The scenario with significant immediate mitigation action, on the 
other hand, results in a more gradual transition. 
TORONTO’S CARBON BUDGET
While Council has set 1.5ºC-aligned targets and directed for the investigation into a similarly 
aligned carbon budget, the City of Toronto has not yet quantified a carbon budget for itself.  
There are different methods for quantifying local and global carbon budgets and there is not yet 
consensus on a single one that should be used. There is consensus, however, that there is a finite 
amount of GHG emissions that can be released into the atmosphere to avoid catastrophic climate 
change, and, as discussed above, a carbon budget allows for accountability and transparency in 
efforts to reach net zero emissions. The NZ40 scenario results in 178 MtCO2e, which can be used as 
a proxy for the city’s carbon budget. At 2019 levels of emissions, this total would be exceeded in 
City of Toronto Net Zero Strategy – Technical Report
150 
12 years. The total remaining consumption of gasoline and natural gas (“gasoline and natural gas 
budgets”) can also be quantified in the NZ40 scenario. Remaining natural gas and gasoline equals 
less than 9 years of consumption of gasoline and natural gas at current rates.

11.3 INTEGRATING CLIMATE 
RESILIENCE
The City’s 2019 Resilience Strategy recommended that future TransformTO updates bring 
together climate mitigation and adaptation more systematically to maximize efficiencies and 
cost effectiveness. Climate resilience is often used interchangeably with adaptation; however, 
the City’s framework views climate resilience as a state, ability, or capacity to anticipate, reduce, 
accommodate, or recover from the effects of climate-related events, stresses, and acute shocks. 
Adaptation is the process by which the City can build climate resilience.
Climate adaptation and mitigation are inherently integrated in the sense that mitigation efforts to 
reduce emissions will help moderate climate impacts now and into the future. As such, investing in 
mitigation today lowers the costs and extent of adaptation and resilience in the future. Immediate 
and near-term policy decisions will determine the level of climate risk that the City of Toronto and 
151 
December 2021
jurisdictions around the globe will be exposed to. Similarly, planning and investing in adaptation 
action now will reduce further impacts and costs as the City’s climate changes.
The City can integrate climate mitigation and adaptation efforts and investments to maximize 
effectiveness and minimize overall risks. There are four types of adaptation-mitigation interactions:
1.	 Mal-investments: Actions that can be undone or are made less effective by the 
impacts of climate change if they do not create sufficient resilience (e.g., building new 
infrastructure in an area prone to flooding).
2.	Trade-offs: Actions with conflicting effects on mitigation and adaptation (e.g., diesel 
back-up power or increased air-conditioning units).
3.	Piggybacking: Actions that are complementary when designed and implemented 
together (e.g., adding adaptation measures to a mitigation initiative).
4.	Synergies: Actions that reduce both GHG emissions and climate risk (e.g., investments 
in new and enhanced green or natural infrastructure).
There are many opportunities for linking the City’s Net Zero Strategy and the Resiliency Strategy, 
including investments in green infrastructure and resilient local energy systems. For example, 
diversified community energy planning not only reduces GHG emissions, it can also reduce the risk 
of system failure during extreme storm events.
Toronto’s Resilience Strategy recommendations should be integrated into the planning and 
implementation of its Net Zero Strategy as follows:
1.	 Neighbourhood resilience, community energy systems, and 
energy efficiency: Develop a bottom-up community resilience approach to 
enhance and build the capacity of communities to become more resilient to climate impacts 
and more energy efficient. This approach should include an equity lens that identifies the 
City’s most climate-vulnerable neighbourhoods.
2.	Emergency management and infrastructure planning: Emergency 
management and risk reduction strategies should be implemented into infrastructure 
planning during the implementation of new climate mitigation actions.
3.	Climate resilience and retrofitting initiatives: Integrate climate 
resilience into ongoing building and tower retrofitting by including resilience to heat, 
flooding, and extreme events as core components of retrofit objectives.
4.	Critical infrastructure risk and vulnerability: The city depends 
upon a complex network of urban infrastructure, including energy, telecommunications, 
transportation, water supply, wastewater treatment, solid waste management, buildings, 
and food systems. This complex network will be transformed as the City implements the Net 
City of Toronto Net Zero Strategy – Technical Report
152 
Zero Strategy. At the same time, investment will be required to ensure that these networks 
can withstand the impacts of the growing frequency of extreme climate events, as well as 
the impacts of longer-term climate change.  
5.	Codes and standards: Update existing codes and standards for buildings and 
infrastructure with climate mitigation and adaptation considerations. These updates can 
be based on the City of Toronto’s Future Weather and Climate Drivers Study and the more 
recent Climate Atlas of Canada, which provides an updated and common set of future 
climate projections.
6.	Land-use planning: Integrate climate mitigation actions, such as energy efficiency 
and active transportation, as well as actions to build climate resilience, such as restricting 
development in high-risk areas and enhancing natural land cover, into land-use planning 
policies and processes. Adapting land-use planning tools for climate mitigation and 
resilience is one of the most effective ways to enhance climate resilience and implement 
GHG reductions in the urban landscape.
7.	Asset management: Integrate climate resilience and mitigation measures into the 
City’s corporate-wide Asset Management Framework and Integrated Asset Management 
Plan to align with Ontario Regulation 588/17. This regulation requires that municipalities 
consider climate change in the development of asset management policies and planning.
8.	Climate mitigation and resilience lens for capital planning: 
Develop and apply a comprehensive guideline for applying a climate lens for capital 
planning that demonstrates how to implement a climate mitigation and adaptation lens 
for all City capital projects. The lens could include spatial risk and vulnerability mapping, 
climate resilience design considerations, equitable distribution of infrastructure, and full 
lifecycle assessment for GHGs and costs.
9.	Green and blue infrastructure city-wide strategy for climate 
mitigation and resilience: Develop a coordinated and comprehensive city-
wide strategy that builds on current City efforts and plans to significantly expand green 
and blue infrastructure. Green and blue infrastructure play a significant role in reducing 
heat and flooding impacts by increasing infiltration, reducing runoff, reducing the heat 
island effect, and providing shading. They also contribute other social and environmental 
benefits, such as improved air and water quality, space for recreation, physical activity and 
social interaction, reduced noise pollution, reduced energy demand for cooling, and habitat 
for biodiversity, beauty, and in some cases food. Significant expansion of green and blue 
infrastructure is needed to address heat and flooding, as well as outdoor spaces for the 
City’s growing population.
10. Indigenous knowledge: Integrate Indigenous knowledge systems and 
collaborate with Indigenous peoples to ensure diverse perspectives and approaches are 
included in climate action planning. 
153 
December 2021
In 2010, the City developed the Toronto Climate Change Risk Assessment Tool to prioritize actions 
across the City’s divisions with a consistent and robust approach. This was followed by a streamlined 
version used by the City for a High-Level Risk Assessment exercise undertaken in 2016. According 
to the City’s Resilience Strategy, this process was successful in identifying a preliminary list of risk 
reduction activities. The Strategy recommended the City undertake a more detailed spatial risk and 
vulnerability assessment that would include an interdependencies analysis for critical infrastructure 
systems. This would ideally be undertaken as soon as possible so it can be integrated into the 
implementation of the Net Zero Strategy actions. For example, Table 29 provides a preliminary list 
of potential considerations and actions for the NZ40 scenario actions.

11.4 THE COST OF INACTION
The impacts and costs of climate change will be determined by how quickly actions are 
implemented and by how deeply GHG emissions are reduced over the next few years prior to 
2030. This is because the cumulative GHGs emitted to the atmosphere determine the degree of 
global average temperature increase. Over the past several decades, the cost of inaction to address 
climate change by limiting and reducing GHG emissions has now locked the world into at least a 
1.5–2.0°C temperature increase. 
Already, the costs of weather-related disasters, such as floods, storms, and wildfires, have risen in 
Canada from an average of $8.3 million per event in the 1970s to $112 million per event between 
2010-2019. This change represents a staggering 1,250% increase.139 During the latter time period 
(2010-2019), total insured losses for catastrophic weather events totalled over $18 billion.
Climate change is driving more extreme weather patterns, resulting in more frequent and more 
expensive impacts than previous decades. For example, in the last decade, disaster costs have 
grown from about the equivalent of 1% of Canada’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth to 
between 5%–6% of annual GDP growth.140
These costs demonstrate some of the impacts that previous decades of inaction are now placing on 
economic growth and well-being today and into the future. 
The cumulative cost of the Do Nothing Scenario between 2020 and 2050 is $94 billion based on 
the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC). In comparison, the SCC declines to $76 billion in the BAP scenario 
and to $35 billion in the NZ40 scenario, as illustrated in Figure 68.141

THE SOCIAL COST OF CARBON
The social cost of carbon (SCC) has been used in regulatory processes in Canada and the US to 
reflect the impacts of climate change on society. The SCC attempts to add up the quantifiable 
costs and benefits of a tonne of carbon dioxide. While the estimates of SCC are highly uncertain, 
it is one of the best ways to reflect future damages to ensure that decision-making that has 
implications for future emissions accounts for those implications. The SCC includes assumptions 
around future conditions, including population size, economic growth, rate of climate change, and 
the impact of climate change on those conditions, drawing on the results of integrated assessment 
models. The discount rate is a significant assumption within the models. Discounting reflects the 
idea that people would rather have $100 now than $100 in ten years. From an ethical perspective, 
a higher discount rate indicates that future generations are worth less than current generations; 
for this reason, the Stern Review recommended a discount rate of 1.4%, well below traditional 
discount rates. As Stern pointed out in a subsequent article “A 2% pure-time discount rate means 
that the life of someone born 35 years from now (with given consumption patterns) is deemed half 
as valuable as that of someone born now (with the same patterns).” The Government of Canada 
recommends 3% in circumstances where environmental and human health impacts are involved 
and 3% was used for Toronto’s NZ modelling. In addition, the Government of Canada reports 
on estimated damage associated with lower probability, high-cost damages, again using a 3% 
discounting rate. The SCC in this analysis reflects less likely impacts of increased temperatures that 
result in greater damage, as described within the 95th percentile of the SCC frequency distribution
11.5 SENSITIVITY 
The NZ pathways illustrate how the City of Toronto could achieve its GHG targets, and are built 
on the assumptions described above in this report. In that light, they reflect what is anticipated to 
occur in the future if the actions are implemented as described.
Sensitivity analysis involves adjusting certain selected variables within the model in order to identify 
those that have the most significant impact on the model outcomes. It is not a process of “scenario 
analysis,” as the variables tested do not represent internally consistent scenarios. The approach to 
sensitivity analysis is to adjust those variables that were identified as having a higher potential to 
“move the curve,” (i.e., the factors that appear to be contributing significantly to the NZ scenarios), 
in order to be better informed about the implications of future options. 
The process applied a judgement-based “one-at-a-time” exploration of variables within the NZ50 
scenario. The results should not be viewed as an evaluation of fully considered alternative futures. 
Rather, it is an exploration revealing how a selected output (i.e. emissions) responds to changes in 
selected inputs (e.g. VKT).

Applying a GWP to methane for 20 years instead of 100 years increases total GHG emissions by 
more than 1 MtCO2e per year, while decreasing the emissions factor of electricity reduces emissions 
by 400 kTCO2e by 2050. Variation in the emissions factor of electricity defines the outer limits of the 
variation evaluated, resulting in an overall uncertainty of 37 MtCO2e, or 15% of the cumulative 
241 MtCO2e emissions under the NZ50 pathway.

Based on this investigation the pathway is sensitive to methane emissions, particularly if a 20 year 
GWP is applied. The emissions factor of electricity is also critical to accelerating the reduction in 
GHG emissions, which follows from the electrification of heating and transportation. 
12. Conclusion: 
Time is of the 
Essence
“We basically have three choices: mitigation, adaptation, and suffering. We’re going to do some of 
each. The question is what the mix is going to be. The more mitigation we do, the less adaptation 
will be required and the less suffering there will be.” 
John Holdren, Professor of Environmental Policy and former Director of the White House Office of 
Science and Technology Policy
In May 2021, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released a milestone report titled Net 
Zero by 2050.142 Globally the IEA found that the path to net-zero is narrow, requiring the 
massive deployment of all available clean energy technologies, including renewables, EVs, and 
energy efficiency building retrofits between now and 2030. IEA’s key findings echo those of the 
TransformTO analysis, notably: the net zero pathway can bring jobs and growth; huge leaps are 
needed in clean energy innovation and a rapid shift away from fossil fuels; electricity becomes 
the core of the energy system; and new low-emissions industries flourish. Similar to the IEA, the 
Technical Report describes a pathway to completely transform the energy system.

As a viable pathway to substantively address climate change, TransformTO is a beacon of hope. The 
urgency to act on climate change grows every day, and the technologies and processes required 
to decarbonize become more accessible and affordable. Decarbonizing sooner rather than later 
is compelling in order to maximize societal benefits that include reducing GHG emissions more 
quickly, delivering health benefits, enhancing resilience, enabling a green recovery from COVID, 
and improving quality of life. From this perspective, delay constitutes forfeited opportunities. 
Every new investment that advances decarbonization of the energy system is additional 
infrastructure that doesn’t need to be retrofitted down the road, decreasing the cost of 
transformation. Investments in fossil fuel equipment, on the other hand, are likely to become 
stranded assets, resulting in financial and social liabilities that will be prematurely replaced in order 
to limit climate change. 
The NZ pathways modelled in this analysis reduce household transportation and energy costs, 
which, depending on how these actions are implemented, can benefit lower-income households. In 
particular, the expanded and free transit modelling in the NZ pathways advances equity objectives 
by improving accessibility. 
The financial industry will play a key role in enabling the NZ scenarios, first by avoiding investments 
that result in increased emissions and second by facilitating access to capital for emissions reduction 
investments. Given access to capital, governments and other organizations will need to coordinate 
their efforts in order to mobilize the workforce that can rapidly deliver retrofits, renewable energy, 
and related actions. 
The net zero scenarios represent a transformation of the energy system and the built environment, 
which will require a coordinated mobilization of the City and society at large for which there are few 
precedents. This analysis demonstrates that the technology is available, the financials are viable, 
and the broader societal benefits are extensive. The pathway to net zero by 2040 has no downsides 
for the current and, in particular, future generations of the residents of Toronto, and of the world.
