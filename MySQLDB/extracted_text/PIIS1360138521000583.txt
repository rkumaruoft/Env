Global Warming, Climate Change, and
Environmental Pollution: Recipe for a
Multifactorial Stress Combination Disaster
Sara I. Zandalinas,1 Felix B. Fritschi,1 and Ron Mittler1,2,*
Global warming, climate change, and environmental pollution present plants
with unique combinations of different abiotic and biotic stresses. Although
much is known about how plants acclimate to each of these individual stresses,
little is known about how they respond to a combination of many of these stress
factors occurring together, namely a multifactorial stress combination. Recent
studies revealed that increasing the number of different co-occurring multifacto-
rial stress factors causes a severe decline in plant growth and survival, as well as
in the microbiome biodiversity that plants depend upon. This effect should serve
as a dire warning to our society and prompt us to decisively act to reduce pollut-
ants, ﬁght global warming, and augment the tolerance of crops to multifactorial
stress combinations.
The Diminishing Resources and Deteriorating Environmental Conditions on Our
Planet
The accumulated impact of human life on our planet over the past several decades, and in par-
ticular the industrial revolution, resulted in a constant increase in greenhouse gas production
(mainly CO2) caused by the burning of fossil fuels (Figure 1A; www.ipcc.ch/) [1–9]. The accumu-
lation of CO2 in the atmosphere traps the IR radiation emitted from the surface of the Earth follow-
ing absorption of sunlight and heats our planet, driving an alarming trend of continual increase in
global surface and ocean temperatures, termed global warming (Figure 1A; www.ipcc.ch/,
https://ourworldindata.org/owid-grapher, www.eea.europa.eu/) [1–9]. Global warming in turn
drives a drastic change in our climate, termed climate change, that is accompanied by an in-
crease in the frequency and intensity of droughts and heat waves (Figure 1B), as well as of
other abiotic stress conditions such as ﬂooding, salinity, and freezing stresses (www.ipcc.ch/,
www.ncdc.noaa.gov/, https://ourworldindata.org/owid-grapher,
www.eea.europa.eu/,
www.epa.gov/) [1–9]. At the same time, the overall growth in the global population, coupled
with the expansion in residential and commercial land use, is driving a continual decline in the
availability of prime agricultural land (Figure 1C; https://ourworldindata.org/owid-grapher)
[10–12]. The loss of arable farmland necessitates a continued increase in yield produced
from each acre of the remaining land to feed an ever-growing population [7,12,13]. However,
the availability of freshwater for use in agriculture is also declining due to the overall population
growth and the increase in freshwater demand for residential and commercial use
(Figure 1D; https://ourworldindata.org/owid-grapher, www.ipcc.ch/) [1,7,12,13]. As a
result, the quality of water used to irrigate crops (e.g., its pH, salinity levels, and content of different
contaminants) is declining [7,12,13].
In addition to the gradual increase in day and night temperatures [14–16], the reduced availability
and quality of water used to irrigate crops [7,12,13], and the increase in frequency and intensity of

occurs when more than two to three abi-
otic and/or biotic stress factors simulta-
neously impact a plant.
Global warming, climate change, and
industrial pollution could result in an in-
crease in the frequency, complexity,
and intensity of multifactorial stress com-
binations impacting plants, soils, and mi-
crobial communities.
With the increase in the number of fac-
tors simultaneously impacting plants,
the survival and growth of plants de-
clines, even if the levels of each of these
individual stresses is very low.
The response of plants to a multifactorial
stress combination is unique and in-
volves many transcripts and genes that
are not altered in response to each of
the different stresses applied individually.
The harmful effects of a multifactorial
stress combination on the survival and
growth of plants, different soil properties,
and diversity of microbial communities
should serve as a dire warning to our so-
ciety and prompt us to act drastically to
reduce the different sources of multifac-
torial stresses in our environment.

grapher) [17–20]. These byproducts of human activity include, among others, heavy metals,
microplastics, pesticides, herbicides, antibiotics, persistent organic pollutants, tropospheric
ozone, and diesel and burn particles. Many of these contaminants can further cause changes
in soil pH and salinity levels, as well as damage the stratospheric ozone layer and enhance the
levels of UV radiation reaching the Earth surface [17–21]. In addition to directly impacting plant
growth and reproduction within many eco- and agricultural systems, many of the environmental
conditions described in the previous text were also found to increase the vulnerability of plants to
attack by different pathogens and pests, as well as to alter the behavior of different insects,
resulting in a decline in many forest ecosystems as well as insect-driven pollination [22–26]. Ac-
cording to computer models, further increases in the frequency and intensity of different episodes
of abiotic stress, such as droughts, heat waves, cold snaps, and ﬂooding, are to be expected as
global average temperatures increase (www.ipcc.ch/) (e.g., [1–3]). Such increases would further
threaten global food production and security, potentially destabilizing different areas on our
planet, leading to unrest, hunger, and even wars [27–29]. In addition, the geographical growth
areas of many important crops are expected to shift as temperatures climb and conditions
worsen (Figure 1F) (www.eea.europa.eu/) [7,8,12].
Although not expected to impact plants all at once, different combinations of the environmental
factors, stressors, pollutants, pathogens, and pests, as described in the previous text, are likely
to affect plants, crops, and trees growing in different areas of our planet. Furthermore, owing to
the continual increase in many of the processes that drive these factors (Figure 1A–E) (www.
ipcc.ch/), the likelihood that plants will be subjected to a multifactorial stress combination (Box
1) of several co-occurring stressors is gradually increasing [30,31].
The Impact of a Multifactorial Stress Combination on Plants, Soil, and Microbial
Populations
At least two recent studies addressed the potential effects of a multifactorial stress combination
on plants, soils, and different microbial populations. Rillig et al. [30] examined the impact of mul-
tifactorial stress combination on soil properties and microbial populations. The effects of ten dif-
ferent stress factors associated with global warming, climate change, and environmental pollution
were studied on soils, using different combinations of drought, low nitrogen, temperature,
microplastics, glyphosate, antibiotics, fungicides, copper, salinity, and insecticides. It was found
that an increase in the number of factors constituting a multifactorial stress combination (selected
sets of one, two, ﬁve, eight, and ten stress factors) was accompanied by a decrease in the diversity
of the soil microbiome, soil respiration, and other soil properties such as water-stable soil
aggregates and decomposition rate (Figure 2A). Although previous studies proposed that such
an effect would occur, Rillig et al. [30] were the ﬁrst to demonstrate the negative effects of multifac-
torial stress combination on soil properties and microbial communities.
Examining the impact of a multifactorial stress combination on plants, Zandalinas et al. [31] sub-
jected arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seedlings to a combination of six different stresses, in-
cluding heat, salt, high light, cadmium, acidity, and the herbicide paraquat (Figure 2B,C). In
addition to studying the impact of multifactorial stress combination on plant growth and survival,
this study also conducted a transcriptomic analysis of a selected set of multifactorial stress com-
binations and examined the impact of multifactorial stresses on the survival of different mutants
impaired in reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism, as well as other metabolic processes
and hormonal signaling pathways. Perhaps the most important ﬁnding of this study was that, al-
though each of the different stresses, applied individually to plants, had a negligible effect on their
growth and survival, the accumulated impact of multifactorial stress combination on plants was
detrimental (Figure 2B,C). This ﬁnding is important because it demonstrates that different

stresses can interact to negatively impact plant health and performance, even if the effect of each
stress applied individually is negligible. Multifactorial stress combination could therefore impact
agricultural areas or ecosystems in ways that we may not be able to predict. For example, we
may not be able to observe a clear decline in crop yields or ecosystems because of a low level
of a single stress factor; however, once additional factors are introduced, even at low levels,
they could negatively interact with each other and lead to dramatic decreases in agricultural pro-
ductivity, as well as push ecosystems towards a rapid decline.
Together with the pioneering study of Rillig et al. [30], the results reported by Zandalinas et al. [31]
therefore suggest that, with the increasing number of simultaneously occurring environmental
stress factors in our environment, plant life, microbiomes, and soils are likely to deteriorate further
(Figure 2). The similar trends observed in these two studies should serve as a dire warning to our
society. Further altering our climate and polluting our environment could result in even higher
Box 1. The Deﬁnition of a Multifactorial Stress Combination
We deﬁne a multifactorial stress combination as a combination of three or more (n ≥3) stress factors simultaneously
impacting plants. This deﬁnition takes the concept of a simple combination of two or at most three different stresses
(e.g., drought and heat, salt and heat, drought, salinity and heat, or drought, heat and virus infection; e.g., [42,44,48,50])
and extends it to a combination of multiple factors. As depicted in the model presented in Figure I, the multiple stress factors
that could simultaneously impact plants can be of biotic (e.g., virus, bacteria, insect), abiotic climate-driven (e.g., ﬂooding,
drought, heat), abiotic man-made anthropogenic (e.g., pesticides, antibiotics, heavy metals), or biotic/abiotic soil-associated
(e.g., nutrient deﬁciency, salinity, decreased microbial diversity) origin. Any combination of three or more such factors,
impacting plants simultaneously, is therefore deﬁned as a multifactorial stress combination.

complexities of multifactorial stress combinations that in turn would drive a crucial decline in plant
growth, soil conditions, and overall agricultural productivity [30,31].
While the study of Rillig et al. [30] demonstrated that multifactorial stress combinations degrade soils
(Figure 2A), Zandalinas et al. [31] demonstrated that the impact of multifactorial stress combination
on plants is similar between plants growing in peat soil (Figure 2C) or on agar plates (Figure 2B).
Plants growing in peat soil had an overall higher survival rate in response to all stresses and their
combinations (providing a possible hint to the important role that the root microbiome could be
playing in these processes), nevertheless the multifactorial stress combination impacted plants
growing in peat soil in a similar manner to that for plants growing on plates (Figure 2B,C) [31].
These ﬁndings suggest that multifactorial stress combinations are likely to have a complex impact
on different environments acting on soil microbiomes, plants, and their interactions.
The Impact of Multifactorial Stress Combinations on Plant Metabolism and
Signaling
Previous studies of biotic and/or abiotic stress combinations involving two or at the most three
different stressors [32–53] revealed that the response of plants to a state of stress combination
is unique and does not simply represent the sum of the plant responses to each of the two or
three different stresses that compose it. Although in some instances of combined stresses the re-
sponse to one of the stressors included in the stress combination was more dominant than that to
the other(s) (e.g., [42,43]), or the different stresses had an overall additive effect [41,50,54,55], in
almost all studies conducted to date the response of plants to a stress combination included

transcripts, proteins, and metabolites that are unique to the combination (e.g., [42,44,47–52]).
These ﬁndings were obtained through multiple omics [44,47–52] and genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) [38–40] conducted in arabidopsis, as well as in other plants such as rice, corn,
tomato, and soybean. Because different stresses may trigger different sensors, signal transduc-
tion pathways, hormones, regulatory networks, and/or metabolic responses that will lead to dif-
ferent acclimation and/or defense strategies (e.g., escape, avoidance, tolerance, senescence,
and/or programmed cell death) (e.g., [35,41,42,56]), a combination of two or more stresses
can have conﬂicting outcomes that could be reﬂected in the clashing of different strategies, net-
works, and/or pathways. In addition, the relative levels and functions of different stress hormones,
such as ethylene, abscisic acid (ABA), jasmonic acid (JA), and salicylic acid (SA), in the response
of plants to a particular stress could be conﬂicting when different stresses are combined
(e.g., [45,52,57]). An example of this is revealed when comparing the stomatal responses of
plants to the combination of drought and heat stress. During heat stress stomata open to cool
leaves via transpiration, but during drought stomata close to prevent water loss. During a combi-
nation of drought and heat stress stomata of different plants remain closed, however, demon-
strating that drought-driven regulation of stomata overcomes heat stress-driven regulation
during a stress combination [44,45,52]. Interestingly, in a recent study on the combination of
high light and heat stress it was found that heat stress-driven regulation of stomata (stomata
opening) overcomes high light-driven stomata regulation (stomata closure) to result in stomata
opening during the stress combination [47]. In addition to stomatal responses, root architecture
is also altered during a stress combination [58,59], and nutrient availability plays a key role in this
response [58,60,61]. In addition to studies examining the simultaneous exposure of plants to two
or more stresses (described in the preceding text), studies of sequential exposure of plants to dif-
ferent stresses, or their combination, revealed a similar complexity in plant responses to a stress
combination [61–63]. The developmental stage of the plant, circadian clock, plant nutrition, light
quality, order of occurrence, and time of day could therefore play a key role in shaping the overall
response of plants to a stress combination.
How the different pathways, networks, and hormones that regulate each of the plant responses to
stress interact with each other, and how these interactions are regulated during a stress combina-
tion, are mostly open questions that await further research. There are many examples of signal
transduction and hormone interactions in plants, including the integration of light and heat, or light
and pathogen, signaling via different light receptors (e.g., [64]), the antagonistic functions of different
plant hormones such as JA and SA (e.g., [45]), or the impact of epigenetic control over the activation
of particular stress-response pathways (e.g., [65,66]). The identiﬁcation of unique transcriptional
regulators (transcription factors, TFs) and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with stress combi-
nations should begin to uncover some answers (e.g., [38–40,44,47–52]). A transcriptomic analysis
of multifactorial stress combination of six different stresses revealed, for example, that even at this
level of stress combination, different states of multifactorial stress combination induced unique
sets of transcripts (Figure 3A) [31]. Moreover, it was found that, with the increased complexity of
multifactorial stress combination (e.g., up to four different stresses), the number of transcripts
responding to each individual stress decreased whereas the number of transcripts unique to each
of the different stress combinations increased (Figure 3B) [31]. Interestingly, several common
stress-response pathways, for example those involving heat-shock transcription factors (HSFs),
the unfolded protein response (UPR), autophagy, and osmoregulation, activated by single stresses
and some of their simple (two-factor) combinations, were not activated by particular (three to four-
factor) stress combinations (Figure 3C,D) [31]. It is therefore possible that the function of these
pathways is replaced by unique response pathways that are speciﬁc to these stress combinations,
and/or that they are primarily regulated at the post-transcriptional level during multifactorial stress
(Figure 3B) [31]. As indicated in the preceding text, further studies will be necessary to address
Trends in Plant Science

the complexity of acclimation/defense response integration during multifactorial stress combination
(Figure 4A). However, from the limited studies conducted so far on multifactorial stress responses of
microbial populations and plants, it is likely that new and exciting discoveries, relevant to ensure
food, feed, and ﬁber production in a changing climate, could be made.

such as some fungi, archaea, or bacteria that withstand a multitude of extreme environmental
conditions) [67–70]. Exploring some of the mechanisms used by these organisms to withstand
these conditions highlights processes such as DNA repair, protein repair and recycling, and main-
taining free iron sequestered to prevent formation of ROS such as hydroxyl radicals [67–71]. A
key role for balancing iron and ROS levels, cellular recycling via autophagy, and suppression of
programmed cell death also emerges from studies of cancer cells that are rapidly evolving eukary-
otic cells subjected to a multifactorial stress combination within the tumor microenvironment (i.e.,
a combination of acidity, anaerobic, nutrient, mechanical, immune response, and drug cytotoxic-
ity stresses) (e.g., [72–79]). It is possible that acclimation to multifactorial stress conditions in
plants might require similar mechanisms, and that these could be regulated by different multifac-
torial stress-speciﬁc transcriptomic networks. The observation that overexpressing the AtNEET
protein in arabidopsis seedlings could mitigate some of the impacts of a multifactorial stress com-
bination on plant growth lends further support to this possibility [31]. NEET proteins play a canon-
ical role in maintaining iron and ROS homeostasis in plant and animal cells, and were found to
overaccumulate in human epithelial breast cancer cells [73]. Furthermore, artiﬁcially elevating
the expression levels of NEET proteins in cancer cells results in enhanced cancer cell resistance
to oxidative stress and facilitates tumor growth [72]. Interesting parallels might therefore be drawn
between plant, microorganism, and cancer cell survival under conditions of multifactorial stress
conditions (e.g., the need to balance iron and ROS homeostasis). Moreover, it might be possible
to harness some of the mechanisms used by cancer cells to survive within the tumor microenvi-
ronment [72–79], or by extremophiles to survive their natural environment [67–70], to enhance the
tolerance of plants to multifactorial stress combination. In addition to extremophiles, plants, and
cancer cells, the involvement of ROS in responses to stress combination was demonstrated in

Figure 4. Integration of Different Stress Response and Systemic Signaling Pathways during Simple and Multifactorial Stress Combinations. (A) A
hypothetical model depicting potential interactions between different signal transduction and acclimation/defense pathways coactivated in response to multifactorial
stress combination in plants. (B) Integration of two different systemic signals in response to a stress combination. Two different scenarios are compared: two different
stresses (high light, HL; and heat stress, HS) simultaneously applied to the same leaf (HL + HS; left), or to two different leaves (HL and HS; right). The two scenarios are
different in the transcriptomic signatures, systemic reactive oxygen species (ROS) wave responses, and stomata and hormonal (jasmonic acid, JA, and salicylic acid,
SA) responses they induce in local and systemic leaves. The model highlights the ﬁndings of Zandalinas et al. [45] that the way in which plants sense the different
stresses that trigger systemic signals in response to a stress combination (i.e., at the same or different leaves) makes a signiﬁcant difference to how fast and efﬁcient
they respond and acclimate.

the animal model Caenorhabditis elegans [80,81], further highlighting the importance of ROS sig-
naling for cellular responses to stress combination.
Multifactorial Stress Combinations and Systemic Signaling
Systemic signaling describes the ability of plants to transmit a signal from a small group of cells lo-
cated at a particular plant organ or tissue to the entire plant [82]. This process can be triggered by a
local biotic or abiotic stress, and result in the activation of a defense or acclimation response in the
entire plant (even in tissues that did not experience the initial stress stimulus). In a recent study of
systemic signal integration during a stress combination, the impact of two local stress stimuli
applied to the same, or two different leaves, of the same plant was studied in arabidopsis
(Figure 4B) [45]. The two different stresses used (high light and heat stress) were found to induce
a systemic response to the stress combination, but this response was much stronger and more
successful in inducing systemic acclimation to high light or heat stress when the two different
stresses were applied to two different leaves (Figure 4B) [45]. The transcriptomic and stomatal
responses recorded in each of the different leaves and in the systemic tissues correlated with
triggering a ROS wave that was much stronger when the two different stresses were
simultaneously applied to two different leaves, as well as with the expected local and systemic
responses to the individual (in each leaf) or combined (in the systemic leaf) stress combination
[45]. This study revealed for the ﬁrst time that different stresses impacting different parts of the
plant can result in the integration of systemic signals that propagate to the systemic tissue and
induce a systemic response to the stress combination. Interestingly, the plant hormones JA and
SA played an antagonistic role in suppressing plant responses to the stress combination when
the two stresses were applied to the same leaf (Figure 4B) [45]. Because plants, and especially
large plants such as trees, are likely to experience multiple stresses at different organs and/or
tissues simultaneously (Figure 4B) [45,82], these stresses might induce a state of readiness for
multifactorial stress combination in the systemic tissue. Because systemic signal integration in
response to a stress combination provides an ideal platform in which different local tissues,
subjected to different stresses, as well as a single systemic tissue that responds to them, can be
collected from the same plant, this experimental system could be used to enhance our knowledge
of multifactorial stress combination and its potential to impact different pathways and hormones.
How Can We Develop Plants with Enhanced Tolerance to Multifactorial Stress
Combinations?
Due to the conﬂicting nature of some of the acclimation and defense pathways and strategies that
might be triggered during stress combination (Figures 3B–D and 4A) (e.g., [35,44,45,83]), achiev-
ing tolerance to a state of multifactorial stress might require focusing on common pathways and
genes that function during all possible combinations of single and multiple stresses that compose
the
multifactorial
stress
condition
(Figure
3A
for
four
different
abiotic
stresses)
(e.g., [31–37,44,47–53]). For example, some TFs and regulatory genes were found to respond
to all six different stresses and their combinations in plants [31]. Another approach could be to
augment the pathways and genes that are required for tolerance to extreme stress conditions
or multifactorial stress combinations [31,67–79]. These might include, for example, pathways in-
volved in sequestering iron and/or managing the relative levels of iron and ROS in cells, pathways
involved in repair and recycling of proteins and DNA, or pathways that suppress metabolism and
accumulate speciﬁc osmoprotectants [31,67–79]. One example of this approach is the overex-
pression of AtNEET in arabidopsis [31]. A completely different approach could be to focus on
pathways and genes that are unique to a multifactorial stress combination [31]. An additional
strategy could be to identify and study plants that are subjected to extreme and multifactorial
stress conditions in nature (e.g., desert plants, plants growing under harsh conditions in industrial
waste sites, salt marshes, and/or next to hot springs, and/or some invasive species) [84–86], and

attempt to import the pathways and genes used by these plants into some of our major crops.
Altogether, a multitude of approaches and acclimation/adaptation strategies might be used,
preferably exhibiting a high degree of plasticity. Finally, a promising approach to enhancing plant
tolerance to multifactorial stress combinations could be the development of rhizosphere
microbiome [87–91] inocula that will (i) tolerate multifactorial stresses themselves, and (ii) induce
plant tolerance to multifactorial stress combinations. A possible source for such microbial commu-
nities could come from some of the same harsh environments used to identify plant strategies to
combat multifactorial stress combinations, as discussed in the preceding text.
Prospects for the Future
Plants evolved for hundreds of millions of years in the absence of human interference. However,
over the past 100–150 years humans have drastically impacted plants and rapidly altered their
environment by introducing numerous new and sometimes extreme stressors and contaminants.
In parallel to these processes, humans have been selecting and breeding plants for thousands of
years to enhance their yield and other traits that make plants more suitable and supportive for
humanity and our growing population. As described in the preceding text (Figures 1 and 2 and
Box 1), these conﬂicting forces, or thrusts, set in motion by humans, are ﬁnally clashing, necessi-
tating a serious effort on our side to prevent possible future disasters (see Outstanding
Questions). The similar trends observed in the studies by Rillig et al. [30] and Zandalinas et al.
[31], and the dramatic impact of multifactorial stress combinations on plants, soils, and microbial
communities revealed by these studies (Figure 2) should serve as a dire warning to our society. Fur-
ther polluting our environment could result in even higher complexities of multifactorial stress com-
binations that in turn could drive a crucial decline in plant growth, soil conditions, and overall
agricultural productivity.
