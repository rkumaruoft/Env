Abstract
The systemic risk induced by climate change represents one of the most prominent threats facing humanity and has attracted increasing
attention since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic at the end of 2019. The existing literature highlights the importance of systemic risk
induced by climate change, but there are still deﬁciencies in understanding its dynamics and assessing the risk. Aiming to bridge this gap, this
study develops a theoretical framework and employs two cases to illustrate the concept, origin, occurrence, propagation, evolution, and
assessment framework of systemic risk induced by climate change. The key ﬁndings include: 1) systemic risk induced by climate change derives
from the rapid growth of greenhouse gas emissions, increasingly complex connections among different socioeconomic systems, and continuous
changes in exposure and vulnerability; 2) systemic risk induced by climate change is a holistic risk generated by the interconnection, interaction,
and dynamic evolution of different types of single risks, and its fundamental, deﬁning feature is cascading effects. The extent of risk propagation
and its duration depend on the characteristics of the various discrete risks that are connected to make up the systemic risk; 3) impact domains,
severity of impact, and probability of occurrences are three core indicators in systemic risk assessment, and the impact domains should include
the economy, society, homeland security, human health, and living conditions. We propose to deepen systemic risk research from three aspects:
to develop theories to understand the mechanism of systemic risk; to conduct empirical research to assess future risks; and to develop coun-
termeasures to mitigate the risk.

1. Introduction
In the past ﬁve decades, the global climate system has
experienced signiﬁcant changes in most parts of the world, as
manifested by increasing frequency, intensity, and impacts of
extreme weather events. As the whole world enters the stage of
a ‘risk society’ (Beck, 1992; Giddens, 1999), it has become a
general consensus that risk induced by climate change repre-
sents one of the most prominent threats facing humanity
(Deere-Birkbeck, 2009; Stern, 2015). The release of the Spe-
cial Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and
Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX) by
IPCC (2011) has drawn interesting scholarly attention to
climate risks. In contrast to conventional risks whose impacts
are usually bounded and limited, the risks of climate change
are systemic (King et al., 2015). Although the direct impact of
climate change is local, it can have knock-on effects across
regions and sectors, through interconnected socioeconomic
and ﬁnancial systems, which are secondary risks generated by
the propagation of direct risks in the human system (CEPCC
and UKCCC, 2018; MGI, 2020; Rosa et al., 2013). The
greatest climate risks may arise from the interaction between

climate and complex human systems such as global food
markets and national and international security.
Risk is herein broadly deﬁned as “the likelihood that an
undesirable state of reality (adverse effects) may occur as a
result of natural events or human activities” (Renn, 2008).
This deﬁnition distinguishes risk from risk events, which have
the potential to trigger such risks. The concept of systemic risk
was ﬁrst introduced by OECD (2013) in the ﬁnal report of The
Futures Project on Emerging Systemic Risks to refer to risks
that affect the systems on which society depends, such as
health, transport, and the environment. The term ‘systemic’ is
meant to capture the embedded nature of the risk in the larger
context of societal processes (Asselt and Renn, 2011). Ac-
cording to Kaufman and Scott (2003), it is “the risk that the
entire system may break down, as opposed to the breakdowns
in individual parts of components”, and “the co-movements
(correlation) among most or all parts”, that distinguish sys-
temic risk from other types of risks. Systemic risk may be
triggered by a direct risk or consists of a bundle of several
different risks (King et al., 2015). Systemic risk is an unin-
tended, often-ignored side-effect of globalization, which has
generated a new and unprecedented level of interdependence
and complexity in the social systems, particularly in the 21st
century (Centeno et al., 2015; Goldin and Vogel, 2010), hence
the four major properties of systemic risk: 1) global in nature,
2) highly interconnected and intertwined leading to complex
causal structures, 3) non-linear in the causeeeffect relation-
ships, and 4) scholastic in their effect structure (Renn, 2016).
Systemic risk exempliﬁes all three characteristics of risk
problems: complexity (difﬁculty of identifying and quanti-
fying causal links between a multitude of potential candidates
and speciﬁc adverse effects), scientiﬁc uncertainty (limited-
ness or even absence of scientiﬁc knowledge required to assess
the probability and outcomes of undesired effects), and so-
ciopolitical ambiguity (the existence of multiple values and
perspectives) (Klinke and Renn, 2002; Renn et al., 2011,
2018). Because of the wide impacts of systemic risk and its
complex internal connections, systemic risks are nearly irre-
versible once a risk-triggering event has occurred and the
tipping point crossed, and possess the potential to do more
harm compared to single risks and to pose serious threat to the
structure and function of the human society (Asselt and Renn,
2011; Renn, 2008). Therefore, preventive measures must be
taken in the ﬁrst place.
Historically the term systemic risk has only referred to
collapses in the ﬁnancial sector (Goldin and Vogel, 2010),
which is claimed to be more vulnerable to systemic risk than
other sectors of the economy due to the structure of bank
balance sheets, the complex network of exposures among
ﬁnancial institutions, and the intertemporal character of
ﬁnancial contracts and related credibility problems (de Bandt
and Hartmann, 2000). As a result, the majority of the extant
empirical studies on systemic risk has focused on the ﬁnancial
sector, particularly in understanding the causes and mecha-
nisms of the ﬁnancial crises, such as the global ﬁnancial crisis
in 2008 (Brunnermeier and Oehmke, 2013; Harrington, 2009).
Scholars have documented historical evidence of contagious
systemic risk in banking (Kaufman and Scott, 2003), devel-
oped a large variety of quantitative measures of systemic risk
(Acharya et al., 2016; Bisias et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2009),
and modeled the propagation of shocks within ﬁnancial sys-
tems drawing analogies with the dynamics of ecological net-
works (Haldane and May, 2011). The study on systemic risk in
the ﬁnancial market exposes the profound, structural short-
comings of modern global institutions to cope with new global
systemic risks in the 21st century, which stemmed from a lack
of understanding of systemic risk, and calls for global coor-
dination and collaboration (Goldin and Vogel, 2010).
Compared to systemic risk in the ﬁnancial sector, other
types of systemic risk, such as that induced by climate change,
are even less understood (Goldin and Vogel, 2010). Recent
years have witnessed an emerging, albeit still limited, litera-
ture on systemic risks induced by climate change. For
instance, both the U.S. Third National Climate Assessment
(Moser et al., 2016) and the UK 2017 Climate Change Risk
Assessment (Challinor et al., 2017) look into cross-border
climate risk, i.e., how climate impacts in other countries or
regions affect the domestic economy and territory. In partic-
ular, the former highlighted the cross-border risks for neigh-
boring countries with shared water resources. The latter
identiﬁed transboundary risk transmission mechanisms and
systematically assessed risks posed by climate change globally
to the UK, such as the negative impact of weather-related
shocks to international agricultural production and food sup-
ply chains on food prices and accessibility for vulnerable
groups, as well as the impact of climate-related displacements
of populations worldwide on the UK (Challinor et al., 2016,
2018). In the context of China, one of the best-known works
along this line is the UKeChina Cooperation on Climate
Change Risk Assessment: Developing Indicators of Climate
Risk co-authored by China Expert Panel on Climate Change &
UK Committee on Climate Change (CEPCC and UKCCC,
2018), which assesses several typical systemic risks induced
by climate change from both a national and a global
perspective, for instance the systemic risk in the global food
system. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the end of
2019, which has either generated or contributed to a series of
interconnected ﬁnancial, societal, and political crises on a
global scale, has triggered comparative studies of systemic
risks of pandemics and climate change, which share many
commonalities despite differences (Pinner et al., 2020).
Systematic risk induced by climate change can be broadly
classiﬁed into emergency risk and incremental risk based on
different
latent
periods
and
manifestations
(CEPCC
&
UKCCC, 2018). Emergency risk often arises from a shock
event, also known in the literature as a ‘black swan’ event.
Such risks are hard to predict and can have catastrophic im-
pacts. Extreme weather events are typical examples that may
pose emergency risk. For instance, the outbreak of Hurricane
Sandy in the Americas in 2012, which swept over Cuba,
Dominica, Jamaica, the United States and other countries,
caused more than 60 billion USD in damage and 233 casu-
alties, leading to severe impacts on energy, transportation, and
ﬁnancial systems (Diakakis et al., 2015; Strauss et al., 2021).

In China, one recent case is the heavy rain that happened in
Beijing on July 21, 2012, which caused the collapse of 10,660
houses, affected 1.62 million people and caused an economic
loss of 11.64 billion RMB (Hou, 2012). The occurrence of
disasters caused by emergency risks depends on the ‘disaster
inducing threshold’ of the system, which is closely related to
the system's exposure and vulnerability. Under the same
weather and climate conditions, the higher the exposure and
vulnerability of the system, the lower the disaster inducing
threshold and the higher the probability of a disaster.
Incremental risk displays typical creeping characteristics
and the fat tail effect. Since changes take place rather slowly,
the adverse consequences take a long time to emerge. How-
ever, the huge potential impacts and long-term consequences
are easily underestimated in the early stage, hence the Chi-
nese old saying “one ant hole may cause the collapse of a
thousand-mile dyke (qian li zhi di kui yu yi xue).” Incre-
mental risk therefore often arises from ‘grey rhino’ events.
Compared with the unpredictability and sporadic occurrence
of a black swan event, a grey rhino event is not a random
incident, but a high-probability event that occurs following a
series of signs and warnings. Once incremental risks cross a
critical point, they are difﬁcult to manage. Most climate
change-induced systemic risks are incremental risks. Climate
impacts will accumulate and worsen over time and across
space. They usually go through a process from quantitative
change to qualitative change, which eventually leads to the
outbreak of a disaster. A typical example of incremental risk
is the risk of water shortage in Africa, which reduces food
production over time and aggravates malnutrition and other
health problems, leading to migration and regional violent
conﬂicts.
In general, the main contribution of the extant literature on
systemic risk induced by climate change, albeit limited, is to
put forward the concept of systemic risk and to clarify the
differences and connections between systemic risk and other
types of risk. The literature also qualitatively assesses several
typical systemic risks individually, such as water resource
security risk and urban security risk. However, there still exists
a gap between the existing literature and a complete concep-
tualization of systemic risk induced by climate change,
let alone potential ways to mitigate it. Therefore, this study
aims to partially ﬁll the gap by integrating and reﬁning the
existing fragmented knowledge about systemic risk induced
by climate change into a complete theoretical framework so as
to present a holistic picture of systemic risk. Speciﬁcally, this
study analyzes the dynamics of systemic risk induced by
climate change and develops a framework to assess it. The
study also uses two typical cases of systemic climate risk to
illustrate the assessment framework.
2. Research framework
The risk governance theory usually divides risk governance
into risk assessment and risk management (IRGC, 2005). Risk
assessment
is
a
comprehensive
understanding
of
risk,
including risk identiﬁcation, risk analysis, and risk evaluation,
while risk management is a series of decisions and actions
made based on a complete understanding of risks. This study
does not involve risk management and focuses on under-
standing risk. The study decomposes climate risk into four
speciﬁc questions, namely, why does systemic risk occur?
How does systemic risk occur? How does systemic risk
propagate and evolve? How to assess systemic risk? The ﬁrst
three questions involve the dynamics of systemic risk, and the
last question is related to risk assessment.
Focusing on the four key questions above, the study es-
tablishes an analytical framework (Fig. 1). The study un-
derstands systemic risk through theoretical and empirical
perspectives. The theoretical research employs methods
including
theoretical
analysis,
literature
review,
brain-
storming, and case study. The fundamental theories of this
study are derived from IPCC's climate risk theory (IPCC,
2011), system ecology theory (Odum, 1983), and risk
assessment theory (IRGC, 2005). The climate risk theory
elaborates the formation mechanism of climate risk from the
perspectives of extreme weather and climate events (also
known as hazard factors), exposure, and vulnerability and
expounds on the particularity of climate risk relative to
general risk. By analyzing the structure and function of the
ecosystem,
system
ecology
explains
the
inﬂuence
of
ecological disturbance on a complex system, expounds the
stability mechanism of the ecosystem, and develops the the-
ory of resilience, which provides an essential reference for
understanding systemic risk. Risk assessment theory ex-
pounds on the process and content of risk assessment and
provides a general framework for systematic risk assessment.
The above theories provide a theoretical basis for under-
standing systemic risk induced by climate change. The
existing literature and cases also contribute to the theoretical
analysis as the basis of research. The study takes brain-
storming as an essential research method. It draws on
constructive suggestions from Tsinghua University, Energy
Research Institute of the National Development and Reform
Commission, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the
Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, National
Meteorological Administration, and other institutions. Based
on theoretical research, the study adopts the case study
method to develop a practical perspective for understanding
systemic risk.
3. Dynamics of systemic risk induced by climate change
3.1. The origin of systemic risk
Systemic risk induced by climate change has three basic
characteristics: 1) the wide scope of climate change impacts,
affecting a wide range of natural, economic and social sys-
tems; 2) the long duration of climate change impacts; and 3)
cumulativeness of these impacts, that is to say, these impacts
will grow over time. Therefore, a systemic climate risk usually
takes years to form.
The formation of a systemic climate risk can be triggered
by the following reasons. First, the rising greenhouse gas
386
LI H.-M. et al. / Advances in Climate Change Research 12 (2021) 384e394
emissions increase the likelihood of more dramatic climate
change. Meteorological evidence shows that since the Indus-
trial Revolution, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere has increased from about 280  106 to about
400  106, and the average surface temperature has
increased by 0.85
C (IPCC, 2015). Even under the low
emission scenarios, carbon dioxide concentrations will rise to
450  106 by the end of the century, and average surface
temperatures will rise by 1.5 C, posing greater climate risks
(IPCC, 2015). Second, there is a lack of adequate adaptation to
climate change, as a result of which climate impacts are
accumulating over the year. Third, exposure and vulnerability
of human, economic and social systems are constantly
evolving. Research shows that by 2050, world population
would reach 9.7 billion, within which senior people aged 65
years or above may surpass adolescents and youth aged 15e24
years (UN, 2019). Last but not least, the increasingly complex
connections among human systems constitutes a complex
network. Once a link in any system collapses, it is likely to
trigger a systemic reaction.
3.2. The occurrence of systemic risk
A systemic climate risk is triggered by one or more direct risks
caused by climate change, and then has cascading effects at
economic, social, cultural, ecological and political levels. When
cascading effects take place, one risk causes one or several risks,
which then propagate further. According to the complexity of
cascading effects, they can be divided into series effects and
parallel effects (Fig. 2). Series effects refer to a causal chain
where one risk causes the formation and occurrence of anther
indirect risk, also known as series risk. Parallel effects refer to a
causal chain where one risk causes the formation and occurrence
of multiple risks, also known as parallel risk. Systemic risk is
often triggered by a direct risk, and then forms a series of indirect
risks through cascading effects, affecting the structure, function
and stability of the whole system. Cascading effects are the
deﬁning, fundamental characteristic of systemic risk that distin-
guishes it from direct risk.
The objective of systemic risk analysis is to investigate the
interconnections, causal chains and feedback loops among
different impacts and to evaluate the probability of cascading
effects and their potential consequences. In modern economic
and social systems, the various elements are more closely
connected and their relationships more complex, which consti-
tute a large complex system. In contrast to cascading effects, in
many cases, indirect risks are caused by the interaction between
multiple related risk factors. In other words, there may be
multiple causes for one result, or there may be multiple causes
for multiple results, which are referred to as bundling effects. In
the real world, cascading effects and bundling effects often
occur at the same time. A nexus risk happens when two or more
types of risks are associated and interact with each other.
There exist two types of feedback loops, i.e., positive
feedback loop and negative feedback loop, in a causal chain of
risks. A positive feedback loop accelerates and ampliﬁes sys-
temic responses. When one part of the loop is damaged, it can
cause a disruption or even a breakdown of the entire system,
hence creating a vicious cycle. A positive feedback loop may
also create a virtuous cycle, making the system function more
in line with people's needs. On the other hand, a negative
feedback loop can offset the adverse effect of the higher-order
risk, so that the system tends to stabilize. In a systemic risk
with a vicious cycle, it is often possible to identify a quanti-
tative index. When this index is within a certain threshold,
system balance can still be restored through the adjustment of
negative feedbacks. However, once the threshold is breached, it
is often too late to change the situation, leaving the vicious
cycle to dominate the evolution of the whole system until it
collapses. The threshold of a system is also called a tipping
point. Establishing indicators, thresholds or critical points is
very important in systemic risk analysis. In addition, the weak
points within a system require particular attention.
3.3. The propagation and evolution of systemic risk
IPCC (2011) deﬁnes climate change risk as a function of three
core elements: hazard, exposure and vulnerability. Hazard refers to
Fig. 1. Research framework of the study.
387
LI H.-M. et al. / Advances in Climate Change Research 12 (2021) 384e394
the frequency and intensity of extreme weather and climate events.
Exposure refers to the exposure of the population, infrastructures
and social wealth to the risk. Vulnerability refers to the vulnera-
bilityofa systemtoacertainrisk,aswell asitsabilitytocope,resist
and recover. The framework can also be used to understand the
propagation and evolution of systemic risk (Fig. 3).
A systemic risk is connected by various discrete risks. In
the process of risk propagation, the adverse consequences
generated in a previous link become the disaster-causing fac-
tors in the next link. The extent and duration of risk propa-
gation in a certain link mainly depends on the impact of the
previous link and the exposure and vulnerability of this link.
This link-to-link transmission leads to the spreading of sys-
temic risks across regions and sectors.
Once a systemic risk occurs, it usually accelerates and cas-
cades in a way that is hard to predict. Due to this characteristic,
the identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of systemic risk is very
challenging. Therefore, systemic risk analysis usually assumes a
scenario ﬁrst and then deduces the conditions for the occurrence
of the scenario backward. In most cases, risk indicators depend
on the origin and the causal chain of the systemic risk involved.
4.An assessment framework of systemic risk induced by
climate change
Risk assessment occurs after risk identiﬁcation. It is the
process of collecting and analyzing data following certain
methodology, estimating and measuring the probability of a
risk and its impact, and determining the risk class and the level
of priority for risk management.
Climate systemic risk may affect different aspects of so-
ciety. Estimating the severity of the consequences based on the
potential economic losses only will ignore a series of impacts
that are hard to quantify. Assessment of systemic risk must
take into account the diversity of the system and the integrated
effects on politics, the economy, society, culture, and the
environment. According to the characteristics of the climate
change impacts, this paper identiﬁes ﬁve impact domains:
economy, society, homeland security, human health, and living
conditions, based on which we set up a schematic assessment
framework for systemic risk (Fig. 4). The framework consists
of three core indicators: impact domains, severity of impact,
and probability of occurrence.

388

4.1. Impact domains
4.1.1. Economy
The inﬂuence of climate change on economy has received
extensive scholarly attention. The economic impact is usually
measured by standard monetary value, which is a core indi-
cator frequently used in risk assessments. According to the
IPCC, a global temperature rise of 2 C will lead to an eco-
nomic loss of about 0.2%e2% of GDP (IPCC, 2014). This
assessment result depends on a variety of assumptions, without
considering extreme events and some irrevocable disasters.
Carleton and Hsiang (2016) draw conclusions based on a large
amount of research, that an increase in temperatures by 1 C
will affect economic production by roughly 1%e1.7%.
4.1.2. Society
Climate change may inﬂuence society through food pro-
duction reduction, water resource crisis, and human health
impacts, and create social crises such as mass migration of
impoverished population and social conﬂicts. Abundant evi-
dence has shown the linkage between climate change and
these social issues (Carleton and Hsiang, 2016; Hsiang et al.,
2013; Lee, 2018; Lee et al., 2019; Schug et al., 2019;
Wischnath and Buhaug, 2014). For instance, Hsiang et al.
(2013) analyze more than 60 empirical works and conclude
that for every 1 standard deviation change in the direction of a
warmer climate or some extreme precipitation, the frequency
of social conﬂicts would increase by 4%, and the frequency of
inter-organizational conﬂicts would increase by 14%.
4.1.3. Human health
Climate systems have a huge impact on human health by
affecting human behaviors, disease vectors, and human living
environment.
Common
assessment
indicators
include
morbidity, mortality, and disability adjusted life year (DALY)
(Carleton and Hsiang, 2016). Desch^enes and Greenstone
(2011) investigate the relationship between daily temperature
and annual mortality rate, and conclude that in 1968e2002
climate change increased mortality rates by 11.2%, and by the
end of the century, climate change would lead to an increase of
3% in the age-adjusted mortality rate.
4.1.4. Homeland security
Homeland security is primarily about domestic prevention,
protection, adapted response to major natural events, acci-
dental, and manmade disaster risks prevention for civilians and
property (O'Sullivan and Ramsay, 2015). Climate change has
an important impact on homeland security through sea level
rise, ﬂood, drought, and other disasters. For example, land
inundation due to sea level rise poses risks to the territorial
integrity of small island states and states with extensive
coastlines. The changes in shared water resources and pelagic
ﬁsh stocks have the potential to increase rivalry among states.
Ide et al. (2020) show that climate-related disasters increase
the risk of armed conﬂicts in countries characterized by the
political exclusion of ethnic groups, a low level of economic
development and a large population.
4.1.5. Living conditions
Climate change has an impact on the sea level, water re-
sources, ecosystem infrastructures, and other aspects, thus
threatening the human living environment. For example,
freshwater-related risks of climate change increase signiﬁ-
cantly with an increasing concentration of greenhouse gases.
The fraction of the global population that will experience
water scarcity and major river ﬂoods will increase along with
warn-up of the 21st century (Field et al., 2014). McKinsey
Global Institute (2020) evaluates the physical impacts of
climate change from ﬁve aspects, including livability and
workability, food systems, physical assets, infrastructure ser-
vices, and natural capital. These factors are closely related to
human living conditions. The research results show that by
2030, all 105 countries under study would likely experience an
increase in at least one of the indicators.
4.2. Severity of impact
The severity of impact of systemic risk depends on the size
of the risk event, the level of risk exposure, the vulnerability of
the exposed population, the effectiveness of mitigation actions,
and the areas affected. If the external harm interacts with the
rational or irrational behaviors of individuals together with
some collective response, even if the initial harm is small, the
social risk may be greatly ampliﬁed. A political crisis is
possible if risks occur suddenly, affecting people and society
at large (CEPCC and UKCCC, 2018).
Different systemic risks have different formation speed and
latent periods. Incremental risks are usually less obvious but
can pose serious threats (WEF, 2020). Their long latent period
leads to severe underestimation of long-term consequences. In
fact, most climate risks are incremental, with impacts slowly
accumulating and potentially triggering sudden, irreversible
tipping points. Emergency events may trigger emergency
Fig. 4. Assessment framework for systemic risk.
389
LI H.-M. et al. / Advances in Climate Change Research 12 (2021) 384e394
risks, such as extreme weather disasters, which can quickly
trigger extremely severe disasters under certain risk exposure
and vulnerability.
Assessment of the severity calls for uniform metrics for the
same domain. Generally, the economic impact can be
measured by monetized economic loss, the impact of living
conditions can be measured by the loss of livable land area,
and the impact of health can be measured by the years of
potential life lost. In contrast, the impact of society and
homeland security is not easy to measure by the uniform in-
dicator. What is more, how to rank the risks is also a challenge.
Even for the same economic loss, some assessors rank it as
high, while others may rank it as minimal. Therefore, it is
critical to establish a set of uniform criteria for risk assess-
ment. For facilitating the future assessment, we launched
concise rank criteria (Table 1). Assessors can employ the table
to rank the different climate impacts.
4.3. Probability of occurrence
Systemic risk assessment is less concerned with low
probability, low impact events and high probability, low
impact events. Because the former is unlikely to happen, and if
it does, the impact will be small; as for the latter, due to its
high probability of occurrence, the government can usually
predict and manage such low-impact events very well. Sys-
temic risk assessment focuses on high probability, high impact
events and low probability, high impact events. These events
are likely to be underestimated by governments because of
their scarcity or their high prevention costs.
5. Typical cases of systemic risk induced by climate
change
Risks do not necessarily lead to disasters, but disasters are
usually transformed from risks. Some typical disaster events
can help us understand systemic risks. This section presents
two cases to illustrate systemic risk. The ﬁrst case is about the
heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain disaster that happened in
South China in 2008, which reﬂects several characteristics of
an emergency risk; the second is the risk of water shortages in
Africa, which illustrates the characteristics of an incremental
risk.
5.1. Case 1: heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain disaster
in 2008 in southern China
From mid-January to early February 2008, the southern part
of China suffered four consecutive heavy snow, sleet and
freezing rain disasters, which affected electricity, trans-
portation, agriculture, energy, ecological system, and tourism
in 20 provinces, generating serious systemic impacts (TSC,
2008). Fig. 5 summarizes the disaster’ transmission routes.
From the perspective of weather conditions, freezing rain
against the backdrop of the La Ni~na event is the main cause of
this disaster. Although the causes of this disaster cannot be
directly attributed to climate change, climate change is an
important reason for the frequent occurrence of extreme
climate events (Ding et al., 2008), which provides important
references for such events in the future.
According to the ofﬁcial statistics after the disaster (TSC,
2008), the direct effects of the event include: 1) damage of
electricity facilities. The electricity transmission lines of 13
provinces were damaged to varying degrees. Power supply in
170 counties was cut off. 2018 substations were shut down, and
power supply in some areas was cut off for more than 10 days.
2) Disruption of transportation. The BeijingeGuangzhou
and ShanghaieKunming railways were blocked due to power
cuts. Nearly 20,000 km of expressway and 220,000 km of
ordinary road were paralyzed. Many civil aviation airports
were forced to shut down, and a large number of ﬂights have
been canceled or delayed. 3) Diminishing agricultural pro-
duction. Crop production was reduced by more than 30% than
average historical level in 7.37 million hm2 of land, of which
1.97 million hm2 was completely barren. 4) Forest ecosystem
damage. 19 million hm2 of forest was affected by the weather
events.
These direct effects generated a series of indirect effects
that spread to the broader economic sector and inﬁltrated into
the social sector, creating a cascading effect that shows the
classic characteristics of systemic risk. The indirect impacts of
the event are greater than the direct impact (TSC, 2008): 1) A

large number of industrial enterprises had to be shut down
due to energy shortage. 83% of industrial enterprises in
Hunan and 90% in Jiangxi stopped production for several
days. 2) Livelihood of residents was seriously affected.
Water pipes in Wuhan, Jingzhou, Yichang, and other cities in
Hubei province were frozen and cracked, leaving 2.8 million
people without drinking water, while power outage and other
incidents made water supply even more difﬁcult. 3) Tourism
was also hit hard after the event. During the Spring Festival
holidays, the number of tourists in the 19 provinces decreased
by 9.7%, and the tourism revenue decreased by 11.5%. The
worst-hit seven provinces, including Hunan and Guizhou, saw
a 28.1% drop in the number of tourists and a 29.8% drop in
tourism revenue during the same period. 4) The risk of forest
ﬁre, diseases, and pests greatly increased. The disaster
caused a large number of trees to fall, break off and die, and
the accumulation of dead branches and leaves on the ground
increased sharply, increasing the risk of forest ﬁre, diseases,
and
pests. Compared with previous
years, the
surface
combustible load of the affected forest increased by 2e10
times, and risk of forest ﬁre in spring increased by one to two
levels. In northern Guangdong province, the number of dry-
eating pests increased signiﬁcantly after the disaster, among
which boring insect population increased by about 90 times in
the second year after the disaster compared with the previous
year. 5) Public security was affected. The event occurred
during the Spring Festival, and millions of passengers were
stranded at stations, airports, and along railways and high-
ways,
including
nearly
800,000 stranded passengers
in
Guangzhou alone, seriously endangering public security.
As an event that has already occurred, it is meaningless to
analyze its probability of occurrence. Based on the ranking
criteria presented in Table 1, we assess the severity of the
disaster. On the whole, the impact of this event is mainly
concentrated in the economic domain and has a slight effect on
the domains of society, human health, and living conditions. In
the economic domain, the direct economic loss of the disaster
reached 151.65 billion CNY, accounting for 0.48% of the GDP
in that year. If considering the indirect losses, the ratio rises
sharply. Regarding the scope of the impact, the incident
involved 20 provinces, and major national projects, including
the
west-east
power
transmission
channel,
BeijingeGuangzhou,
ShanghaieKunming,
and
BeijingeZhuhai expressway, were damaged. The assessment
result of the economic impact is High.
In the domain of society, the event increased the public
security risk due to a large number of stranded people. How-
ever, the disaster did not have a substantial impact on social
stability. In the domain of human health, the disaster caused a
total of 129 deaths. It increased the incidences of respiratory
diseases, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and
intestinal diseases et al. However, the overall impact was
short-term and did not substantially affect the average state of
social health, and the overall rating was Minimal. In the living
conditions domain, the disaster collapsed 485,000 houses,
damaged 1.686 million houses, involving 1.66 million people.
It caused a regional inﬂuence on the living conditions, but the
damage is recoverable, and so its severity is ranked as Low.
5.2. Case 2: the risk of water shortage in Africa
Climate change has contributed to water shortage in Africa,
although non-climate drivers such as population, economic
growth and expansion of irrigated agriculture may have a
stronger inﬂuence on future water availability (Beck and
Bernauer, 2011; IPCC, 2014; Wolski et al., 2012). Fig. 6
presents a possible risk chain of water shortage in Africa.
First, water shortage may exacerbate Africa's already fragile
agricultural production. Not only will climatic zones suitable
for growing perennial cash crops diminish signiﬁcantly, but
crop productivity will also be seriously damaged, which will
exacerbate food security and nutritional deﬁciency. In addition,

391

water shortage will cause excessive growth of drought-tolerant
species and lead to an increase in pests and diseases. On the
one hand, pests and diseases affect agricultural production and
ecosystem functions. On the other hand, they may cause the
wide spreading of some insect-borne diseases and have adverse
effects on the prevention and control of infectious diseases.
Malnutrition, with its potential life-long impacts on health
and development and its contribution to vulnerability to ma-
laria and diarrheal diseases, can result in severe health risks.
At the same time, crop failures also have a signiﬁcant negative
impact on household income in the region, while the decrease
in income will increase the possibility of migration. Low per
capita income, economic contraction, competition for scarce
resources, combined with other adverse social-economic
conditions, may increase the risk of violent conﬂicts (Field
et al., 2014; Kumssa and Jones, 2010).
Based on the risk assessment framework proposed in Sec-
tion 4, we brieﬂy assess the risk of water shortage in Africa
(Table 2). Overall, the climate risk induced by water shortage
in Africa is at a high level, which involves all ﬁve domains of
impact: economy, society, homeland security, human health,
and living condition. In the living condition domain, the dry
area covers approximately 41% of the African continent, the
long-term continuous drought caused by rising temperature
and decreasing precipitation will signiﬁcantly deteriorate the
residing environment in Africa. Under the inﬂuence of climate
change, the regions receiving 500e600 mm rainfall per year
will experience a reduction by 30%e50% in the surface
drainage, which is very likely to cause further expansion of the
arid area (Misra, 2014). In the economic domain, climate
change is very likely to trigger signiﬁcant adverse conse-
quences. According to the World Meteorological Organization
(WMO, 2020), the overall GDP of Africa would decrease by
2.25% if the global average temperature increases by 1 C, and
by12.12% if temperature increases by 4 C.
In the domain of human health, climate change will
intensify food insecurity in Africa. From 2012 to 2018, the
number of undernourished people in the drought-prone sub-
Saharan region increased by 45.6% (WMO, 2020). Besides,
the deterioration of living conditions and economic stagnation
can lead to inadequate public health care systems, insufﬁcient
access to safe sanitation, and other climate-sensitive health
outcomes, such as Malaria, Leishmaniasis, Rift Valley Fever,
and other diseases. In the domain of society, climate change
may intensify regional migration away from areas with lower
water availability and crop productivity (Mueller et al., 2020;
Rigaud et al., 2018). However, human migration has social,
political, demographic, economic, and environmental drivers,
which may operate independently or in combination, and the
role of climate change is controversial (IPCC, 2014). There-
fore, we assess its probability of occurrence as Possible. In the
domain of homeland security, the U.S. Department of Defense
identiﬁed climate change as a “threat multiplier” and “accel-
erant of instability” as early as 2014 (USDoD, 2014). The
degradation of natural resources will contribute to increased
conﬂicts over the distribution of vital strategic resources
(MGI, 2020). Climate change is often not the sole factor in
conﬂict; the outbreak of armed conﬂict depends on many
country-speciﬁc socio-political, economic, and cultural fac-
tors. Therefore, our assessment on homeland security is con-
servative, with a Medium impact and a probability of Possible.

392

of systemic risk and proposes a new conceptual framework to
assess systemic risk. Following conclusions are drawn.
First, systemic risk induced by climate change results from
rapid growth of greenhouse emissions, increasingly complex
connections among different socioeconomic systems, and
continuous
changes
in
exposure
and
vulnerability.
The
fundamental, deﬁning feature of systemic risk is cascading
effects. The extent of risk propagation and its duration depend
on the characteristics of the various discrete risks that are
connected to make up the systemic risk. The extent and
duration of risk propagation in a certain link mainly depends
on the impact of the previous link and the exposure and
vulnerability of this link.
Second, assessment of systemic risk must take into account
system-wide diversity and the integrated impacts of events on
politics, economy, society, culture, as well as ecology. Impact
domains, severity of impact, and probability of occurrences
are three core indicators in systemic risk assessment. Specif-
ically, this study identiﬁes ﬁve impact domains: economy,
society, homeland security, human health, and living condi-
tions. The severity of impact of systemic risk depends on the
size of the risk event, the level of risk exposure, the vulnera-
bility of the exposed population, the effectiveness of mitiga-
tion actions, and the areas affected. While most climate risks
are incremental, where impacts slowly accumulate and can
potentially trigger sudden, irreversible tipping points, some
climate risks are emergency risks caused by emergency events
such as extreme weather disasters. Systemic risk assessment
mainly focuses on high probability, high impact events and
low probability, high impact events instead of low probability,
low impact events and high probability, low impact events.
6.2. Limitations and future research agenda
This study explains the dynamics of systemic risk induced by
climate change and provides a primary assessment framework,
but the study is still at an infant stage of conceptual and theo-
retical development. There are still some technical limitations.
First, the study develops the theoretical framework based on the
known risks, but there is still plenty of ambiguous and unknown
risks, presenting characteristics different from known risks.
Second, the study strives to capture the characteristics of sys-
temic risk, but the assessment framework still needs to be
further developed. Due to the complexity of systemic risk and
the limited understanding of the risk propagation paths, this
study brieﬂy analyzes the cascading effect of the systemic risk
from the perspective of the inﬂuence domain. A more precise
assessment depends on the knowledge of risk details.
The high complexity of systemic risk suggests that a
comprehensive understanding of systematic risk needs to
integrate politics, economics, culture, society, ecology, and
other ﬁelds. Future research should focus on the following
three aspects. The ﬁrst aspect is to develop a theoretical
framework based on historical disaster risks, risk theory,
ecological theory, and system theory. A complete theoretical
framework is helpful to grasp the fundamental laws of systemic
risk. The second aspect is to carry out regional and industrial
case studies. Extensive and in-depth observations help to
identify and discover more details of the system risks, as well
as to understand the complex structure of systemic risks. The
last aspect is to carry out risk assessment on typical regional
systemic risks. The combination of theory and practice can
promote continuous improvement and update of the assessment
method and better support the risk response strategy.
