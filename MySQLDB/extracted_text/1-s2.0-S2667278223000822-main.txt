Humanity is currently confronted with simultaneous complex environmental crises of unprecedented scale.
These include, but are not limited to, the ongoing sixth mass extinction and the depletion of biodiversity, and
ongoing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions which are causing changes in the climate that humanity
has never before witnessed. As these ecological crises continue to progress, there is increasing recognition of
the impact this has on mental health. Within this context, the notion of ecoanxiety has gained traction, pri-
marily from the perspective of psychology, with the view to elevate suffering. However, in our view, the risk
of considering ecoanxiety, and other ecological emotions, solely from a medicalized perspective as a mental
disorder is that it places too much responsibility on individuals, decontextualizes ecological emotions from
their social and political settings, and detaches these emotions from their ethical and moral dimensions. This
article proposes to reconsider ecological emotions from the perspective of moral distress. Environmental
moral distress resituates ecological emotions within their social and political contexts, and sheds light on
their entanglement with ethical realms that medicalized conceptions of ecoanxiety fail to recognize. We
argue that responding to environmental moral distress requires a shift to an ethics of care and ecofeminist
paradigm which enables us to consider ecological emotions as contextualized indicators of the experience of
morally questionable actions. This approach opens the door to collective responses aiming to empower and
build moral agency in the face of the shared moral and political struggles which characterize the ecological
crisis.

Introduction
There is increasing evidence from social psychology literature
demonstrating psychological distress and emotional states, such as
anxiety, worry, anger, and hopelessness (among others) associated
with the state of the environment and ongoing climate change [1−4].
Climate change impacts mental health in numerous ways among
which anxiety and difﬁcult emotions are one potential pathway.
These pathways include through exposure to extreme weather
events and high temperatures, conﬂict and displacement, pressures
due economic and social loss, as well as anxiety and distress associ-
ated with ongoing and future climate change [4,5], the latter of
which, is the focus of this article.
People in over 25 countries have reported experiencing ‘negative’
emotions about climate change, such as worry, fear, guilt, hopeless-
ness and despair, in association to poor mental health [6]. Further-
more, climate anxiety has been found to be related to mental well-
being in 31 countries [7]. Climate anxiety is of particular concern
among young people, speciﬁcally young adults [8], who often experi-
ence additional layers of complex emotions such as betrayal, aban-
donment and confusion linked to lack of appropriate action by the
adults who surround them [3]. A survey of 10,000 young people
(aged 16−25) across ten countries found that 59% were ‘very’ or
‘extremely’ worried about climate change and 84% were ‘moderately’
worried [3]. Emotions such as sadness, anger, anxiety, powerlessness,
helplessness and guilt were reported by more than half of the young
people surveyed [3]. With these numbers in mind, ecoanxiety is
poised to become (if it is not already) a central mental health concern
among young people as climate change continues to progress and
impacts become increasingly visible and dangerous. However, these
mental health concerns are not limited to younger populations. Other
groups that are particularly vulnerable to the mental health impacts
of climate change include older [9] and marginalized populations
[10,11], women [12], and people with pre-existing physical and men-
tal health challenges [4].
While ecoanxiety and ecological emotions are increasingly being
discussed in social and clinical psychology literature, there is

simultaneous advocacy for considering the range of ecological emo-
tions and climate anxiety as a healthy reaction or an adaptive func-
tion that enables practical coping through the reinforcement of
future-orientation [1,13−15]. Critical psychology literature highlights
the shortcomings of some approaches, which tend to overburden
individuals with responsibility and disconnect ecological emotions
from their social, political, and ethical contexts [16]. For these rea-
sons, it has been suggested ecoanxiety can be considered a ‘moral
emotion’ based on sensitivity to the severity of the ecological crisis
[14,15].
Through our own research and involvement with climate change
action and environmental advocacy, we have engaged in discussions
and observations of ecological emotions among members of collec-
tives committed to sustainability action. This experience has contrib-
uted to our understanding that ecological emotions often distinctly
exhibit moral dimensions. Indicators of these moral dimensions that
have been exhibited in our interactions, such as through expressions
of fatigue stemming from a deep sense of responsibility to bring
about rapid and radical change in the context of highly complex and
slow-moving systems. They have also been expressed through pro-
found and pervasive powerlessness in the face of deep structural
forces that resist change despite pressing ecological crises. Finally,
moral dimensions of ecological emotions inﬁltrate seemingly unde-
tected through sentiments of guilt surrounding individual lifestyle
choices which contradict deeply held values. Such experiences are
also supported by other authors working on guilt and environmental
behavior [17]. Furthermore, our previous interests in Conrad’s con-
cept of medicalization of society [18,19] makes us aware of the chal-
lenge of medicalization, particularly what it represents for emotions
in the ﬁeld of ecoanxiety. More speciﬁcally, it begs the question of
seeing ecoanxiety as a mental disorder and its possible place in the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) [20],
an open question widely discussed [21,22]. These personal observa-
tions highlight the intricate interplay between the psychological and
moral dimensions of ecological emotions.
Within this context we argue that the increasing tendency to
focus on ecoanxiety as a medical disorder has obscured the moral
dimension of ecological emotions and their associated moral distress.
In this publication we use the terms ‘ethics’ and ‘morals’ interchange-
ably as synonyms. We hypothesize that reconsidering ecological
emotions from the perspective of moral distress sheds light on the
entanglement of ecological emotions and their ethical realms. This
perspective, which we call environmental moral distress, enables
ecological emotions and their associated moral distress to be resitu-
ated within their social and political context. Subsequently, we posit
that the lens of the ethics of care and ecofeminism is necessary. As a
theoretical framework, ecofeminism explores the intersections of
environmentalism and feminism; this focus reveals important fea-
tures of domination over, and oppression of, women and nature, thus
shedding light on “interconnected systems of human domination”
[23, p.2]. It focuses on ethical principles such as needs, empathy,
responsibility, relatedness, engagement, creativity, on “thinking dif-
ferently” and on the role of narratives and voices [24]. This framing
enables adequate consideration of ecological emotions as indicators
of morally questionable action in the context of the ecological crisis.
Furthermore, this reframing enables us to consider ecological emo-
tions as a collective experience and source of empowerment. Finally,
we propose concrete actions, particularly moral deliberation, as a
response to environmental moral distress.
Ecoanxiety and ecological emotions
Numerous terms are used to describe different forms of psycho-
logical and emotional responses induced by environmental change
and the ecological crisis. Terms that are often mobilized include psy-
choterratic syndromes, ecoanxiety, climate anxiety, ecological grief,
solastalgia, ecoparalysis, econostalgia, eco-angst, eco-depression and
eco-anger [1,7,25−29]. Psychoterratic syndromes is often used as an
umbrella term to refer to mental illnesses where mental wellbeing is
impacted due to threats to the link between a person and their home
or territory [26]. Ecological grief refers to the emotional response
experienced in relation to lived or anticipated loss in nature and the
environment [27], including the loss of species, ecosystems, and
meaningful landscapes due to acute or chronic environmental change
[28]. Solastalgia describes the distress or pain related to lived experi-
ence of negative environmental change of a home environment
[25,26]. Econostalgia is the sentiment of melancholia and nostalgic
longing for a place that has undergone considerable transformation
(which could be due to development or climate change, for example)
even though the individual has no lived experience of the changes
that occurred in that place [25]. Ecoanxiety can include non-speciﬁc
worry about our relationship with supporting environments, height-
ened distress in response to dangerous changes in the climate sys-
tem, or even chronic fear of environmental collapse [1,14,25,27,30].
These emotional responses can range from mild stress to clinical dis-
orders and maladaptive coping strategies.
There has been recent criticism of the medicalized approach to
ecoanxiety. Social psychologists advocate for ecoanxiety to be recog-
nized as a normal and healthy reaction to the ongoing ecological cri-
ses
[1,13,14]
with
clear
distinctions
between
healthy
and
pathological manifestations [7,14]. Similarly, critical psychologists
criticize the conceptualization of ecoanxiety as a psychological disor-
der which removes ecological emotions from the realm of legitimate
human experience and extricates these emotional responses from
their historical, cultural, social and political contexts, in other words
its fundamental ethical foundations and dimensions [16,30−32].
Such discourse feeds into a neo-liberal agenda where citizens are
burdened with the responsibility of building individual resilience and
adapting to a seemingly unchangeable system, thus prioritizing indi-
vidual success and competition, and guaranteeing their productivity
[16]. Such “discursive entanglement” of psychological and moral
dimensions of ecological emotions [16, p.6] has obscured the funda-
mental ethical dilemmas that underly these emotional responses,
thus limiting understandings of responsibility and accountability
[32].
Ecological emotions are considered as a response to existing and
possible future threats and changes relating to the environment deg-
radation [16] and the relationship that we as humans have with the
natural world that surrounds us. Ka»wak and Weihgold [16, p.3] see
ecological emotions as “a sense that effectively informs us on the
changing climate of our natural and social environment”. Ecological
emotions encompass a range of emotions such as worry, fear, anger,
anxiety, grief, sadness, hopelessness, despair, guilt, shame, frustra-
tion, depression, hope, betrayal, and (dis)empowerment or power-
lessness [2,3,13,14,27,28,33−37]. Here the term ‘ecological emotions’
is used to capture a wide range of the above described psychological
and emotional responses related to the ongoing ecological crisis. Eco-
logical emotions are entangled with individual and collective experi-
ences [38,39] as well as ethical realms of environmental change, and
thus need to be approached as such. To shed light on the ethical
dimensions of ecological emotions, we next consider the frameworks
of moral distress and moral injury.
Moral distress and moral injury: a distinction
The concept of moral distress was ﬁrst introduced by philosopher
and public health ethicist, Andrew Jameton, in the 1980s in order to
describe disruptive moral experiences associated with emotional dis-
tress in nursing practices [40,41]. This includes, for example, when a
nurse makes a moral decision about the treatment of a patient but is
constrained from taking the identiﬁed course of action due to institu-
tional or hierarchical barriers [40,41]. Since its conception, moral

distress has been identiﬁed in a range of situations and disciplines
such as medicine, social work, and education [40]. Moral distress is
considered as psychological unease in response to morally challeng-
ing situations such as confrontation with a moral dilemma or uncer-
tainty, including situations when one is restricted from taking the
course of action that one believes to be ethically right [41,42]. Situa-
tions of moral distress often involve violations of important moral
values [43]. As such, emotions indicative of psychological distress are
evident in cases of moral distress including, but not limited to, anger,
guilt, self-blame, or withdrawal from the moral dilemma [44].
According to Jameton [41], there are numerous factors which can
contribute to moral distress, including moral judgement, psychologi-
cal and physical distress, moral dilemmas, moral uncertainty, exter-
nal and internal factors constraining action, and threats to moral
integrity. Through a review of the common elements of deﬁnitions of
moral distress, Morley et. al [40] identiﬁed three factors in order for
distress to be considered moral distress. First, the person or people
must experience a ‘moral event’ where a moral dilemma or moral
uncertainty is encountered. Second, they need to experience psycho-
logical distress. Third, there needs to be a direct causal relation
between the moral event and experience of psychological distress.
Finally, it is important to note that moral distress can also occur
through witnessing moral transgression by others [42].
Moral injury ﬁnds its origin in trauma psychology as a psychoana-
lytic concept and has been principally developed in literature pertain-
ing to soldiers and war veterans who experience post-traumatic
responses to violations of moral boundaries by the commands, deci-
sions or actions of military authorities [45−47]. Moral injury is distinct
from moral distress in that it arises from sustained moral distress caus-
ing a pathological response in the form of psychological harm or
impaired function [42]. Furthermore, it arises primarily in relation to
lived experience of incidents related to violence and death [46]. Expe-
riences that may result in moral injury can involve situations such as
deaths or killings, dealing with human remains, or encountering
severely injured individuals where the person was unable to provide
assistance [46]. In general, in the literature, two important features of
moral injury emerge, including lived experience of a traumatic events
and a violation of moral values [32,42,48]. Such violations have been
suggested to be committed by someone who is in a position of author-
ity or leadership [45]. Finally, it has been claimed that moral injury is a
precursor for post-traumatic stress disorder [46,47].
Ecological distress has been previously suggested as constituting
moral injury, particularly as this distress can emerge from transgres-
sions of values committed by persons in positions of authority
[3,17,32,49]. Weintrobe [17] suggests that knowing that one has con-
tributed to the causes of climate change creates risks for exposure to
moral injury. However, focusing solely on moral injury narrows the
focus of moral dilemmas and transgressions to extreme cases, partic-
ularly related to traumatic experiences. As a result, less acute and
long-term experiences of moral distress may become marginalized
and therefore not receive the appropriate and necessary attention.
Instead, the additional consideration of moral distress may provide
space to intervene early as preventative action prior to the develop-
ment of moral injury. As such, moral distress can also be a valuable
framework in holistic approaches to ecological emotions and should
be considered on a spectrum alongside moral injury. While previous
articles have elaborated the argument for moral injury [3,32], we aim
to provide further clariﬁcation on the relevance of ‘environmental
moral distress’ to ecological emotions and potential responses to
moral distress in this context.
Understanding and responding to moral dimensions of ecological
emotions
As we illustrated above, there is need for a shift towards a deeper
understanding of the relationship between ecological emotions and
their moral dimensions. Building on the concept of moral distress we
develop the notion of ‘environmental moral distress’ to shed light on
moral dimensions of ecological emotions. Following this we argue
how adequate recognition of moral dimensions in ecological emo-
tions necessitates the adoption of ethics of care and ecofeminist per-
spectives which give space to the consideration of emotions in
morality. Furthermore, ethics of care and ecofeminist perspectives
encourage the adoption of responses grounded in collective empow-
erment and development of agency.
Environmental moral distress
Here we use the concept of ‘environmental moral distress’ to refer
to the moral distress that individuals experience in response to eco-
logical crises, such as climate change and biodiversity loss, among
others. This distress is expressed through ecological emotions (see
aforementioned list of ecological emotions). The three elements of
moral distress established by Morley et al. [40], being (1) the experi-
ence of a ‘moral event’, (2) the experience of psychological distress,
and (3) a direct causal relation between (1) and (2), are used as a
framework to reconstruct ecological emotions through the prism of
environmental moral distress.
Moral events refer to events that involve moral dilemmas or
moral uncertainty [40]. They can incorporate features such as limited
moral agency (the capacity to recognize, reﬂect on and act on moral
responsibilities [40]) which results in constraint from taking the
‘right’ course of action, moral uncertainty, and violation of moral val-
ues due to the decisions and actions of self or others [40,41,43,44,50].
Global and national environmental politics repeatedly highlight how
citizens and community members have limited moral agency to be
able to collectively pursue the moral course of action. People are sig-
niﬁcantly constrained in their ability to act due to existing institu-
tional structures and power dynamics. This constraint is exempliﬁed
by the fact that individual behavior change alone cannot address
environmental crises at the scale required, but also requires deep sys-
temic transformations [51]. Moral uncertainty can arise within the
context of the ecological crises in many forms. It can arise in relation
to the lack of certainty about directions of future policy or govern-
ment decisions relating to important environmental concerns. Exam-
ples of this include political back-and-forth on climate change
policies, such as the implementation and subsequent repeal of the
‘Carbon Tax’ in Australia under Tony Abbott and the Liberal-National
Coalition [52], the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris
Agreement under the Trump administration [53], and the use of
unreasonable force and violence against environmental activists pro-
testing the development of a mega basin in Sainte-Soline, France
[54,55]. Ethical dilemmas related to personal choices associated with
reducing personal environmental impacts can also give rise to moral
distress through the existence of trade-offs between two (or more)
competing values. For example, choosing to have fewer or no chil-
dren is increasingly viewed as an option in predominantly Western
cultures to reduce individual environmental impact, however this
choice is never neutral in terms of the values involved in taking such
a decision [56,57]. Finally, the decisions of other actors, particularly
government and private sector, can cause moral distress through the
transgression of what is known to be the right course of action among
a community or its members, and government failure to deliver on
environmental promises. For example, governments have established
climate change mitigation commitments through nationally deter-
mined contributions, however, these commitments are known to be
insufﬁcient to reach the 1.5°C target that was internationally agreed
upon through the Paris Agreement [58,59]. These targets often go
unmet, and their revision in some cases results in less ambitious
emissions reductions [60,61]. Other cases of such moral transgres-
sions include the private sector making decisions that harm the envi-
ronment or future generations, despite awareness (and even denial)

of their harmful nature, such as in the case of ExxonMobil’s aware-
ness of the link between the fossil fuel industry and climate change
since the 1970s [62]. The resulting distrust in institutions and feelings
of betrayal can even lead to moral injury [3].
The second component of environmental moral distress is psy-
chological distress related to ecological crises. As established in the
introduction, this is a growing concern worldwide with numerous
studies demonstrating the negative impact of climate change on
mental health. Existing research thus establishes sufﬁcient quantita-
tive and qualitative evidence of psychological distress linked to eco-
logical crises [1−4,6−8]. Such psychological distress may manifest
through a range of ecological emotions such as worry, fear, anxiety,
grief, hopelessness, despair, guilt, shame, anger, frustration, depres-
sion, hope, betrayal, and (dis)empowerment [2,3,13,14,27]. While
some may view these emotions solely through a psychological lens
or in a negative way, they can have an important place in fostering
positive and transformative change [2,31,63].
The third element of environmental moral distress constitutes a
causal link between the experience of the moral event and the psy-
chological distress. Examining both of these elements, we hypothe-
size that there is indeed a causal relationship between moral events
in relation to ecological crises and psychological distress currently
referred to under the labels of ecoanxiety, or climate anxiety, among
others. However, this relationship is obscured by the dominant medi-
calized view of decontextualized and pathological ecological emo-
tions [16,30,31] which misrepresents the entanglement of ecological
emotions (psychological distress) and their moral components
(linked to moral events) [16]. The recognition of the moral context of
ecological emotions through the identiﬁcation of moral events such
as those listed above is crucial to developing a deeper understanding
of environmental moral distress and adequately addressing the sour-
ces of this distress.
Taking ecological emotions (morally) seriously
Moving away from the medicalized approach in order to take our
ecological emotions seriously also requires a shift in our ethical
approach. Not all ethical approaches allow us to take account of eco-
logical emotions and the empowerment they enable (their dimension
of making us act). In our view, it is ﬁrst and foremost the ethics of
care and, in particular, ecofeminism that support this approach. The
ethics of care and ecofeminism pay particular attention to who we
are, our needs, our dependencies, our interdependencies, our rela-
tionships and our context [23,64,65]. This is in contrast to liberal
ethics, which attach particular importance to our autonomy, our
rationality and to separating the individual from all elements that
would limit his freedom and property, such as other people, the envi-
ronment, or non-human others.
In the very deﬁnition of what constitutes care according to Tronto,
for example, our environment appears as an element to be cared for:
“on the most general level, we suggest that caring be viewed as a spe-
cies activity that includes everything that we do to maintain, con-
tinue, and repair our ‘world’ so that we can live in it as well as
possible. That world includes our bodies, our selves, and our environ-
ment, all of which we seek to interweave in a complex, life-sustaining
web” [66, p.40]. Although she stresses the need to take the environ-
ment into account, she does not seem to expand on this point, nor
deﬁne what she means by environment. Thus, it is undoubtedly Val
Plumwood’s ecofeminism that best enables us to integrate ecological
emotions into our mindset.
According to Plumwood, Western thought and its rationalist pos-
ture accord a dominant role to reason over emotion [67]. Contrast-
ingly, both the ethics of care and ecofeminism value emotions in
morality rather than rejecting them [23,64,68]. Val Plumwood
grounds her argumentation in dualisms that are at the crux of the
domination over nature and women. Among the multiple dualisms
she demonstrates how emotion is cast as the adversary to reason and
as “an unreliable, unreﬂective, irrational and sometimes uncontrolla-
ble force reason must dominate” [69, p.189]. Such dualism contrib-
utes to the disregard of emotions in moral and political spheres.
Instead, Plumwood advocates for an integrative approach between
reason and emotion to support the articulation of values and perspec-
tives [69]. Similarly, Karen Warren argues that emotional intelligence
is an integral and necessary component for moral reasoning [23].
This ecofeminist stance enables the appropriation of ecological emo-
tions as indicators of moral values. Here ecological emotions associ-
ated with environmental moral distress can be considered to indicate
that the current and ongoing environmental destruction is not in
accordance with our values, moral reasoning, or desired relationship
with nature.
Ecofeminists often consider our relationship with nature through
a relational ontology where people are “members of ecological com-
munities” and humans and non-human nature exist as “beings-in-
relationships” [68, p.300]. According to Plumwood, the human-
nature dualism is a falsehood [70,71] which results in the reduction
of non-human nature to its instrumental value (its usefulness to
humans) [24]. Such hyper-separation of humans and nature is a dan-
ger as it hinders our understanding of the limits of ecological systems
[24]. Plumwood instead argues for the consideration of the self as
interrelated with nature based on a mutual selfhood [69]. This per-
spective enables us to rethink environmental moral distress as a
response to the ecological crisis based on our interdependencies with
non-human
nature.
Furthermore,
it
emphasizes
the
collective
essence of this experience. That is, environmental destruction
becomes a collective experience intricately interwoven with our own
well-being and survival. Within this context, the ethics of care and
ecofeminist
perspectives
encourage
the
adoption
of
responses
grounded on collective empowerment and development of agency.
Through the lens of the ethics of care and ecofeminism, it is possi-
ble to take into account ecological emotions so that they are consid-
ered as contextualized indicators of the experience of moral
questionable doing. They make us question and signal a dilemma, a
form of moral distress that requires ﬁrst an ethical assessment and
then action. In this sense, ecological emotions awaken our moral
desire for action. This framing can contribute to the empowerment of
people and communities and improving people’s normative compe-
tencies and ethical reasoning so that they can articulate this and build
moral agency that facilitates courageous and cooperative speaking
up, and persistent action [40].
Responses to environmental moral distress
To address environmental moral distress related to ecological cri-
ses, it is crucial to build moral agency and empower community
members. To build such moral agency in the face of wicked problems
such as climate change and biodiversity loss, a new normative narra-
tive is needed [63]. This new narrative needs to be based on collective
approaches that emphasize the interconnectedness both among com-
munity members with the societies and environments that they
inhabit [30,63], thus giving appropriate space to the historical and
political contexts of environmental destruction [16,31]. This involves
creating opportunities for people and communities to foster a shared
understanding of the moral issues involved in the ecological crises
and to arrive at a morally justiﬁed course of action through reﬂection
on their values.
Moral case deliberation offers a practical approach to navigating
ethical dilemmas through structured dialogue and collaborative
reﬂection on a concrete moral question [72,73]. This method, which
has emerged from clinical healthcare settings, can be used as a bot-
tom-up support process for ethical decision-making and empower-
ment [72]. Through deliberation, groups can reach a collective
decision or compromise by considering different paths of action [74

dimensions of events that impact them psychologically or the values
of
stakeholders
involved
in
the
ethical
dilemma
at
hand
[72,75,77,78]. Deliberation has been found useful in healthcare and
can facilitate the understanding of moral elements of ethical dilem-
mas, the identiﬁcation of moral responsibilities in complex situations,
as well as the co-creation of moral practices [79,80]. It provides a
platform for joint reﬂection and fosters a deeper understanding of
ethical issues and thus empowerment of people to speak up when
encountering moral distress by formulating a moral standpoint [80].
Additionally, such deliberative processes could potentially serve as
preventative measures to avoid moral injury resulting from exposure
to environmental moral distress.
It is important to note that environmental moral distress and psy-
chological framings of ecoanxiety are considered to be complemen-
tary. Psychological treatment of ecoanxiety symptoms is important
to address physical manifestations to reduce peoples’ and communi-
ties emotional, mental and physical suffering, particularly in acute
cases of ‘pathological’ ecoanxiety. The work of psychologists in this
area is crucial for community well-being. Environmental moral dis-
tress provides an additional perspective which is important to work
towards effective solutions that tackle the root causes of the ecologi-
cal emotions, alleviate suffering in the long-term, and potentially pre-
vent moral injury. Collaboration with psychologists is highly valuable
in this context as they not only provide the support necessary for
alleviation of suffering from acute symptoms but are also important
gatekeepers for identifying individuals suffering from environmental
moral distress. Deliberation processes for environmental moral dis-
tress would not necessarily need to be carried out by a psychologist,
rather could be facilitated by trained specialists in ethical delibera-
tion. Such approaches would be useful for people engaged in environ-
mental
action,
community
groups
impacted
by
important
environmental decisions, in the context of environmental politics, or
young people that are greatly impacted by our ever-changing envi-
ronment, among others.
Conclusion
The overwhelming focus on ecoanxiety as a mental disorder
obscures the moral dimensions of ecological emotions and their asso-
ciated environmental moral distress. This results in the overburden-
ing of people and communities with the responsibility to address
their own ecoanxiety without recognition of the broader social, polit-
ical and ethical dimensions that contribute to this psychological dis-
tress. Thus, such approaches have been said to treat psychological
symptoms of ecoanxiety without addressing the chronic root causes
of the problem. Furthermore, such an approach risks to delegitimize
healthy concerns about the existential moral questions regarding the
human-nature relationship.
There is need for a shift towards a deeper understanding of the
relationship between ecological emotions and their moral dimen-
sions, and a recognition of the underlying moral distress that contrib-
ute to these emotions. To shed light on the ethical realm of ecological
emotions, we propose the framework of ‘environmental moral dis-
tress’ which should be considered on a spectrum alongside moral
injury. Environmental moral distress refers to the moral distress that
individuals experience in response to ecological crises, such as cli-
mate change and biodiversity loss, among others. It constitutes an
experience of a moral event related to environmental degradation
which is causally linked to an experience of psychological distress.
This distress is expressed through a range of ecological emotions,
including worry, fear, anxiety, grief, hopelessness, despair, guilt,
shame, anger, frustration, depression, hope, betrayal, and (dis)
empowerment.
Through the lens of the ethics of care and ecofeminism, it is possi-
ble
to take account of ecological emotions as contextualized
indicators of the experience of moral questionable doing. This experi-
ence leads to ethical evaluation, development of moral agency, and
subsequently empowers us to act. In particular, this empowerment
involves the articulation and expression of moral concerns and
engagement in bold, collective, and sustained action for change.
Building moral agency and empowering people through the creation
of collective opportunities to foster a shared understanding of the
moral issues involved in ecological crises is necessary to address
environmental moral distress. The use of moral case deliberations
can help navigate ethical dilemmas, and potentially serve as preven-
tion measures to avoid moral injury resulting from exposure to envi-
ronmental moral distress.
