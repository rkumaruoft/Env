Building Resilient Neighbourhoods 
(BRN) is a collaborative effort to help 
create more resilient communities and 
neighbourhoods in British Columbia’s 
Capital Region. From 2012-2016 the 
project was led by the Community 
Social Planning Council of Greater 
Victoria and Transition Victoria, and was 
assisted in its development by support 
from BC Healthy Communities, Canadian 
Centre for Community Renewal and 
Fraser Basin Council’s Smart Planning 
for Communities program. As of 2017, 
the Building Resilient Neighbourhoods’ 
project is hosted by BC Healthy 
Communities. 
Our 2014 report, “Strengthening 
Neighbourhood Resilience: 
Opportunities for Communities and 
Local Governments” (see Appendix), 
explored the main characteristics of 
resilient communities and reviewed 
examples of the roles that citizens, 
non-profit organizations and local 
governments could each play in 
successful resilience efforts. This new 
report provides the results of Building 
Resilient Neighbourhoods’ “pilot phase” 
– our four years of efforts to help 
implement these principles of practice 
in the Capital Region.

ABOUT COMMUNITY & 
NEIGHBOURHOOD RESILIENCE
Resilience is all about strengthening 
our community’s ability to respond 
and adapt to major changes and deep 
challenges. It’s about all of us working 
together to build stronger, more 
connected neighbourhoods and 
communities that are intentional about 
balancing the diverse needs of people 
and the planet for current and future 
generations.
Communities today face a complex 
range of social, environmental and 
economic challenges. Many people are 
seeing that new ways of addressing 
these challenges are needed – approaches 
that acknowledge the interrelated and 
dynamic nature of the issues in ever-
changing communities. 
Using “resilience” as a lens to assess our 
communities, and as a reference set of 
capacities that we need to strengthen 
them, can help us respond to this 
dynamic complexity.
To be resilient in the face of complex, 
changing circumstances, we need the 
relationships, leadership and skills to 
work together: neighbour to neighbour 
and across different organizations and 
sectors. We also need to be open to 
new ideas, encourage diversity, and 
experiment and innovate so that we 
are continually learning. 
Resilient communities take charge of 
their current and future circumstances 
themselves, and also seek the resources 
or expertise that they need from 
outside. In addition, resilient communi­
ties do this in ways that ensure citizens’ 
basic needs (food, shelter, water, 
energy, livelihoods etc.) are met. 
Whether at the level of a household, 
apartment building, street, neighbour­
hood, or whole community, the basic 
resilience capacities remain the same 
and, to build resilience, we need ways 
to encourage and support these 
capacities at all of these levels.       
“Resilience is 
our 
ability to 
respond 
and adapt 
to change in 
ways that are 
proactive, 
build local 
capacity, 
and ensure 
essential 
needs are 
met.”
Why is Resilience so Important? 
4
By using a 
“place-based” 
rather than an 
“issue-based 
approach”, we 
support people, 
organizations 
and groups in 
neighbourhoods 
to build relation­
ships and social 
capital where 
they live.
Why a Place-based Focus in Neighbourhoods?
If ever there was a need for neighbours, 
neighbourhoods and whole communities 
to come together to adapt to change, 
it is today. Across the country, communi­
ties are experiencing the pressures of 
deteriorating infrastructure, climate 
change, financial instability, growing 
income inequality, and the rising 
prevalence of chronic health conditions. 
Our natural resource base is diminishing 
and many ecosystems are threatened. 
Many people are experiencing a greater 
sense of isolation from their neighbours. 
But amidst these vast challenges, there 
is a spreading hope and optimism that 
we have the methods and the means 
to transform our communities to have 
better chances of surviving and thriving 
into the future.
The Building Resilient Neighbourhoods 
project focuses at the neighbourhood 
scale because of our interest in supporting 
comprehensive, place-based change. 
(Though our work has occurred mainly in 
urban settings, many of our approaches 
can transfer to – or be easily adapted for 
– rural settings.) By using a “place-based” 
rather than an “issue-based approach”, 
we support people, organizations and 
groups in neighbourhoods to build 
relationships and social capital where 
they live. 
This shared connection to place helps 
engage residents and organizations in 
building long-term resilience to respond 
to a multitude of changing situations. A 
focus on neighbourhoods also provides 
a manageable scale where people can 
often see first-hand the impacts of their 
actions. This, in turn, has the potential to 
create more attachment to people and 
place, strengthen pride, and promote 
more engagement.

The Building Resilient Neighbourhoods Approach
The Building Resilient Neighbourhoods 
approach builds on the many examples 
of best practices in comprehensive 
community and neighbourhood 
development, while bringing a unique 
focus on resilience capacity-building. 
Based on our work to date, we have 
identified four core aspects of a com­
munity that are involved in enhancing 
neighbourhood resilience, and our goal 
is to assist communities in building these 
capacities locally: 
	1.	Shifting ATTITUDES & VALUES towards greater 
		
social cohesion and positive, solutions-focused outlooks.
	2.	Identifying and addressing gaps in human, natural 	
	
		
and built INFRASTRUCTURE & RESOURCES. 
	3.	Strengthening local ownership and control of the	
	
		
LOCAL ECONOMY. 
	4.	ENGAGING LEADERS, groups and citizens in 		
	
		
NEIGHBOURHOOD-BASED PLANNING and action 
		
to ensure local needs are met by building on local 
		
strengths and assets and leveraging resources 
		
from outside the neighbourhood.

WHAT DID WE DO?
(Pilot Phase 2012-2016)
The Building Resilient Neighbourhoods project was launched in 2012 as a collab­
orative effort to strengthen cohesion and capacity within neighbourhoods in the 
Greater Victoria region. During this pilot phase, our interest and intention was to 
test and learn as much as possible about the capacities that “make a difference” 
towards increasing neighbourhood resilience, and to discover what approaches to 
resilience-building gain the most traction and have the most potential. 
THIS PILOT PHASE FOCUSED ON THREE MAIN AREAS OF ACTIVITY:
1. 	Resilience Education & Capacity-building Across the Region.
	 •	 Directly engaged over 900 residents across the region in 14 different 
	 	
workshops about resilience-building.
	 •	 Facilitated educational workshops to residents and leaders in five different 
	 	
neighbourhoods to help identify strengths, vulnerabilities and priorities for 
	 	
resilience action.
	 •	 Developed the tool, “Characteristics of a Resilient Neighbourhood or 
	 	
Community – a Checklist,” to support individual and group assessments and 	
	 	
engagement around resilience strengths and vulnerabilities.
	 •	 Produced the report “Strengthening Neighbourhood Resilience: Opportunities 	
	 	
for Communities and Local Government”. 
	 •	 Involved 150 residents in regional resilience-building through community 
	 	
theatre and arts-based engagement.
	 •	 Published “Laughing Allowed: A How to Guide for Making a Physical Comedy 	
	 	
Show to Build Neighbourhood Resilience”. 
2. 	Resilience Assessment, Planning, & Collaborative Action in 
		 Pilot Neighbourhoods & Municipalities.
	 •	 Partnered with the Esquimalt Residents Association and Township of Esquimalt 
	 	
to facilitate resilience assessment, visioning and planning workshops, and a 
	 	
Resilient Streets pilot.
	 •	 Engaged 180 residents and over 20 neighbourhood groups in  
	 	
comprehensive resilience assessment and action planning in the demonstration 	
	 	
neighbourhood of Victoria West.
	 •	 Hosted a “Resilient Neighbourhood Resource Table” of approximately 15 
	 	
representatives of organizations, businesses and citizen-groups in Victoria 	 	
	 	
West, and facilitated networking and action planning. 
	 •	 In collaboration with the Vic West Resilient Neighbourhood Resource Table, 
	 	
supported the launch of the first-ever Vic West Street Fest.
3. 	Strengthening Neighbour-to-neighbour Connections & 
		 Collaboration in Pilot Neighbourhoods & Municipalities.
	 •	 Supported 24 individuals/groups and approximately 300 households in our 
	 	
Resilient Streets pilot program focused on building neighbour-to-neighbour 	
	 	
connections on residential streets and in multi-family residential buildings.
	 •	 Partnered with BC Housing to offer discussions, coaching and support in 	 	
	 	
resilience-building to tenant leaders.
	 •	 Hosted peer learning sessions for Resilient Streets block champions.

Feedback from 
Workshop 
Participants:
“I’d like to take the 
resilience checklist to 
our community 
association, as I think 
that it might be a useful 
way for guiding the 
association’s activities.” 
“I gained a 
greater awareness 
of community 
organizations and what 
is going on in my 
community.”
“Everyone I met was 
new to me. I am more 
engaged now than I 
ever have been.”

The initial phase of the Building Resilient Neighbourhoods project involved an 
intensive focus on regional learning events. These events brought together 
community members and organizations from 38 different neighbourhoods and 
communities across the Capital Regional District to explore opportunities 
for resilience building in relation to four workshop themes: 
1)	STRENGTHENING 
	 RESILIENCE: HOW 
	 TO DO IT IN YOUR 
	 NEIGHBOURHOOD
An introduction to keys concepts of 
neighbourhood resilience.

2)	GROWING A RESILIENT 
	 NEIGHBOURHOOD
An overview of approaches to 
assessing and strengthening 
neighbourhood resilience.
3)	ECONOMIC CHANGE 
	 AT THE LOCAL LEVEL
An exploration of innovative ways to 
help strengthen locally-owned 
businesses, develop complementary 
trading and sharing systems, and 
revitalize local economies.
4)	ENGAGING OUR 
	 NEIGHBOURS
A practical workshop and discussion for 
encouraging participation and collabo­
ration towards positive social, economic 
and environmental change in 
neighbourhoods.
Resilience Education & 
Capacity Building Across the Region
WHAT DID WE DO?
Using Community Theatre and 
Arts-based Engagement to 
Build Resilience
In the fall of 2014, a group of 
people from across the region who 
shared both an interest in their 
neighbourhood and a quirky sense 
of humour were brought together 
to explore a question: Could they 
turn their experiences of the ups 
and downs of neighbourhood 
leadership, activism and volunteer­
ing into physical comedy sketches? 
Project participants were trained 
in theatre and physical comedy 
techniques over six weeks and 
collaboratively developed a show 
called “Laughing Allowed! – 
The Slapstick World of 
Neighbourhood Activism.” 
The final show was performed 
for a regional audience and was 
followed by an interactive con­
versation between audience and 
performers. The show and ensuing 
collective conversation explored 
the “rewards, pitfalls and pratfalls” 
of neighbourhood volunteering, 
and afforded opportunities for a 
shared examination of the vital 
roles of artistic creativity and 
humour in building resilience.

Workshops for community association members and residents 
in the Victoria neighbourhoods of North Saanich and North Park, and in 
the District of Highlands.
A partnership with BC Housing which offered education, coaching and 
support for tenant leaders to develop and deliver a Resilient Streets program for 
other tenants. (For a description of BRN’s Resilient Streets program, see the 
section “Building neighbour-to-neighbour Connections through Resilient Streets”.)
A partnership with the District of 
Saanich which offered a customized 
resilience learning series for residents of 
Saanich, leading to Resilient Streets and 
citizen-led project activities. 
A partnership with the Esquimalt 
Residents Association and the 
Township of Esquimalt that offered 
two resilience visioning and planning 
workshops, follow-up support for three 
cross-sectoral table action-planning 
sessions, and the delivery of Resilient 
Streets workshops and micro-grants.
A regional community-based 
theatre project which brought together a 
group of citizens from Victoria West and other neighbourhoods 
to develop and perform an original comedic musical show, “Laughing Allowed! 
– The Slapstick World of Neighbourhood Activism.” The final show was 
performed for a regional audience and was followed by an interactive 
conversation between audience and performers. This project also led to the 
writing and web-release of a free, do-it-yourself guide to using physical 
comedy as a method for building neighbourhood resilience.
Presentations by the Building Resilient Neighbourhoods team at three 
provincial and national-level learning events.

Along with these workshops, the BRN team provided a range of other 
mentorship, peer support and learning events to assist citizen and 
organizational champions in identifying resilience strengths, vulnerabilities, 
and priorities for action, including:

“I think the experience of 
diverse groups working 
together to create a neigh­
bourhood event creates 
bonds that will likely last. 
Hopefully those bonds can be 
reactivated to address the 
community vulnerabilities.”

“It always helps to  build 
and maintain community 
connections – I know that 
going forward, when we 
are looking to share 
information, or ask for 
insights or support, 
that we have a much 
larger network of folks 
from which to choose.” 
“It confirmed what I’ve 
believed already: 
It is cooperation and 
collaboration that will help 
us all to get where we want 
to be, and not competition. 
And it is possible. There are 
so many good people in Vic 
West willing to help out and 
be part of the moving-
forward process.”
Resilience Assessment, Planning, & 
Collaborative Action in Pilot 
Neighbourhoods & Municipalities
In our efforts to more effectively learn 
about what it takes to build neighbour­
hood resilience, we focused the majority 
of our efforts in one pilot neighbourhood 
over two years: Victoria West in the 
municipality of Victoria. In addition, in 
2014, Building Resilient Neighbourhoods 
was invited to collaborate with the Esqui­
malt Residents Association to do resilience 
engagement work in the nearby Town­
ship of Esquimalt (population 16,000), 
and we agreed to participate. We con­
sidered that this would provide a unique 
opportunity to compare different 
community resilience-building approaches, 
at different scales, with different levels of 
involvement from BRN.
VICTORIA WEST RESILIENCE ASSESSMENT:
Beginning in 2013, we partnered with 
residents and organizations in Victoria 
West for an intensive process that 
engaged us collectively in assessing, 
planning and taking action on neigh­
bourhood resilience. As a first step, 
we invited residents, neighbourhood 
groups and organizational leaders to 
help assess the resilience strengths 
and vulnerabilities of their neighbour­
hood. We explored how Victoria West 
responds and adapts to change in four 
main dimensions of neighbourhood 
resilience: attitudes and values; 
resources and infrastructure (built and 
natural environments); local economy; 
and leadership, engagement and 
community-wide planning. 
During this process, we drew on 
Statistics Canada data and engaged 
with close to 180 Victoria West residents 
through a series of surveys, interviews 
and workshops, including “Neighbour­
hood Living Rooms” set up at various 
events and venues to engage citizens 
in conversations about their neighbour­
hood. This resulted in a detailed 
document of data and analysis – a 
“Resilience Snapshot” of the neighbour­
hood. Residents and champions were 
then gathered together for a “Resilience 
Assembly,” where the Resilience 
Snapshot was used to guide discussions 
and the setting of action priorities to 
strengthen resilience in the 
neighbourhood.
WHAT DID WE DO?

VICTORIA WEST RESILIENT NEIGHBOURHOOD 
RESOURCE TABLE (RNRT): 
One of the key resilience priorities 
identified through the Victoria West 
Resilience Snapshot and Resilience 
Assembly was an interest in bridg­
ing across the neighbourhood. 
Many neighbourhood groups and 
organizations were interested in 
coming together to build networks, 
collaborations, and a more “joined 
up” approach to neighbourhood 
development. Many also identified 
concerns about growing economic 
and geographic divides among 
Victoria West’s “sub-neighbourhoods.”
With these and related resilience 
interests in mind, the Resilient 
Neighbourhood Resource Table 
decided to undertake a tangible 
project together which would enable 
them to foster greater collaboration 
between groups and organizations: 
They collaboratively coordinated the 
first-ever Vic West Street Fest. 
In June of 2015, the outdoor fes­
tival took over a prominent street 
along the downtown waterway, 
showcasing and celebrating the 
groups, organizations, businesses 
and people of the neighbour­
hood, and drew an estimated 2,500 
visitors over the course of the day. 
The event occurred again in 2016 
without any involvement from BRN.
 •	 Reviewed and discussed the research that was done on Victoria West’s 
	
resilience strengths and vulnerabilities, and evaluated possible priorities 
	
for action.
•	
Explored ways to build greater neighbourhood resilience, such as 		
	
	
“connecting the dots” between activities already going on, identifying 	
	
	
resources already available, taking a comprehensive approach to 
	
neighbourhood activities, inviting new participants to the RNRT, and 
	
building stakeholder relationships.
 •	 Identified priorities and developed a shared agenda and action plan for 
	
the RNRT, and began to implement these.
 •	 Engaged in ongoing sharing of reflections and learnings about the 
	
RNRT efforts.
 •	 Conducted networking activities and provided assistance to each other 
	
on small projects.
 •	 Collaborated on organizing the first-ever Vic West Street Fest, an 
	
outdoor celebration and showcase of neighbourhood groups, 
	
organizations, and businesses.
As of June 2016, the Victoria West RNRT has been continuing its activities for nearly 
a year without BRN’s assistance, being sustained by local neighbourhood 
champions and leaders.
Following the Resilience Assembly, the 
Building Resilient Neighbourhoods 
team convened and supported regular 
meetings over 18 months of a Resilient 
Neighbourhood Resource Table (RNRT) 
in Victoria West. The RNRT was com­
prised of a core group of approximately 
15 people from organizations, busi­
nesses and associations representing 
diverse interests, sectors, and stakehold­
er groups based in the neighbourhood, 
including schools, community associa­
tions, social service agencies, housing 
providers, faith groups, real estate 
developers, grassroots community 
groups, and not-for-profit organizations. 
Together, the RNRT:

ESQUIMALT RESILIENCE  ENGAGEMENT PROCESS:
In contrast to our more comprehensive 
work in Victoria West, we did not 
undertake any type of resilience 
assessment surveys, interviews or 
research in the Township of Esquimalt. 
Instead, Esquimalt citizens, elected 
officials, and organizational leaders 
attended two half-day workshops where 
they were introduced to resilience and 
conducted their own SWOT (Strengths, 
Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) 
analysis of each of the four dimensions 
of resilience for their community. 
By the end of the second workshop, 
participants had selected four projects 
to move forward, and each project had 
a lead named to convene a subsequent 
planning session. BRN then helped 
convene and facilitate several subsequent 
meetings involving organizations in 
Esquimalt that shared the specific 
interest of developing ways to strength­
en citizen engagement and leadership. 
(See the Case Studies in the “What Did 
We Learn?” section for more details and 
discussion.)

In the Victoria West neighbourhood, the 
Township of Esquimalt, and the District 
of Saanich, we developed and imple­
mented a “Resilient Streets” program 
to offer specific support for fostering 
stronger neighbour-to-neighbour 
connections on residential streets and 
in multi-family buildings. 
What could 
a “resilient 
neighbour-
hood” look 
like in Vic 
West?
A community-wide project  
is underway to help make  
Vic West a Resilient  
Neighbourhood, and  
we are inviting  
YOU to join in!
how well do you know your 
neighbours?
BUILDING RESILIENT NEIGHBOURHOODS
Building Resilient Neigh-
bourhoods is helping to 
bring people in Vic West  
together to connect with 
their neighbours, strengthen 
the local neighbourhood 
economy and build capac-
ity as a neighbourhood to 
adapt to change.
If you live in Vic West, we’d love to hear what you think at:  
www.surveymonkey.com/s/vwresidentsresilientneighbourhood
This toolkit is designed to help you (and 
your neighbours!) start making your 
building, street or block more resilient 
with some fun, hands-on projects. We’re 
deliberately suggesting projects that can 
be done by small groups of people with 
few resources, because finding creative 
ways to do lots with little is a big part of 
what resilience is all about!  
This toolkit is a 1.0, “beta” version. That 
means, we’re hoping that you’ll give us 
feedback about what works and what 
doesn’t and why, and share with us what 
you learn along the way so we can use 
your experiences and advice to help oth-
ers.  If you come across a great tool or 
resource, send it our way so we can add 
it to the kit. Every group and street is dif-
ferent, but by learning together we can all 
become stronger – that’s a basic principle 
of building resilience, too!
Of course, no one can build the relation-
ships between you and your neighbours 
for you – only you and your neighbours 
can do that. And only you and your 
neighbours can decide how you want to 
go about doing that. What we’re hoping 
to do is engage, inspire and assist you in 
any way we can. 
 
BUILDING RESILIENT NEIGHBOURHOODS
Welcome!
 
 
Here’s what’s included in this toolkit:
 
 
 
•    Examples of Resilient Streets projects that have been done elsewhere
 
 
 
•   How-to Guides to get started on Resilient Streets projects
 
 
 
•    Links to resources for more information and ideas 
 
 
We’ve organized this all into 4 categories of resilience-building activities  
 
 
that can work well at the street or building level. These include:

The Resilient Streets program provided practical support to individuals and groups 
of citizens in four key ways:
	
1)	 Orientation and learning sessions that provided inspirational ideas for 
	
	
neighbours coming together to build resilience on their streets or in 
	
	
their buildings.
	
2)	 A downloadable and printed, take-home “Resilient Streets Toolkit” of 
	
	
ideas and resources that provided a menu of options for types of 
	
	
activities that people could initiate with their neighbours.
	
3)	 Small micro-grants of $40 to help pay for food and beverages for an 
	
	
initial neighbour get-together, and up to $200 for group resilience 
	
	
projects.

Altogether, through this small pilot, we gave out 24 micro-grants and approximately 
300 households directly participated in various Resilient Streets activities. 
On the following pages are some examples of the events.

WHAT DID WE DO?
“We held our planning 
picnic last Sunday with 
great success. So great, in 
fact, that we ended up 
painting all the poles on 
our street that same day. 
I really wasn’t prepared 
for that outcome, but 
one neighbour in her 70s 
showed up ready to get 
going! So we brought out 
whatever paints we had 
from past household 
projects and a friend ran 
down to [a hardware store] 
for a couple primary colors 
and an off-tint – and voila!

“I struggle with 
health challenges to 
do my own 
gardening, so it was 
just really heartening 
for me to see the 
offers of support, 
and assistance should 
I ever need it. It just 
has me feeling much 
more connected with 
my fellow Vic Westians.

GATHERINGS & CELEBRATIONS: 

These were events designed to begin to nurture social cohesion through 
celebratory get-togethers. Activities included block parties, street potlucks and 
celebrations, outdoor street hockey tournaments, and pancake breakfasts that 
brought neighbours together to create a vision for their block. 
SHARED SPACES & PLACES: 
Some projects that emerged from initial neighbour gatherings included street 
beautification and murals, garden sharing, free mini-libraries (book-boxes), and 
community benches that created “bumping space” for neighbours to encounter 
each other and connect.
14
SHARING AND THE LOCAL ECONOMY: 
Many neighbours developed opportunities for more sharing between neighbours, 
such as regular meal sharing and sharing of tools, gardens, and even cooperatively 
owned backyard chickens. Others came together with a focus on the local 
economy, and started a bulk food-buying club, collectively purchased products 
to improve home energy efficiency, or hosted street-wide garage sales. 
PEER LEARNING & ACTION: 
These were typically more ambitious projects to build local self-reliance through focused 
learning and action. For example, one group of neighbours participated in the 
“Transition Streets” program – nine households worked through a series of modules on 
conservation issues such as food consumption, waste production and recycling, and 
household energy use. Results included five households installing heat pumps, four 
getting insulation upgrades, six putting in clotheslines, five installing low-flow toilets, and 
seven initiating composting.

“The Transitions Streets program 
had a very powerful impact on my 
street. Before the program 
neighbours would wave to one 
another but seldom reached out to 
talk to one another. Now we know 
each other so well that it feels more 
like a big family.  We often get 
together for work (and play) 
parties to help one another with 
projects and events. We also 
support each other with house/pet 
sitting, sharing gardens/harvests, 
sharing tools, repairing equipment, 
figuring out how to vote and a host 
of more trivial things. Transition 
Streets has transformed my street 
into the type of community that 
can deal with anything, 
good or bad.”

“Even people who did 
not attend have been friendlier, 
as they now know our name and 
where we live. There are now 
more conversations on the street 
and less [invasive] ivy in the park. 
There is  garden produce being 
shared and more greetings being 
called out as people drive or ride 
by. Now we are at work planning 
a bee-friendly garden to 
occupy an empty lot.”

“We had our first Food Buyers meeting 
today thanks to the $40 [Resilient Streets] 
grant – thanks so much for kick-starting 
the action. WOW, what started as ‘let’s 
buy organic food together to share costs’ 
exploded into so many other offerings of 
sharing support… chicken coop, carpool to 
local farms to support local farmers and 
buy local food, pet sitting, seed sharing, 
yard sharing, home-grown food swapping, 
street canning parties…. and the food 
buying group of course!” 
	
 – Vic West Resilient  Streets Champion 
(Food Buying)
“Now that people 
know each other, conversations can 
happen more easily. I set out just 
wanting to get to know a few more 
faces on the street. I think this is 
the first step to community building 
and resiliency. I didn’t have 
an agenda other than that; 
thinking that next year, now that 
we’ve taken this first step, would be 
a good time to introduce some 
topics of discussion such as 
resiliency, emergency preparedness, 
community involvement and 
support networks, etc.”

WHAT DID WE LEARN?
Our main learnings from our activi­
ties from 2012-16 can be grouped 
into three thematic areas. Essentially, 
these themes follow the trajectory 
of people’s involvement in building 
resilience: We learned about what it is 
that makes citizens and organizational 
representatives become interested 
and more involved in building resil­
ience, what helps keep them engaged 
and taking action, and what helps 
them sustain their resilience efforts.
These themes themselves reflect one 
of our most important learnings from 
all of our work. Our “Characteristics 
of a Resilient Neighbourhood or 
Community” checklist divided resilience 
into four dimensions: Attitudes and 
Values; Infrastrutures and Resources 
(Natural and Built Environments); 
Local Economy; Community-wide 
Leadership, Engagement and Planning. 
While these are important dimensions 
of resilience, what we found is that 
ultimately all of these were in an 
important way secondary to an 
overarching factor: the social capital 
and networks borne of trusting, 
dynamic interpersonal and profes­
sional relationships. This theme, more 
than any other, is the underlying 
thread that weaves together all of our 
other learnings.
What Inspires and Helps Us to Connect and 
Become Involved in Building Resilience? 
WHAT DID WE LEARN?
Strengthening connections 
to place strengthens interest 
in building resilience.
A sense of connection to the people 
and places where we live is central to 
building resilience. Yet in the 
neighbourhoods and municipalities 
where we were involved, we found that 
most people lived in one neighbourhood, 
worked in another neighbourhood, and 
shopped in yet another. 
The communications media with which 
they regularly engaged, such as television, 
radio, email, periodicals, social media 
and the web were often not very con­
nected to their neighbourhood or even 
to their broader communities. This was 
mirrored at the sectoral level: Many 
organizations, businesses and groups 
that were active in a particular 
neighbourhood were not specifically 
neighbourhood-focused in their mis­
sions or activities, and indeed often 
had few direct personal or professional 
involvements with their immediate 
neighbours.
This situation is of course common in 
modern urban areas, but it produced 
important learnings for us. First, it was 
difficult to utilize media to connect with 
people in specific neighbourhoods, or 
for neighbours or organizations to 
learn about and connect with each 
other through these mediums. Sec­
ond, these communications challenges 
sometimes undermined people’s already 
eroding “sense of place.”
Conversely, through our work we found 
that, as people “made an investment” 
of their time in getting to know each 
other and their neighbourhood better, 
this in turn deepened their sense of 
place and neighbourhood identity, and 
strengthened their appreciation for it. 
17
We also saw that people were drawn 
to taking action to enhance that sense 
of place, by taking on projects that 
enhanced neighbourhood design, 
such as creating “bumping spaces” for 
spontaneous encounters. People also 
took action to bridge gaps between 
the differing types or depths of con­
nection to place often experienced 
by more transient renters, owners of 
single-family dwellings, or owners of 
condominiums in the neighbourhood.
Crossing interpersonal 
barriers and creating 
space for relationships is 
challenging but exciting 
– and key to resilience 
building.
The social fragmentation that is common 
in modern urban areas, we learned, has 
for some people contributed to creating 
anxiety in relation to interpersonal 
connecting with their neighbours. 
In short, many of our participants told 
us that they felt uncomfortable simply 
knocking on the doors of strangers, 
or calling up local businesses or 
organizations simply to “connect”. 
For citizens, we heard that our Resilient 
Streets Toolkit (with sample projects, 
handbill invitations for neighbours, 
posters etc.) and micro-grants helped 
people overcome this anxiety by pro­
viding them with a small, extra sense 
of professionalism, legitimacy and 
purpose. When we brought Resilient 
Streets leaders together, we again 
heard this theme that people were 
deeply appreciative just to be given this 
loosely guided opportunity to connect. 
Similarly, in our regional workshop 
series we heard frequently that people 
were grateful to be provided with a 
space to meet and talk with others 
about resilience building.
And finally, participants in the RNRT 
told us that BRN’s role as an outside 
facilitator steering meetings with a 
flexible resilience-building agenda 
helped move the group forward until 
they started experiencing for them­
selves the significant rewards of 
networking and collaborating on 
neighbourhood initiatives. 
In essence, we repeatedly found that 
all of the circumstantial impediments to 
interpersonal and inter-organizational 
connecting actually provided significant 
opportunities for resilience building. 
This was the case because, for many 
people, this context had created a 
yearning for greater connection and 
belonging that simply needed a small 
amount of support and encourage­
ment to become activated.
We observed that multi-family buildings 
such as apartments and condominiums, 
however, posed more significant 
challenges for people to overcome, 
because their design structures often 
restricted communications from outside 
parties and did not always support 
spontaneous encounters between their 
inhabitants. Our research also revealed 
that more work could be done to 
develop resilience-building project 
ideas that are appropriate for people 
living in apartments and condominiums, 
especially since these can often house 
the majority of inhabitants in 
urban areas.
 “It’s easier 
than it seems to 
just do it, to just 
get out there and 
talk to people and 
make something 
happen. People 
want to 
be a part of 
community and to 
be invited.”

WHAT DID WE LEARN?

Engage diversity through the 
head, heart and hands: It’s 
vital to meet people “where 
they are at” by working at 
multiple scales with guides, 
examples, tools and resourc­
es to support different ideas 
and interests.
We heard that many people felt extremely 
concerned, but also easily overwhelmed 
and powerless in the face of social, 
environmental and economic challenges. 
In that context, at the street, neighbour­
hood and regional levels, we consistently 
found that practical, solutions-focused, 
highly-localizable examples and resources 
for building resilience inspired people. 
Some were more motivated to prepare 
for large-scale threats in the future, while 
others were more motivated to construc­
tively and positively re-shape the present 
in small but important ways. In essence, 
though, many people were deeply drawn 
to resilience-building because the 
approach helped shape both big-picture 
and small-scale solutions with both the 
short and long-term view in mind.
By working at multiple scales – household, 
street, neighbourhood-wide, municipality-
wide, and regionally – we were able to 
engage a greater diversity of people in 
resilience building. Some were drawn 
to activities at the household or street 
levels, while others were more engaged 
by neighbourhood-wide initiatives;  some 
were interested in social cohesion while 
others were concerned about food or 
water issues. People liked to be able to get 
involved through activities that engaged 
either their head (e.g. learning about 
resilience capacities), hands (e.g. taking 
action on small-scale resilience projects) 
or heart (e.g. developing relationships 
and strengthening social connections). 
It became clear that having opportunities 
for a range of activity options at different 
scales – meeting people where they are – 
is vital to building resilience.

Become Involved in Building Resilience cont’d
What Motivates Collective Action 
for Resilience Building? 
It is valuable to assess local 
resilience to help optimize 
limited resources – but the 
timing and scope of the as­
sessment should be adjusted 
for the situation. 
In our neighbourhood-wide and municipal-
wide resilience building efforts, we started 
with the assumption that it was important 
for residents, groups and organizations 
to have a picture of current resilience 
strengths and vulnerabilities in order to 
set priorities and develop an action plan 
for enhancing resilience capacity. The  
unplanned, fortuitous opportunity to 
conduct different resilience assessment 
processes in the neighbourhood of Vic 
West and in the Township of Esquimalt 
contributed to our learning about how 
to approach resilience assessment 
moving forward.
In the initial stages of our efforts in Vic 
West, we spent significant time and 
resources in conducting interviews, surveys, 
an assembly, a statistical study, and other 
analyses to create a “Resilience Snapshot” 
19
that successfully identified key resilience 
strengths and vulnerabilities in the neigh­
bourhood. We believed that this would 
help people prioritize actions and optimize 
the use of limited resources for creating 
resilience. 
However, we found that the Snapshot 
had more limited effects on galvanizing 
action on specific priorities than we initially 
anticipated. (So far, at least – the Vic West 
RNRT and many Resilient Streets continue 
as of this writing). The people involved in 
Resilient Streets or who participated in the 
RNRT took the Snapshot into consider­
ation, but in the end it appeared that many 
preferred to decide for themselves what 
the priorities for action would be, based on 
their own and their shared interests, skills, 
energies, and financial resources.
We concluded that the scope and 
comprehensiveness of a resilience assess­
ment should be adjusted for the situation 
– ideally, the people taking leadership on 
priorities themselves determine what kind 
or scope of assessment is needed to help 
guide them. In addition, building robust 
community engagement processes into 
the analysis and action-planning phases 
after an assessment is critical. Participants 
need to set aside sufficient time to consider 
what data they will seek, how they will 
analyze that data, and who will be en­
gaged in what ways to evaluate, rank and 
take action together on the resilience 
priorities that emerge. Choosing the 
“right-for-you” resilience assessment, 
community engagement, and action-
planning processes can assist in building 
the relationships between citizens, leaders 
or organizations that will be essential for 
taking action later.

The Building Resilient Neighbourhoods Project is a partnership between the Community Social Planning Council and Transition Victoria. 
The project has been generously supported by the Victoria Foundation, Vancouver Foundation, City of Victoria, and the 
District of Saanich and has been developed with the collaboration of the Centre for Community Renewal, BC Healthy Communities, 
and the Fraser Basin Council’s  Smart Planning for Communities program.

WHAT DID WE LEARN?
CASE STUDY 1:  The Vic West 
resilience assessment process 
was intended to engage citizens and 
organization/group stakeholders in 
thinking about resilience strengths and 
vulnerabilities in their neighbourhood, 
help guide the setting of priorities, and 
galvanize action.
We found that the statistical research, 
questionnaires, on-line surveys, and 
in-person interviews conducted over 
several months were labour- and time-
intensive. While the efforts did yield a 
significant amount of new data for the 
Resilience Snapshot, during discussion at 
the Resilience Assembly several important 
concerns were raised. Some felt that 
the number of responses was not large 
enough to allow for robust interpreta­
tions. (We had obtained 179 completed 
surveys, representing about 3% of the 
approximate 6,000 population.) And 
due to the extent of the focus in our data 
gathering on subjective “perceptual” 
indicators (where people reported on their 
personal perceptions of the neighbour­
hood’s resilience strengths and vulnerabili­
ties), the consequent “objective” validity or 
meaning of certain results was debated. 
Finally, attempts to order the emerging 
priorities in an action plan were hampered 
by a need to collectively take much more 
time to first establish the criteria for 
evaluating and ranking those priorities 
(e.g. Would we rank a resilience priority 
higher if it was more laudable, or more 
feasible? Or if it affected a large number 
of people in small ways, or a small 
number of people in large ways?)
Later, the Vic West RNRT was formed with 
the intention of creating a multi-sector,  
comprehensive, collaborative group that 
could give leadership and take action 
on some of the priorities identified. 
While we imagined the RNRT would 
quickly select a priority to act upon, 
participants instead requested time to 
learn more about each other and about 
the activities of their respective organi­
zations and groups before taking on a 
large-scale project together. In the end, 
the actions the RNRT took on tended 
to reflect a dynamic combination of 
the priorities identified in the Resilience 
Snapshot and the particular interests, 
skills, resources and capacities of the 
various RNRT members.

The Link Between Resilience Assessment & Action: 
Two Case Studies 
WHAT DID WE LEARN?

for Resilience Building cont’d
CASE STUDY 2: In the Township of 
Esquimalt, a much less comprehensive 
and quicker Strengths, Weaknesses, 
Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) 
approach to assessing resilience got 
participants engaged in thinking about 
resilience in their community.
However, this approach was not robust 
enough or diverse enough to surface 
some of the underlying issues affecting 
community resilience. Projects selected 
at the planning workshop resulted 
from some residents having “energy” to 
take action on them, rather than from 
a deeper analysis of root causes and 
vulnerabilities. 
Later, informal discussions and subsequent 
meetings surfaced a particular, wide­
spread resilience vulnerability among 
organizations in the community, yet it 
became clear that no organization was 
ready or able to take leadership on that 
particular issue. 
We concluded that a quick assessment 
of resilience based on residents’ “gut 
sense” can be valuable, but only if there 
is a diverse enough base of partici­
pants and enough time to ensure that a 
shared understanding of the community 
emerges. 
In addition, as in Vic West, we learned 
that it is critically important for partici­
pating groups and organizations to feel 
a sense of ownership of the assessment 
process and priority setting, if they are 
the ones most likely to be responsible 
for taking leadership on priorities.
Out of these learnings, we revised our 
Characteristics of Neighbourhood and 
Community Resilience – A Checklist to 
outline a range of approaches to assess­
ing neighbourhood resilience. This tool 
now provides suggestions for both 
“light touch” and “deeper dive” 
assessment activities. 
21
WHAT DID WE LEARN?
Convening and “secretariat” 
support can be light, but 
may be vital to keep  groups 
going. 
We observed that optimally facilitating 
the Resilient Neighbourhood Resource 
Table (RNRT) required substantive 
BRN staff time – more than a volunteer 
could reasonably take on in most 
circumstances. 
We also heard from participants that 
having an external, neutral partner 
providing some “light touch” leadership, 
guidance and administrative support to 
the group was valuable. 
As with many neighbourhood collectives, 
the RNRT was made up of volunteer 
leaders (representing less formal or 
grassroots community groups) as well as 
organizational representatives who were 
able to participate as part of their paid 
staff positions and/or were able to 
contribute financially in support of 
particular activities. In this context, it 
was identified as a valuable contribution 
to the group dynamics to have BRN as 
an external, neutral partner helping in 
different ways to “balance” participation 
and influence in ongoing ways.
The multiplying value of 
social connectedness and 
network capital rapidly 
becomes visible, and 
self-reinforcing.
We did not have to persuade people 
about the value of meeting others, 
networking and collaborating to build 
community and neighbourhood 
resilience. Whether thinking at the level 
of the street, neighbourhood or region, 
most people not only understood that 
the “sum can be greater than its parts”, 
but yearned to activate the social and 
network capital and resilience potential 
of collaboration. Relationships and trust 
were key to activating these collabora­
tions, and those relationships could be 
built either by taking time to get 
to know each other (and/or to learn 
about each other’s organizations), or 
through the experience of successfully 
accomplishing things together.
Resilient Streets groups were more likely 
to continue collaborating after their 
initial meeting or project micro-grant 
if the people had developed shared 
interests and felt excited about being 
together – this basic social cohesion 
spontaneously led to more shared 
projects. Similarly, at the RNRT, we found 
that participants valued time spent at 
meetings updating each other and 
networking, and that many small, 
spontaneous shared projects emerged 
when participants realized that they could 
help each other in relatively easy ways by 
sharing resources, skills, tools etc. 
When the RNRT successfully executed a 
large-scale project – the Vic West Street 
Fest – this deepened the participants’ 
trust in each other and further inspired 
them about the possibilities of 
continuing the RNRT. 
22
“You held the RNRT 
together, provided 
structure and 
consistency. Allowed the 
RNRT the time to 
establish a project 
without judging or too 
much guidance – just 
enough to keep 
everyone going and 
aware of time 
passing. 
By facilitating the 
meetings, sending out 
email notices and 
reminders, you kept 
the RNRT on track, 
so now there is a 
concrete example 
(Vic West Street Fest) 
of what a diverse group 
of neighbours can 
accomplish.”

Creative and artistic 
approaches provide 
opportunities for learning 
and can revitalize resilience 
champions and leaders.
One of the most important learnings 
from our “Laughing Allowed!—The Slap­
stick World of Neighbourhood 
Activism” theatre project (see page 8) 
came clear during the post-show 
discussion with the audience. We heard 
that many members of the audience 
watching the show had experienced 
precisely what the performers of the 
show had experienced while developing 
it: They felt invigorated and revitalized by 
seeing familiar tropes, vulnerabilities, 
contradictions and challenges of 
neighbourhood 
engagement reflected 
and examined in 
humorous ways. Some 
remarked on the value 
of art and humour for 
helping people openly 
discuss challenging 
topics that often 
remain unspoken or 
under the surface. 
They said that they 
wished more of this 
kind of light-hearted 
creativity would infuse 
their ordinary 
community work. 
(One participant from 
the show later did 
indeed take clown 
noses to give to 
everyone to wear at a 
community meeting.) 
It was an important reminder that a 
constant focus on “getting to the goal” 
can reduce the time and space for 
shared reflecting and self-questioning, 
which ultimately can restrict shared 
learning and group creativity and in­
novation – important underpinnings 
of resilient communities. 
Ongoing learning 
contributes in important 
ways to building 
resilience.
A characteristic of resilient communities 
is that they are open to learning and 
innovation in ongoing, adaptive ways 
– and we saw abundant evidence of 
that. The more eager that people were 
to discover, learn and 
experiment, the more 
likely that they could

Especially for groups 
that were collaborat­
ing together over time 
in more serious ways, 
it was often a helpful 
reminder for everyone 
that a primary aspect 
of building resilience is 
to learn how to build 
resilience together, 
i.e. that building 
resilience is not only 
about the goal but also 
the process, and any 
arising difficult situation 
is in fact the next great 
learning opportunity.

the fact that you guys

so forth. You actually 
put a little humour into it. 

You made me feel better 
about the parts that suck!”

How Do We Transition Towards 
Sustaining Resilience Capacity Over Time?
Working comprehensively, at multiple-scales, and across 
sectors, is key for strengtening neighbourhood resilience.
WHAT DID WE LEARN?
The Resilient Streets program inspired 
people to give leadership, gather 
neighbours, and take action. Successful 
Resilient Streets in turn inspired others 
and created motivation and energy for 
replication, and thereby created 
opportunities for scaling. In this small 
pilot phase, we did not get enough 
Resilient Streets going in a concentrated 
area to discover what would happen 
if they began to overlap and link up, 
but strategic support for such an effort 
looks as though it holds great promise.
The RNRT, as an example of a 
structure supporting cross-sector 
collaboration and networking, similarly 
showed potential for incorporating more 
participants and expanding its resilience 
reach and impacts. It became very 
evident to us that comprehensive, cross-
sectoral approaches that strengthen 
social networks across neighbourhood 
groups and organizations is a critical 
foundation for resilience. One factor 
crucial to the continuation of the RNRT 
was that some of the participating 
organizations developed a sense of 
ownership and commitment to the RNRT. 
However, we observed two important 
limitations that may affect the potential to 
grow and expand its resilience building. 
First, many sectors that are important for 
resilience may not be represented in a 
particular neighbourhood. Second, the 
particular neighbourhood is not neces­
sarily central to the mandates of many 
of the sectors that may be represented 
there (e.g. a social service organization 
may have a mandate to support children 
and families, but not neighbourhood 
community-building more broadly.) 
These two factors can create key sector 
gaps at the RNRT as well as place limits 
on the contributions or capacities of the 
participants. Expanding the reach and 
impact of these kinds of multi-sector 
tables ultimately may require 
strategically expanding beyond the 
neighbourhood level, while not losing 
the central focus on place and 
neighbourhood identity.
In both Esquimalt and Vic West, we saw 
that both simple and extensive resilience 
assessment processes quickly brought a 
broader range of important issues 
forward which were 
often not included in 
traditional planning, 
such as resource usage, 
local business owner­
ship, and community 
leadership and volun­
teering. However, we 
also observed that, while 
resilience is a powerful 
lens for neighbourhood 
and community leaders 
to view their community, 
“building resilience” is a 
longer-term, more complex proposition 
than the more typical project-by-project 
approach to community building. The 
focus on capacity building can also be 
daunting; many of us tend to be more 
comfortable building with bricks and 
mortar than we are engaging with each 
other around, for example, attitudes 
and leadership skills. And without an 
immediate emergency 
or similar “pressure” 
driving people, it can be 
difficult to generate the 
commitments neces­
sary for developing 
relationships that may 
only become essential 
much later. For all of 
these same reasons, 
though, the resilience 
lens provides important 
opportunities for 
inspiring new discussions 
and galvanizing new approaches.
The resilience lens can add value when moving beyond 
traditional neighbourhood and community planning.
Organizational leadership can be a critical element of long-
term resilience – but leadership can be shared.
25
WHAT DID WE LEARN?
From the outset of our work in Esquimalt 
and Vic West, we believed that the 
emergence of organizational leadership 
would be essential for sustaining resilience 
efforts over the long term. In Esquimalt, 
we saw how the lack of any single 
organization with the resources, mandate, 
and sense of ownership of the resilience 
agenda hindered continuation of the 
work that had been started. In Vic West, 
however, a different process unfolded. 
Specific organizations “anteed up” with 
significant contributions to help sustain 
the RNRT activities, and that spurred 
contributions from other organizations at 
the table. A shared ownership and shared 
leadership approach emerged, and the 
RNRT was then able to continue without 
any further BRN involvement.
SUMMARY: The Building Resilient 
Neighbourhoods Principles
Work comprehensively, at multiple-
scales, and across sectors: While 
nurturing specific, small-scale (e.g. street 
level) projects that build social cohesion 
and address immediate issues, work to 
facilitate connections and cross-sector 
collaborations both within and outside 
neighbourhoods. This approach fosters 
the internal and external connections 
that neighbourhoods need, and also 
begins the process of building city and 
region-wide connections grounded in 
shared interests. 
Encourage both the short and long-
term view: Foster quick-action projects 
at the household, street and block level, 
while also supporting the longer-term 
work of neighbourhood-wide, 
comprehensive planning and action.
Provide inspiring examples of change 
to create hope and motivate action: 
Many people feel daunted by the pros­
pect of trying to bring about meaningful 
change, so it can be helpful and 
inspiring to draw on a myriad of 
varied examples, big and small, of 
people successfully working together 
to create resilience in neighbourhoods 
and communities.
Being open to 
deeper, stronger 
social connections 
with each other 
and with the 
places we share.
 Doing through 
action in small-scale 
projects.
Learning together 
and developing 
the capacities 
that drive 
resilience building.

WHAT DID WE LEARN?
Work 
Comprehensively
Encourage
Inspire
Over the course of four years of experiments, explorations and discussions with neigh­
bourhood champions, organizational collaborators, and many other participants, we 
have gradually condensed and digested all of our learnings into a set of principles. 
These principles now guide all of our efforts at building neighbourhood resilience

Assess local resilience to optimize 
limited resources: Use the characteristics 
of resilience as a guide for helping neigh­
bourhoods assess their resilience strengths 
and vulnerabilities at the level of detail and 
complexity that is right for their circum­
stances. Encourage communities to invest 
their energy and resources where these 
will have the most positive impacts. 
Go beyond conventional planning: 
Focusing on resilience can help com­
munities consider a broader range of 
important issues that are often not 
included in traditional planning, such as 
resource usage, local business owner­
ship, and social determinants of health 
and well-being. The resilience lens can be 
valuable to draw attention to the capacity 
side of the equation: the leadership, skills, 
and attitudes needed to work successfully 
in this complex environment. 

Constant learning and innovation are 
key aspects of resilience. An informal 
developmental evaluation approach that 
includes team learning and reflection 
processes, and reflective processes at 
meetings and gatherings can support 
building this critical “resilience muscle”.
Provide opportunities for people to 
engage in different ways: For a pro­
cess of resilience building to be 
successful, it must engage all interests 
of the community, including citizens, 
organizations, businesses and local lead­
ers. A more diverse range of people and 
organizations can be engaged by 
meeting people “where they are at” 
through a three-pronged approach of 
engaging the “head, hands and heart”.

WHERE ARE WE GOING?
In an effort to build on the successes of our work from 2012-16, and in light of our 
many learnings, Building Resilient Neighbourhoods will be taking action in the 
following areas in 2016-17: 
	
1)	
Expanding the Resilient Streets program across the City of Victoria.
	
2)	
Expanding on the theme of multiple entry points or meeting people 	
	
	
where they are, and also extending our own collaboration. We have 	
	
	
engaged representatives from the municipal government, and a 
	
	
diverse range of other organizations interested in fostering 
	
	
neighbour-to-neighbour connections on issues such as social 	 	
	
	
cohesion, emergency preparedness, and community safety. 
	
	
We all share a desire to strengthen social cohesion at the neighbour-
	
	
to-neighbour level, and there are opportunities for all of us to work 	
	
	
more effectively in collaboration. 
	
3)	
Expanding the Resilient Streets Toolkit with new modules, including 	
	
	
ideas for resilience activities that are appropriate for “Vertical Streets” 	
	
	
like apartments and condominiums.
