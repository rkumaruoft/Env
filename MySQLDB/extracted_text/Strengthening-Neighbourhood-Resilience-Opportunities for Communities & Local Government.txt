Strengthening Neighbourhood 
Resilience: Opportunities for 
Communities & Local Governments
This report highlights some of the 
research and approaches that have 
been explored and the lessons that 
have been emerging during the 
beginning phases of the Building 
Resilient Neighbourhoods project. This 
pilot project in BC’s Capital Regional 
District is working to support 
neighbourhood resilience today as a 
way to strengthen the cohesion and 
capacity of neighbourhoods to respond 
to climate, resource, and economic 
challenges in the future. 
The Building Resilient Neighbourhoods 
project is facilitated by four partner 
organizations: 
 
• Community Social Planning 
	
	 Council of Greater Victoria (CSPC)
 
• Transition Victoria, 
 
• Fraser Basin Council’s Smart Plan- 
	
	 ning for Communities Program 
 
• Canadian Centre for Community  
	
	 Renewal,
with funding support from the Victoria 
Foundation and Vancouver Foundation.

Understanding Resilience: 
What have we learned about the characteristics 
of resilient communities from our research and 
engagement processes so far? 
Characteristics of Resilience: 
What are some of the key characteristics of 
resilient communities, and what are some guiding 
or inspirational examples of resilience at the 
neighbourhood level that have been occurring 
here or elsewhere in the world? 
Building Resilience: 
What are some of the key roles that different 
sectors – such as local governments, non-profits, 
and citizen groups – can play in fostering 
resilient neighourhoods? 
This report overviews three key aspects of the project:

UNDERSTANDING RESILIENCE
What is Community 
Resilience?
Communities today face a complex 
range of social, environmental, 
and economic challenges. Many 
communities are seeing that new ways 
of addressing these challenges are 
needed, approaches which acknowledge 
the interrelated nature of these issues. 
A focus on “resilience” can provide 
that lens and framework. 
Resilience is our ability 
to respond and adapt to 
change in ways 
that are pro-active, 
that build local capacity, 
and that ensure essential 
needs are met. 
Along with creating the ability to respond 
to shocks and threats, resilience is 
about increasing a community’s 
capacity to respond 
pro-actively and 
enhance well-being 
even while under 
stress. A focus on 
resilience emphasizes 
the dynamic nature of 
communities and the fact that they 
are always changing.1
According to the 
Government of Australia, 
“Resilient 
communities 
have a high 
level of 
social capital. 
That is, 
mutual trust, 
social norms, 
participation & 
social networks. 
Resilient 
Communities 
also possess 
the necessary 
resources such 
as strengths 
and abilities, 
required to 
overcome 
vulnerabilities 
and adapt 
positively to 
change.”2

Communities today are faced with 
multiple, complex challenges – and the 
list is growing. Across the country, we 
are facing the effects of climate change, 
deteriorating infrastructure, population 
growth, and an aging population – 
all of which are putting pressure on 
provincial, regional, and community 
services and resources. There is growing 
debt at household, government and 
corporate levels, and wages are not 
keeping pace with the cost of living. 
The gap between the rich and the poor 
is becoming bigger, not smaller. 
Resilience is often taken to mean the 
ability of communities to respond and 
build back quickly after a disaster or 
crisis (e.g. storms, economic downturns 
etc.). Indeed it is this, but increasingly it 
is being recognized that for resilience 
to be effective, our thinking needs to 
include efforts to build stronger and 
more cohesive communities today, in 
ways that not only help us respond to 
crises but also ward off future threats. 
This means a focus on community 
building, addressing inequities that exist 
for vulnerable or marginalized groups, 
and strengthening social ties today, not 
just in response to emergencies.  
For local governments, this may 
require a new way of thinking about 
the relationships between communities 
Our natural resource base is diminishing 
and ecosystems are threatened.  
If ever there was a need for whole 
communities to come together to 
adapt to change, it is today.  Change 
is hard at the best of times, and even 
harder at the worst of times, so we 
need to start now to strengthen our 
resilience skills and approaches; to 
create new ways of living in harmony 
with the planet and each other.
and local and regional governments. 
According to one international group 
examining the policy challenges of 
community resilience, “by building on 
existing local relationships, using local 
knowledge and preparing for risks, your 
community will be better able to cope 
during and after an emergency. The 
challenge is… how central government 
can redefine and transform its role to 
be supportive of public engagement. 
Resilience… is not meant to justify a 
new round of social programs, even if 
they have more of an outreach focus. 
Rather, community resilience involves a 
philosophical shift in relations between 
the state and civil society that changes 
the parameters of how local 
communities organize and act”. 3

“Through this 
lens, resiliency 
recognizes that

(acute or chronic) 
city issue may 
not exist in 
isolating and 
fixing just that 
issue; rather the

Resilience can be considered as one“lens”, 
or way of looking at our communities. 
There are other lenses – and they 
are all useful or important in different 
ways. For example, a sustainability lens 
can help us consider if our social and 
economic lives are in balance with 
the limits of nature.  An asset lens, or 
appreciative-inquiry lens, can help us 
view things from 
the perspective of 
our strengths and 
what is working 
well.  A city planner’s 
lens might focus 
on ensuring land 
use and zoning is 
in sync with 
long-term 
community 
development 
needs.  Many 
people in 
different roles use 
different lenses 
to help consider 
situations and 
strengthen 
communities 
from different 
perspectives. 
The resilience 
lens can help us 
strengthen our ability to act 
pro-actively, collectively, and in 
ways that increase our ability to 
adapt or respond successfully in 
the face of multiple trends or threats. 
Using a Resilience Lens
The resilience framework is based on 
the idea that communities are com­
plex systems. It challenges us to 
look at our communities and 
neighbourhoods holistically, and move 
beyond sector-specific strategies 
which often attract a limited segment 
of the population. Instead, a resilience 
lens encourages us to consider the 
interconnections 
between com­
munity issues and 
systems, and to 
focus on long-
term adaptive 
capacity that cuts 
across silos. 
This lens can 
help expand 
participation as 
we work to 
activate local 
institutions and 
social capital in 
ways that appeal 
to a wide range 
of interests of 
citizens from all 
walks of life. This 
kind of socially 
diverse 
cohesiveness 
helps meet 
challenges 
now, and 
in the 
future.

town as ‘resilient’ 
because it was able 
to build back after 
a natural disaster, 
even though other 
factors, such as 
poverty or income 
inequality might 
remain the same or 
even worsen during 
the same period?

The Building Resilient Neighbourhoods 
project focuses at the neighbourhood 
scale because of our interest in 
supporting comprehensive, place-
based change in an urban setting. 
By using a “place-based” rather than 
“issue-based approach”, the project 
supports people and groups in 
neighbourhoods to build resilience at 
the local level. 



Our focus on neighbourhoods stems 
from a growing movement recognizing 
that solutions and strategies to many of 
the global issues we face – such as 
reducing fossil fuel consumption – 
can be best found at the local level. 
A neighbourhood focus emphasizes 
people’s connection to place, and 
provides a manageable scale where 
people can often see first-hand the 
impacts of their actions. In this way, 
the neighbourhood scale often 
engages and excites people by 
demonstrating that change at this 
level is far-reaching, yet feasible. 
REFLECTIONS – 
WHAT WE ARE 
LEARNING:
Throughout the learning sessions 
hosted by Building Resilient 
Neighbourhoods in 2012-13, one 
theme that emerged from 
participants is the importance of 
comprehensive approaches to 
neighbourhood and community 
building. Participants identified that 
comprehensive approaches are 
often missing. We heard that bet­
ter and more frequent connecting 
across issues or sectors such as food 
security, renewable energy, 
affordable housing, and 
community social cohesion, with 
a goal of fostering collaboration 
through a resilience lens, is 
something many communities 
recognize as a key need. 
A comprehensive approach draws 
attention to the cross-sectoral, 
foundational challenges to neigh­
bourhood resilience, such as the 
importance of community-con­
trolled finance (economy), 
community-controlled land and 
buildings (infrastructure), and the 
importance of local decision making 
and control. 
In the workshops, almost all the focus 
groups independently arrived at plans 
to do cross-sectoral projects, seeing 
such work as an important and 
valuable priority that resonated with 
everyone’s interests and needs.

Neighbourhood Approach

While the characteristics to the right are 
organized based on these four 
dimensions of resilience, it should be 
noted that these dimensions are often 
inter-connected. Activities at the 
community or neighbourhood level, 
and many of the examples provided, 
will often address more than one di­
mension of resilience.  It is also 
important to note that resilience 
changes over time,  and that it can be 
strengthened – the characteristics are 
not fixed.  Part of this process is to help 
communities assess their resilience 
strengths and weaknesses and then 
create a strategy to fortify areas where 
they need to be more resilient.   
8
One of the cornerstones of building 
more resilient communities and 
neighbourhoods is fostering greater 
collaboration across sectors and 
between residents, organizations, and 
local governments. Within the 
collaborative process of strengthening 
resilience, each sector brings a 
different sphere of influence and set of 
“tools” they can offer. For example, local 
governments have a key role to play 
in creating enabling policy frameworks 
and tools. Community organizations 
can provide services, facilities, and 
programs, and facilitate engagement 
processes. Residents may foster lead­
ership, energy, and relationships that 
are fundamental to community life. 
In each dimension of resilience listed 
in this document, we provide some 
ideas of the different roles each group 
can play, or tools they can draw on, to 
help build more resilient neighbour­
hoods and communities. These 
are not intended to provide a 
comprehensive list, but rather starting 
places for consideration and spurs to 
creative problem-solving.
CHARACTERISTICS OF 
RESILIENT NEIGHBOURHOODS
Each community or neighbourhood is 
unique, and there is no fixed “recipe” 
for building community resilience. 
However, while the context and process 
for strengthening resilience will vary for 
each community, we do know from 
existing research that resilient communities 
demonstrate common characteristics. 
The Building Resilient Neighbourhoods 
project has drawn on research originally 
conducted by the Canadian Centre for 
Community Renewal to identify 
characteristics of resilient neighbourhoods 
along four dimensions: 
positive attitudes and values; 
proactive and ongoing leader­
ship development and plan­
ning; a localized economy, 
and a high degree of local 
access to and collective own­
ership of resources and assets.

Attitudes & Values
Resilient Neighbourhoods Attitudes & Values
When we think about assets within a 
community or neighbourhood, we 
often first think of the physical resources 
or infrastructure that exists. These 
physical resources play an important 
role in affecting community resilience; 
however, there are also many other 
less tangible assets that make one 
neighbourhood distinct from another. 
The attitudes, behaviours, and values 
of residents affect the neighbourhood 
“culture” or the “the way things are 
done around here.” These attitudes and 
values greatly influence a community 
or neighbourhood’s resilience, as does 
the social infrastructure of communities, 
including relationships between 
community members, levels of trust, 
and informal networks. Some of the 
key characteristics of resilient neigh­
bourhoods include these less tangible 
aspects of community life such as 
connection between neighbours, 
residents’ sense of belonging and 
identity, respect for diversity and 
inclusion, and neighbourhood attitudes.
EXAMPLES MIGHT INCLUDE 
• There is evidence of care for public spaces
• Public celebrations/events are well attended
• Citizens support each other
• Citizen work parties are common
• Identified needs tend to get addressed 
• There is not much “blaming” that goes on
• People in the neighbourhood help 
	
each other 
• People show support for those less 
	
fortunate
• Volunteerism is strong
• A range of formal and informal work-
	
shops are offered and well attended
• There is inter-generational skills transfer
• Labour market opportunities have been 
 
identified
• There is support for recycling, waste 
	
reduction, compost
• Water conservation is evident
• Energy conservation is evident
• There is welcoming and integration of 
	
new comers
• Organizations intentionally reach out to 
	
those at the margins (disabled, youth, 
	
isolated seniors)
• An openness to new ideas is common
CHARACTERISTICS:
There is a sense of respect, or positive 
regard, for each other and the 
neighbourhood
The neighbourhood has a “can do” 
attitude and gets things done


There is a spirit of mutual assistance



There is support for learning and skills 
development at all levels


Citizens demonstrate respect for 
ecological limits

The neighbourhood values diversity 
and is inclusive of all populations and 
perspectives
Some of the key 
characteristics 
of resilient 
neighbourhoods 
include these less 
tangible aspects of 
community life such 
as connection 
between 
neighbours, 
residents’ sense 
of belonging and 
identity, respect for 
diversity and 
inclusion, and 
neighbourhood 
attitudes.

REFLECTIONS - 
WHAT WE ARE 
EXPLORING:
Throughout our work on the 
Building Resilient Neighbourhoods 
project, we have seen a strong 
interest in developing new ways 
to build a greater sense of connection 
and cohesion amongst neigbours. 
One growing area of activity that 
we are witnessing is street or 
block-level activities that promote 
relationship-building between 
neighbours. These activities are 
often informal and encompass 
elements of fun and socializing 
such as block parties and 
community dinners. 
Many neighbours are getting 
together to create infrastructure 
that promotes sharing between 
neighbours such as book boxes, 
tool sharing, or garden sharing. 
Using social activity as a starting 
place, some blocks are getting 
together through “parties with 
a purpose” to explore issues of 
common concern such as energy 
efficiency or food security.
Transition Streets
Social Capital
Coming out of the Transition Towns 
movement, Transition Streets is an 
opportunity for groups of neighbours to 
come together to look at how to save 
money and reduce energy and resource 
use.  Working together over a period 
of several months, the group explores 
five topics related to building resilience 
through a guided curriculum: local food, 
water use, energy use, transportation, 
and waste/consumption. Individuals and 
their families then identify the actions 
they wish to take in each area.
A group of neighbours on McKaskill 
Street in Victoria, British Columbia 
participated in a Transition Streets pilot. 
While the group achieved significant 
energy reduction goals, the project 
also had a number of unanticipated 
benefits in terms of building 
relationships amongst neighbours. 
One of the leaders of this group 
mentioned that he had lived on the 
block for fifteen years and, though he 
knew his neighbours’ enough to say 
hello, he never had something 
concrete to engage them with. When 
he saw the Transition Streets project, 
this gave him the courage and the 
reason to go around and talk to his 
neighbours. From there, so much 
more has happened. 
Here are some of the 
results from the McCaskill 
Transition Street pilot with 
eight households:
• four household energy  

 audits leading to two 
 new  heat pumps and 
 improved insulation
• one household obtaining 
 a low-flow toilet, a new 
 shower head, and a rain 
	 barrel
•  different habits for 
 washer, dryer, and dish
 washer use
•  more bike and bus riding
•  more gardening and local  
 food buying, and a group  
 seafood purchase
•  tool sharing and skill  
 
	 sharing/teaching
•  a new sense of community 
 on a street where no one   
 knew each other before!

One key indicator of resilient communities and neighbourhoods is the level of 
“social capital” that exists. In their Exploring Community Resilience handbook, the UK’s 
Fiery Spirits Community of Practice outlines three types of social capital identified 
by Tom Sanders:
Bonding capital is the close ties 
between people in similar situations – 
such as family and close friends. 
It builds trust, reciprocity, and a shared 
sense of belonging and identity.
Bridging capital is the looser ties to 
similar people, such as casual friends, 
colleagues, or people we meet 
through social networking sites. 
It builds broader, more flexible identi­
ties, and enables innovations to be 
shared across networks.
Linking capital helps ensure that 
people with different levels of power 
and status meet and learn from one 
another. It is the ability of groups to 
access networks of power and resources 
beyond their immediate community.

example
Physical infrastructure, community 
design, and our use of resources can 
support or thwart  neighbourhood 
resilience. Indoor and outdoor 
gathering spaces, density, and 
proximity of services to residential areas 
are all factors to consider in building 
resilient neighbourhoods. Physical 
infrastructure and community design 
are vital in encouraging other aspects 
of resilience such as community 
cohesion, pride, diversity, and 
collaboration. Involving the community 
in planning and designing local 
infrastructure can often be just as 
important as the facilities themselves by 
fostering engagement and leadership.
It is important to ensure that essential 
needs can be met close to home. 
Resilient neighbourhoods are aware of 
and working toward local access to 
food, affordable shelter for all 
residents, renewable energy, and 
reduced energy use. They understand 
how important it is to have ownership 
and control of these essential services as 
a means of reducing their vulnerability, 
and as potential sources of revenue. Of 
course, enhancing a neighbourhood’s 
food, shelter, and energy systems may 
often require working with community 
partners outside the neighbourhood, so 
resilient neighbourhoods seek and 
develop such external relationships as well.

REFLECTIONS - 
WHAT WE ARE 
EXPLORING:
People seem to like tangible 
projects like personal storm­
water recycling systems or 
backyard agriculture, and 
tend to gravitate to very 
small and household-level 
activities. This is good, but 
there is also a need to build 
the skills, knowledge, and 
relationships to enable 
larger-scale infrastructure 
projects such as neigh­
bourhood-wide renewable 
energy supplies, eco-friendly 
housing developments, 
food processing facilities, or 
trading hubs. We are curious 
about the relationships 
between micro or house­
hold-level infrastructure 
projects, and how they may 
support interest in and 
capacity for larger-scale 
efforts. We hope to explore 
what it takes, in terms of 
internal and external 
relationships across sectors, 
for households and 
neighbourhoods  to “scale 
up”  proven innovations 
from micro to macro.

POSSIBLE ROLES & TOOLS
The Fernwood Neighborhood Resource 
Group Society (Fernwood NRG) is a 
social enterprising, community-based 
non-profit organization that is 
democratically run by and for residents 
of the Fernwood neighbourhood in 
British Columbia’s Capital Region. 
Fernwood NRG works to improve 
the quality of life for people living in 
Fernwood by building neighbourhood 
capacity, providing affordable housing, 
and managing a suite of properties and 
buildings including the Fernwood 
Community Centre.
Today Fernwood is a vibrant, diverse 
and healthy community with a bustling 
centre. Fernwood square was recently 
recognized as one of the top five public 
spaces in Victoria by an award- winning 
national magazine, Spacing. However, 
before 2005, Fernwood was facing sig­
nificant challenges. These were height­
ened by civic action to ‘clean up’ 
downtown that forced illicit activities 
outward into neighbourhoods like 
Fernwood and North Park. The 
neighbourhood was also grappling 
with long-term under-investment by 
the municipality, contributing to 
neighbourhood decline. 
At the same time, the condition of 
another property in the community 
was causing concern. The Cornerstone 
Building, located in the very core of the 
neighbourhood, had fallen into 
significant disrepair and was contributing 
to the overall rate of decline in the area. 
While there was a general consensus 
in the community about the need to 
address the condition of the building, 
residents were divided about how to 
do so. In 2005, with a vision of creating 
a more environmentally and socially 
sustainable neighbourhood, a group 
of citizens coalesced around the idea 
that if they were to effect change in the 
neighbourhood, the solutions would 
need to be driven by the neighbour­
hood itself, and began negotiating for 
the building.  
This was the first step towards taking 
ownership and control of neighbour­
hood assets to address the needs 
of the community. Soon afterwards, 
neighbourhood residents got involved 
in work parties to demolish and 
renovate the Cornerstone building into 
a mixed-use development. Through 
this project they were able to turn an 
empty building into a thriving business 
hub, creating economic development 
opportunities and a space for citizen’s 
involvement in the community 
development process. Soon, other 
businesses started coming to the core, 
supporting each other and supporting 
people in Fernwood by providing 
employment and investment in the 
community.

Strengthening 
the Local Economy
A strong local economy is a foundation 
for a resilient community; however, in 
this sense, “strong” cannot be equated 
with dependency on foreign investment 
or constant growth without regard for 
ecological limits. Instead, resilience 
requires that we understand local 
economies in terms of community 
economic development and quality of 
life indicators; for example, increased 
tool sharing may be economically “bad” 
in the short-term for a franchise hard­
ware store located in a neighbourhood, 
but economically “good” over the long-
term for the neighbourhood overall. By 
focusing on increasing local control and 
ownership of key resources, businesses, 
and finance, communities are able to 
build their own resilience and decrease 
their vulnerability to external economic 
pressures. Part of what we have seen, in 
communities that have been able to 
adapt, is an emphasis on locally-owned 
businesses (as  opposed to externally-
owned businesses that are simply 
located locally), “shop local” education, 
and efforts to “plug the leaks” – to 
keep more local dollars re-circulating 
rather then going outside of the 
community. These ideas are often new 
for residents who have grown up with 
traditional top-down, constant-growth 
economic thinking, so it often takes 
time to educate and engage residents 
and organizations in the rationale and 
approaches of a “localized” economy 
that is closer to a “steady state”.   
In order to achieve this, it is important 
to pay attention to the core functions 
of an economy, with an eye to 
bolstering local control of resources 
against dependence on global or 
external credit and investment capital, 
human resource development, land 
and research, and planning services. 
“Economic 
resources 
include access 
to equity 
capital, credit, 
human capital 
and expertise. 
Developing lo­
cally-
controlled 
sources of 
finance and 
capital can help 
empower a 
community to 
build enterprise 
  and 
employment 
opportunities.”
Australian Social Inclusion 
Board, “Building Inclusive & 
Resilient Communities”



Strengthening the local economy 
is related to the “Infrastructure and 
Resources “ dimension insofar as local 
ownership and control of resources 
such as buildings, land, and finances 
are often key factors in economic 
resilience. Economic resilience is 
also connected to the “Planning and 
Leadership” dimension, since economic 
planning requires strategic thinking and 
implementation over longer periods 
of time. Developing short and long-
term strategic implementation plans to 
nurture economic resilience is an area 
where local governments can play an 
extremely important role; however, this 
would require incorporating cross-
sectoral consultations and a resilience 
lens into economic planning rather 
than letting plans be steered only by 
an established business sector using an 
economic-growth lens.

POSSIBLE ROLES & TOOLS
The Ainsworth Street Collective in 
Portland, Oregon is a great example 
of neighbours coming together to 
strengthen their local economy, while 
at the same time building relationships 
and social connections. The group, 
which started informally out of a 
potluck between neighbours, has 
grown to include ninety households. 
Neighbours gather for monthly social 
events which include informal exchanges 
where they share food and drinks, 
clothes, plants, and other household 
items through a “Freecycling” table. In 
addition to the monthly potlucks, there 
are also interest-specific subgroups that 
meet throughout the year, and the 
Collective has taken on many specific 
projects including wholesale food 
purchasing, a neighbourhood farmer’s 
market, neighbourhood recycling, and 
emergency preparedness.

In 2009, the T’Souke First Nation 
identified energy security and a sustain­
able future as top priorities for their 
community. Out of this visioning they 
developed an action plan based on 
four interrelated pillars: energy 
autonomy, food self-sufficiency, cultural 
renaissance, and economic development. 
Since then, nine band members have 
been trained as solar installers through 
a training program that builds on 
the oral traditions of the community, 
resulting in the installation of solar PV 
and solar thermal on many of the Band

One of the group’s goals was to create 
an economy at the neighbourhood 
level, encouraging buying from neigh­
bours first. To do this, they created the 
Ainsworth Street Business Directory 
which lists members’ services and skills. 
The Directory features pet, baby, and 
house sitters, a home repair person, 
a writer and copy editor, and even 
a Celtic Quartet.
To share their experience and lessons, 
the Ainsworth Street Collective has cre­
ated a neighbourhood handbook:

buildings, including the fish hatchery, 
the community hall, band hall, and 
canoe shed. In addition to meeting 
their own energy needs, T’Souke First 
Nation is able to sell surplus clean 
energy to BC Hydro, and they have 
partnered with a neighbouring 
municipality to install 1200 solar hot 
water heaters. They have developed a 
local eco-tourism industry with visitors 
from around the world visiting T’Souke 
for tours of solar installation, gardens, 
and T’Souke cultural activities.

Sangudo Investment 
Co-op
“Declining enrolment. Low property 
values. “For lease” signs in shop 
windows. These are such common 
sights in rural parts, it’s a relief to 
hear about a place that is beating 
the macro-trends. When the place is 
Sangudo, Alberta, it’s more than a relief 
– it’s astonishing. Sangudo’s 400 citizens 
didn’t wait for a town council, regional 
municipality, financial institution, or 
provincial or federal agency to take the 
lead. They took it themselves.”  Citizens 
in Sangudo, Alberta created a 
Community Investment Co-op by 
pooling resources and investing them 
in local projects to revitalize empty 
buildings and provide local services.  
They identified four keys to their 
successful local turnaround: community 
vision, trusted leadership, an economic 
strategy and being compelled by a 
wider agenda for change.

and Local Economies

As a result of 
Sangudo’s success, the 
province of Alberta 
has since supported 
five more similar pilot 
projects. 
In the Capital Region of BC, a group of 
citizens and organizations led by the 
Community Social Planning Council of 
Greater Victoria is drawing from the 
inspiration of Sangudo to create a local 
community investment fund to support 
affordable housing and community 
enterprise development.

POSSIBLE ROLES & TOOLS
REFLECTIONS – 
WHAT WE ARE 
EXPLORING:
Throughout the Building Resilient 
Neighbourhoods workshops, a 
common theme that emerged is 
the need to engage more of the 
community in resilience-building 
activities, and concerns about 
developing and diversifying 
community leadership. Many 
community champions are 
struggling with burn-out or 
feeling over-extended. This 
highlights a need to foster 
leadership that supports 
transitions toward greater 
sustainability and resilience in the 
places we live.  This includes a 
model of leadership that:
• meets others where they are 
	 and encourages participation 
	 across all segments of the 
	 population;
• shares power and builds con-
	 sensus around a common vision; 
• sees the big (systems) picture 
	 and also supports small-scale 
	 (e.g. household or street-level) 
	 projects as part of working 
	 toward whole systems change;
• works to connect people and 
	 organizations within and 
	 between the household, street, 
	 organization, institution, and 
	 city-wide scales; 
• engages and trains youth as a 
	 means of being pro-active 
	 about leadership succession 
	 planning.
The City of Seattle’s Department of 
Neighbourhoods has demonstrated 
commitment to cultivating neighbour­
hood leadership through the 
development of the People’s Academy 
for Engagement and Action (PACE). 
The goal of this leadership training 
program is to improve district and 
community council participation and to 
enhance involvement in other grassroots 
community organizations in Seattle. 
Part of the mission is to expand civic 
involvement by also building the 
capacity of people who work with 
underrepresented communities. 
The program targets emerging leaders 
(ages 21 and up) who are newly 
engaged in the community and would 
like to acquire the additional skills 
needed to be more effective when 
engaging Seattle neighbourhoods, 
including underrepresented communities. 
It includes a seven-session curriculum 
with specific focus on community 
organizing and how to work with and 
access local government. 
Other goals are to build 
participants capacity to:
Refine their 
organizing & 
communication skills
Increase their 
community and 
individual 
	
capacity to sustain 
	
vital neighborhoods
Identify resources and 
	
avenues to empower 
	
communities
Cultivate a deeper 
	
appreciation of 
cultural competency 
and inclusive 
civic engagement.

BUILDING RESILIENCE 
IN A NEIGHBOURHOOD 
While every initiative that builds neigh­
bourhood resilience is led by citizens 
and organizations together, these efforts 
can be supported through local or 
regional government programs. Here 
are some brief samplings of what some 
governments are doing to support 
comprehensive neighbourhood efforts.
examples
Manitoba 
Neighbourhoods 
Alive!
In Manitoba, the Neighbourhoods 
Alive! program supports “long-term, 
community-led, social and economic 
development” and neighbourhood 
revitalization  through a citizen and 
community-led approach to com­
munity planning and neighbourhood 
revitalization. The program supports 
targeted neighbourhoods through 
funding streams designed to support 
community development efforts in a 
range of areas, from housing, crime 
prevention, and education to training 
and community recreation. In June 
2012, this comprehensive place-based 
approach animated through Neigh­
bourhoods Alive! was brought into law 
through the passage of the Community 
Renewal Act. The act mandates the 
development of community renewal 
plans in consultation with residents, 
establishes a Community Renewal 
Advisory Committee made up of 
community-based stakeholders to 
provide advice on community renewal 
issues, and creates a Deputy Ministers’ 
Committee on Community Renewal to 
ensure ongoing support and high-level 
leadership on issues of community 
renewal.

equitable, sustainable, and livable 
neighbourhoods through cross-
departmental collaboration. The goals 
include delivering services in neigh­
bourhoods more efficiently, developing 
comprehensive neighbourhood 
planning, enhancing two-way 
communication with residents and 
supporting their efforts to create the 
place they want their neighbourhood 
to be, and investing in targeted capital 
projects. 
The program is supported through a

Development Strategy
The Portland Neighbourhood Economic 
Development Strategy articulates 
how community partners, business 
leadership and public partners can use 
focused neighbourhood-level actions 
to collectively foster economic 
opportunity and neighbourhood vitality. 
The goal of the strategy is to create 
thriving commercial areas, successful 
neighbourhood businesses, and 
equitable access to quality jobs. The 
related Neighborhood Prosperity 
Initiative supports neighbourhood 
vitality in six targeted urban renewal 
areas through a series of community 
planned and led actions, such as:   
 • Increase the visibility of the 
	 	 business district
 • Grow more jobs
 • Strengthen existing businesses
 • Fill vacant spaces
