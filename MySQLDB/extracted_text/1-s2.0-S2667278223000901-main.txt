Background: Climate change is one of the most signiﬁcant threats to human and planetary health. As trusted
sources, health professionals have a unique opportunity to help protect society from the impacts of climate
change by educating key publics including policymakers about solutions to climate change, as well as reduc-
ing their sector’s contribution to climate change by promoting sustainable practices in the workplace. Devel-
oping methods to activate health professionals as climate educators and advocates is an important step in
activating this opportunity. Drawing on the practice of behavioral journalism, this study tests the effective-
ness of role model stories at increasing attitudinal and behavioral engagement of health professionals with
sustainability.
Methods: Participants in this study (n = 39) were employees of a network of U.S. hospitals and urgent care
centers that were subscribed to a sustainability e-newsletter published by the healthcare system. Partici-
pants were randomly assigned to a control group that only received the regular newsletter, or a treatment
group that received an additional series of emails featuring stories about sustainability role models in their
healthcare system.
Results: We found that receiving the role model stories increased participant’s belief that health professionals
have a responsibility to support sustainability efforts and their willingness to receive more information about
joining a climate and health advocacy organization, although there were no between-group differences on
other dependent variables.
Conclusion: This study although limited by a small sample size provides evidence that role model stories can
play a role in activating healthcare professionals to participate in sustainability initiatives and advocate for
climate and health solutions.

1. Introduction
As climate change causes adverse impacts across many facets of
society, there is growing recognition of the signiﬁcant threat it
presents to human health. The most recent Lancet Countdown report
[1] underscores the effect climate change is already having on human
health. Among these are an increase in heat-related deaths, height-
ened spread of infectious diseases like malaria, and associated
economic effects as a result of those health impacts [1]. The Intergov-
ernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in their latest assessment
report (AR6) identiﬁed that there still remain signiﬁcant climate-
health adaptation gaps despite some progress [2], indicating more
work still needs to be done. While recognition of the health impacts
of climate change is growing in the United States [3], most Americans
cannot name a speciﬁc health threat worsened by climate change
[4,5].
Raising awareness of the health implications of climate change is
critical for building public engagement and advocating for enduring
climate policy solutions, and healthcare professionals are in a power-
ful position to do just that. As of 2022, healthcare professionals rank
as one of the most trusted sources of global warming information in
the United States, especially among those who are politically conser-
vative and Republican [6]. Furthermore, healthcare professionals
have a key role to play in helping achieve emissions reductions
within their working sector. The healthcare sector contributes
roughly 5 % of global greenhouse gas emissions with the U.S. contrib-
uting the greatest amount on a country basis in terms of healthcare
emissions [1,7]. There is a critical need to decarbonize the health sec-
tor and healthcare professionals are positioned to be potentially
strong advocates in calling for and supporting wide-spread emissions
reductions and sustainability in their sector [8].

Framing climate change as a health challenge is a topic that has
received growing attention in academic literature [9]. Issue frames
represent different communication lenses, created through the inten-
tional (or not) choice of speciﬁc elements that can speak to causes,
problems, judgments, and remedies [10,11]. Previous studies have
highlighted the potential of the health frame to increase public
engagement across the political spectrum, especially when efforts
include information about the health risks of climate change, the
health beneﬁts of climate solutions, opponents who stand in the way
of efforts to address climate change, and social normative informa-
tion about others who are taking action [12−16]. Given high levels of
trust towards healthcare professionals, they are uniquely positioned
to use their voices to help convey the importance of climate change
as a public health issue [5,17,18].
Despite the potential for health professionals to act as effective
advocates for climate change and sustainability action, there are chal-
lenges to mobilizing these trusted voices. A multi-national survey of
healthcare professionals identiﬁed a number of barriers impeding
their public engagement efforts [19]. Barriers pertaining to a lack of
time, perceived lack of knowledge, and belief that their participation
would not make a difference, were among the most prevalent [19]. In
this study, we test the effectiveness of role model narratives as one
potential method to help health professionals overcome these bar-
riers and enable them as more active advocates for sustainability and
climate change action.
Social cognitive theory posits that perceptions of self-efﬁcacy and
outcome expectancies are central in enabling behavior change [20−22].
Recent research suggests feelings of low self-efﬁcacy may act as a bar-
rier for healthcare professionals when it comes to engaging others on
the climate and health [19]. One potential pathway for helping build
self-efﬁcacy is through behavioral journalism which uses insights from
behavioral science to construct effective role model stories [23,24].
These stories provide the role model’s personal account of their behav-
ior change journey, which can then encourage similar changes in the
reader through identiﬁcation with the story’s subject [25].
Previous research on role model narratives−and behavioral jour-
nalism speciﬁcally−has tended to focus on promoting healthy life-
style behaviors in the general population, such as improved nutrition
and physical activity, smoking cessation, and avoidance of sexually
transmitted diseases [26,27]. Fewer studies have investigated the
effectiveness of behavioral journalism in promoting sustainability or
climate-friendly actions (although see, [28]). We extend previous
work in this area by testing the effectiveness of role model narratives
to encourage health professionals to become more engaged in
advancing workplace sustainability and climate change advocacy.
Past research ﬁnds that deepening an individual’s relationship to an
organization (whether it’s a workplace sustainability ofﬁce or an
advocacy organization) is an important antecedent to speciﬁc advo-
cacy behaviors [29]. This is because organizations help to foster and
coordinate individual actions of their members toward collective
goals, which leads to greater impact than acting alone [30]. Therefore
we investigate willingness to personally support workplace sustain-
ability initiatives as well as willingness to get involved in advocacy as
past research has highlighted the important role of collective action
[31]. Speciﬁcally, we posit the following hypothesis:
H1: Exposure to role model stories will result in greater support
for sustainability and climate change action through the following
outcomes:
(a)
Higher support for workplace sustainability initiatives;
(b)
Lower perceived barriers to supporting those initiatives;
(c)
Greater willingness to promote workplace sustainability;
(d)
Greater interest in receiving information on how to get involved
with workplace sustainability;
(e)
Greater willingness to join a climate and health advocacy orga-
nization;
(f)
Lower perceived barriers to joining a climate and health advo-
cacy organization;
(g)
Greater interest in receiving information on how to join a cli-
mate and health sustainability organization; and
(h)
Greater sense of personal responsibility when it comes to being
an advocate for the connections between climate change and
health.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Participants
To test our hypothesis, we conducted a ﬁeld experiment in part-
nership with a large, nonproﬁt healthcare system located in Northern
Virginia, U.S. The partner organization focuses on providing immedi-
ate and preventive healthcare through direct consultation and treat-
ment, as well as through education and community engagement. As
part of their sustainability program to reduce the overall environ-
mental impact of their operations, the partner organization produces
and maintains a regular e-newsletter on workplace sustainability dis-
tributed once a month.
Participants for the study were employees sourced from the sus-
tainability newsletter email list of the partner organization which
contained a total of 771 people. The study consisted of two waves of
data collection in 2022. The ﬁrst wave of data collection (T1) took
place over the period of March 9th −30th, 2022. The second (T2) was
ﬁelded over the period of June 23rd −September 22nd, 2022, and
occurred after treatment group participants were exposed to the
experimental stimuli. The number of survey respondents differed for
the baseline (n = 152) and post-test surveys (n = 121) with a smaller
number of participants completing both waves (n = 39).
In preparing the dataset, we removed duplicate responses (i.e.,
those that took the same survey twice), responses from individuals
who had multiple email addresses subscribed to the sustainability
list that happened to get assigned to different experimental condi-
tions, and responses from individuals that were featured as role mod-
els in the stimulus material. Additionally, we restricted our analysis
only to those who completed both waves of the survey. Taken
together, the ﬁnal sample size for analysis was n = 39. Based on a
post-hoc sensitivity power analysis conducted in G*Power (assuming
ɑ = 95 %; 1-b = 0.8; and numerator df = 1) the minimum detectible
effect size for this sample was Cohen’s d = 0.92, which constitutes a
large effect size [32,33].
2.2. Study design
Prior to sending out surveys, subscribers to the email list were
randomly assigned into either a control or treatment group. The con-
trol group received the regular monthly sustainability newsletter,
whereas the treatment group received the regular newsletter in addi-
tion to a series of six role model stories each spaced about two weeks
apart.
The role model stories were detailed, personal accounts featuring
a fellow employee and their experience in getting involved with cli-
mate, health, and sustainability (see Supplementary ﬁle 2). All of the
role models were actual employees of the partner organization to
increase the likelihood that readers perceived the role models as sim-
ilar to themselves and belonging to a common peer group [34]. Each
story contained a different role model, but consisted of similar narra-
tive elements, including: (a) how the role model became interested
in climate change/sustainability, (b) barriers encountered in their
journey to becoming a sustainability leader, (c) how they overcame
those barriers, and (d) what they are doing now to sustain their
efforts over time. These stories were developed through careful role

model selection in collaboration with sustainability staff from the
partner organization and in-depth interviewing of the role models
[34].
2.3. Survey measures
2.3.1. Support for sustainability initiatives
To measure support for sustainability initiatives, participants
were asked “How much do you support or oppose [partner organiza-
tion] focusing on the following sustainability goals?” and were pro-
vided with seven sustainability initiatives including: increasing clean
energy use, reducing food waste, and educating government ofﬁcials
on the connection between climate and health. Responses options
included: 1 = strongly oppose, 2 = moderately oppose, 3 = slightly
oppose, 4 = neither support nor oppose, 5 = slightly support, 6 = mod-
erately support, and 7 = strongly support. Wording for all matrix-
style questions is available in Supplementary ﬁle 1. All seven items
were combined into a single 7-point index at T1 (ɑ = 0.763) and T2
(ɑ = 0.623).
2.3.2. Willingness to help promote workplace sustainability
Willingness to help promote workplace sustainability was mea-
sured by asking “How willing or unwilling would you be to get
involved [in promoting sustainability within the organization]?” and
responses recorded on a 5-point scale: 1 = I deﬁnitely would not do
it, 2 = I probably would not do it, 3 = I probably would do it, 4 = I deﬁ-
nitely would do it, and 5 = I am already getting involved.
2.3.3. Barriers to promoting workplace sustainability
To assess potential barriers, we asked “To what extent do these
factors limit your willingness to get involved with promoting sustain-
ability at [partner organization]?” and provided ﬁve barriers scored
on a 5-point scale: 1 = not at all, 2 = a little, 3 = a moderate amount,
4 = a good amount, and 5 = a great deal. Examples of the items asked
include a lack of time, lack of support from my peers, and it won’t
make a difference. All ﬁve items were averaged into a combined bar-
riers to promoting sustainability index at T1 (ɑ = 0.721) and T2
(ɑ = 0.610).
2.3.4. Interest in information on how to get involved with promoting
workplace sustainability
To assess interest in learning more about how to promote sustain-
ability at work we asked “How interested are you in receiving more
information on how to get involved with promoting sustainability at
[partner organization]?”. Participants responded on a 5-point scale:
1 = not at all interested, 2 = a little interested, 3 = moderately inter-
ested, 4 = very interested, and 5 = extremely interested.
2.3.5. Willingness to join a climate and health advocacy organization
To assess willingness to join a climate and health advocacy orga-
nization we asked “Next, we are interested in your thoughts about
joining an organization of health workers to educate policy makers
about policies that can address climate change and improve health
(for example, Virginia Clinicians for Climate Action). How willing or
unwilling would you be to join such an organization?”. Responses
were recorded on a 5-point scale: 1 = I deﬁnitely would not do it,
2 = I probably would not do it, 3 = I probably would do it, 4 = I deﬁ-
nitely would do it, and 5 = I am already participating in an organiza-
tion like this now.
2.3.6. Barriers to joining a climate and health advocacy organization
To measure perceived barriers to joining a climate and health
advocacy organization we asked “To what extent do these factors
limit your willingness to join an organization of health workers to
educate policy makers about policies that can address climate change
and improve health?” and provided seven barriers, such as: a lack of
time, lack of support from my peers, and the topic is too controver-
sial. The items were measured on a 5-point scale: 1 = not at all, 2 = a
little, 3 = a moderate amount, 4 = a good amount, and 5 = a great deal
with all seven items averaged into a single index at T1 (ɑ = 0.718)
and T2 (ɑ = 0.667).
2.3.7. Interest in information on how to join a climate and health
advocacy organization
To measure interest in receiving information about joining a cli-
mate and health advocacy organization we asked “How interested
are you in receiving more information about joining such an organi-
zation?” following the organizational description provided in the
question above. Responses were recorded on a 5-point scale: 1 = not
at all interested, 2 = a little interested, 3 = moderately interested,
4 = very interested, and 5 = extremely interested.
2.3.8. Perceived responsibility of health professionals
Participants were asked three conceptually related statements
about whether healthcare professionals had a responsibility to com-
municate about and educate the public and policy makers on the con-
nections between climate and health. Responses were measured on a
7-point scale and the three statements were: “Health workers have a
responsibility to bring the health effects of climate change to the
attention of the public.”, “Health workers have a responsibility to
bring the health effects of climate change to the attention of govern-
ment ofﬁcials.”, and “Health workers have a responsibility to reduce
the healthcare sector’s contribution to greenhouse gas emissions that
cause climate change.”. The three statements were averaged into a
single index at T1 (ɑ = 0.854) and T2 (ɑ = 0.808) and retained the
same 7-point scale: 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = somewhat
disagree, 4 = neither agree nor disagree, 5 = somewhat agree,
6 = agree, and 7 = strongly agree.
A series of additional demographic variables were also measured,
including gender, age, education, working position (i.e., clinical, or
non-clinical), and focus area of degrees earned (see Supplementary
ﬁle 1 for the full survey instrument).
2.4. Analysis
To address our hypothesis, we conducted a series of one-way
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) tests to assess the effect of the role
model narratives on the dependent variables. Measures at T2 were
treated as the main dependent variable with measures at T1 treated
as a covariate. Utilizing a mixed design with repeated measures
increases statistical power, especially when sample sizes are small
[35]. We present our analyses below without multiple-comparison
correction because such adjustments are applied arbitrarily and
inconsistently, can increase Type II error, and are not a substitute for
replication [36,37]. Analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statis-
tics [38] and Jamovi [39−41], with ﬁgures generated in R [42,43].
Finally, we identiﬁed one demographic variable (working position)
that was not balanced across the experimental conditions. We have
chosen to report the unadjusted models in the main text due to bal-
ancing test and adjustment procedures being advised against in ran-
domized
experiments
[44].
However,
we
have
included
a
supplementary table (SM3.2) with the adjust models −controlling
for the position variable −for transparency.

3. Results
3.1. Assessing the effect of experimental condition
We found that the role model narratives signiﬁcantly increased
perceived responsibility of healthcare professionals (F(1, 38) = 8.33,
p = .007, d = 0.932 [0.240, 1.62]) and willingness to receive more
information about joining a climate and health advocacy organization
(F(1, 38) = 4.17, p = .049, d = 0.660 [0.015, 1.33]); see Fig. 1. We did
not detect signiﬁcant effects of the role model narratives on any of
the other outcome variables (see Table 1).
4. Discussion
This study contributes to the understanding of whether role
model stories can help encourage healthcare professionals to support
and participate in pro-climate and sustainability behaviors. As
trusted sources of information, healthcare professionals are in a pow-
erful position to help advocate for climate and health solutions. How-
ever, encouraging pro-climate behaviors and advocacy among health
professionals can be challenging [19]. We tested the efﬁcacy of role
model stories to address these challenges through a ﬁeld experiment
that measured a variety of outcomes related to support for sustain-
ability initiatives and climate advocacy. Despite a small sample size,
we found that the role model narratives signiﬁcantly increased will-
ingness to receive more information on joining a climate and health
advocacy organization and perceived responsibility of healthcare
professionals to advance climate and health solutions in the work-
place as well as among the public and policy makers.
Supporting sustainable initiatives and those designed to curb car-
bon-intensive practices is an important ﬁrst step toward broader
societal change. According to one estimate, the healthcare sector con-
tributes to roughly 5 % of global GHG emissions [1], and therefore has
a signiﬁcant opportunity to help reduce global emissions. Decarbon-
izing the healthcare sector provides multiple beneﬁts to health, not
just by reducing the negative consequences of climate change, but
also through directly lowering pollution levels by utilizing clean elec-
tricity [1]. However, in order to achieve the ambitious goals set forth
n the Paris Climate Agreement −and ensure these shifts are enduring
[45]
−
support
from
healthcare
professionals
is
critical
[46].
Highlighting the leadership of sustainability role models is one
method that could boost support for various sustainability initiatives.
In this study, participants who received role model stories exhibited
an increase in their desire to receive more information about joining
a climate and health advocacy organization. Although the effect size
was large (d = 0.660), this ﬁnding should be interpreted with caution
given that the p-value was just below conventional cutoff criteria for
statistical signiﬁcance (p = .049) and the effect size conﬁdence inter-
val crosses zero −likely due to the small sample size. Moreover, this
effect was not robust when we controlled for a demographic imbal-
ance between the experimental conditions (see Supplementary ﬁle 3,
Table SM3.1). Although further research is needed with a larger sam-
ple, these ﬁndings suggest that role modeling could be an effective
means to build and maintain healthcare professional participation in
climate advocacy, which is critical to advancing broader policy and
structural change within the sector. Furthermore, this support can
work towards legitimizing the efforts of organizations that aim to
facilitate workplaces in adopting sustainable policies.
The second important ﬁnding from this study relates to level of
responsibility healthcare professionals put on themselves as trusted
communicators of climate and health. We found that role model sto-
ries had a large effect (d = 0.932) on health professionals’ perceived
responsibility to educate government ofﬁcials and the public about
the impacts of climate change on health. A previous multinational
study based on correlational data found perceived responsibility to
be
a signiﬁcant predictor
of climate advocacy, speciﬁcally in

participating in a global campaign to strengthen commitments to the
Paris Agreement [47]. Other research has also found feelings of
responsibility to be a predictor of climate advocacy in the general
population [48]. While these correlational studies have found per-
ceived responsibility to be an important predictor of climate advo-
cacy behaviors, our study extends these ﬁndings by demonstrating
that role model stories can have a causal effect on perceived responsi-
bility, and therefore represent one effective means to encourage sup-
port for climate advocacy among health professionals.
This study is not without its limitations. First, because this
research was conducted in a single healthcare organization in the
United States, we cannot speak to how generalizable these ﬁndings
will be in other organizational settings. However, one point of prom-
ise is that the role model stories substantively increased information
seeking and perceived responsibility even though these participants
had a pre-existing interest in sustainability (i.e., they had already
opted to receive emails from their employer’s sustainability ofﬁce)
and displayed relatively high baseline levels of engagement. Hence,
we believe this strategy should be explored in other healthcare set-
tings regardless of previous levels of prior climate and sustainability
engagement. Second, the sample size for this study is quite small and
future research should aim to test this strategy on a larger sample
with more statistical power. However, we believe the fact that some
of the observed effect sizes were large enough reach statistical signif-
icance despite these limitations is an intriguing ﬁnding that warrants
further investigation into role model stories as a engagement strategy
in this context. Our study establishes a set of expected effects sizes to
help guide power calculations for future studies. Finally, we mea-
sured behavioral intentions and not actual behavior. While the con-
cept of role modeling appears to be a promising strategy, future
research should implement behavioral measures such as signing peti-
tions or signing up for a campaign to better gauge the effects of the
intervention on behavioral outcomes.
5. Conclusions
Healthcare professionals are trusted sources of information, and
they can be invaluable in communicating the health implications of
climate change and sustainability now, and into the future. Their
actions in raising awareness, educating, and advocating for policy sol-
utions −both in the workplace as well as in society more broadly −
can help build a public mandate for climate and sustainability action.
This study analyzed the effect role model stories can have in encour-
aging healthcare professionals to be advocates for climate and sus-
tainability health solutions.
Our analysis shows that role model stories were effective in both
increasing interest in receiving more information on how to join a climate
and health advocacy organization, as well as boosting perceptions of
responsibility when it comes to educating the public and government
ofﬁcials on climate and health. These results are promising, although
must be caveated with the fact this sample was restricted in terms of size.
Activating healthcare professionals to advocate for sustainability
and climate and health solutions is critical for policy progress, as has
been seen in previous examples like the role that health professionals
played in the nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaty and manage-
ment of the COVID-19 pandemic [49]. Although behavior change can
be challenging, role models that share their personal journey of
change can be effective in helping inspire others to action. Highlight-
ing the stories of inﬂuential healthcare role models may be one
important method of mobilizing more health professionals to take up
the critical role of climate and sustainability advocacy.
