some of the main proposed methods of geoengineering, see Royal Society (2009).	
2. Hydraulic fracturing, or, "fracking," involves injecting water, sand, and sometimes other chemicals into a well at high pressure in order to cause 
fracturing in underground bedrock to increase the flow of oil or gas reserves in the well.

The state of the future climate depends on human 
actions, primarily the emission of greenhouse 
gases and other industrial pollutants. This raises 
the questions: "What path are recent historical 
emissions following?" "What path would we be 
on, if we continue with business-as-usual, in the 
absence of further mitigation action?" And, "Are 
these paths reliable guides to future emissions?" 
One scenario that is commonly used in the sci-
entific literature, RCP 8.5, is often referred to as 
"business-as-usual." Recently, some scientists 
have taken issue with this description, saying it is 
unrealistic and may hinder the goal of emissions 
reductions policy. Others argue that, in fact, RCP 
8.5 is the scenario that most closely tracks cumu-
lative emissions to date, that it is thus of the most 
use for planning out to the middle of the century. 
In this Science Brief, we unpack each of these ar-
guments and evaluate what these differing per-
spectives can tell us about the ultimate objective 
of emissions scenarios as tools for exploring fu-
ture climate change.
Introduction
In a broad range of areas, planning for the future requires 
some knowledge of the future climate. However, we can-
not make a forecast of the climate of 30, 50 or 80 years 
in the future. The state of the future climate depends 
crucially on human emissions of greenhouse gases and 
aerosols1, which in turn depend on a number of factors, 
including the makeup of the future global energy system. 
The makeup of the future energy system itself depends on 
global population growth, energy needs and future tech-
nologies. Technological change is difficult to predict and 
can quickly alter the energy landscape. For example, the 
advent of profitable hydraulic fracturing2 and the rapidly 
falling price of energy from solar photovoltaics have af-
fected the mix of global energy sources, while the carbon 
footprint of cryptocurrencies has grown rapidly and now 
rivals that of many countries3.   
While we cannot predict the state of the global climate by 
the middle or end of the century, we can use our under-
standing of the Earth system and the fundamental physi-
cal laws that govern it to develop a range of plausible fu-
ture scenarios that can be used to inform planning. There 
is particular interest in determining which scenario best 
represents the path we are on, or the path that we would 
be on if we were to continue with "business as usual." That 
is, what would the future climate look like, given current 
policies and in the absence of significant further mitiga-
tion action? There has been an ongoing debate about 
what future scenario constitutes business-as-usual that 
spans the scientific and popular literature. This Science 
Brief examines an illustrative portion of this exchange that 
captures some of the key points of interest.

Emissions Scenarios
We begin by looking at the two most recent sets of emis-
sions and concentration scenarios developed for the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) as-
sessment reports, with a focus on the Representative Con-
centration Pathways4 (RCPs) developed for the Fifth Assess-
ment Report (AR5). The RCPs are comprised of four paths 
that future atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions may 
follow: RCP 2.6, which projects low greenhouse gas emis-
sions, RCP 4.5 projects moderate emissions, RCP 6.0 proj-
ects moderate-to-high emissions and RCP 8.5, which proj-
ects high emissions. They are named for the net change 
in the balance of incoming solar and outgoing longwave 
radiation at the top of the troposphere5 at the end of the 
21st century, measured in watts per square metre. 
In place of the RCPs, the upcoming report IPCC Sixth As-
sessment Report uses the Shared Socioeconomic Path-
ways6 (SSPs), a set of five trajectories (SSP1 through SSP5) 
that illustrate different ways that global societies may de-
velop. The SSPs are broadly comparable to the RCPs (see 
Aside).
RCP 8.5: Business As Usual?
Although RCP 8.5 was developed as a high-emissions sce-
nario, it has widely been described in the scientific and 
popular literature as a business-as-usual scenario. This 
raises a number of  questions, among them: does RCP 8.5 
actually represent business-as-usual? In which contexts 
and to whom is RCP 8.5 useful?
In their Nature comment article titled, Emissions — the 
'business as usual' story is misleading, Hausfather and Pe-
ters (2020a) argue that the business-as-usual designation 
sometimes given to RCP 8.5 is misleading. Their arguments 
are largely centered around emissions projections and the

5. The Earth's atmosphere can be divided up into successive layers by height: the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere and 
exosphere. The troposphere is the layer closest to Earth's surface.
The emission of greenhouse gases such as CO2 (Figure 2, left panel), alters their global mean atmospheric concentrations (centre 
panel) which results in a net radiative forcing (right panel), which in turn causes in an increase in mean global surface temperatures. 
The upcoming IPCC Sixth Assessment Report uses the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways5 (SSPs), a set of five trajectories (SSP1 through 
SSP5) that illustrate different ways that global societies may develop, each of which has several associated emissions and concentra-
tion scenarios. These are used to create climate projections for the report. The RCPs and the SSPs are named for the radiative forcings 
that result from a given pathway by the end of the century, for example, RCP 4.5 and SSP2-4.5 both results in a radiative forcing of 4.5 
watts per square metre (Wm-2) by 2100. Unlike the RCPs, SSPs allow more than a single radiative forcing target to be achieved within 
a given SSP. The SSPs were developed by considering a number of factors, such as plausible future population growth, human de-
velopment, economic growth, changes to lifestyles, policies and institutions, developments in technology, and management of the 
global environment and natural resources. A knowledge of these factors permits estimates of country-level quantities such as Gross 
Domestic Product and the degree of urbanization that are known to strongly control greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions. Generally 
speaking, the SSPs are designed to capture a range of possible ways in which societies may develop and, because of this, they do not 
follow a simple linear ordering in terms of emissions, from SSP1 to SSP5. However, for a given radiative forcing target, RCPs and SSPs 
are quite comparable (Figure 2, right panel).

hazards of normalizing overly pessimistic projections as 
"business-as-usual." They begin by pointing out that, de-
spite the fact that RCP 8.5 was meant to capture an un-
likely and high-risk future, it has since been used by policy-
makers as a business-as-usual scenario. The authors argue 
that end-of-century emissions projections under RCP 8.5 
now appear implausible, given recent historical emissions 
trends. For example, while global coal use appears to have 
peaked in recent years, RCP8.5 reflects a fivefold increase 
in emissions from this energy source by 2100. Hausfather 
and Peters also suggest that current policies would lead to 
a world that is about 3°C warmer by the end of this cen-
tury, short of the approximately 5°C of warming projected 
under RCP 8.5. 
The authors contend that describing RCP 8.5 as "business-
as-usual," and therefore as probable, may lead to defeat-
ism and overestimating the costs of climate action. Sce-
narios issued without guidance for their use (in the form 
of at least qualitative probabilities) effectively invite users 
to assign such likelihoods themselves, Hausfather and Pe-
ters say. And a focus on the extremes, in the form of best- 
and worst-case scenarios, ignores the space of more likely 
outcomes that lies in between. As examples of more likely 
outcomes, the authors point to the IEA's scenarios up to 
2040, which are based upon countries’ current emissions 
policies and targets (Figure 1).
Responding in the Proceedings of the National Academy of 
Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS), Schwalm, 
Glendon and Duffy (2020a) counter that future emissions 
scenarios should not be viewed as predictions, with as-
sociated likelihoods—which we have no way of quantify-
ing—but rather as planning tools with multiple outcomes 
by design. In other words, RCP 8.5 cannot be viewed as 
"misleading," because it can’t be validated against (un-
known) future emissions. With respect to the cumulative 
emissions of carbon dioxide up to the present, RCP 8.5 ac-
tually holds up well, argue the authors, being within 1% of 
observational estimates, and they further note that this is 
unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Looking to the 2030s and 2050s, Schwalm, Glendon and 
Duffy make use of two near-term IEA-based projections 
mentioned by Hausfather and Peters as being more "re-
alistic." The authors develop projections by combining 
historical emissions with the IEA projections, emissions 
from land use change and industrial emissions. They then 
compared these scenarios, representing nations' "current 
policies" and "stated policies," with the RCPs for these fu-
ture periods (Figure 3). The authors find that RCP 8.5 most 
closely matches cumulative emissions for 2030, for both 
IEA scenarios. By 2050, the IEA-projected emissions fall be-
tween RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5. So why choose RCP 8.5 over 
RCP 4.5 on this longer time horizon? Schwalm and coau-
thors contend that it would be  prudent to do so, given 
that the IEA estimates do not account for additional car-
bon dioxide released from positive climate feedback 
mechanisms. They also point to recent research that finds 
there is a 35% chance that carbon dioxide emissions will 
exceed the emissions assumed by RCP 8.5 by the end of 
this century (see Christensen, Gillingham and Nordhaus, 
2018). This illustrates one of the key differences between 
the two sets of commentators: while Hausfather and Pe-
ters believe that scenarios should be "realistic," Schwalm 
et al. feel it is more important for the to be "useful," in the 
sense of bracketing possible outcomes in an uncertain fu-
ture.
Two further responses in PNAS flesh out the arguments at 
play, largely focused on the issue of emissions from land 
use change. Hausfather and Peters (2020b) argue that, in 
terms of cumulative emissions, both current policies and 
stated policy intentions result in emissions that are closer 
to RCP 4.5 and RCP 6.0 than they are to RCP 8.5 for 2030

from Schwalm, Glendon and Duffy, 2020a).  
This figure shows historical and projected-future cumulative 
global carbon dioxide emissions for years 2020, 2030 and 2050. 
The scenarios used are projections from the International En-
ergy Agency (combined with emissions from land use change 
and industrial emissions) and the RCPs, as labelled, with histori-
cal data from the Global Carbon Project.

and 2050. They argue that Schwalm et al.'s response relies 
heavily on highly uncertain estimates of land use change 
and assume an increase in emissions from this source, 
whereas the RCPs and SSPs assume a decline. Whereas 
Schwalm et al. (2020b) note that the most important thing 
is the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. They 
reiterate that RCP 8.5 is the closest match to observed at-
mospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, remains the 
best choice for risk assessment through to the middle of 
the century, and point out that land use change emissions 
have consistently failed to peak, despite projections.
Outlook: Scenarios, Not Forecasts
With the advent of CMIP6 and the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment 
Report, RCP8.5 will likely cede its place to one of the SSPs. 
Differing views such as those highlighted above may con-
tinue to be heard between those arguing for the “realism” 
of scenarios on one side and for their overall utility on the 
other. But is the adoption of one viewpoint or the other 
helpful to users of climate projections?
Much of this dialogue can be seen as complementary. Given 
that RCP 8.5 is not the most "likely" outcome of emissions 
following business-as-usual or stated policy intentions, it's 
reasonable to refer to it as a high-emissions scenario in-
stead of business-as-usual. And cumulative emissions thus 
far do follow RCP 8.5 quite closely, so it remains useful for 
planning through to the middle of the century. However, 
in terms of projected global climate change, significant 
differences between the scenarios do not emerge until 
near the middle of the century. Thus, projected climate 
impacts over the next two decades are similar across sce-
narios. Also, given the substantial uncertainty involved in 
making projections of future emissions, it is unclear how 
much recent changes and trends in emissions tell us about 
what emissions will be decades from now.
The economic forecasters, who originally pioneered sce-
nario development in partnership with the IPCC, did not 
intend for them to be understood as either value-based or 
probabilistic. Rather, they were tasked with the "formula-
tion of [...] narrative scenario 'storylines' to describe alter-
native futures," and the "quantification of each storyline 
using a variety of modeling approaches." (IPCC, 2000). Spe-
cifically, they formulated high-emissions scenarios such as 
RCP 8.5 with the expressed intent of generating strong 
climate forcings, which provide better tests for climate 
models than more moderate forcings. But the intent was 
not merely academic. Emergency management planners, 
for example, are also likely to value RCP 8.5, since they are 
concerned with how society can respond to low-likelihood, 
high-risk disasters. Other users, such as government plan-
ners and industry, who may be more interested in examin-
ing "likely" scenarios, may steer away from high-emissions 
scenarios. In any event, we would do well to note that the 
very exercise of scenario development involves aiming at 
a moving target, as the global energy landscape continues 
to shift beneath our feet.
