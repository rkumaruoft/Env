Background information: What do educators need to know?
Ripple Effect of Individual Actions
According to Canada’s Institute for Climate Choices, personal changes in behaviour will play a
key role in reaching Canada’s net-zero goal. The question that often comes up is how can one
person’s actions have an impact on a problem as large as climate change?
Behavioural Psychologist Kelly Fielding from the University of Queensland explains, "people are
very influenced by what others do, even though we don't think we are". "It's a paradox. We think
we make our own decisions, but the truth is we look to others for guidance about how we should
behave. When it comes to climate change, the problem is that we just aren't getting the cues we
need from our friends and families or, for that matter, from government and business.” This is
2
what makes individual actions so important: it’s less about our actions themselves and more
about growing our impact by guiding others to follow suit (Justin Rowlett, BBC, 2019).
Climate change isn’t going to happen or not happen—it is happening!—but it’s up to the
government, corporations, and, yes, individuals to determine just how much the climate will
change and what impacts will be felt. As Greta Thurnberg says about taking individual action:
“We do it because we want to influence the people around us, we want to send a clear signal
that we are facing an emergency and when you are in an emergency you change your behavior”
(Green Matters, 2022).
Consumer Choice
Every day we make choices about what is a necessity vs. a luxury (need vs. want) in our lives.
These consumer choices have a big impact on the planet. To keep us fed, clothed, sheltered,
and entertained, the earth’s resources are being consumed faster than they can be replenished.
This is related to humans’ overconsumption, but also the linear nature of our economy. A linear
economy means the raw materials that were used to make a product are thrown out at the end
of its use, and thus become waste. A circular economy, on the other hand, reduces or eliminates
waste by recycling and re-introducing used materials back into production, and
materials/services are produced with sustainability, longevity, and repairability in mind.
In Canada, many goods and services are consumed without considering the environmental
impact. For instance, according to a recent report by Second Harvest, 58% of all food produced
in Canada is thrown away. Additionally, according to Elisa Tonda (Head of the Consumption and
Production Unit at the UN Environment Programme), fast fashion and irresponsible purchasing
of clothing are large contributors to the climate crisis; apparel and footwear industries account
for more than 8% of global climate impacts.
While we can work to make our economy more circular, while it remains primarily linear, we
need to examine our consumption habits to reduce our waste and impact on the earth.
Green Energy
Globally, the energy sector accounts for over 70% of all greenhouse gas emissions attributed to
humans (Our World in Data). To significantly reduce these emissions, humans need to not only
reduce their overall energy use but also transition to cleaner and greener energy sources.
“Climate change also has direct and indirect impacts on energy demand. Warmer winters
reduce fossil fuel and electricity demand for heating (Mantle314, 2019), while the increasing
number of hot days in summer increase electricity demand for cooling (Ortiz et al., 2018; Jaglom
et al., 2014).” (NRCAN, 7.6.1)

Observed and projected changes in non-hydro renewable energy capacity in Canada between 2005 and
2040 under the National Energy Board reference case scenario. Higher rates of growth are projected
under a technology scenario (NEB, 2018).
Source: NRCAN Chapter 7: Adapted from National Energy Board, 2018.
There is some confusion among the terms “clean,” “green” and “renewable” energy. “Clean
energy is energy gained from sources that do not release air pollutants, while green energy is
simply energy that is derived from natural sources, and “renewable energy is energy derived
from natural processes that are replenished at a rate that is equal to or faster than the rate at
which they are consumed” (TWI, 2022). Renewable energy includes energy generated from
many different natural resources or processes including solar, wind, hydropower, tidal power,
geothermal, solid biomass, biogas, and liquid biofuels (NRCAN, 2017). While most green
energy sources are renewable, some renewable energy sources may be greener than others.
For example, a hydropower dam is clean because it releases no air pollutants, and it is
renewable because the source of energy replenishes itself, but it is not green because dams
and reservoirs that produce electricity are a large contributor to GHG emissions (WaterKeeper
Alliance, 2017). Understanding the difference between these energy sources is important when
discussing the environmental implications of energy use, and sustainable alternatives.
This chart below compares the tradeoffs of various energy sources:

Source: World 101: What is Climate Change
In Canada, the goal is to reach net-zero emissions before 2030 (Government of Canada, 2020).
However, the path to zero emissions will be challenging and complex. Varying solutions will
likely be key parts of achieving this goal, including improving energy efficiency, shifting to
non-emitting electricity, adopting heat pumps, and switching to electric vehicles (Canadian
Institute for Climate Choices,p4, 2021).
“It is easy to be green!” explores climate change with K-2 students by learning about the
importance of individual choices in the context of living sustainably. The inquiries focus on green
energy, needs vs. want, and finally how these choices can ripple out to have a greater impact.
Each of the 3 inquiries begins with a provocation followed by numerous strategies and
examples. These steps can be completed in their entirety as stated. However, as inquiry is an
organic and fluid process based on student input, educators may wish to adapt, modify or
replace the suggested steps to create their own inquiry with their class. We, therefore, suggest
that teachers review the whole chapter first to create a plan that will work best with their
particular group of learners.
The following 3 inquiries are connected to curricular concepts as shown in this chart. These
curricular concepts are applicable across Canada.

Prior to Provocations: Journaling
Encourage students to record their thinking and learning throughout the learning process. The
main reason for developing a journal is for students to then be able to look back and track their
growth and progression with their connection to climate change. Students scaffold their thinking
throughout their learning journey. The entries can be a combination of personal reflections and
assigned reflections. This can be done as illustrations, concept maps or written reflections.
Inquiry 1: Green Me- Needs vs. Wants
What do children need to survive and live a healthy, happy life? The activities in this inquiry help
students distinguish the difference between the things they want and the things they need.

Inquiry 2: Understanding Green Energy
Students will explore innovations in alternative energy, learn how they function and understand
their benefits. They will explore their environment and understand how changes can be put in
place to improve the energy system. Students will then create a machine that can help the
environment. They will be given choices and encouraged to design and build their prototype.

A. Provocation:
To hook student interest, introduce the provocation to initiate students' thinking
about needs vs wants.
Picture
(Source: Pixabay)
After viewing the picture. Invite students to give the image a title. Display the titles around
the image. Then, as a group, invite students to explain why they chose this title for the
poster.
1
B. Question Generation
At this point in the inquiry, we want to harness students’ curiosity and build off of
the provocation by generating meaningful questions to continue to drive the
learning process.
Use the Five-Why's by looking at the picture. This strategy helps students deepen their ideas
and understanding.
Possible questions:
●
Why do people throw things away?
●
Why is there a tractor there?
●
Why doesn’t garbage disappear when buried?
●
Why is there garbage in this beautiful field?
●
Why does this hurt the climate?
C. Knowledge Building
At this stage, students may be ready to engage in a group knowledge building activity. It will
encourage students to open their minds to many alternative ways of thinking about the
provocation and ideas that have been generated thus far in the inquiry process.
Engage in a class Knowledge Building Circles -kindergarten (outside if possible)
Use one of the questions that you generated after the picture activity to do a Knowledge
Building Circle.
Possible Critical Thinking Question:
●
What can we do to reduce the amount of garbage?
D. Determining Understanding
At this stage of the inquiry, use responses to inform and guide the learning
process. They can provide insight into which concepts need clarity, what
students are already well informed about, and a general direction that students want to
pursue. After the knowledge building circle, simulate a situation to understand the difference
between needs and wants.
Simulation
Begin the activity by sharing the book WALL-E
2
“When a loveable, lonely robot named WALL•E falls in love with a sophisticated female robot
named EVE, he follows his heart all the way into outer space! Young fans will enjoy this Little
Golden Book retelling of Disney/Pixar’s WALL•E” (WALL-E, RH Disney).
OR
Explain that we have created too much garbage and polluted our water so in order to
survive, we need to leave planet earth and find another planet. The problem is that we only
have one rocketship so we are only allowed to bring 12 things with us.
Have a discussion about our needs and wants and how they can be influenced by our lived
experiences and context. This will help students understand that they are similar and
different to others. (i.e., both students might want an iPad but one student can’t get one
because they don’t have internet, one student might want a new pair of shoes but another
student may need a new pair of shoes because theirs are too small )
In pairs, invite the students to look around the classroom and collect 12 things they will need
or want to bring on the journey to the new planet.
Possible questions:
●
Why do you think this item is important?
●
Could you sort the items in order from most important to least important or are they
all the same?
●
How will this item help you on your journey?
EXTENSIONS:
●
Watch: WALL∙E’s “Day At Work” (clip)
●
Watch: TALKING AND PLAYING WITH MOVIES: WALL-E (study of human impact
on earth)
**Note: The movie is approximately 1 hour and 40 min. You will need to show it in smaller
sections to keep the students interested.
These books also speak to needs/wants and how they can be different based on our lived
experiences:
●
Those Shoes by Maribeth Boelts, illustrated by Noah Z. Jones:
“All Jeremy wants is a pair of those shoes, the ones everyone at school seems to be
wearing. Though Jeremy’s grandma says they don’t have room for "want," just "need,"
when his old shoes fall apart at school, he is more determined than ever to have those
shoes, even a thrift-shop pair that are much too small. But sore feet aren’t much fun, and
Jeremy soon sees that the things he has — warm boots, a loving grandma, and the
chance to help a friend — are worth more than the things he wants.” (Those Shoes:
Boelts, Maribeth, Penguin Random House)
●
A Bike like Sergio's by Maribeth Boelts, illustrated by Noah Z. Jones:
A story about Ruben, who is faced with a difficult choice, and an opportunity to do the
right thing when he comes upon a surprise $100 bill. (Scholastic, A Bike Like Sergio’s)
E. Pursuing Learning
At this stage, students may begin research to pursue their questions, or the
following activity could be integrated into the process to ensure that students
3
have an understanding of foundational climate science.
Game
The game below provides students with deliberate and focused opportunities to continue
learning about climate change impacts and responses to needs and wants.
Continue the discussion about needs and wants.
1.
Inform the students that more people are coming on the rocketship so 6 more items
need to be eliminated.
2.
With their partner, discuss the reason for keeping those 6 items.
3.
Keep telling each pair that they have to eliminate items until they are allowed only
one.
4.
Discuss and present the reason that they chose that one item with the rest of the
class.
5.
Display all of the items chosen by the pairs and give each student two post-its with
their name on it.
6.
Students then place their post it notes beside the two items that they feel are the
most important items to bring on the voyage.
7.
Reflect on why some items seem to be more important than others.
End the lesson by explaining that they don't have to go on the rocket, but that they should
stay here, take care of the planet and make it a more sustainable place for future
generations.
Next, play the game Needs or wants? That is the question! - Bank of Canada Museum to
help them solidify their understanding of climate change.
Extension Videos:
●
Needs and Wants for Kids: A basic description of the differences between needs
and wants.
●
Needs vs Wants: Learn the difference, when it comes to economics, between your
needs and your wants.
●
Need vs Want: Understand how paying attention to your needs helps you work
towards your wants.
F. Consolidation
This step is designed to encourage students to integrate and synthesize key ideas. When
students make connections and see relationships within and across lessons, it helps them to
solidify knowledge and deepen their understanding.
SEE-I Strategy
●
S- State it: with the class clearly state and copy the definition of the concepts onto
the board.  Needs  “a need is something you must have to survive” and wants
“something that’s nice to have, but you can actually live without”.  (Teaching kids the
difference between needs and wants | ASB Blog)
●
E- Elaborate: the student reformulates the definition in his own words.
4
●
E- Example: the student gives their own examples of need and want.
●
I- Illustrate: the student illustrates in a non-linguistic way the image he has for the
need and the want.
More experienced students might also be able to find an illustration or even a symbol that
makes them think of the concept.
Invite students to share their illustration/symbol together.
Assessment Idea
Teachers will use multiple methods to assess learning at various stages. The following
method represents an alternative to the usual tests and can be used after the consolidation
stage or at any other time during the lesson to check the level of comprehension of the
pupils.
Exit Ticket
Use the I Used to Think... Now I Think... strategy as your exit ticket.
Have students write one sentence explaining how their thinking about needs and wants have
changed (with a personal example) as a result of this inquiry. For younger students, this can
be done with the teacher writing down their thoughts after they share them or illustrate them.
Take Action
Allowing time for students to take action is an essential part of the learning process on
climate change, as it empowers students and eases their eco anxiety. These ideas for
action can be utilized at any point in the learning process, whether it's now or after
completing more guided inquiries. Please note that the suggestions are consistent in each
chapter.
You might introduce the idea of students taking action by sharing the following YouTube
“Climate Change Song”
Ask the students what they want to do to positively impact climate change in their local
community. List their ideas and come up with a plan to put their action in place.
Action can be taken in many different ways, these are some possible Ideas for Taking
Action:
●
Model green behaviour - use a reusable water bottle, actively recycle, compost, bring
your bags to the grocer, bring your mug to the coffee shop, repair things that need
mending, buy second-hand when applicable, pack a litterless lunch, use cloth
5
napkins, use toxic-free cleaners (or make your own), walk or bike instead of driving
when possible - these are just some basic ideas. Check out Ideas to Think Green for
more suggestions.
●
Collect rainwater for the garden
●
Compost your kitchen waste
●
Try more plant-based foods
●
Enrol in the EcoSchools program The core of the EcoSchools program is the
EcoSchools Certification Application (ECA), our bilingual, online application platform
that enables schools across the country to create and implement a customized
environmental action plan that meets the needs of their community. At the end of
each year, school plans are submitted and assessed by EcoSchools staff, and
schools are awarded a certification level ranging from Bronze to Platinum.

Action Project Examples
“BABY BITES FOR SUSTAINABLE FOOD PRODUCTION”- Sydney Academy- ON (2021)
K-6
●
This class learned about the impacts food production has on our planet and the
limited food production of fresh produce in their region. Each student was
provided with the materials needed to grow a tomato plant and some herbs. The
students were asked to take it home with a plan to care for it and have a harvest
in their homes over the summer. See their project here.
“CLOTHING SWAP AND CLOTHING INDUSTRY POLLUTION”- Port Elgin Regional
School-  NB (2021) K-1
●
This class did an action project of a clothing swap to try to help reduce, reuse
and recycle. They also did some research to see what materials are best for
6
the earth. They want to encourage others to do clothing swaps and try to
reduce the amount of clothing everyone uses. See their project here.
“SUSTAINABILITY AT HOME CHALLENGE”-St. Mary Catholic Elementary School-ON
(2021) AGE
●
The teachers at St Mary developed an educational program to deliver to
students virtually through their classroom teachers that involved a
presentation, supporting activities and an at-home challenge. The goal was to
have students submit photos, videos, drawings and written descriptions of the
things they were doing at home to live more sustainably. As a result of
participation all students will receive a St. Mary Grafton reusable water bottle
to use at home or at school. See their project here.

GOOS stands for Good On One Side. GOOS paper is paper that has been used on
one side, but is still blank and usable on the other side. Using GOOS paper means
ensuring both sides of a piece of paper are used before it is recycled.
●
A GOOS paper bin collects and stores your GOOS paper in a convenient and
accessible place to help ensure it can be used easily. Get creative and decorate your
GOOS bins with a “goose” theme or other eye-catching styles.
●
Join students, teachers, workplaces, and families across the country on the first
Thursday in April to celebrate National GOOS Paper Day.
●
On this day of action, get creative as you learn about responsible paper use and
promote effective ways to reduce, reuse, and recycle paper.
The [Roberta] Bondar Challenge
●
Dr. Roberta Bondar is unique, not just for being the world’s first neurologist in space,
the first Canadian woman in space, or for her pioneering space medicine research.
Academically one of the most distinguished astronauts to have flown in space, Dr.
Bondar is also the only astronaut to use fine art photography to explore and reveal
Earth’s natural environment from the surface.
●
The Bondar Challenge is an opportunity for students to learn about the art of
photography and to discover new perspectives on nature through a camera lens. The
challenge is designed for students aged 6-18. Student entries will be judged in one of
7
three age categories: 6-10; 11-14; or 15-18.

**Begin to introduce new vocabulary. (renewable/non-renewable, biomass (plants, wood,
waste), solar power, wind energy, wave energy, geothermal energy, hydro power)
B. Question Generation
At this point in the inquiry, we want to harness students’ curiosity and build off of
the provocation that has captured their interest by generating meaningful
questions to continue to drive the learning process.
Video
Play the video 100% Renewable Energy and write any new vocabulary on the board with the
accompanying Alternative Energy Pictures.
What questions do your students have about the different types of renewable energies?
Write them down.
C. Knowledge Building
At this stage, students may be ready to engage in a group knowledge building activity. It will
encourage students to open their minds to many alternative ways of thinking about the
provocation and ideas that have been generated thus far in the inquiry process.
Engage in a class Knowledge Building Circles-kindergarten (outside if possible)
Use one of the questions that you generated after the video to do a Knowledge Building
Circle.
Possible Umbrella Question:
●
What alternative energy do you think is the best one to use? Why?
D. Determining Understanding
At this stage of the inquiry, use responses to inform and guide the learning
process. They can provide insight into which concepts need clarity, what
students are already well informed about, and a general direction that students want to
pursue.
At this point in the inquiry you may decide to use a tool such as PMI strategy .
How Can Plus Minus Interesting Strategy be Used in The Classroom?
School Walk
2
Have students take a walk through and around their own school and share what they believe
is a plus, minus or something interesting around energy use.
PLUS
MINUS
INTERESTING
List all of the positive ideas
that you noticed about
energy in and around your
school.
List all of the negative ideas
or problems that you noticed
about energy in and around
your school.
List all of the interesting
ideas, neither positive or
negative, that came from
your walk through and
around the school.
Draw, write or record your thoughts on an iPad or journal.
E. Pursuing Learning
At this stage, students may begin research to pursue a question that has been
generated, or the following activity could be integrated into the process to ensure that
students have an understanding of foundational climate science. The activities listed below
will enrich the understanding of alternative energies and climate change.
Help students understand the importance of inventions and share examples of students who
have already created inventions to help climate change.
Video
This video is for junior students, it is suggested that you stop it often to help the younger
students identify the problems and solutions.
Invention
Inventors see a problem and try to come up with a solution. Inventions can also make the
world a better place. Use the video Engineering Design Kindergarten Science (Ask, Learn
More, Create, Improve) to encourage students to design and construct something that will
help with energy and climate change. Have older students label their Invention/Design Idea.
After they have illustrated their design, they can create a prototype (simple model based on
a design). This prototype can be made from any material they choose (e.g., playdough, clay,
pipe cleaners, recycled materials).
These challenges are taken from or adapted from Little Inventors.
●
Choose three to five that you like and give the students a choice.
●
Invent a machine to reduce the amount of electricity we use.
●
Invent a new way to travel that uses less energy.
●
Invent a way to create energy through exercising.

F. Consolidation
This step is designed to encourage students to integrate and synthesize key
ideas. When students make connections and see relationships within and across lessons, it
helps them to solidify knowledge and deepen their understanding.
Create an Inventors Museum
Invite another classroom to come to your Inventors Museum.
●
Option 1: Each group will have to explain their invention and how it works to the
different groups of students.
●
Option 2: Each group will try to sell it to another class. They will need to explain why
it is important for climate change and why they should buy it.
Schools — Canadian Multicultural Inventors Museum
Assessment Idea
Teachers will assess learning at different points throughout the inquiry using multiple
methods. The following assessment provides an alternative evaluation method to standard
quizzes and tests, that can be used after consolidation or at any point in the lesson to check
for understanding.
4
Create Your Own “Green School”
Provide a picture of your school to each pair of students or small group in your class. Each
group can add changes to the school that they believe will make the school “greener” and
help with climate change. Have them present their thinking to the principal /superintendent
/custodians or any other stakeholders.
Take Action
Allowing time for students to take action is an essential part of the learning process on
climate change, as it empowers students and eases their eco anxiety.
These ideas for action can be utilized at any point in the learning process, whether it's now
or after completing more guided inquiries. Please note that the suggestions are consistent in
each chapter. Remind students that even when things get hard and seem so big they can
always do something by taking action. Their actions will create an impact.
You might introduce the idea of students taking action by sharing the following YouTube
“Climate Change Song”:
If they need some ideas of simple and immediate measures they can implement you can
share this document from Direct Energy.  While it is written for parents, students can get the
idea of something that would be attainable for themselves - or to share with their families!
Ideas to Think Green
Ask the students what they want to do to positively impact climate change. List their ideas
and come up with a plan to put their action in place.
Ideas for Taking Action:
●
Model green behaviour - use a reusable water bottle, actively recycle, compost, bring
your bags to the grocer, bring your mug to the coffee shop, repair things that need
mending, buy second-hand when applicable, pack a litterless lunch, use cloth
napkins, use toxic-free cleaners (or make your own), walk or bike instead of driving

Take Action
A. Provocation
To hook student interest and get them thinking, introduce a provocation to get
them thinking about what it means to be green.
Song
Have the students listen to the song Sesame Street: It's Not Easy Being Green (Kermit's Song)
Muppets - Kermit - It's not easy being green (original)
Either share the Kermit the Frog - It's Not Easy Being Green Lyrics
on overhead projector or
write the lyrics out on large poster paper.
*Students are very literal at this age. This helps them understand that the song can be interpreted many ways
and introduces the concept of “being green”.
Possible Questions:
●
What message is Kermit trying to say?
●
What do you think Kermit means by “It’s Not Easy Being Green”? Is he right?
●
After listening to the song, do you think you would like to be “green”? Why?
B. Question Generation
At this point in the inquiry, we want to harness students’ curiosity and build off of the
provocation by generating meaningful questions to continue to drive the learning process. Below
are some suggestions for guiding students in creating questions that will drive their inquiry on
their understanding of being “green” and being climate champions.
Kermit doesn’t want to be green at the beginning of the song but changes his mind at the end.
1
Use Five Ws and an H and developing higher order questions (Who, What, Where, When, Why
and How) to get the students thinking about being green.
Example:
●
Who can be “green”?
●
What does it mean to be “green”?
●
Where are “green” people?
●
When is a good time to be “green”?
●
Why would you want to be “green”?
●
How do I start to be “green”?
C. Knowledge Building
At this stage, students may be ready to engage in a knowledge building activity. It will
encourage students to open their minds to many alternative ways of thinking about the
provocation and ideas that have been generated thus far in the inquiry process.
Sketch Map
Engage students in the Doodling and sketching strategy. The purpose of this strategy is to
begin to understand what “green” means to them. Have them work on their own, in pairs or as a
class to sketch some of their ideas. They can add to their sketch or the group sketch throughout
the inquiry.
Possible questions:
●
What does it mean to be green?
●
Is it easy being green?
D. Determining Understanding
At this stage of the inquiry, use responses to inform and guide the learning process. They can
provide insight into which concepts need clarity, what students are already well informed about,
and a general direction that students want to pursue.
After spending some time learning about being “green”, share this book and reflect on their
understanding to determine next steps.
Book
Teach kids sustainability: What Does it Mean to be Green? By: Rana Diorio, illustrated by
Chris Blair
2
“In this empowering book, a young boy and girl discover amazing facts (like how our food travels an
average of 1,500 miles to be on our plate!) and explore all the different ways they―and we―can
help protect the Earth's most precious resources to save the planet and live "green" lifestyles.”
(Rana Diorio)
As a class, come up with several  IF- THEN statements about what it means to be “green”. Write
their statements on poster paper and decorate them.  Have the students decide where each of
the statements should be put in the classroom or in the school to remind everyone of the
importance of being “green”.
Example:
If we use the bottle filling station then we save water.The students may decide to put this above
the bottle filling station in the school hall.
E. Pursuing Learning
At this stage, students may begin research to pursue a question that has been
generated, or the following activity could be integrated into the process to ensure
that students have an understanding of foundational climate science. The activity
listed below will enrich the understanding of being green and becoming climate champions.
Book
Read: What Matters By Alison Hughes, illustrated by Holly Hatam find the read along version
here!
“What happens when one small boy picks up one small piece of litter? He doesn't know it, but
his tiny act has big consequences. From the miniscule to the universal, What Matters sensitively
explores nature's connections and traces the ripple effects of one child’s good deed to show
how we can all make a big difference.”(Alison Huges)
AND
Read: I AM ONE- A Book Of Action! By Susan Verde, illustrated by Peter H. Reynolds by
“One seed to start a garden, one note to start a melody, one brick to start breaking down walls:
Every movement and moment of change starts with purpose, with intention, with one. With me.
With you.” Peter H Reynolds.
Experiment
Drop a rock in a pan of water so that the students can see the ripple effect. Ask the students
what they notice. Explain that when a rock is thrown, there is a movement in the water that
widens and expands. Like the rock, our actions and words can have far reaching effects.
Possible questions:
●
What is the relationship between the boy and the ripple that the rock caused?
3
●
Why is a tiny act important?
●
What tiny act have you done that you think helped another species?
Climate Champions Book
Create a book together. Each child creates a page for their book illustrating an action they would
like to take to become a climate champion. Decide on the title for your book.
Possible title: Climate Champions!
F. Consolidation
This step is designed to encourage students to integrate and synthesize key ideas. When
students make connections and see relationships within and across lessons, it helps them to
solidify knowledge and deepen their understanding.
There are many ways that we can help the earth, animals and people. Let’s start to answer the
question “Is it easy being green?” by creating something that will immediately help our
environment and help stop climate change.
Seed Bombs
These wildflower seed bombs are made with local species and natural clay and are thrown into
natural spaces anytime of the year. When Spring arrives and the rain washes away the clay, it
leaves the wildflower seeds which will hopefully grow and encourage different insects and
wildlife to the area. The students will start to understand another important and easy way to be
“green” and how much we rely on pollinators.
Suggestion: focus on specific seeds so that you can help certain species in your area.
E.g., milkweed seeds for Monarch butterflies
**Have the students take pictures and short videos of the process so that they will be able to
create and share their videos with other students.
Assessment Idea
Teachers will assess learning at different points throughout the inquiry using multiple methods.
The following assessment provides an alternative evaluation method to standard quizzes and
tests, that can be used after consolidation or at any point in the lesson to check for
understanding.

Student-Created Videos in the Classroom | Edutopia
●
Learning product videos
●
Response videos
●
Reflection videos
●
Tutorial videos
Have the students create a video or take pictures and do a voice over to demonstrate their
learning. The students show how they made seedballs, where they threw or want to throw them
and what they hope will happen. They can finish the video by explaining why they think this will
help the climate.
Take Action:
Allowing time for students to take action is an essential part of the learning process on climate
change, as it empowers students and eases their eco anxiety.
These ideas for action can be utilized at any point in the learning process, whether it's now or
after completing more guided inquiries. Please note that the suggestions are consistent in each
chapter. Remind students that even when things get hard and seem so big they can always do
something by taking action. Their actions will create an impact.
You might introduce the idea of students taking action by sharing the following YouTube
“Climate Change Song”
Ask the students what they want to do to positively impact climate change. List their ideas and
come up with a plan to put their action in place.
Ideas for Taking Action:
●
Model green behaviour - use a reusable water bottle, actively recycle, compost, bring
your bags to the grocer, bring your mug to the coffee shop, repair things that need
mending, buy second-hand when applicable, pack a litterless lunch, use cloth napkins,
use toxic-free cleaners (or make your own), walk or bike instead of driving when possible
- these are just some basic ideas. Check out Ideas to Think Green for more suggestions.

National GOOS paper Day
GOOS stands for Good On One Side. GOOS paper is paper that has been used on one side,
but is still blank and usable on the other side. Using GOOS paper means ensuring both sides of
a piece of paper are used before it is recycled.
A GOOS paper bin collects and stores your GOOS paper in a convenient and accessible place
to help ensure it can be used easily. Get creative and decorate your GOOS bins with a “goose”
theme or other eye-catching styles.
Join students, teachers, workplaces, and families across the country on the first Thursday in
April to celebrate National GOOS Paper Day.
On this day of action, get creative as you learn about responsible paper use and promote
effective ways to reduce, reuse, and recycle paper.
