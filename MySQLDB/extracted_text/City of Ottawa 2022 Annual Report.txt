Land Acknowledgement 
We acknowledge that Ottawa is built on 
unceded Anishinabe Algonquin territory. 
The peoples of the Anishinabe Algonquin 
Nation have lived on this territory for 
millennia. Their culture and presence have 
nurtured and continue to nurture this land. 
The City of Ottawa honours the peoples 
and land of the Anishinabe Algonquin 
Nation, and honours all First Nations, 
Inuit and Métis peoples and their valuable 
past and present contributions to this land. 
The City of Ottawa is committed to a 
renewed focus on Indigenous Rights and 
reconciliation, and to building reciprocal 
relationships with the Anishinabe Algonquin 
Host Nation, Urban Indigenous First 
Nations, Inuit, and Métis communities. 
On February 28, 2018, Ottawa City Council 
approved the adoption of a Reconciliation 
Action Plan, which was developed to align 
with the spirit and intent of the Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) Calls 
to Action. By March 2022, all 14 actions 
established in the 2018 Reconciliation 
Action Plan were completed or ongoing. 
As a municipality, we have a responsibility 
to implement policy decisions in a manner 
that is consistent with the recognition of 
constitutionally protected Aboriginal and 
Treaty Rights. We are continuing to learn 
how to apply principles of the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples (UNDRIP), Indigenous sovereignty, 
self-determination, and reciprocity.

2022 Annual Report 
Message from 
the Mayor 
Investing in our people and 
communities is the best way 
to thrive as a city. We have 
all gone through a lot over 
the past few years, but we’ve 
turned a corner in Ottawa. 
I see evidence of this every 
day as I meet residents and 
have discussions with local 
business owners. The buzz 
is back. And we need to keep 
the momentum going. 
As your mayor, one key area 
of focus for me has been 
infrastructure investment. 
I firmly believe that investing in 
our city’s core infrastructure is 
crucial to supporting Ottawa’s 
economy. Allocating resources 
to develop and enhance our 
infrastructure generates more 
opportunities for development, 
employment, and investment 
in our city. These investments 
not only provide a boost to our 
local economy, but they also 
establish a solid foundation to 
support our retail and service 
industries and strengthen our 
overall community. 
The returns from infrastructure 
investments go beyond 
mere financial gains. They 
contribute to the overall  
well-being and prosperity  
of the residents in Ottawa.  
By creating a vibrant 
and resilient city and 
an environment where 
businesses can thrive, jobs 
can flourish, and residents 
can enjoy an enhanced 
quality of life – we all win. 
As you delve into this annual 
report, I invite you to explore 
the achievements, milestones, 
and strategies that have driven 
our city’s progress over the 
past year.

I am pleased to present 
the 2022 Annual Report for 
the City of Ottawa, which 
continues to reflect the City’s 
history of sound financial 
management and strong 
fiscal performance. The City 
started to recover from the 
impacts of the pandemic in 
2022, in all areas except 
for Transit. Transit’s return 
to pre-pandemic ridership 
levels has been steady 
but slow, particularly with 
Federal government workers 
continuing remote work and 
who make up a significant 
portion of Ottawa’s transit 
riders. For all other services, 
we have seen a return to 
near normal operations. 
By the end of 2022 most 
community and recreational 
2022 Annual Report 
Message from the

centre operations were back 
up and running, although 
participation, registration and 
rental levels had not returned 
to pre-pandemic levels. There 
were exceptions where a few 
facilities continued to be used 
for social distancing shelters 
throughout the year as the 
City continued to support the 
needs of our community. 
Ottawa’s economy also 
continued to improve. 
Unemployment rates were 
lower than the National and 
Provincial averages and 
housing starts increased 
from the previous year. The 
most significant impact on the 
City’s finances has been the 
increase in borrowing rates 
for the issuance of any new 
debt and inflation. Two of the 
City’s most significant projects 
were already contracted and 
underway in 2022, Stage 2 of 
the Light Rail Transit system 
and our new central library –  
Ādisōke. Stage 2 of our 
expanding LRT system is one 
of many major infrastructure 
projects that will help keep our 
economy and future job market 
moving forward. 
The City of Ottawa has always 
prided itself on its strong fiscal 
framework. Tax increases 
have remained low compared 
to other municipalities, staff 
implemented mitigation 
measures throughout the 
pandemic and into 2022 
to minimize discretionary 
spending, defer non-critical 
capital projects, leverage 
COVID-19 funding support 
from senior levels of 
government and reduce 
operations where required  
to better align with need. 
S&P upgraded the City’s 
rating from AA to AA+ 
 
on June 1, 2022 and, as 
reported by Moody’s, “The 
City of Ottawa’s Aaa debt 
rating and stable outlook 
reflect a track record of 
6 Annual Report 2022 | City of Ottawa 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
positive Fiscal outcomes, 
a manageable debt burden, 
strong liquidity and a stable 
economic base.” 
The City was also successful 
in securing funding from 
the Federal government to 
support our conversion of 
350 diesel buses to new 
zero-emission electric buses 
over the next four years. We 
also had an eventful year 
with two large scale national 
demonstrations that took 
place in Ottawa and the May 
2022 Derecho. The costs 
incurred by the City from that 
storm were the highest of all 
natural disasters experienced 
to date. As part of this year’s 
annual report, I am proud to 
introduce a new section: Task 
Force on Climate-Related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD). 
The TCFD summarizes the 
City’s climate-related actions, 
strategies, and financial 
impacts to help stakeholders 
and decision-makers 
understand how the City is 
responding to climate-related 
risks and opportunities.   
I am very proud of the 
changes we have made to 
our annual report this year 
and I hope the readers of  
this report find it informative.

Our City 
The City of Ottawa is Canada’s capital. Located in eastern Ontario, Ottawa is the 
fourth largest urban region in Canada and is home to 1 million people. Although Ottawa 
is recognized for being the epicenter of the federal government and bustling downtown 
core, it is also known for its beautiful countryside, and other rural attractions. The City 
of Ottawa spans across 2,796 km², which is larger than the cities of Calgary, Edmonton, 
Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal combined, and is a blend of urban, suburban and 
rural communities.

Introduction 
The City of Ottawa’s 2022 Annual Report contains the audited 
consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with 
Canadian public sector accounting standards established by 
the Public Sector Accounting Board [‘PSAB’] of the Chartered 
Professional Accountants of Canada [“CPA Canada”], as 
required by the Ontario Municipal Act. 
The City of Ottawa administration is 
responsible for preparing the following 
financial statement discussion and analysis 
(FSD&A). It should be read in conjunction with 
the audited consolidated financial statements 
and the financial and statistical schedules. 
The FSD&A reports to stakeholders on how 
the financial resources entrusted to the City 
are being managed to provide municipal 
infrastructure and services. It presents 
significant activities that affected 2022 results 
or that may have an impact on future results.

Consolidated Statement 
of Financial Position 
The statement of financial position reports the financial and non-financial assets, including 
tangible capital assets (TCA), available to the City. It also lists the City’s obligations in the  
form of liabilities, including debt. As the City’s total assets are greater than its liabilities,  
the statement shows an accumulated surplus.

Financial assets 
Financial assets are comprised of cash or items that can be 
turned into cash to discharge existing liabilities or finance future 
operations. The City’s financial assets includes cash and cash 
equivalents, accounts receivable, investments, investment in 
government business enterprise [GBE] and loan receivable.

Financial assets totaled $4.49 billion at the end of 2022, increasing 
by $351.8 million (8.49%) from the previous year. The major 
changes were increases to cash and cash equivalents  
($72.8 million), accounts receivable ($181.1 million) and 
investments ($85.4 million). The increase to cash and 
cash equivalents and investments were due to the use of 
promissory notes to cover cash outflows as compared to 
the previous year, as well as capital deferrals and other 
discretionary spending savings which allowed more funds to 
be held as investments. Accounts receivable increased mainly 
due to cost recoveries for policing due to two major downtown 
demonstrations, Transit Safe Restart funding for the recovery 
of 2022 expenditures and lost revenues due to COVID-19, as 
well as 2022 COVID vaccine funding.

Liabilities 
Liabilities represent obligations that must 
be paid over the short and long term. The 
City’s liabilities include accounts payable 
and accrued liabilities, deferred revenue, 
employee future benefits and pension 
agreements, environmental liabilities,  
net long-term debt and other liabilities.

$1,147,279 (16%) 
These liabilities totaled $7.24 billion at the end 
of 2022, an increase of $506.2 million (7.51%) 
from the previous year. The major changes 
were increases to accounts payable and 
accrued liabilities ($194.2 million), deferred 
revenue ($135.5 million), and net long-term 
debt ($171.9 million). The increase to accounts 
payable and accrued liabilities related primarily 
to a short-term promissory note that was issued 
in 2022 and was due to mature in 2023, as well 
as for childcare, where the 2022 revised funding 
was received late in the year and resulted in 
amounts not yet paid out to childcare providers. 
Deferred revenue increased due to higher 
development charges revenues, as well as 
government funding that was received in 2022 
but not yet recognized as revenue. Net long­
term debt increased due to $308.7 million of 
new debt issues and loans, which was offset 
by $136.8 million of debt principal repayment. 
Net debt 
Net debt is comprised of the difference between 
financial liabilities and the City’s financial assets. 
It is a measure of future revenues required to 
pay for past transactions. Net debt increased  
by $154.4 million during 2022. 
Non-financial assets 
Non-financial assets are comprised primarily 
of tangible capital assets which represents the 
largest item on the City’s consolidated statement 
of financial position. As tangible capital assets 
do not provide liquidity, and are generally 
used to deliver government services, they are 
reported separately along with inventories and 
prepaid expenses, as non-financial assets. 
Tangible Capital Assets 
Tangible capital assets represent a 
significant investment for the City and the 
related information is vital for stewardship, 
accountability, costing and the development of 
asset management plans. Assets are valued 
at their historical cost on the date of purchase 
or construction and are amortized over their 
useful lives. The residual net book value (NBV) 
of these assets represents the value of the 
assets available to serve future generations.

The City’s tangible capital assets consist primarily of water and wastewater infrastructure, roads, 
land, light rail transit (LRT), buildings, and machinery, plant and equipment. Costs associated with 
construction of Stage 2 of LRT are included in assets under construction until it is put into service.

The net book value of the City’s tangible capital assets at December 31, 2022 was $20.9 billion 
and increased by 6.5% compared to the 2021 balance of $19.63 billion. The net increase of 
$1.27 billion is a result of acquisition of tangible capital assets of $1.22 billion and contributions 
of tangible capital assets of $469 million. 
This increase was partially offset by annual amortization of $400 million and disposals of assets 
with a net book value of $21 million. Significant projects that contributed to the  increase of 
tangible capital assets included Stage 2 of LRT ($710 million), road related projects ($182 million) 
and water/wastewater infrastructure ($456 million). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Accumulated surplus 
Accumulated surplus is the primary indicator 
of the financial resources the municipality has 
available to provide future services. It represents 
the net of all the City’s assets (financial and 
non-financial) and liabilities. Accumulated 
surplus increased by $1.120 billion and is 
made up of increases in the city’s investment 
in tangible capital assets of $1.031 billion, 
increases in reserves of $62 million, increases 
in the City’s investment in Hydro Ottawa of 
$20 million, decreases in unfunded liabilities 
of $2 million and a $5 million increase in the 
City’s Endowment fund on a cost basis. 
Consolidated Statement of Operations  
The Consolidated Statement of Operations 
reports on revenues and expenses to 
summarize what transactions have impacted 
the accumulated surplus during the year. 
The budget presentation shown below 
for revenues and expenses follows the 
requirements of Ontario Regulation 284/09 of 
the Municipal Act. The Municipal Act requires 
that municipalities prepare balanced budgets, 
which include estimates of all sums required 
during the year for the purposes of the 
municipality. This means that municipalities 
need to have or raise sufficient funds each 
year, through the setting of tax rates, water 
rates and user fees, to cover the operating  
and capital spending requirements for the year. 
The City of Ottawa, like other municipalities, 
continues to prepare its annual budgets on 
a modified accrual basis, with no anticipated 
surplus or deficit. Modified accrual treats 
certain cash items, including borrowings, the 
initial cost of assets, and debt repayments, as 
revenues and expenses. However, it accrues 
these and other transactions by recognizing 
them at the time they happen, not when the 
cash is received or paid. 
Financial Statement reporting at year-end 
is done on a different basis. The province 
requires municipalities to follow the accounting 
standards set by the Public Sector Accounting 
Board (PSAB) for governments in Canada. 
PSAB recommends that financial statements 
be prepared on a full accrual basis. Under full 
accrual, an organization recognizes revenues 
as they are earned, even if the cash has not 
been received, and expenses are reported 
when they are incurred, even if the invoice 
has not yet been paid. It includes additional 
amounts related to consolidated entities, 
amortization, post employment benefits, future 
liabilities, contributed assets, acquisition of 
assets and transfers to/from reserves. 
Note 23 of the financial statements reconciles 
the approved budget with the budget figures 
reported in this Annual Report and the 
consolidated financial statements using  
the accrual basis of accounting.

Comparison to Budget 
Revenues were higher than budget by $178.3 million mainly due to higher government 
transfers, contributed tangible capital assets, and other revenue. 
Government transfers were higher than budget by $62.9 million mainly related to cost 
recoveries for the National Capital Extraordinary Policing Costs Program that covers unique 
large-scale events. In 2022, that included two major demonstrations that were unforeseen 
events and not budgeted for. 
Contributed tangible capital assets represent assets that are donated or contributed to the 
City by developers. As the timing of the development work varies, it is difficult to precisely 
budget the amount that will be contributed to the City. 
Other revenue was higher than budget by $41.4 million due to the Better Homes Loan 
Program, increase in funds received for water and wastewater projects, more cash-in-lieu 
projects, land sales and a change in accounting policy for social housing.

Comparison to Prior Year 
Revenues were higher by $132.4 million 
when compared to the prior year mainly due 
to increases in taxes available for municipal 
purposes, fees and user charges, and other 
revenue. This is partially offset by lower 
government transfers, contributed tangible 
capital assets and development charges. 
Taxes available for municipal purposes 
increased by $114.9 million mainly due to 
the 3% tax levy increase, an increase in the 
assessment base due to new properties, 
as well as an increase in hotel tax as hotel 
accommodations started to return to  
pre-COVID-19 levels. 
Fees and user charges increased by 
$100.3 million. Transit fare revenue 
increased as residents physically returned 
back to work ($42.1 million), water and 
sewer revenue increased due to rate 
increases ($13.8 million) and recreation 
revenue increased as facilities and programs 
started to return to normal operations after 
COVID-19 ($20.9 million). 
Other revenue increased by $61.8 million 
due to the Better Homes Loan Program, 
an increase in the number of cash-in-lieu 
projects, increases in the sale of surplus land, 
increase in the amount received for water 
and wastewater projects, increase in BIA 
grants and corporate sponsorship, as 
well as a change in accounting policy 
for social housing. 
Government transfers decreased by 
$52.9 million which was mainly made up 
of decreases in COVID-19 related funding 
($137.7 million) such as the Safe Restart and 
vaccination programs, one-time payment for 
federal gas tax funding that was received in 
2021 but not in 2022 ($57.0 million) as well 
as decreases in capital funding for various 
programs ($25.8 million) such as Light Rail 
cost recovery funding for Stage 2 and Federal 
Public Transit Infrastructure Funding (PTIF). 
These were offset by increases in the National 
Capital Extraordinary Policing Costs Program 
($52.2 million), new childcare programs for 
Canada Wide Early Learning and Child Care 
System including one time funding initiatives 
($71.2 million), social services funding related 
to increased caseloads ($18.4 million) and 
an accounting policy change for OCHC which 
records forgivable loans as government 
grants ($25.8 million). 
Contributed tangible capital assets. In 
2022, contributed tangible capital assets 
decreased by $62.8 million. The amounts 
vary from year-to-year based on the timing 
of development work. 
Development Charges decreased by  
$40.0 million. Development charges revenue 
is not recognized until the funds are spent 
for their intended purposes, so revenue 
recognized each year can fluctuate.

Comparison to Budget 
Roads, traffic and parking expenses were lower than budgeted mainly due 
to lower than anticipated maintenance costs and lower amortization costs. 
Transit expenses were lower than budgeted due to reduced expenditures  
mainly attributable to staffing vacancies, reduced amortization as well as lower 
maintenance costs. 
Environmental services expenses were lower than budgeted due to savings related  
to staffing vacancies and fewer emergency repairs. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Comparison to Prior Year 
Protection to persons and property increased by $45 million 
in 2022 to $709 million mainly due to additional policing costs 
that were incurred for the two downtown demonstrations. 
Roads, traffic and parking increased by $24 million in 
2022 to $446 million mainly due to the cleanup costs for the 
derecho that occurred in May 2022, as well as higher winter 
maintenance and fleet costs. 
Transit increased by $45 million in 2022 to $765 million due 
to additional costs related to COVID-19, as well as additional 
costs related to the downtown demonstrations which caused 
disruptions to the transit routes. 
Environmental services increased by $34 million in 2022 to 
$486 million due to increases in repairs and maintenance 
expenditures and higher amortization expenses. 
Social and family services increased by $106 million in 
2022 to $609 million due to higher number of caseloads 
and benefits, and higher childcare expenditures due to the 
introduction of the Canada Wide Early Learning and Child 
Care System. 
Social housing increased by $103 million in 2022 to 
$458 million due to higher program costs and increased 
costs associated with affordable rental housing, including 
increased operating and capital expenditures related to 
the Ottawa Community Housing Corporation. 
Recreation and cultural services increased by $26 million 
in 2022 to $373 million mainly due to the lifting of COVID-19 
restrictions that saw more facilities and programs return to 
normal operations.

Reserves  
Reserves are an essential tool for municipalities 
to finance capital projects, mitigate financial 
risks and maintain essential services. The 
management of reserves is an important 
factor in the City’s overall financial position 
as they influence financial sustainability and 
financial flexibility. Reserves are established 
by Council through by-laws, which outline the 
purpose, operation, and eligible expenditures 
of a specific reserve. Reserves represent prior 
year or current year surpluses that are to be 
used for purposes that are mandated by the 
Council approved by-laws. The balance of the 
reserves is included in the City’s accumulated 
surplus and is the largest component of the 
accumulated surplus after the City’s $17.5B 
invested in tangible capital assets. 
The City of Ottawa uses a portfolio-based 
approach to manage reserves. Combining 
reserves used for similar purposes reduces 
the overall risk by providing much greater 
flexibility to manage fluctuations or respond 
to unexpected events. The three portfolios of 
discretionary reserves are: Operating, Capital, 
and Combined Operating and Capital. 
Operating Reserves are generally used to 
stabilize or mitigate the impact of one-time 
expenditures, deficits and unexpected or 
emergency events, or to accumulate funds 
for future liabilities. Capital Reserves are 
generally used to fund capital works. When  
a project is approved, the funds are put aside 
and can be invested by the City until spent. 
Combined operating and capital reserves 
allow the flexibility to manage volatility of 
operations as well as fund capital works. 
In addition to the three portfolios of discretionary 
reserve funds, the City also maintains a portfolio 
of restricted reserve funds, which includes 
Federal and Provincial Gas Tax. These reserves 
are required by provincial statues or contractual 
agreements and can only be used for their 
intended purpose. 
Reserves are a critical component of the 
City’s long term financial plan. To provide 
flexibility, liquidity, remain sustainable, and 
mitigate against extraordinary measures, 
the City has target minimum and maximum 
balances that are maintained to ensure the 
City’s financial strength. 
As at December 31, 2022, the City’s reserves 
increased by $62 million (from $680 million 
in 2021 to $742 million in 2022), which 
represents an increase of 9.1 per cent.

Net Long-term Debt  
Use of Debt 
Long-term debt is an important source of 
capital financing for the City to be able to 
grow and maintain its assets in a state of 
good repair. Provincial legislation limits 
the use of long-term debt to financing the 
construction or acquisition of capital assets 
that have been approved by Council in 
the Capital Budget. Using long-term debt 
conservatively in this way has three  
main benefits: 
1 . The upfront cost of capital projects is 
aligned with the useful life of the assets. 
This improves intergenerational equity 
by enabling future taxpayers to pay for 
assets that they benefit from. 
2 . It can advance the timing of capital 
projects that are needed to maintain or 
enhance municipal service delivery when 
internal or external funding is limited. 
3 . Municipalities have access to debenture 
financing with fixed interest rates for 
the entire term of the debt. When 
interest rates are lower than the rate of 
construction inflation, it actually costs 
less on a net present value basis to fund 
a capital project with debt and spend 
sooner to avoid a higher cost later due  
to inflation and other risk factors. 
As at December 31, 2022, the City had 
$3.21 billion in net long-term debt, which was 
an increase of $172 million from the prior year. 
The City issued $308.7 million in new long-term 
debt in 2022 to finance various capital projects 
and programs including a $200 million Green 
Bond to fund LRT Phase 2, $20 million for other 
transit projects, $23.7 million for roads and 
bridges, $39.7 million for sanitary and storm 
sewers, and $2.6 million for environmental 
services. The City also entered into new loan 
agreements to finance the Better Homes  
Loan Program and Zero Emission Buses  
and received $22.7 million in loan draws. 
Net long-term debt outstanding represents 
15% of the City’s tangible capital assets that 
total $20.90 billion (based upon net book 
value). From a homeowner perspective, this 
is the equivalent of having a $90 thousand 
mortgage on a $600 thousand home. 
As shown in Figure 7, the City’s net long-term 
debt has grown in proportion to the growth 
of the City’s tangible capital asset base. 
But most of the City’s capital needs are 
funded through other sources, such as 
cash reserves, development charges, 
grants, and other capital revenues.

The City of Ottawa Green Bond Program  
The City of Ottawa was the first municipality in 
Canada to issue a Green Bond. Green Bonds 
are an innovative form of debt financing 
that demonstrates the City’s commitment to 
climate change. Proceeds are used to finance 
capital projects that promote environmental 
sustainability by adapting to the effects of 
Debt Levels 
Debt levels are carefully monitored through 
the City’s Long-Range Financial Plans to 
ensure the ongoing financial well-being of 
the City is maintained in accordance with 
its fiscal framework principles. Conservative 
debt servicing ratio targets are set by Council 
for both tax and rate-supported programs. 
The ratio represents the share of own-source 
revenues that can be used to pay principal 
and interest payments on issued debt. 
Rate-supported programs include water, 
wastewater, and stormwater services. 
Own-source revenues include those collected 
through the water bill. Tax-supported programs 
include those funded primarily from property 
taxes such as transportation, transit, recreation, 
library, and police services. Own-source 
revenues for tax programs include property 
climate change or by reducing greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions. To date the City  
has issued five Green Bonds totalling over  
$1 billion to finance LRT projects. As of 2022, 
the City was the second largest municipal 
issuer and fourth largest government issuer  
of Green Bonds in Canada. 
taxes, payment in lieu of taxes and user fees. 
Debt that is repaid with either development 
charges or gas taxes are not included in tax 
or rate-supported programs but are included 
in the City’s consolidated debt servicing ratio 
that is regulated by the Provincial Repayment 
Limit. Government transfers, contributed 
tangible capital assets and development charge 
revenues are excluded from all calculations. 
As demonstrated in Table 6, the City is 
well below each of the limits. The ratios 
decreased from the prior year due to the 
continued growth in own-source revenues and 
by taking advantage of historically low interest 
rates seen in the past couple of years. The 
ratios indicate the City’s strong ability to meet 
its debt obligations while also being able to 
meet on-going service mandates.

Sinking Fund 
Another distinguishing characteristic of the 
City’s debt is the use of a sinking fund, which 
is required by Provincial legislation. 
The City makes annual contributions to the 
Sinking Fund where it is then invested in 
line with its Investment Policy approved by 
Council. The duration of the sinking fund 
investments align with the repayment period 
of the long-term debt allowing the City to 
better manage interest rate risk associated 
with the portfolio. The contributions and the 
investment income are used to settle the 
various debt obligations at their maturity. 
This year the Sinking Fund generated  
$7 million in investment income (2021 –  
$4.6 million). The weighted average  
yield to maturity on the par value of 
investments held at December 31, 2022  
is 3.560% (2021 – 3.199%). The City’s 
Sinking Fund Financial Statements show  
a surplus fund balance of $1.1 million  
(2021 – $0.45 million), which means the  
City is on track to settle long term debt 
obligations as they come due. The financial 
assets of the Sinking Fund total $265.8 million 
(2021 – $186.9 million) and are consolidated 
into the City’s Financial Statements and are 
shown as an offset to the City’s long-term 
debt obligation. 
Credit Rating 
The City of Ottawa is rated by two international 
credit rating agencies: Moody’s Investors 
Service (Moody’s) and Standard & Poor’s 
Ratings Services (S&P). They use varying 
methodologies and analyze both financial and 
non-financial information to provide a neutral 
third-party assessment of the City’s ability to 
meet its financial obligations. 
A credit rating plays an important role in 
enabling the City to issue debt and affects 
the interest rate on borrowing. Generally, a 
municipality with a higher credit rating will 
pay a lower interest rate, so it is important for 
a municipality to obtain and maintain strong 
credit ratings. 
In 2022, Moody’s affirmed the City’s Aaa 
rating, which is the highest possible ranking, 
that the City has maintained since 1975. 
S&P upgraded the City’s very strong rating 
in 2022 from AA to AA+, based on its strong 
financial management, stable revenue 
generation, strong budgetary performance, 
and exceptional liquidity.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT 
The integrity, relevance and comparability of the data in the accompanying consolidated 
financial statements are the responsibility of management of the City of Ottawa [the "City"]. 
The consolidated financial statements are prepared by management, in accordance with 
Canadian public sector accounting standards established by the Public Sector Accounting 
Board of the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada. The consolidated financial 
statements necessarily include some amounts that are based on the best estimates and 
judgments of management. Financial data elsewhere in the report is consistent with that in 
the consolidated financial statements. 
To assist in its responsibility, management maintains accounting, budget and other 
controls to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are appropriately authorized, 
that assets are properly accounted for and safeguarded, and that financial records are 
reliable for the preparation of consolidated financial statements. 
The Auditor General's office reports directly to City Council ["Council"] and, on an ongoing 
basis, carries out its audit program to ensure internal controls and their application are 
reviewed and financial information is tested and independently verified. 
Council fulfils its responsibility for financial reporting through its Audit Committee and the 
Finance and Corporate Services Committee. 
Ernst & Young LLP, Chartered Professional Accountants, have been appointed by Council 
to express an opinion on the City's consolidated financial statements. Their report follows.

Independent auditor’s report 
To the Mayor and Members of Council 
Opinion 
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of the City of Ottawa [the “City”], which comprise the consolidated 
statement of financial position as at December 31, 2022, and the consolidated statement of operations and accumulated 
surplus, the consolidated statement of change in net debt and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then 
ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. 
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated 
financial position of the City as at December 31, 2022, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated 
cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Canadian public sector accounting standards. 
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements 
section of our report.  We are independent of the City in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the consolidated financial statements in Canada, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion. 
Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the consolidated financial statements 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance 
with Canadian public sector accounting standards, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary 
to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error. 
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the City’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the City or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative 
but to do so. 
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the City’s financial reporting process. 
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with 
Canadian generally accepted auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment 
and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud 
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the City’s 
internal control. 

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by management. 

Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant 
doubt on the City’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are 
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, 
if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the City to cease to continue 
as a going concern. 

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in 
a manner that achieves fair presentation. 

Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities 
within the City to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. 
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of 
the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our 
audit.

1. 
Nature of business 
The City of Ottawa [the “City”] was created through provincial legislation on
December 20, 1999 and commenced operations on January 1, 2001.
The City is responsible for providing municipal services such as employment and 
financial assistance; long-term care; community services and libraries; emergency and 
protective services including police, fire and ambulance; and transportation, utilities 
and public works, including roads, sewers and wastewater, drinking water, waste 
collection and disposal. 
As sole shareholder of Hydro Ottawa Holding Inc. [“Hydro Ottawa”] and the Ottawa 
Community Housing Corporation [“OCHC”], the City also provides hydro and housing 
services to the residents of Ottawa. In 2009, the Ottawa Community Lands 
Development and the Manotick Mill Quarter Community Development Corporations 
were created for the purpose of promoting and undertaking community improvements 
in the City by managing real property.

Significant accounting policies 
Basis of accounting 
The consolidated financial statements are prepared by management in accordance 
with Canadian public sector accounting standards established by the Public Sector 
Accounting Board [“PSAB”] of the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada.

Significant accounting policies [continued]
  Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements of the City reflect the assets, liabilities, revenue 
and expenses for the activities of all committees of City Council [“Council”] and the 
following boards, Business Improvement Areas [“BIAs”] and entities: 
The Police Services Board 
The Ottawa Public Library Board 
The Ottawa Board of Health 
The Ottawa Community Housing 
Corporation 
Manotick Mill Quarter Community 
Development Corporation 
Ottawa Community Lands

The Preston Street BIA 
The Byward Market BIA 
The Downtown Rideau BIA 
The Barrhaven BIA 
The Wellington West BIA 
The Kanata North BIA 
The Bells Corners BIA 
The Kanata Central BIA 
All interfund assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses have been eliminated. 
Condensed supplementary information for the Ottawa Public Library Board is provided 
in Appendix 1. 
Hydro Ottawa and its subsidiaries are accounted for on a modified equity basis, 
consistent with the generally accepted accounting treatment for government business 
enterprises [see note 5]. These corporations follow International Financial Reporting 
Standards [“IFRS”]. Under the modified equity basis, the business enterprise’s 
accounting policies are not adjusted to conform to those of the City, and inter-
organizational transactions and balances are not eliminated. Other comprehensive 
income or loss of the enterprise is recorded directly to the City’s accumulated surplus 
and net debt. 
School boards 
The taxation, other revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities with respect to the 
operations of the school boards are not reflected in these consolidated financial 
statements as school boards are separate entities and the City does not control or 
have any involvement in the operations of school boards.

Significant accounting policies [continued] 
Use of estimates and measurement uncertainty 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Canadian 
public sector accounting standards requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions on such areas as employee benefits liabilities, property tax assessment 
appeals, legal claims provisions, landfill closure and post-closure liabilities, liabilities 
for contaminated sites, and contributed tangible capital assets. These estimates and 
assumptions are based on the City’s best information and judgment and actual 
amounts may differ significantly from these estimates. 
Revenue and expenses 
Revenue and expenses are reported on the accrual basis of accounting, which 
recognizes revenue as it is earned and measurable; expenses are recognized as they 
are incurred and measurable, as a result of receipt of goods or services. 
Tax revenue 
Annually, the City bills and collects property tax revenue for municipal purposes, 
provincial education taxes on behalf of the Province of Ontario [the “Province”], 
payment in lieu of taxes, local improvements and other charges [see note 19]. The 
authority to levy and collect property taxes is established under the Municipal Act, 
2001, the Assessment Act, the Education Act, and other legislation. 
Property tax revenue and associated receivables are recognized when they meet the 
definition of an asset and a revenue; the tax is authorized; and the taxable event has 
occurred. Assessments and the related property taxes are subject to appeal. Tax 
adjustments as a result of appeals are recorded when the result of the appeal process 
is known. 
Government transfers 
Government transfers are transfers from senior levels of government that are not the 
result of an exchange transaction. Government transfers are recognized in the fiscal 
years during which events giving rise to the transfer occur, provided the transfers are 
authorized, eligibility criteria and stipulations have been met and reasonable estimates 
of the amounts can be made. 
In addition, the City provides transfers to individuals or organizations.  These transfers 
are recognized as expenses once they are authorized and eligibility criteria, if any, are 
met.

Significant accounting policies [continued] 
Fees and user charges 
Fees and user charges relate to transit fares; utility charges; water, wastewater, and 
solid waste; licensing fees; fees for use of various programming; and fees imposed 
based on specific activities. Revenue is recognized when the activity is performed or 
when the services are rendered. 
Development charges 
Development charges are one-time fees levied by the City on new residential and non-
residential properties to help fund a portion of the growth-related capital infrastructure. 
The authority to introduce development charges is provided by provincial legislation, 
and the operational details and schedule of charges are outlined in the City’s by-
law. Development charges are determined and accounted for by type of service 
component. The amount of charges varies by dwelling type and by location within the 
City reflecting different actual costs of establishing and providing the service.  The 
underlying intent of development charges is that growth pays for growth and that the 
financing of capital costs required to service new growth does not place a burden on 
existing taxpayers. 
Actual funding transfers to capital projects are made in accordance with regulations 
that stipulate that development charges may only be applied to projects when costs 
are incurred. Growth-related spending authority is approved annually as part of the 
City’s budgeting process, with only those capital projects included in the current 
Development Charges Background Study being eligible for funding. Development 
charge fund balances are monitored annually through the capital budget approval 
process to ensure they are in compliance with the overall policies adopted by Council. 
Development charges are recognized as revenue when the related expenses are 
incurred. 
Investment income 
Investment income is recorded as revenue in the period in which it is earned. 
Investment income also includes income for the City’s Endowment Fund and is 
invested in accordance with the investment policy and procedures adopted by Council. 
Other revenue 
Other revenue includes revenue from land sales, cash in lieu of parkland, and other 
miscellaneous revenue. Amounts received relating to revenue that will be earned in a 
subsequent year are deferred and reported as deferred revenue.

Financial instruments 
The City’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts 
receivable, investments, loan receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, 
accrued interest, net long-term debt, mortgages payable and other liabilities. 
The City uses derivative financial instruments consisting of bank swaps to reduce its 
exposure to interest rate risk related to its debt. The City does not use financial 
instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
The City uses bank swaps to manage commodity price fluctuations. These bank 
swaps are used to set a fixed price for a specific quantity over a defined term and 
settle on specific dates commensurate with the defined term.  Swaps result in a 
payment or receipt of funds to or from the counterparty to the transaction. Gains 
(receipts) or losses (payments) are recognized in the same period as the delivery of 
the underlying commodity. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of 90 days or less from the date when the securities are purchased. 
Investments 
Investments are recorded at amortized cost less amounts written off to reflect a 
permanent decline in value.  Investments consist of authorized investments pursuant 
to provisions of the Municipal Act and comprise financial instruments issued by the 
Canadian government and Schedule I, II, and III banks, as well as asset-backed 
securities and eligible commercial paper. Included within investments are specific 
investments for the endowment fund consisting of Canadian equities and corporate 
bonds as authorized by Provincial Regulation 438/97. All investments are in 
accordance with the Investment Policy approved by Council. Investments with original 
maturity dates of more than 90 days are classified as investments on the consolidated 
statement of financial position.

Significant accounting policies [continued] 
Loan receivable 
A loan receivable is recognized by the City on its consolidated statement of financial 
position when the City has the contractual right to receive cash from the borrower. 
The loan receivable is initially recorded at cost.  If circumstances warrant the 
revaluation of a loan, the City will report the loan receivable net of any related 
valuation allowance/write-down. Changes in valuation allowances, if applicable, will be 
recognized in expenses in the consolidated statement of operations and accumulated 
surplus.  Interest revenue on a loan receivable is recognized when earned and is 
reflected in the consolidated statement of operations and accumulated surplus. 
Deferred revenue 
Certain amounts are received in advance pursuant to legislation, regulation or agreement 
and may only be used in the conduct of certain programs or in the completion of 
specific work.  In addition, certain user charges and fees are collected in advance for 
which the related services have yet to be performed.  These amounts are recorded as 
deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue in the year during which the related 
expenses are incurred provided eligibility criteria and stipulations have been met. 
Employee benefit plans 
The City has adopted the following policies with respect to employee benefit plans: 
[a] The costs of post-employment benefits are recognized as a liability when the 
event that obligates the City occurs. The costs are actuarially determined using 
projected future income payments, health care continuation costs, and fees 
paid to independent administrators of these plans, calculated on a present 
value basis. 
[b] The costs of post-retirement benefits are recognized as a liability when the 
event that obligates the City occurs. The costs are actuarially determined using 
the projected benefits method prorated on service and management’s best 
estimate of retirement ages of employees, salary escalation, expected health 
care costs, and plan investment performance.

Significant accounting policies [continued] 
[c] Past service costs for plan amendments related to prior-period employee 
services are accounted for in the period of the plan amendment. The effects of 
gain or loss from settlements or curtailments are expensed in the period during 
which they occur. Net actuarial gains and losses related to employee benefits 
are amortized over the estimated average remaining service life of the related 
employee group. Employee future benefits are discounted using current interest 
rates on City-issued long-term bonds. 
[d] The costs of workplace safety and insurance obligations are recognized as a 
liability when the event that obligates the City occurs. The liability is actuarially 
determined and is based upon an estimate of future claims to be insured. This 
is based on a number of assumptions including future interest rates, inflation 
rates, and the history of claims with City employees. 
[e] The costs of termination benefits and compensated absences are recognized 
when the event that obligates the City occurs; costs include projected future 
income payments, health care continuation costs, and fees paid to independent 
administrators of these plans, calculated on a present value basis. 
Pension agreements 
The City has adopted the following policies with respect to pension agreements: 
[a] The contributions to a multi-employer, defined benefit pension plan are 
expensed when contributions are due. 
[b] The actuarial valuation is determined using the projected unit credit method 
prorated on credited service.  It is also based on management’s best estimates 
and assumptions that include assumptions for employee retirement ages, 
salary escalation, and plan investment performance, which are used for 
discounting benefits.  Plan assets are valued using a market-related value, 
determined over a three-year period. 
Legal claims and contingencies 
Estimated costs to settle legal claims and possible legal claims are determined based 
on available information.  Where the costs are deemed to be likely and can be 
reasonably estimated, claims are reported as an expense on the consolidated 
statement of operations and accumulated surplus and a liability on the consolidated 
statement of financial position. Where costs are deemed not to be determinable, no 
liability is reported on the consolidated statement of financial position.

Landfill closure and post-closure liabilities 
The estimated costs to close and maintain solid waste landfill sites are based on future 
expenses for 25 years, adjusted for inflation and discounted to current dollars. These 
costs are reported as a liability on the consolidated statement of financial position. 
Contaminated sites 
Criteria to recognize a liability for contaminated sites are as follows: 
[i] 
An environmental standard exists; 
[ii] 
Contamination exceeds the standard; 
[iii] 
The City is directly responsible or accepts responsibility for the contamination; 
[iv] 
It is expected that future economic benefits will be given up; and 
[v] 
A reasonable estimate of the amount can be made. 
When all the criteria for recognition are met, the City accrues a liability for the 
estimated amount of future remediation costs of contaminated sites no longer in 
productive use. 
Non-financial assets 
Non-financial assets are not available to discharge existing liabilities and are held for 
use in the provision of services. They have useful lives beyond the current year and 
are not intended for sale in the ordinary course of operations.

[a] Tangible capital assets 
Tangible capital assets are recorded at cost, which includes amounts that are 
directly attributable to acquisition, construction, development or betterment of 
an asset.  The costs, less residual value, of the tangible capital assets, 
excluding land, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated 
useful lives, as follows:

[b] Contributed tangible capital assets 
Contributed tangible capital assets represent assets that are donated or 
contributed to the City by developers and are recognized as revenue in the year 
the assets are contributed based on fair market value at the date of 
contribution. 
[c] Intangible assets 
Intangible assets and natural resources are not recognized as assets in the 
consolidated financial statements. 
[d] Interest capitalization 
The City’s tangible capital asset policy does not allow for the capitalization of 
interest costs incurred by the City associated with the acquisition or 
construction of a tangible capital asset.

[e] Leases 
Leases are classified as operating or capital leases. Leases that transfer 
substantially all of the benefits and risks incidental to ownership of property are 
accounted for as capital leases and recorded as a liability.  All other leases are 
accounted for as operating leases and the related payments are charged to 
expenses as incurred. 
[f] 
Inventories 
Inventories held for consumption are recorded at the lower of cost and 
replacement cost. 
Reserves 
Reserves comprise funds set aside for specific purposes by Council [see note 17]. 
Reserves set aside by legislation, regulation, or agreement are reported as deferred 
revenue on the consolidated statement of financial position. 
Contractual rights and obligations 
Contractual rights reflect future rights to economic resources arising from contracts 
and/or agreements that will result in both an asset and revenue in future fiscal periods. 
For further details regarding the City’s contractual rights for long-term property leases, 
please see note 18(m). 
Contractual obligations represent obligations that will result in liabilities upon the 
completion of agreed-upon terms specified in contracts and/or agreements in future 
fiscal periods.  For further details regarding the City’s contractual obligations, including 
the nature, extent and timing of these types of transactions, please see note 18. 
Future accounting pronouncements 
Standards effective for fiscal years beginning on or after April 1, 2022 (in effect for the 
City for the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2023): 
PS 1201 Financial Statement Presentation (“PS 1201”) replaces PS 1200 to 
conform to PS 3450 Financial Instruments (“PS 3450”), and requires a new 
statement of remeasurement gains and losses separate from the statement of 
operations. Included in this new statement are the unrealized gains and losses 
arising from the remeasurement of financial instruments and items denominated in 
foreign currencies, as well as the government’s proportionate share of other 
comprehensive income that arises when a government includes the results of 
government business enterprises and partnerships.

Significant accounting policies [continued] 
PS 3041 Portfolio Investments (“PS 3041”) replaces PS 3040 and has removed 
the distinction between temporary and portfolio investments. This section was 
amended to conform to PS 3450 and now includes pooled investments in its 
scope. Upon adoption of PS 3450 and PS 3041, PS 3030 Temporary Investments 
(“PS 3030”) will no longer apply. 
PS 2601 Foreign Currency Translation (“PS 2601”) replaces PS 2600 and 
requires exchange rates to be adjusted to the rate in effect at the financial 
statement date for monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency 
and non-monetary items included in the fair value category. Unrealized gains and 
losses are to be presented in the statement of remeasurement gains and losses. 
Gains and losses on long-term monetary assets and liabilities are amortized over 
the remaining term of the item. 
PS 3450 Financial Instruments (“PS 3450”) establishes recognition, 
measurement and disclosure requirements for derivative and non-derivative 
financial instruments. The standard requires fair value measurement of derivatives 
and equity instruments that are quoted in an active market; all other financial 
instruments can be measured at cost/amortized cost or fair value at the election of 
the government. Unrealized gains and losses are presented in a new statement of 
remeasurement gains and losses. There is the requirement to disclose the nature 
and extent of risks arising from financial instruments and clarification is given for 
the derecognition of financial liabilities. 
PS 3280 Asset Retirement Obligations (“PS 3280”) requires entities to record 
asset retirement obligations. An asset retirement obligation is a legal obligation 
associated with the retirement of a tangible capital asset. Asset retirement costs 
associated with a tangible capital asset controlled by the entity increase the 
carrying amount of the related tangible capital asset and are expensed in a 
rational and systematic manner. Asset retirement costs associated with an asset 
no longer in productive use are expensed. Subsequent measurement of the 
liability can result in either a change in the carrying amount of the related tangible 
capital asset or an expense, depending on the nature of the remeasurement and 
whether the asset remains in productive use.  Upon adoption of PS 3280, landfill 
closure and post-closure liabilities will fall under this new standard and PS 3270 
Solid Waste Landfill Closure and Post-Closure Liability (“PS 3270”) will no longer 
apply.

Significant accounting policies [continued] 
Standards effective for fiscal years beginning on or after April 1, 2023 (in effect for the 
City for the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2024): 
PS 3400 Revenue (“PS 3400”) proposes a framework that includes two 
categories of revenue – exchange transactions or unilateral transactions. 
Revenue from an exchange transaction is recognized when the public sector 
entity has satisfied the performance obligation(s). If no performance obligation is 
present, it would be unilateral revenues. Unilateral revenues are recognized when 
a public sector entity has the authority to claim or retain an inflow of economic 
resources and a past event gives rise to a claim on economic resources. 
PS 3160 Public Private Partnerships (“P3s”) (“PS 3160”) identifies 
requirements on how to account for and disclose transactions in which public 
sector entities procure major infrastructure assets and/or services from private 
sector entities.  Recognition of assets arising from P3 arrangements is ultimately 
dependent on whether public sector entities control the purpose and use of the 
assets, access to the future economic benefits and exposure to the risks 
associated with the assets, and significant residual interest in the asset, if any, at 
the end of the term of P3s.  Measurement of the asset and related liability will also 
be dependent on the overall model used to compensate the private sector entity. 
PSG-8 Purchased Intangibles provides guidelines on accounting and reporting 
for purchased intangibles.  Concurrently, PS 1000 Financial Statement Concepts 
has been amended to remove the prohibition against recognizing intangibles 
purchased in an exchange transaction in public sector financial statements. 
The City continues to assess the impacts of the above standards. While the timing of 
standards adoption may vary, certain standards must be adopted concurrently. The 
requirements in PS 1201, PS 3450, PS 2601 and PS 3041 must be implemented at 
the same time. 
The City has not adopted any new accounting standards for the fiscal year ended on 
December 31, 2022.

The defined benefit plans relating to post-retirement and post-employment 
provide a variety of benefits to retirees and active and long-term disabled 
employees, including income, medical, dental, and life insurance; workers’ 
compensation; and sick leave benefits. 
The City is a Schedule 2 employer under the Workplace Safety and Insurance 
Act and, as such, assumes full responsibility for financing its workplace safety 
insurance costs.  The accrued obligation represents the present value of future 
benefits on existing claims. 
The continuity for post-retirement, post-employment, and WSIB benefits for 
2022 is as follows:

Employee future benefits and pension agreements [continued] 
Expenses for post-retirement and post-employment benefits and WSIB in the 
amount of $95,480 [2021 – $102,721] are recorded on the consolidated 
statement of operations and accumulated surplus. 
The liability for post-retirement and post-employment benefits is calculated 
based on an estimate of future outlays required under contractual agreements 
with various City employee bargaining units. These estimates are based on a 
number of assumptions regarding the expected costs of benefits, which are 
dependent on the demographic makeup of the various groups, future interest 
rates, and inflation rates. The liability for WSIB is calculated based on an 
estimate of future claims to be insured. This is based on a number of 
assumptions including future interest rates, inflation rates, and the history of 
claims with City employees. The City engages the services of an actuarial 
consulting firm to provide a determination of the City’s obligation for post-
retirement and post-employment benefits, as well as for WSIB benefits. 
Due to the complexities in valuing the plans, actuarial valuations are conducted 
on a periodic basis. The liabilities for post-retirement and post-employment 
benefits reported in these consolidated financial statements are based on a 
valuation as of September 30, 2022 with an extrapolation to December 31, 
2022. The liability for WSIB benefits reported in these consolidated financial 
statements is based on a valuation as of December 31, 2021 with an 
extrapolation to December 31, 2022. 
Gains or losses are generated each year due to changes in assumptions and 
corrections or clarifications to the plan design previously provided by the City. 
These gains or losses are amortized over the expected average remaining 
service life of the related employee groups beginning in the year following the 
gain or loss.  Amortization of the 2022 actuarial gain of $85,205 [2021 – gain of 
$47,394] for post-retirement and post-employment benefits will commence in 
fiscal 2023. Amortization of the 2022 actuarial loss of $127,740 [2021 – loss of 
$40,431] for WSIB will commence in fiscal 2023.

[see note 17]. 
[b] Pension agreements 
[i] Ontario Municipal Employees’ Retirement Fund 
The City makes contributions to the Ontario Municipal Employees 
Retirement System [“OMERS”], which is a multi-employer pension plan, on 
behalf of most of its employees. 
The plan is a defined benefit plan, which specifies the amount of the 
retirement benefit to be received by the employees based on length of 
service and rates of pay.  The City’s contribution to the OMERS plan for 
2022 totalled $136,790 [2021 – $127,444] for current services and is 
included as an expense on the consolidated statement of operations and 
accumulated surplus. These contributions were matched with identical 
employee contributions for both years.

THE CITY OF OTTAWA 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
December 31, 2022 [dollars in thousands] 
9. Employee future benefits and pension agreements [continued]
As OMERS is a multi-employer pension plan, the City does not recognize in 
its consolidated financial statements any share of the pension plan deficit of 
$6,100,000 [2021 deficit – $69,000] as this is a joint responsibility of 
all Ontario municipalities and their employees. 
The amount contributed for past service to OMERS for the year ended 
December 31, 2022 totalled $1,054 [2021 – $532] and is included as an 
expense on the consolidated statement of operations and accumulated 
surplus. 
[ii] City of Ottawa Superannuation Fund 
The City sponsors the City of Ottawa Superannuation Fund [“COSF”], a 
defined benefit plan that provides retirement benefits to employees based 
on length of service and rates of pay.  With the introduction of OMERS, the 
COSF became a closed group in 1965. As at December 31, 2022, there 
were no active members and 415 pension recipients [2021 – 442 pension 
recipients].  Pension payments during 2022 amounted to $14,619 [2021 – 
$16,930]. No employee or matching employer contributions to this pension 
plan for current service were required in 2022 or 2021. Employer 
contributions for past service were nil in 2022 [2021 – nil]. 
The pension fund assets disclosed are based on a valuation method 
whereby the capital gains and losses on the assets are partially recognized 
in the year in which they are incurred, and the remainder are recognized in 
the following two years. The reported accrued benefit liability (asset) is as 
follows:

There is no remaining service life in this plan. 
The actuarial valuation performed for accounting purposes was based on a number of 
assumptions that are based on management’s best estimates and are in accordance 
with accepted actuarial practice. The inflation rate was estimated at 3.00% per year for 
two years and 2.00% thereafter [2021 – 3.00% per year for two years and 2.00% 
thereafter] and the discount rate for the plan was estimated at 4.90% per year [2021 – 
3.60% per year]. 
The accrued benefit obligations and benefit cost levels will change in the future as a 
result of future changes in the actuarial methods and assumptions, the membership 
data, the plan provisions and the legislative rules, or as a result of true experience gains 
or losses. 
The City pays for the indexation of COSF from 55% of inflation to 100% of inflation. 
This top-up to the cost of living adjustment is approved each year through the City’s 
budget process.  The estimated pension obligation if the indexation provided by the City 
stops after January 1, 2023 is $18,290 [January 1, 2022 - $17,260].  This amount is 
included in the total employee future benefits and pension agreements liabilities on the 
consolidated statement of financial position. 
Emerging experience, differing from the assumptions, will result in gains or losses that 
will be included in future accounting valuations. 
The last filed actuarial valuation for funding purposes dated December 31, 2021 
quantified a surplus of $13,656 [December 31, 2020 surplus – $6,900] on a going 
concern basis. 
The market value of the assets of the plan as at December 31, 2022 amounted to 
$115,210 [2021 – $147,192].

[iii] Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission Employees’ Pension Plan 
The City sponsors the Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission [“OC 
Transpo”] Employees’ Pension Plan, a defined benefit plan that provides 
retirement benefits to employees based on length of service and rates of 
pay. Effective January 1, 1999, OC Transpo adopted the OMERS pension 
plan for all employees and new hires to accrue future benefits.  Members 
retiring with both pre-1999 and post-1998 service will receive pension 
incomes under both plans. Net pension payments during 2022 amounted to 
$33,570 [2021 – $33,493]. No employee or matching employer contributions 
to this pension plan for current service were required in 2022 or 2021. 
Employer contributions for past service were nil in 2022 [2021 – nil]. 
The pension fund assets disclosed are based on a valuation method 
whereby the capital gains and losses on the assets are partially recognized 
in the year in which they are incurred, and the remainder are recognized in 
the following two years. The reported pension asset is as follows:

The market value of the assets of the plan as at December 31, 2022 amounted to
$575,479 [2021 – $730,237].
The actuarial valuation performed for accounting purposes was based on a number of 
assumptions that are based on management’s best estimates and are in accordance 
with accepted actuarial practice. The inflation rate was estimated at 3.00% per year for 
two years and 2.00% thereafter [2021 – 3.00% per year for two years and 2.00% 
thereafter], the discount rate for the plan was estimated at 5.55% per year [2021 – 4.60% 
per year], and long-term salary forecasts for actuarial purposes were estimated at 2.25% 
per year for 2023 and 2024 and 3.00% thereafter [2021 – 3.00% per year]. 
The accrued benefit obligations and benefits cost levels will change in the future as a 
result of future changes in the actuarial methods and assumptions, the membership data, 
the plan provisions and the legislative rules, or as a result of true experience gains or 
losses. 
Emerging experience, differing from the assumptions, will result in gains or losses that 
will be included in future accounting valuations. 
The last filed actuarial valuation for funding purposes dated January 1, 2022 quantified a 
solvency surplus of $56,866 [2021 surplus – $24,112]. In 2022, the City contributed an 
amount of nil [2021 – nil] to the plan. With a surplus in the plan, no solvency special 
payments were required in 2022, and the City was able to reduce the total amount 
outstanding under the letter of credit by $59,314 for 2022, bringing the balance down to 
$13,075 [from $72,389 in 2021] as allowed under the applicable legislation. 
10. Landfill closure and post-closure liabilities
The Environmental Protection Act (Ontario) sets out the regulatory requirements for
the closure and maintenance of landfill sites. Under this Act, the City is required to
provide for closure and post-closure care of solid waste landfill sites. The costs related
to these obligations are included in operating expenses over the estimated remaining
life of the landfill sites based on usage. The liability for closure and post-closure active
and inactive sites is reported on the consolidated statement of financial position.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

10. Landfill closure and post-closure liabilities [continued] 
Active sites 
The City has two active landfill sites, Trail Road Landfill and Springhill. The City has 
responsibilities for all costs relating to closure and post-closure care for these active 
landfill sites.  As at December 31, 2022, the remaining capacity of the Trail Road site is 
approximately 3,397,688 [2021 – 4,222,640] cubic metres, all of which is expected to 
be used by the year 2036 [2021 – used by 2036]. The remaining capacity at the 
Springhill site is approximately nil [2021 – nil] cubic metres. 
Closure of the Trail Road Landfill and Springhill sites will involve covering the sites, 
implementing drainage control, and installing groundwater monitoring wells and gas 
recovery facilities.  Post-closure care activities for these sites are expected to occur for 
approximately 25 years from the date of site closure. 
The Springhill site is no longer accepting waste but is not closed. The City is currently 
engaged in discussions with the site manager and the Ministry of Environment 
Conservation and Parks regarding the next steps to be taken. 
The estimated liability for the landfill sites is based on future expenses, adjusted for 
inflation based on the Consumer Price Index 10-year average rate of 2.21% [2021 – 
1.68%] and discounted to current dollars using the City’s average long-term borrowing 
rate of 4.23% [2021 – 2.83%].  This estimate amounts to $24,276 as at December 31, 
2022 [2021 – $22,471]. In order to help reduce the future impact of these obligations, 
the City has established reserves for the care of these sites. As at December 31, 2022, 
the balance in these reserves was $6,990 [2021 – $6,539] and is included within other 
discretionary reserves [see note 17]. 
Estimated total undiscounted expenses over the 25-year post-closure period amount 
to approximately $43,658 [2021 – $37,823].

10. Landfill closure and post-closure liabilities [continued] 
Inactive sites 
The City has identified 44 inactive or closed landfill sites. Of the total, 15 sites require 
ongoing monitoring over the post-closure period of 25 years. Post-closure care 
activities for landfill sites will involve surface and groundwater monitoring, maintenance 
of drainage structures, monitoring leachate and landfill gas, and maintenance of the 
landfill cover. 
The estimated liability for the inactive or closed landfill sites is based on future 
expenses, adjusted for inflation based on the Consumer Price Index 3-year average 
rate of 4.10% [2021 – 2.57%] and discounted to current dollars using the City’s 
average long-term borrowing rate of 4.23% [2021 – 2.83%]. The estimated present 
value of future expenditures for post-closure care for inactive sites as at December 31, 
2022 is $14,562 [2021 – $14,329]. Estimated total undiscounted expenses over the 
post-closure period amount to approximately $14,621 [2021 – $15,052]. 
11. Contaminated sites 
Contaminated sites are a result of a contamination being introduced in air, soil, water 
or sediment of a chemical, organic, or radioactive material or live organism that 
exceeds an environment standard. The liability relates to sites that are not in productive 
use and for which the City is responsible or has accepted responsibility for remediation, 
future economic benefits will be given up, and costs can be reasonably estimated. 
Liabilities are recorded for the estimated costs related to the management and 
remediation of contaminated sites where the City is likely to be obligated to incur costs. 
The liability estimate includes costs that are directly attributable to remediation 
activities and reflects the costs required to bring the site up to the current 
environmental standard for its use prior to contamination. The assumptions used in 
estimating the liability include a unique assessment of the depth of soil to be removed 
and disposed of for each property as well as excavation, trucking and backfilling soft 
costs. 
The City recognized an estimated liability of $6,769 [2021 – $6,784] for remediation of 
34 [2021 – 36] contaminated land sites based on the estimated costs of removal and 
replacement of contaminated soil.

Principal payments will be funded from tax and rate-supported operations. It is 
estimated that interest to be earned by the sinking fund will amount to 
approximately $840,139, which together with the amount of $2,371,443 shown 
above will be used to retire the outstanding total debt of $3,211,582. 
The City has entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage the volatility 
of interest rates.  The City converted notional floating rate debt totalling $17,233 
[2021 – $22,408] to fixed rate debt with interest rates ranging from 1.705% to 
5.92%. The related derivative agreements are in place until the maturity of the 
debts in 2025 and 2031. 
These interest rate swaps qualify, and have been designated by the City, as 
cash flow hedging items against the floating rate long-term debt.  The City has 
assessed the hedging relationship as effective.  If the interest rate swaps were 
cancelled as at December 31, 2022, the City would receive the market value of 
$1,062 [2021 – City would pay the market value of $327]. 
The City has entered into bank swap agreements to improve budget certainty 
for commodity costs.  As at December 31, 2022, the City had set bank swaps in 
place to hedge 30,000,000 litres [2021 – 30,100,000 litres] of diesel fuel for the 
2023 and 2024 calendar years with expiry dates ranging from June 2023 to 
January 2024 [2021 – January 2022 to December 2023]. The City has 
assessed the relationship as effective. If the commodity swaps were cancelled 
as at December 31, 2022, the City would receive from the swap counterparty 
the market value of $4,276 [2021 – $2,355]. 
[c] As part of the public-private partnership arrangement, the Rideau Transit Group 
[“RTG”] had obtained $225,000 of debt financing and $75,000 of equity 
financing to pay for the construction of the light rail project. At the revenue 
service availability date, the City started to repay the total of $300,000 to RTG 
as part of the capital annual service payments and substantial completion 
payments over the life of the light rail. This long-term debt is at an interest rate 
of 6.47% and will mature on May 24, 2048.

long-term lenders for Stage 1 of the light rail project. With this agreement, the 
long-term lenders transferred all their rights and obligations under the existing 
credit agreement with Project Co (borrower) to the City (assignee), and in 
exchange, the City issued debentures in the equivalent principal amount with 
the equivalent repayment profile and interest rate to the long-term lenders. The 
debentures issued by the City were at an interest rate of 4.89% and mature on 
June 30, 2047. 
Principal payments in future years for the combined amount of Stage 1 light rail 
debt, including the assignment and assumption agreement noted above, are as

12. Net long-term debt [continued]
[e]
The City has launched the Better Homes Loan Program [“BHL Program”] to 
help homeowners finance home energy improvements which will help the City 
achieve its greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets.  The program 
participants repay the City for their project costs over time through a local 
improvement charge which is added to their property tax bills. 
An initial loan amount of $2,028 was received on August 3, 2022 from the 
Federation of Canadian Municipalities as part of the Green Municipal Fund. 
That loan is repayable over 25 years at zero interest rate. The entire amount of 
the loan has been disbursed to the first round of program participants at zero 
interest rate during 2022, and it has been recognized as accounts receivable as 
at December 31, 2022, which will be collected via residents’ property tax bills 
over the next 20 years. 
As part of the BHL Program, the City also has loans from Vancity Community 
Investment Bank [“Vancity”]. The first tranche was received on April 13, 2022 in 
the amount of $3,887 and is for a 20-year term at an interest rate of 3.25%. A 
second tranche from Vancity was received on June 30, 2022 in the amount of 
$15,000 and is for a 20-year term at an interest rate of 4.33%. A portion of the 
two tranches from Vancity have been disbursed to the program participants at 
their respective interest rates, and the amounts disbursed have been 
recognized as accounts receivable as at December 31, 2022.

13. Mortgages payable [continued] 
[a] Public housing debentures issued by Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation in the amount of $1,409 [2021 – $2,656] related to OCHC have not 
been included in these consolidated financial statements as they are the 
responsibility of the Province. 
Mortgages and forgivable loans on housing properties are governed by 
operating agreements with the Province and/or Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation and involve no direct or indirect obligation to the City. In 2022, 
OCHC applied changes to the Forgivable Loans accounting practice, which 
resulted in bringing down the account balances to nil for the year ended 
December 31, 2022. With respect to the debenture payable to Infrastructure 
Ontario of $239,425 [2021 – $246,425], per OCHC’s direction, the City has 
transferred directly to Infrastructure Ontario amounts equivalent to the annual 
principal and interest payments owing on the debentures of $15,472 [2021 – 
$14,904].  These payments form part of the annual subsidy provided by the City 
to OCHC, which is calculated based on OCHC’s annual information return. 
No mortgages of OCHC properties were refinanced in 2022. In 2021, five 
OCHC properties were refinanced after detailed appraisals were conducted. 
The revised appraisals allowed OCHC to borrow additional funds while 
maintaining the same annual payments on the debt for the refinanced 
properties. The 2021 refinancing provided $20,583 of funding to be utilized for 
future capital repairs.

Brownfields 
Brownfields are abandoned, vacant or underutilized properties where past actions 
have resulted in actual or perceived environmental contamination and/or derelict or 
deteriorated buildings. They are usually, but not exclusively, former industrial or 
commercial properties. 
The Ottawa Brownfields Community Improvement Program is a framework that 
promotes brownfield development within the City. The program contains financial 
incentives that encourage the remediation, rehabilitation and adaptive reuse of 
brownfield properties in Ottawa. The brownfields program is a grant equivalent to 
100% of the incremental municipal property tax increase for up to 10 years based on a 
percentage of eligible costs.  The applicants will initially pay for the entire cost of 
rehabilitation. When the City receives the incremental property taxes that result from 
the rehabilitation project, the City will reimburse the applicant in the form of an annual 
grant based on the executed legal agreement and the parameters of the applicable 
program. 
The liability of brownfields is estimated by calculating the present value stream of the 
relevant incremental property tax for up to 10 years for each property site. The 
incremental tax is the difference between the projected property tax and the current 
property tax for each property site. 
The estimated present value of future expenditures for brownfields as at December 31, 
2022 is $58,902 [2021 – $55,784]. Estimated total undiscounted expenses for 
brownfields amount to approximately $67,981 [2021 – $59,656].

18. Contingencies, commitments and contractual rights 
[a] Through the course of its normal operations, the City becomes involved in 
various claims and legal proceedings.  Litigation is subject to many uncertainties 
and the outcome of individual matters is difficult to predict. A provision for these 
claims has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements based on 
management’s best estimate, based upon an analysis of specific claims and 
historical experience with similar claims. Any amendment to amounts accrued 
will be recorded once new information becomes available. Where the potential 
liability is determinable, management believes that the ultimate disposition of 
the matters will not materially exceed the amounts recorded in the accounts. 
If the outcome of a claim is undeterminable, then no liability accrual is recorded, 
and any additional losses related to these undeterminable claims will be recorded 
in the period during which the liability becomes determinable. Amounts recorded 
in the accounts have not been separately disclosed in the consolidated financial 
statements as disclosure may adversely impact the outcome. 
[b]  The City has the following future contractual obligations for capital works:

[d]
On August 30, 2019, Stage 1 of the O-Train Confederation Line achieved 
Revenue Service Availability [“RSA”] and the maintenance contract became 
effective on that date. The City has committed to making a series of monthly 
service payments during the 28-year maintenance and service term ending 
May 2048. Commitments for Monthly Service Payments [“MSP”] for capital 
construction costs deferred beyond the construction period, as well as for 
maintenance costs associated with the light rail system and vehicles, began on 
the RSA date.  Annual payments will be adjusted as service levels change, and 
a portion will be adjusted for inflation, in accordance with the project agreement. 
The City has also committed to a series of payments for life-cycle costs, and for 
maintenance costs that will vary with service kilometres. The City reviews all 
invoices to ensure that all contractual obligations under the Project Agreement 
are met by the vendor. Invoices from October 2019 to April 2020, reflecting the 
system performance of September 2019 to March 2020, were still in dispute as 
of December 31, 2022, and no payments were made for those months. MSP 
payments were made for the invoice period from May 2020 to August 2021, 
taking into account performance deductions related to system performance of 
April 2020 to July 2021. An additional accrual for performance deductions was 
made in fiscal 2022 for the months of October to December of 2022. Accruals 
are recorded for the disputed periods based on the City’s most current 
estimates of the MSP and performance deductions for those periods. 
Amounts recorded in the accounts have not been separately disclosed in the 
consolidated financial statements as disclosure may adversely impact the 
outcome of the disputed items.

As at December 31, 2022, Hydro Ottawa had total open commitments 
amounting to $107,939 for the period from 2023 to 2029.  The commitments 
relate to a call centre services agreement, distribution-related construction 
projects, overhead and underground services, and other services related to 
Hydro Ottawa’s operations. 
[f]
The City has commitments for the purchase of ice rental time for annual 
amounts of $1,158, $6,663 and $15,813, which are paid in two installments in 
accordance with three public-private partnership agreements.  These 
commitments are set to expire in 2027, 2034 and 2043, respectively.

18. Contingencies, commitments and contractual rights [continued] 
[g] The City has entered into guarantees of loans amounting to $132,720 arranged 
to provide financing for the development of ice rinks, the construction of a 
paramedic headquarters facility, the development of an arts centre, and 
Lansdowne Park roof replacement under public-private partnerships. The City’s 
guarantees for ice rinks, the paramedic facility and Lansdowne roof replacement 
also cover the borrowers’ obligations under interest rate derivative agreements 
to manage the volatility of interest rates. The total amount outstanding under 
guarantees as of December 31, 2022 is $104,804. The City has converted 
floating rate debt in the amount of $98,830 for fixed rate debt ranging from 
2.849% to 6.49% on four guarantees. The related derivative agreements are in 
place until the maturity of the debts in 2044. The City’s guarantee of the loan in 
connection with the arts centre facility does not involve interest rate derivative 
agreements since the loans are on a fixed interest rate basis. 
[h] On June 28, 2010, Council authorized a payment covenant guarantee that may 
require the City to make annual payments of up to $1,463 in respect of a loan in 
the amount of $20,700 for the construction and operation of a trade and 
exhibition centre. The covenant agreement was signed by the City on April 15, 
2011 and expires on April 15, 2041. No payments have been made on this 
guarantee in 2022 [2021 – nil]. 
[i]     On October 12, 2012, the City entered into an agreement with Ottawa Sports 
and Entertainment Group [“OSEG”] to revitalize Lansdowne Park. The Master 
Limited Partnership agreement was established to manage the construction 
and future net positive cash flows that will be distributed based on a waterfall of 
priorities as set out in the agreement. The net positive cash flows will be 
distributed with priority to life-cycle reserves, then OSEG Partners return on and 
of contributed equity, and then to the City for return on deemed equity, with any 
remaining cash balances to be evenly split between the City and OSEG. 
In 2020, Council approved a ten-year extension to the agreement to 
December 31, 2054. Due to COVID-19, Lansdowne Park experienced a 
significant decrease in revenues due to events not being held. OSEG put 
measures in place to reduce costs and requested a transfer of $4,653 from the 
capital life-cycle fund to manage cash flows over the three-year period from 
2020 to 2022 inclusive.  In fiscal 2023, OSEG will be required to replenish the 
capital life-cycle fund.

18. Contingencies, commitments and contractual rights [continued] 
[j]     In 2017, Council and the Ottawa Public Library Board approved partnering with 
Library and Archives Canada to build a new joint facility that brings together the 
creative services of a public library and the public services of a national library 
and archives.  The final design plans of the joint facility were approved in 
April 2021 and the City’s Supply Services branch, in May 2021, released the 
tender for the construction of the joint facility. As at the end of 2022, construction 
of the new facility was ongoing.  Construction is planned to continue until late 
2025, with the official opening taking place in 2026. The Library and Archives 
Canada portion of the building is funded by the federal government. For the 
City’s portion of the building, capital costs incurred up to December 31, 2022 
were $44,953. Future commitments for the City portion of the building amount 
to $138,007 for 2023 to 2026 inclusive. 
[k] On August 10, 2022, the City entered into a credit agreement with the Canada 
Infrastructure Bank of up to $380,000 in order to finance the Zero Emission 
Buses ("ZEB") Program over the next five years. The credit facility bears 1% 
interest per annum, and it is to be repaid over the useful life of the ZEBs 
(15 years) beginning the first anniversary of the first operation of the ZEBs 
(expected 2024). As of December 31, 2022, the City has borrowed $1,693 
related to this credit agreement. 
[l] 
In March 2019, the City entered into agreements with private partners for the 
two extensions of the Stage 2 LRT Projects: Trillium Line Extension (“TLE”) and 
Confederation Line Extension (“CLE”). The CLE project further consists of two 
phases, the extension of the LRT line to the east (“CLE East”), and the 
extension of the line to the west (“CLE West”). The TLE extension project is 
being delivered as a design, build, finance and maintain project, while the CLE 
extensions are being delivered as a design, build, and finance project, and the 
maintenance component of the extended line will be delivered by the current 
contractor for the existing Confederation Line. 
For the TLE extension, the City has outstanding commitments totalling $82,496 
related to the ongoing construction costs. Upon substantial completion, the City 
must repay $25,918 related to the construction costs that were funded by the 
private partner and $136,126 plus interest will be paid over the 27-year 
maintenance period. During the maintenance period, the City is also committed 
to a series of monthly payments to cover the maintenance and life-cycle 
requirements, as well as insurance, administrative, and legal/accounting costs.

18. Contingencies, commitments and contractual rights [continued]
For the CLE extension, the City has outstanding commitments totalling 
$1,129,989 related to the ongoing construction costs. Upon substantial 
completion of the CLE East extension, the City must repay $80,000 related to 
the construction costs that were funded by the private partner.  Upon substantial 
completion of the CLE West extension, the City must repay $176,446 related to 
the construction costs that were funded by the private partner. During the 
combined 30-year maintenance term, the City is also committed to a series of 
payments to cover the maintenance and life-cycle requirements for the 
combined Stage 1 and Stage 2, as well as insurance, administrative and 
legal/accounting costs. 
[m] Contractual rights are rights to economic resources arising from contracts or 
agreements that will result in revenues and assets in the future. The City’s 
contractual rights arise out of contracts entered into for long-term property 
leases and rental arrangements where the City is the lessor. Contractual rights 
are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements until revenues or 
assets are received. The estimated amount of contractual rights is $13,098 over 
the next five-year period, assuming no lease renewals or counterparty default.

THE CITY OF OTTAWA 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
December 31, 2022 [dollars in thousands] 
21. Segmented information [continued] 
The City is responsible for providing a wide range of services to its citizens, including 
police, fire, ambulance, public transit and water. 
The City reports on functional areas and programs in its consolidated financial 
statements similar to the reporting reflected as part of the Ontario Financial 
Information Return. 
These functional areas represent segments for the City, and expanded disclosure by 
object has been reflected in the above consolidated schedules of segmented 
disclosure. 
A brief description of each segment follows: 

General government consists of Council, administration, and Ontario Property 
Assessment. 

Protection consists of police, fire and other protective services.  These groups 
maintain the safety and security of all citizens by reducing or eliminating loss of 
life and property, by maintaining law enforcement, and preserving peace and 
good order. 

Roads, traffic and parking include parking, signs and signals, streetlights and 
the maintenance of roads within the City. 

Transit services provide local public transportation for citizens. They also 
include other transportation services such as planning and development. 

Environmental services include water supply and distribution, wastewater 
treatment, storm sewer systems and waste and recycling services.  These 
services provide clean drinking water to residents, collect and treat wastewater, 
and collect and properly process waste and recycling items. 

Health services include paramedic and health services.  Mandated health 
services promote and maintain health programs that optimize the health of 
residents.  Paramedic services deliver timely and effective care for pre-hospital 
emergency care, along with medically required inter-hospital transportation. 

Social and family services include social assistance, long-term care and 
childcare services.  Social assistance services determine, issue and monitor 
clients’ eligibility for financial, social and employment assistance.  Long-term 
care services provide secure and supervised health services for seniors who 
can no longer live at home. Childcare services provide subsidized childcare

The City enters into transactions with its subsidiary corporations in the normal course 
of business, under terms and conditions similar to those that apply to unrelated 
parties. Related party transactions with Hydro Ottawa are disclosed in note 5 and 
related party transactions with OCHC are disclosed in note 13. These transactions are 
measured at their exchange amounts. 
25. Impact of COVID-19 
Throughout 2022, the City continued to track all COVID-19 financial impacts, including 
increases in expenses responding to the pandemic, cost savings due to temporary 
closure of facilities and reduced service levels, and revenue reductions primarily for 
transit and recreational services. Revenue of $187,544 [2021 – $325,283] was 
recognized during the fiscal year to offset COVID-19 related increased expenditures and 
lost revenues. This funding was received from provincial and federal government funding 
programs such as the Safe Restart Agreement, Social Services Relief Fund, Ministry of 
Health, Temporary Pandemic Pay, and various other service-specific funding allocations. 
Tracking of COVID-19 financial impacts will continue in 2023. The upper levels of 
government have shown a continued commitment to provide funding to offset the 
financial impacts that COVID-19 has had on municipalities. It is not possible to reliably 
estimate the length and severity of the pandemic and its impact on the financial 
position and financial results of the City in future periods. 
The COVID-19 related funding recorded by the City, as noted above, is shown as 
government transfers on the consolidated statement of operations and accumulated 
surplus.

Introduction 
Cities are increasingly dealing with the financial impacts from climate change, 
whether it be responding to extreme weather events and gradual changes 
in climate or working to transition to a low-carbon economy. Ottawa is not 
immune to the impacts of a changing climate and is already experiencing 
warmer, wetter, and more unpredictable weather which impacts our health 
and safety, infrastructure, the economy and the environment. 
Ottawa has experienced a number of extreme 
weather events in recent years which had a 
significant financial impact to residents and 
businesses. The incremental cost for the City 
to respond to these events has exceeded  
$30 million in the last five years (Figure 9).  
Notably, the May 2022 derecho storm 
recovery effort cost the City $18.8 million, 
which included emergency response aimed 
at keeping residents safe, city tree and debris 
removal, waste disposal, repairs to traffic 
lights, cleaning up parks, running community 
support centres, and repairing damaged  
City buildings.

The City of Ottawa is committed to reducing 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and 
building climate resiliency over the short and 
long-term and declared a climate emergency 
in 2019. Understanding the financial risks  
and opportunities related to climate change  
is critical to the City’s financial sustainability.

About the Task Force on 
Climate-Related Disclosures (TCFD) 
The TCFD was released in 2017 by the 
Financial Stability Board after years of 
collaborative consultation with global 
stakeholders. It established best practices for
the consistent reporting of an organizations’ 
climate-related risks and opportunities. 
The voluntary disclosures enhance the 
reliability and transparency of climate 
information and are structured around four 
areas that represent core elements of how 
organizations operate: governance, strategy, 
risk management, and metrics and targets.

The following disclosures summarize the 
City’s climate-related actions, strategies,  
and financial impacts to help stakeholders 
and decision-makers understand how the  
City is responding to climate-related risks  
and opportunities. The disclosures also 
explain how the City incorporates climate-
related information into strategic, capital,  
and financial planning processes. 
The Chartered Professional Accountants 
of Canada published guidance on how 
Canadian cities can incorporate TCFD 
recommendations within their annual financial 
reports. The City of Ottawa applied this 
guidance in producing its first set of climate-
related financial disclosures. The City will 
adopt TCFD recommendations with a phased 
approach acknowledging that it will take 
several years for the City to reach full maturity 
and that the field of sustainability reporting is 
early in its evolution.

Governance 
Transitioning Ottawa to a clean, renewable, and resilient city 
will require broad and deep participation in mitigation and 
adaptation efforts. A climate change internal governance 
structure has been established to support decision makers 
in accelerating action and investment towards reducing 
emissions and building climate resiliency. A refresh of 
the internal governance structure, as well as an external 
governance structure, will be completed in 2023 to align 
with the most recent organizational changes. 
Mayor and Council’s Role 
Mayor and City Council set climate and environmental policy 
and direction to manage climate risks and opportunities. They 
receive regular updates and reporting from management directly 
and through various committees, such as the Environment and 
Climate Change committee. In 2019, Mayor and City Council 
declared a Climate Emergency for the purposes of naming, 
framing, and deepening our commitment to protecting our 
economy, our eco systems, and our community from 
climate change. 
A Climate Change Council Sponsors Group consisting of 
six members of Council was created for the 2018-2022 term 
of Council. Members of the Sponsors Group received updates 
from City management on initiatives related to climate change, 
advised on how climate change risks and opportunities would 
intersect with Committee and Council priorities and were 
responsible for championing climate change initiatives to 
Council. A Climate Change Council Sponsors Group will be 
re-established in 2023 for the 2022-2026 Term of Council.

from the City Manager’s Office. Members 
of the Tiger Team are responsible for 
championing climate change initiatives within 
their own department and to Council, advising 
on how climate change risks and opportunities 
will intersect with Council and departmental 
priorities, and advise on how climate 
considerations will be incorporated into the 
City’s key planning processes. As well, various 
directors and managers were identified as key 
advisors to champion climate change initiatives 
and provide updates to senior leadership 
where risks and opportunities arise. 
Strategy 
Climate Change Master Plan 
In January 2020, City Council approved the 
Climate Change Master Plan, the overarching 
framework to reduce GHG emissions and 
respond to current and future effects of climate 
change in Ottawa. The Plan’s vision is to take 
unprecedented collective action to transition 
Ottawa into a clean, renewable and resilient 
city by 2050. As part of the Plan, Council 
approved short-, mid- and long-term GHG 
emission reduction targets and eight priorities 
to be undertaken in the short-term. 
Priorities include implementing Energy 
Evolution: Ottawa’s Community Energy 
Transition Strategy, developing a Climate 
Resiliency Strategy, applying a climate 
lens to the new Official Plan and asset 
management plans, establishing a carbon 
budget and accounting framework, and 
developing a governance framework. 
Figure 11: Climate Change Framework 
 
 
 
 
 
Energy Evolution: Ottawa’s Community Energy Transition Strategy  
In October 2020, Council approved Energy 
Evolution, which sets the framework for what 
it will take for Ottawa to meet the Council 
approved long-term targets to reduce 
community GHG emissions by 100 per cent 
by 2050 and corporate GHG emissions 
by 100 per cent by 2040. Its vision is to 
transform Ottawa into a thriving city powered 
by clean, renewable energy. An integrated 
energy, emissions and financial model was 
used to identify what it will take to achieve 
these targets in five key sectors: Land 
Use and Growth Management, Buildings, 
Transportation, Waste and Renewable 
Natural Gas (RNG), and Electricity. Energy 
Evolution identified 20 priority projects to 
be undertaken by 2025 to accelerate action 
and investment towards achieving the GHG 
emission reduction targets. 
Figure 12: Total projected community-wide greenhouse gas emission reductions required 
to achieve the long-term targets 
Cost of Climate Mitigation 
Energy Evolution analyzed the financial impacts 
to the entire community (municipality, residents, 
business, institutions, and organizations) in 
order to achieve the targets in the five key 
sectors. For the City’s assets and operations, 
it is estimated that roughly $687 million 
(in 2020 dollars) per year is required for 
electrifying transit and municipal fleets, new 
active transportation infrastructure, retrofitting 
municipal buildings, waste diversion, and 
sewer heat capture. Included in this estimate is 
$65 million per year for the City to incentivize 
the community into taking action. 
Energy Evolution also developed projected 
community-wide cumulative investment needs 
from 2020 to 2050, roughly estimated to total 
$57.5 billion (in 2020 dollars). It is projected 
that community-wide capital costs are higher 
up front, but that there is a net financial

benefit to society starting after 2030 when 
the net annual savings and revenues exceed 
the annual investments. If investments were 
made to reach the long-term target to reduce 
emissions by 100 per cent by 2050, the 
community-wide net return is forecasted  
at $12.4 billion (in 2020 dollars). 
Although there is a level of uncertainty in the 
financial estimates, the financial model serves 
as a starting point to understand the capital 
Climate Resiliency Strategy 
The development of the Climate Resiliency 
Strategy is split into three phases. The first 
phase was the completion of the Climate 
Projections for the National Capital Region 
which was received by Council in June 
2021. Using climate science and modelling 
for moderate5 to high6 emission scenarios 
to predict future changes in temperature, 
precipitation, wind and extreme weather, 
it identified that Ottawa is experiencing 
warmer, wetter, and more unpredictable 
costs required to meet the Council-approved 
GHG emission reduction targets by 2050 
and the potential return on investments. It is 
recognized that the City alone will not be able 
to accomplish the scale of investment required. 
Funding commitments by the City combined 
with new revenue streams, private capital 
sources, and funding from senior levels of 
government will ultimately influence the City’s 
success in achieving emissions reductions. 
weather and that these trends will continue 
into the next decades. Projections are 
available for 178 climate indices and three 
time horizons (2030s, 2050s, 2080s). 
Using two plausible scenarios and multiple 
timelines provides flexibility in assessing 
climate risks for different purposes. Localized 
climate projections will be revisited following 
significant advances in global climate models.

Figure 13: Summary of Future Climate in Canada’s Capital Region 
(based on high carbon emission scenario RCP 8.5) 
In June 2022, Council received the Climate 
Vulnerability and Risk Assessment, the 
second phase of the development of the 
Climate Resiliency Strategy. The Climate 
Vulnerability and Risk Assessment used 
the Building Adaptive and Resiliency 
Communities (BARC) methodology to 
assess close to 150 potential climate 
impacts, including impacts on health, 
community well-being, infrastructure, natural 
environment, and the economy, to determine 
how vulnerable Ottawa is to changing 
climate conditions and prioritize where 
action is needed most. Separate climate risk 
assessments were completed for the two 
drinking water purification plants, wastewater 
treatment plant and water services using 
the Public Infrastructure Engineering 
Vulnerability Committee (PIEVC) 
methodology. Of these potential climate 
impacts, 40 priority risks were identified 
that require action in the next one to three 
years. These include risks related to higher 
temperatures and more precipitation, as 
well as more extreme weather like flooding, 
tornadoes, and heat waves. 
The Climate Resiliency Strategy is currently 
in its last phase of development and by 
early 2024 will identify actions to mitigate 
the priority risks identified in the Climate 
Vulnerability and Risk Assessment.

Cost of Climate Adaptation  
Established in 2013, the Financial 
Accountability Office (FAO) of Ontario provides 
independent analysis on the state of the 
Province’s finances, trends in the provincial 
economy and related matters important to 
the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. The 
FAO launched its Costing Climate Change 
Impacts to Public Infrastructure project (CIPI) 
to analyze the long-term costs that climate 
change impacts could impose on Ontario’s 
provincial and municipal infrastructure. The 
City provided the FAO with asset inventory and 
condition data which was incorporated into 
their provincial-wide analysis. FAO recently 
published reports assessing the composition 
and state of repair of provincial and municipal 
infrastructure in Ontario and costed the impact 
of select climate hazards to linear storm and 
wastewater infrastructure, public buildings, 
and transportation infrastructure including 
roads, bridges, large structural culverts, and 
rail tracks. 
The FAO research identified the operating 
and capital costs that are necessary to 
maintain existing public infrastructure in a 
state of good repair to the end of the century 
in the absence of adaptation measures  
under a medium emissions scenario will 
increase by 37%7, 8%8 and 17%9 relative  
to a stable climate scenario for linear storm  
and wastewater infrastructure, public 
buildings, and transportation infrastructure, 
respectively. This increases to 61%, 15% 
and 32% respectively under a high emissions 
scenario. The median cost projections reflect 
that selected climate hazards will generally 
result in higher spending on operations and 
maintenance, accelerate asset deterioration 
and shorten the useful service life of some 
infrastructure, which will then require more 
frequent and additional rehabilitations. 
Although there is a level of uncertainty in 
the FAO’s estimates, and Ottawa’s climate, 
portfolio of assets, and condition of assets 
differ slightly than Ontario averages, the 
FAO’s research serves as a starting point to 
understand the relationship between climate 
change and the cost to maintain public 
infrastructure in a state of good repair. City 
staff are leveraging this research to advance 
the assessment of financial impacts on the 
City’s assets. As well, the third phase of the 
City’s Climate Resiliency Strategy will look to 
identify, prioritize and cost projects needed  
to adapt infrastructure to better withstand  
the effects of climate change.

Integrating Climate Strategy into
Key Planning Processes 
The City’s climate goals can only be advanced by integrating 
climate strategy into key planning processes such as official 
planning, strategic planning, capital planning, long range 
financial planning, corporate policies, and annual budgeting. 
The Official Plan (OP) provides a vision for the future growth 
of the city and a policy framework to guide the city’s physical 
development and is an essential tool to meet climate change 
objectives through land use planning, urban design, regulatory 
practice, building design and environmental protection. The 
new OP that came into effect in November 2022 embedded 
environmental, climate and health resiliency, and energy into 
the framework of its planning policies. The OP’s supporting 
Master Plans will also integrate climate mitigation and 
adaptation policies, programs and projects. 
The City’s Strategic Plan is the key corporate planning 
document that defines what Council plans to accomplish 
over its four-year term and serves as the City’s roadmap to 
success. Environmental stewardship was a key priority in the 
2019–2022 City Strategic Plan, including objectives for the 
City to reduce its GHG output and embed climate change 
considerations across all operations. The 2023-2026 City 
Strategic Plan is currently in development and is informed by 
Master Plans including the Climate Change Master Plan. 
The City’s capital planning process for renewing existing 
assets is managed by the Comprehensive Asset Management 
(CAM) Policy. CAM is an integrated approach to infrastructure 
management that aims to maximize benefits, reduce risk and 
provide safe and reliable levels of service. Climate change 
considerations have been embedded into the CAM Policy and 
will be embedded into the management of existing assets in 
order to meet provincial regulation. The regulation requires 
Ontario municipalities to consider climate change in asset 
management planning.

The 2023 Budget was the first year that a climate lens was applied to all new capital budget 
requests. This systematic approach identified how new investments contribute to climate 
goals and where future opportunities might exist. Overall, the budget identified $52 million 
of new investments with moderate or major climate contributions to reducing emissions and 
building climate resiliency. 
The City will continue to integrate climate-related risks and opportunities into financial planning 
processes. Embedding climate considerations into key planning processes better positions the 
City to integrate climate considerations into annual budgeting and long-range financial planning 
processes. Future TCFD reporting will measure the actual capital expenditures spent in the 
fiscal year measured against amounts previously budgeted and the target level of investments 
identified for climate mitigation and climate adaptation. 
Risk Management 
Climate-related risks were identified, assessed and prioritized through the Climate Vulnerability 
and Risk Assessment and Energy Evolution. The City works to mitigate and monitor those risks 
through its governance framework and its strategies (including the Climate Resiliency Strategy 
and implementation of the Energy Evolution projects). 
Integrating Climate Risks into Enterprise Risk Management 
The City has an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program, which is directed by a Council 
approved Policy and Framework. The ERM program has annual processes in place, where 
departments identify, assess, mitigate, monitor and report on risks. These risks are reviewed 
and evaluated for cross-departmental trends. Risks are also escalated corporately if they 
require the attention or action of senior leadership. 
The Corporate Risk Register often includes strategic corporate risks and may also include 
selected departmental and/or horizontal risks that met escalation guidelines and/or exceeded 
corporate risk tolerance levels. Climate-related risks related to meeting GHG reduction 
targets, responding to extreme weather events and adapting to the changing climate are 
incorporated into the City’s ERM program as part of the Corporate Risk Register. 
 
 
 
 
 
Metrics and Targets  
Metrics and targets include the key metrics 
to monitor climate-related risks and report 
on progress toward climate-related goals. 
As part of the approved Climate Change 
Master Plan, the city committed to providing 
an annual update on the climate change 
framework that includes the latest GHG 
emission inventories, an assessment of how 
Ottawa is tracking towards community and 
corporate targets, and a progress update on 
achieving the Climate Change Master Plan’s 
eight priorities. The most recent status update 
report was received by Council in April 2023 
and included key performance indicators 
where data was available to track progress. 
The number of indicators will continue to grow 
in the coming years as projects, programs, 
and plans move from the development phase 
into the implementation phase. 
Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Targets  
As part of the Climate Change Master Plan, 
Council approved short-, mid- and long-term 
targets to reduce community emissions 
by 100 per cent by 2050 and corporate 
emissions by 100 per cent by 2040 
(based on a 2012 baseline). These targets 
align with the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change’s target to limit global 
warming increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Greenhouse Gas 
Emissions Inventories 
GHG emission inventories provide a snapshot of energy 
use and associated emissions over a given period within 
the buildings, transportation, waste, and agriculture sectors. 
The City undertakes two types of GHG inventories: community 
inventories, which track emissions from activities within the 
geographic boundary of Ottawa, and corporate inventories, 
which track emissions under municipal operational control. 
The latest inventory results are for the 2020 calendar year. 
Between 2012 and 2020, community emissions decreased by 
15 per cent. To meet the mid-term target to reduce emissions 
by 68 per cent by 2030, emissions will need to decrease by six 
to seven per cent per year, requiring a significant increase in 
action and investment to meet the aggressive timelines. Over 
the same period, corporate emissions decreased by 43 per cent, 
putting the corporation ahead of its short-term target to reduce 
emissions by 30 per cent by 2025 and on track to meet its  
2030 target. 
The City is undertaking a third-party review of its inventory 
methodologies, data sources, and assumptions to confirm 
accuracy, consistency and alignment with best reporting 
practices. The 2021 and 2022 GHG inventories will be 
completed later in 2023 following the completion of the  
third-party review.
