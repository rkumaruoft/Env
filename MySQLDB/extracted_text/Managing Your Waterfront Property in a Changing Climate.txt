Climate change is real and it is happening now. 
The impacts of climate change in Ontario are already being observed. The 
impacts of climate change outlined in this document should be considered 
as part of your waterfront stewardship plan.
As a good waterfront property 
owner and Lake Steward, you make 
wise environmental and economic 
decisions, and implement the 
most effective strategies to help 
your waterfront property be more 
resilient to climate change. Many 
of these management options are 
already part of good stewardship 
practices to enhance wildlife, 
recreation, and other objectives. You 
may also want to consider how your 
shoreline can play a vital role to help 
capture carbon emissions, reduce 
erosion and minimize the impacts of 
climate change in the future.
Now is the time to get informed, make plans, and manage your waterfront 
property as an informed steward. Shorelines that are well adapted to new 
and changing conditions will be better able to meet your management 
goals as you build a more sustainable future for your waterfront property.
Good shoreline management  
can save you time and money 
The choices you make will affect how well your waterfront property can 
withstand changes or recover after extreme weather. It is important that 
property owners take steps to keep shorelines healthy even as conditions 
change. Preparing for these changes now will save time and money in the 
long run, improve shoreline/lake health, increase your enjoyment of your 
property, and reduce the risk of shoreline damage in the future.
There are several things property owners can do to enhance the ability of 
waterfront properties to adapt to climate change and its effects (see the 
list on the inside of the back page). In most cases, these actions are part of 
normal shoreline management.

Climate change is happening
The following pages explain the potential impacts of climate change in 
Ontario and how they may affect waterfront properties. Management 
options are described that can help to reduce polluted runoff, erosion 
and shoreline loss, and impacts from flooding, as well as increase 
the environmental benefits of a healthy property. In some cases, a 
management option may be to take minimal-to-no action, and to allow 
species composition and structure to change naturally over time (natural 
succession). In other cases, the best management option may be to increase 
the resiliency of your property through some of the recommendations in 
this guidebook, such as planting more species, or building a buffer zone to 
reduce runoff.
Within the last 40 years, Ontario has 
experienced changes in temperature, 
rainfall patterns, and extreme weather 
events that can have pronounced 
environmental and economic effects 
on lakes, rivers, nearshore habitats 
and wetlands. Within aquatic 
ecosystems in the Great Lakes Basin, 
surface water temperatures are on 
the rise, water levels are in flux, and 
the composition of plant and animal 
communities in wetlands, lakes and 
rivers is changing. 
Temperatures are increasing
40 years of data show that Ontario 
is getting warmer.¹ Minimum air 
temperatures have increased in 
northern Ontario between 1.4 and 
3.8°C (averages shown on right). By 
comparison, temperature increases 
experienced in southern Ontario have 
been less: between 0.7 and 2.1°C.

Warming water temperatures 
have also been observed in 
Ontario inland lakes and the 
Great Lakes, reducing the 
amount of suitable habitat for 
fish species that are typically 
found in lakes and streams. 
In the last century, surface 
water temperatures of the 
Great Lakes have increased 
by as much as 3.5°C.²
Rainfall patterns are changing
As temperature increases, we have experienced changes in rainfall  
patterns. Generally, conditions have become slightly wetter and lake  
effect precipitation is on the rise which is leading to increases in stream 
flows. Small increases in precipitation may not be sufficient to offset 
the more significant rises in temperature and may lead to overall drier 
conditions. Fluctuating water levels were observed in the Great Lakes 
between 1985 and 2005, through natural phenomena (precipitation, 
evaporation and transpiration) and also driven by human activities  
such as water withdrawals.³
Extreme weather events are more frequent
Ontario is experiencing more frequent extreme rain and storm events, 
and more flooding and drought. During the first half of the 20th century, 
there were less than 10 flood disasters per decade in Ontario; however by 
the 1990s, the frequency of floods per decade had increased five-fold.4 
Waterfront properties affected by extreme events such as wind storms, 
ice storms, summer heat waves, droughts, floods, and wildfires can take 
decades to recover after disturbance, and ecosystem structure and 
productivity may change as a result.

Natural landscapes store carbon and resist erosion
Scientists agree that our climate is changing and that these changes are 
caused by human activities, particularly the increase in greenhouse gas 
emissions from burning fossil fuels.
Nearshore habitats and ecosystems can help with flood storage, erosion 
control, water filtration and carbon sequestration. Vegetation naturally 
captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which is then stored as 
carbon in live plants and trees, downed woody debris, and soil. This 
carbon can be stored for decades and centuries in living trees or in durable 
wood products like furniture or building frames until it is released when 
vegetation either decays or is burned. Maintaining or increasing the amount 
of carbon that can be stored within your property is crucial to help reduce 
atmospheric carbon dioxide emissions and the effects of climate change in 
the future.
If natural shorelines are converted to hardened or manicured shorelines 
it decreases resiliency to climate change. Natural shorelines also provide 
other benefits such as producing clean air and filtering water, creating 
wildlife habitat, and other aesthetic values. With increased temperatures 
and drought, plants and trees along shorelines may be stressed and less 
successful at reproduction and seedling survival may decline, which makes 
maintaining healthy ecosystems so important.

Many changes to the natural environment are already being observed in 
Ontario. These changes may affect the biodiversity on your property as well 
as both ecosystem and human health. Some examples of observed changes 
in nature include:
1. The northern range boundaries of warm 
and coolwater sportfishes in Ontario lakes 
are shifting northward. Over the past 30 
years fish have moved northward at a 
rate of 12 to 17 km per decade in Ontario.5 
Brown bullhead, bluegill and largemouth 
bass showed the largest northward 
shifts, each more than one-half degree 
of latitude. These species are shifting at 
rates comparable with other aquatic and 
terrestrial species around the globe. 
2.	Ice cover declines on all Great Lakes 
are affecting biodiversity in coastal 
wetlands and nearshore habitat, reducing 
ice fishing opportunities and rendering 
shorelines more susceptible to extreme 
storm events in winter. Between 1970 and 
2013, mean maximum ice cover declined 
most on Lake Superior (42%), followed by 
lakes Ontario (32%), Erie (25%), Michigan 
(21%) and Huron (19%).6
3.	Smallmouth bass (shown at left) 
spawning time in eastern Ontario 
populations have advanced on average 
by 2 days per decade since the 1960s as 
a result of changing ice-out and spring 
water temperatures. The opening day of 
bass fishing season has been changed in 
some areas to protect nesting fish and 
young until the young disperse from 
spawning sites.7

4. Several frog and toad species have shifted 
the timing of spring emergence and calling 
in southeastern Ontario. In the four decades 
of observation to date, the northern leopard 
frog emerges significantly earlier now, by 
an estimated 22 days. American toads have 
advanced their start of calling by up to 
19 days. This significant shift in breeding 
behaviour for two species has occurred at 
the same time as a significant local increase 
in spring temperatures of an estimated 
2.8°C over four decades.8
5.	Expansion of the native orchid nodding 
ladies’ tresses northward since the 1980s 
has been facilitated by its many small light 
seeds’ ability to disperse naturally in the 
wind and more northerly areas becoming 
available with warming temperatures. The 
orchid’s native range was traditionally 
southern Ontario and US parts of the Great 
Lakes Basin but it is now thriving on the 
eastern shores of Lake Superior and  
Algoma Highlands.9 
6.	Until recently, the risk of Lyme disease, a 
bacteria spread by some species of ticks, 
has been restricted to localized areas 
along the north shore of Lake Erie, Lake 
Ontario, and the St. Lawrence River due to 
temperature limitations. However, as the 
climate changes, Lyme disease is emerging 
as a serious health risk in many parts of 
Ontario. Models suggest that the geographic 
range of tick species that transmit Lyme 
disease may expand significantly due to 
climate change, with a northern expansion 
of about 200 km projected by the year 
2020. This expansion would likely be due 
to longer growing seasons resulting from 
warmer temperatures and decreased tick 
mortality during milder winters.10

As our climate changes, the projected changes in temperature and 
precipitation that are most likely to affect shorelines and waterfront 
properties are:
•	 More frequent extreme weather events including heavy rain, wind  
and ice storms
•	 Drier soils in summer
•	 Increasing invasive species and new pathogens from southern climates
•	 Changing habitat ranges, particularly for species along the southern  
edge of Ontario
•	 Changing ecological processes that may affect shorelines in unknown ways 
(e.g. insect pollination, breeding, plant hardiness, wildlife interactions)
•	 Increased erosion of shorelines
•	 An earlier spring freshet
•	 More ice free days on inland lakes in the winter months
•	 Longer growing seasons
•	 More winter rain and earlier peak stream flows

Researchers with the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry have modeled 
the projected changes in climate in Ontario.11 An ensemble of several downscaled 
Global Climate Models are used to look at possible future climate. Scenarios describing 
possible future climate are based on assumptions of how the earth’s climate operates, 
future world population levels, economic activity and greenhouse gas emissions. 
The maps shown below illustrate the average annual temperature difference 
comparing a base historical period (1971-2000) to a future period in the 2050’s  
and 2080’s using a business-as-usual emissions scenario (RCP 8.5).11
For more projections see:  
www.climateontario.ca/MNR_Publications/CCRR-44.pdf (download 40 pages) 
Suitable habitat for many species will move north
The composition of aquatic and 
nearshore ecosystems is largely 
controlled by past land use history 
and by what species have adapted 
to the climate in the area. 
Slow and subtle changes in 
ecosystem composition and 
distribution are determined by a 
number of factors such as: seasonal 
temperatures, precipitation patterns, 
soil moisture patterns, severity of 
extreme storm events and natural 
disturbances, and the abundance of 
pests and diseases. As these factors 
change, the habitat required for 
species may shift. Species you find 
on your waterfront property today 
may not be there in the future.
Fish populations that are not 
adapted to the warmer temperatures 
may begin to disappear while those 
who prefer warmer temperatures 
will expand their ranges. Warmer 
water temperatures provide more 
favourable conditions for toxic algal 
blooms which could make water 
undrinkable and/or un-swimmable.12

The beloved loon is projected to lose  
over half of its current summer range  
and approximately three quarters  
of its’ winter range. 
In both seasons the potential to shift 
northwards in a warming climate is 
significant. While the loon may be able 
to keep pace with the rapidly changing 
climate, it looks all but certain that we 
will lose the iconic loons in summer  
by the end of the 21st century.
44% of summer 
2000 range is stable.

Variable temperatures lead to unpredictable  
weather and damage
Warming is projected to continue across Ontario throughout the 21st century. 
Across the province more precipitation is projected in the winter, though this 
could vary greatly by region (provincial range is from -56 to 158mm from 
historical levels). Summers are projected to be drier on average, with a range 
of -69 to 48 mm less precipitation than historical levels across the province 
by the 2080s. Higher temperatures in the winter may mean fewer frost days 
per year. This could mean a longer growing season which could affect plants 
and fish whose life cycles depend on the temperature.11 
It is likely that lake-effect snow will increase in the short term as lake 
temperatures rise. However, by the end of the 21st century, snowfall will likely 
be replaced by heavy lake-effect rain events due to the higher temperatures. 
As well, warmer annual temperatures will cause warmer winters which will 
lead to precipitation in the form of ice, sleet and freezing rain as opposed 
to snow.13 Ice storms will likely occur more frequently with more moderate 
winter temperatures across most of Ontario in the future. Ice storms occur 
primarily when surface temperatures are hovering at or just below the 
freezing point. Changes to rainfall can also affect connectivity within and 
among streams and lakes.14

Ice accumulations on branches can 
increase branch weight up to 30 
times and cause even large branches 
to break, severely affecting tree 
growth. Damages to your home may 
result from falling branches, power 
lines could be downed and roadways 
blocked. Unfortunately this could 
mean increased power outages and 
restricted access to your property 
via cottage roads in severe weather.
Melting and freezing of water in 
variable temperatures can cause  
ice jams which may result in  
flooding of natural creeks and  
rivers. Historically, in Southern 
Ontario we have experienced a 
single spring melt, when the majority 
of the winter snow and accumulation 
melts. During this period rivers 
and lakes are at capacity, and if 
overwhelmed can cause potentially 
dangerous situations. 
More recently due to variable 
temperatures, spring melt is not 
necessarily happening all at once 
and not necessarily happening only 
in the spring. There is also evidence 
that rising air and water temperatures 
may contribute to more tornado 
activity in areas not previously prone 
to this type of activity.15
Warmer winters and variable 
temperatures will make winter 
activities even more unpredictable 
and dangerous. Extreme weather 
events present both health and 
safety risks and can result in 
property loss, environmental 
damage, insurance claims, costly 
repairs and maintenance.

Drought may cause wetlands  
to dry up and decrease water quality
Wetlands are a vital part of a functioning 
ecosystem as they play an important 
role in maintaining local water quality. 
Wetlands are also capable of slowing the 
effects of climate change by capturing 
and storing carbon. A functioning wetland 
is capable of storing large amounts of 
water which is then filtered and slowly 
released into the surrounding watershed. 
When wetlands are removed or dry due 
to the effects of climate change, storm 
water runs directly into the watershed, 
increasing the chances of flooding and 
decreasing water quality. In the Great 
Lakes Basin, many wetlands are projected 
to be vulnerable to potential drying or 
shrinkage due to changes in temperature 
and precipitation, particularly wetlands 
in southern Ontario and the north-east 
shores of Lake Superior.14 
Warmer temperatures 
help insect pests and 
disease to overwinter
Insect pests and disease can have 
a significant impact on shorelines, 
and a changing climate may 
affect what kind of pests are 
seen in Ontario. Many insects 
and diseases are controlled 
by winter temperatures, with 
colder temperatures reducing 
their populations. As winters get 
warmer with climate change, 
the number of these pests and 
diseases that survive the winter 
may increase, leading to greater 
outbreaks and infestations.
13 
Invasive species outcompete
Invasive plant and fish species affect shoreline/
lake health and regrowth through competition 
for light, nutrients, habitat and food. As many 
of these invasive species have been introduced 
from other regions, the absence of competitors 
or predators means that they are able to 
outcompete and replace many native species. 
Aquatic ecosystems are especially vulnerable. 
Once established in an aquatic ecosystem, an 
invasive species is almost impossible to eliminate 
and control measures can be costly. A changing 
climate may also intensify the problem in the 
following ways:
•	 A longer growing season can give invasive 
species a bigger advantage in their 
competition with native species.
•	 Higher nitrogen levels are linked to a faster 
spread of invasive plants and increased 
resistance to herbicide applications.
•	 Increasing water temperatures will result in 
native fish populations being replaced with 
invasive species that favour warm water. 
•	 Shifting species distributions provides 
an opportunity for invasive species to 
outcompete native species.
Three of the most aggressive invasive plants that are already stressing 
Ontario’s shorelines and waters include: Phragmites, Japanese knotweed 
and Water soldier. 
Invasive Species on your waterfront property?
Ontario has an Early Detection and Distribution Mapping System (EDDMapS 
Ontario) to detect and monitor the spread of invasive species in the 
province. Through EDDMapS Ontario you can report sightings of invasive 
species and view their local, regional or provincial distributions. It contains 
information profiles for over 150 different species, as well as tools for 
searching and downloading data. You can also set up alerts to be notified 
when a new species is detected in your area.

Top 5 actions shoreline owners can take
	
Keep your shoreline natural  
and enhance it if possible 
	
A naturalized shoreline is generally considered the best multi-purpose 
approach to protecting the lake’s edge. Protect the natural shoreline  
by replanting areas that lack vegetation and maintain those areas  
that already exist.
	
Keep aquatic plant populations intact
	
Aquatic plants support the insects that fish eat, and are a primary food 
and habitat source for birds. In addition, aquatic plants help stabilize 
loose sediment and are an effective natural breakwater keeping waves 
from eroding the shoreline. 
	
Maintain and improve your waterfront  
property’s health and biodiversity
	
Enhance biodiversity on your property by leaving rock piles, fallen tree 
limbs and brush piles untouched so they can function as wildlife habitat. 
Re-vegetate bare grounds near streams, rivers and lakes and encourage 
native species of flowers, shrubs and trees to limit your maintenance 
work and provide shelter to native species.
	
Manage pests and disease
	
Understand which insects, diseases and invasive species might be 
expected at your waterfront property and be on the lookout for them with 
regular monitoring to enable early intervention and easier management. 
	
Stay informed
	
It is important to stay informed and attuned to developments in science 
and research and incentive programs that may affect you and your 
waterfront property. Sign up to receive FOCA’s free monthly Elert
