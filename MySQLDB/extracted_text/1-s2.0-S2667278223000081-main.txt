Climate change contributes to adverse outcomes and disruptions in cancer care with disproportionate
impacts on speciﬁc populations. As the health effects of fossil fuel air pollution and planetary warming
increase, transdisciplinary stakeholders across communities will be crucial to developing and implementing
climate solutions as health solutions for patients affected by cancer. We provide a narrative review of four
key themes at the intersection of climate change and cancer then describe potential opportunities to
engage health care and community organizations, government agencies, public health entities, and clinicians
dedicated to ensuring high quality cancer care for all. Through the review, we highlight that an expansion
of climate-focused research funding and educational offerings for health professionals provides the founda-
tion for ongoing action that can reduce health disparities, care disruptions, and health service demands while
diminishing the carbon footprint of cancer care and improving patient-centered health outcomes. Lastly, we
discuss lessons from the past that emphasize the importance of preparedness and swift action through scal-
able institutional, national, and international policies rooted in health, equity, and justice. We posit that
through systematic and deliberate choice by those with decision making capabilities, climate mitigation and
adaptation becomes cancer prevention and control.

1. Climate change and cancer intersection
Both cancer and climate change increasingly challenge communi-
ties to promote health and well-being with a focus on health equity.
While often viewed as independent challenges, there is a strong syn-
ergy between efforts to prevent and control cancer and efforts to mit-
igate and adapt to climate change. While all populations are—and
will continue to be—affected by both challenges, disparities are sig-
niﬁcant and persistent. Cancer disproportionately affects older adults,
women, certain racial and ethnic groups, and low socioeconomic sta-
tus (SES) groups [1,2]. Climate change exposures affect speciﬁc popu-
lations and places unequally as well [3,4]. As climate change
progresses, individuals with cancer are more likely to experience
large-scale disruptions in transportation, health care delivery, and
energy availability with compounding insults to existing challenges
[5,6]. Such potential harm reveals an opportunity for community and
academic leaders to convene to guide evidence-based policies and
practices for health. In this narrative review, authors brieﬂy outline
four key themes at the intersection of climate change and cancer,
offering areas of emphasis for transdisciplinary teams seeking to
intervene, then share potential areas to act on a local or global level.
1.1. First, climate change may cause cancer or complicate cancer
survival via environmental changes
Air pollution fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels is causing
hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide with robust evidence
connecting ambient ﬁne particulate matter (PM2.5) to lung cancer
incidence and mortality [7−10]. In a large prospective cohort of
never-smoking patients studied over 26 years, there was a 15−27%
increase in lung cancer mortality for every 10 mg/m3 increase in
PM2.5 concentrations [11]. Wildﬁres, now increasing in size and
scope, degrade air quality by releasing volatile carcinogenic com-
pounds and heavy metals in addition to particulate matter into the
atmosphere, soil, and nearby aquatic habitats [12−15]. Extreme heat
worsens air quality and fuels ﬁres, yet it is the people exposed who
matter most.
In terms of survival, environmental shifts may make previously
livable places inhospitable to individuals made vulnerable by cancer
diagnoses and treatments. Patients suffering from advanced malig-
nancies will be at greater risk for dehydration due to increased

frequency of heatwaves coupled with a decreasing or impaired water
supply and complications associated with worse air quality [16,17].
In addition, healthy behaviors known to prevent cancer or improve
survival may be less supported in a warming world. Urban heat
islands create potentially dangerous environments for salutogenic
physical activity outdoors [18] and increase risk for cancer pathogen-
esis and poorer prognosis [19]. Climate-related extreme weather
events (EWEs) such as prolonged droughts or heavy precipitation dis-
rupt food supply and water systems that negatively inﬂuence crop
yields and food prices thus increasing risk for malnutrition and/or
poor nutritional status, both of which negatively affect cancer out-
comes [20]. EWEs also increase psychological stress, which has been
shown to impede immune response and increase systemic inﬂamma-
tion; both elevate the risk for cancer incidence, tumor progression,
and aggressiveness [21,22].
1.2. Second, climate change may lead to disruptions in care for patients
with cancer
Acute and chronic climate stressors threaten multiple facets of
health and health service delivery [23]. While every EWE cannot be
attributed directly to climate change, EWEs are being ampliﬁed by
anthropogenic climate change and will increasingly insult health,
including within the cancer community [4,24]. With supply chains,
blood products and some medications require cold storage and reli-
ably functioning energy systems. From a treatment perspective,
patients undergoing radiotherapy have been shown to have worse
survival if treatment was received during a declared hurricane disas-
ter [25]. In 2017, Hurricane Harvey left a record amount of rainfall in
Houston, Texas and caused MD Anderson Cancer Center to close
some of its outpatient services due to ﬂooding [26]. After Hurricane
Maria, delayed or interrupted health care contributed to one-third of
deaths, thus emphasizing the sustained morbidity and mortality after
climate-related events in communities [27]. Treatments also require
a diverse group of highly skilled health care workers to provide serv-
ices for patients. Healthcare systems need to be fully equipped and
ready to support individuals affected by climate-related health emer-
gencies, including those seeking cancer care.
1.3. Third, the complex care that is required for patients with cancer
diagnoses and surveillance is energy intensive thus contributing to rising
levels of greenhouse gas emissions and planetary warming
In the United States, 8.5% of greenhouse gas emissions are from
the health sector [28]. Advanced imaging, single-use plastics, trans-
portation (patients, health workers, air and ground Emergency Medi-
cal
Services),
heating
and
cooling,
food
and
nutrition,
pharmaceuticals, among other surgical and non-surgical treatments
are leaving environmental impacts long after initial use or occurrence
[17]. For oncology care, additional factors include the shipment of
targeted therapeutics via specialty pharmacies. As these targeted
therapies are not readily available at general pharmacies and require
frequent clinic visits for therapy administration or lab monitoring,
this contributes to increased transportation impacts and vehicle
emissions particularly in rural locations. Whereas cancer care deliv-
ery is important for patients and should not be compromised, the
environmental implications of care provide an opportunity for inter-
ventions that reduce the carbon footprint of providing health care
services and address intergenerational equity [29].
1.4. Fourth, climate change is likely to disproportionately affect the
same communities who are disproportionately affected by cancer
PM2.5 disproportionately affects Black, Latino, and Indigenous
Peoples [30,31]. Indigenous people, as an example, have unjustly
been subjected to targeted differential investments in carbon
intensive economic activities since the colonial era [32,33]. Wildﬁres
worsen air quality that directly impacts air quality on reservations
[13]. Similarly, communities in the Midwest, for example, live in the
shadow of steel mills, coal power plants, and manufacturing plants. A
greater proportion of Black and Latino residents live near coal power
plants in Wisconsin [34]. In Chicago, residents of color on the South-
side carry a disproportionate burden of adverse cancer outcomes;
cancer death rates are almost twice the national average, and cancer
is the second-leading cause of death for area residents [35]. In Louisi-
ana, polluting chemical plants have long affected nearby residents
and cancer risk, deemed Cancer Alley [31]. While these individuals
are differentially exposed to/and affected by climate hazards and fos-
sil fuel pollution, they are frequently the least responsible for the cur-
rent climate crisis. Equitable, innovative, and pragmatic climate
mitigation and adaptation initiatives, such as strategic investments in
urban greenspaces [22,36,37] and addressing longstanding environ-
mental racism [31,33,38], are needed. Such action would build indi-
vidual and community resilience and ideally improve outcomes on
the full spectrum of the cancer control continuum: etiology, preven-
tion, detection, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, and end-of-life
care.
Mitigation and adaptation to climate change is cancer prevention
and control. People from all backgrounds have a unique opportunity
to engage with communities that have been impacted ﬁrst and worst
from the health hazards of climate change, learn from their lived
experiences, and form authentic partnerships in efforts to develop
mitigation and adaptation strategies. A rigorous review of the litera-
ture previously identiﬁed ﬁfty-seven selected articles in the literature
with the “climate change” and “cancer” intersection [39]. We expand
on the profound opportunity for diverse community partners from
all professional backgrounds to reduce exposures to patients; to
reduce risks to health care teams responsible for providing health
services; to minimize disruptions within cancer care that affects
quantity and quality of life; and to create a new standard for the next
generation of leaders who are driving evidence-informed policy
development and implementation.
2. Taking action
Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States,
and nearly two million people receive a cancer diagnosis every year
[40,41]. Addressing cancer care collectively with a climate justice
approach can give these patients more quality days and protect
health workers and systems responsible for caring for their commu-
nities during times of uncertainty and need. Despite climate-related
record heat, inland and coastal ﬂooding, wildﬁres, dust storms and
drought, and tropical storms, our transdisciplinary teams of clini-
cians, scientists, policymakers, businesses, and organizations can
work to ensure that the quality of cancer care, and the development
of innovative therapies, continues to advance. As depicted in Fig. 1,
proposed action steps include expansion of educational opportuni-
ties, reducing the environmental footprint of cancer care, increasing
research funding at the intersection of climate change and health,
reducing racial and ethnic disparities in cancer care, and building cli-
mate resilient health systems. In the following section, each of these
topics will be expanded upon to highlight potential areas of involve-
ment.
2.1. Expand educational opportunities
There is a growing body of clinicians with structured and unstruc-
tured training in climate change health impacts and opportunities for
action within the health setting [42]. As of May 2022, the Medical
Society Consortium on Climate and Health represents 700,000 physi-
cians and more than 40 national medical societies, including the
American Society of Clinical Oncology and Society for Gynecologic

Oncology. There are individual groups such as Oncologists United for
Climate and Health (OUCH) and the European Society for Medical
Oncology (ESMO) that have climate change task forces. The Global
Consortium on Climate and Health Education is expanding climate
and health educational resources. The Medical Students for a Sustain-
able Future represents more than 100 medical schools and a growing
number of students dedicating their time and talents to addressing
the climate crisis as a health emergency by developing solutions and
action plans that reduce health burdens and improve care in their
communities [43,44]. Among resident education across medical and
surgical specialties, speciﬁc competencies have already been created
[45,46].
Scientists continue to call upon the global clinician community to
act [47,48] as climate and health messaging has been shown to be
effective when coming from trusted messengers [49]. Physicians are
also counseling patients [50] and challenging policymakers to
improve their communication on climate change as a health issue
[51]. Resolutions are being passed by professional organizations,
such as the American Medical Association, that incorporate mitiga-
tion and adaptation commitments from the health sector. Increas-
ingly, academic physicians will gravitate toward climate opportunity
and health settings that have developed comprehensive, cross-sec-
tional plans to address climate hazards to staff and patients.
2.2. Reduce the environmental footprint of cancer care
There are currently 71 National Cancer Institute-Designated Can-
cer Centers, 53 of which are Comprehensive Cancer Centers [52].
These Centers are frequently connected with university settings and
are driving basic science and clinical research and innovation in can-
cer care. Yet, an environmental toll exists from the cancer care that is
provided [53]. There is a formidable impact from operating theaters
[54] and hospitals, in general, with chemotherapy suites, radiation,
anesthesia, and surgery [55]. An action plan for environmentally sus-
tainable cancer care has already been proposed [56] among other rec-
ommendations across specialties. Others have discussed sources of
greenhouse gas emissions with energy, pharmaceuticals, medical
devices, food, transport, procurement and supply chain, and waste
with proposed interventions [17].
In the last year, the United States made a call to decarbonize the
health sector across partnerships in industry, health systems, and the
National Academy of Medicine [57]. Organizations such as Health
Care Without Harm and Practice Greenhealth continue to engage
clinicians and health systems. Global Green and Healthy Hospitals is
one project of Health Care Without Harm with challenges and a 10-
goal framework that focuses on leadership, chemicals, waste, energy,
water, transportation, food, pharmaceuticals, buildings, and purchas-
ing internationally. Additionally, waste generation in the hospital
from food [58], laparoscopic surgeries [59], or emergency department
encounters [60] are substantial. Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center in New York, New York and the Carbone Cancer Center in
Madison, Wisconsin are the only two national cancer centers with
independent sustainability plans separate from a university while
seven cancer centers referenced sustainability on their homepages
[61].
2.3. Increase research funding on climate change and health
There is a myriad of ways to reduce risks and improve medical
and surgical outcomes that affect patients through targeted climate
and health research linked to actionable policies. Cross-cutting
research across geographic regions that incorporates speciﬁc climate
and cancer hazards and local vulnerable populations impacted by
EWEs or with barriers to care should be key priorities. In ﬁreﬁghters,
for example, evidence supports an increased risk of cancer in Aus-
tralia [62] and in the states of California, Illinois, and Pennsylvania
[63,64]. Heat exposure is another example with complex interactions
that adversely affect health and cause multiorgan failure and death in
severe circumstances [65,66]. Housing and urban heat is one preven-
tion target area whereby place of residence with access to air condi-
tioning and neighborhood inﬂuence heat risk [67]. Air conditioning
use can also contribute to climate change so other solutions related
to patient education and medication choices, access and availability
of cooling facilities, social connectedness, water and fan cooling tech-
niques, among others are vital to incorporate in research and prac-
tice.
Furthermore, an increase in public health research is needed with
partnerships across health systems and public health ofﬁcials to man-
age risks and communication [68]. Urban greenspace is one area that
has positive associations with health [69]; disproportionate exposure
in inner city urban heat islands warrants targeted investments in
urban greenspaces so that individuals may have the opportunity to
improve their health and reduce cancer disparities across all measur-
able outcomes [36]. Part of this work is recognizing the longstanding
discriminatory policies and practices that have led to systemic disin-
vestment in targeted neighborhoods and current challenges in access
to resources and infrastructure [31,38,70]. Other indicators and
implementation science research can be tailored to patients with

cancer and the systems that house them—clinics, hospitals, skilled
nursing facilities, and rehabilitation units [71].
Regarding mitigation, guidelines for modeling and reporting
health effects of mitigation actions have already been described [72]
and should be incorporated in cancer research. Speciﬁc attention
should likewise be directed to substantial greenhouse gas inequality
across race and economic class [73]. Studies support that clean
energy policies reduce emissions and are projected to prevent 53,200
premature deaths each year in the United States and provide $608
billion in beneﬁts from avoided air pollution-related illness and death
[74]. Health care costs are steep with a reported $800 billion in health
care costs annually in the United States due to air pollution and cli-
mate change [75] and, just in 2012, $10 billion in health-related costs
due to 10 climate-sensitive events [76]. Other comprehensive cost
analyses and assessments are needed to accurately describe co-bene-
ﬁts of environmental impact of care and health impacts related to cli-
mate events, especially with an aging population.
On a global scale, building energy resilience may increase treat-
ment options and improve patient-centered outcomes. Resource-
constrained settings face challenges with having trained staff and
functioning equipment [77]. Human and supply chain shortages,
including blood products and reproductive health needs, are fre-
quently ampliﬁed during times of EWEs [78−82]. In radiation oncol-
ogy, services are limited in some regions of the world [83]. Targeted
radiation in cancer treatments has been expressed as the next step to
reducing health disparities and meeting the needs of critically ill
patients; energy policy and global partnerships are necessary [6,84].
Humanitarian crises require “education, screening, treatment, and
palliative care” [85]. Additionally, there is a need for health in
National Adaptation Plans that align with the United Nations Frame-
work Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and other interna-
tional climate policies [86]. As renewable energy is scaled and costs
are at an all-time low [87], the implications for the cancer community
are only positive in expanding access and improving reliable care
around the world not just for some, but for all.
2.4. Reduce racial and ethnic disparities in cancer care
The focus of climate action is to reduce racial and ethnic dispar-
ities and advance equitable care as a human right across global medi-
cal, surgical, and public health spheres [88]. There are racial
disparities in esophageal, lung, colorectal, cervical, liver, gastric,
breast, ovarian, and gynecologic cancers, to name a few [89−93]. Sim-
ilarly, there are disparities in the health effects of climate change in
the United States across ZIP codes, states, and regions [94]. Historical
redlining is associated with air pollution disparities [95], more oil
and gas wells [96], reduced greenspace [97], an increase in dangerous
heat exposure [98], present cardiometabolic risk [99], and worse
breast cancer survival [70].
Another area of intervention is pharmaceuticals and barriers to
medical access for patients. Challenges have been described with ﬁll-
ing opioid prescriptions, which are frequently required for pain con-
trol [100]. In another study, more than half of Black patients with
cancer had difﬁculty obtaining opioid prescriptions at a pharmacy
with many having to wait days or needing to return to the pharmacy
multiple times [101]. Not stocking medications was a primary cause.
Across America’s largest cities, there are more pharmacy deserts in
Black and Latino neighborhoods with higher closure rates of existing
pharmacies and fewer new pharmacies in these locations [102].
Addressing these unmet needs with public health and medical teams
could improve the care and experience for patients as well as reduce
unnecessary phone calls, messaging, and acute care encounters. Sup-
ply chain disruptions—weather or non-weather related—is another
target area to meet these patient care needs. Equity-focused inter-
ventions are urgently needed across all socioeconomic sectors to
reduce both climate injustices and inequities in cancer burden, and
improve equitable access to salutogenic resources.
The mobility of people related to climate change and cultural dif-
ferences impacting cancer screening and treatment uptake should be
considered in the context of global health equity and the ethical dis-
tribution of resources required for cancer care. One example is cervi-
cal cancer screening in refugees with variable health literacy,
ﬁnancial constraints, and competing priorities [103−105]. Another
example is the Gullah Geechee people in South Carolina. Community
champions worked with Hollings Cancer Center and a mobile van to
increase awareness and education on cancer screenings, treatment,
and research [106]. Complex social, economic, political, demographic,
and environmental factors inﬂuenced by climate change contribute
to displacements and disruptions in care [107]. The American Society
of Clinical Oncology has an Equity Task Force that is working to
reduce cancer disparities and improve representation across the can-
cer community. The American Hospital Association has task forces
working to ensure access in vulnerable communities and can utilize
new tools, such as the Environmental Justice Index, to incorporate
environmental health. Lessons can also be learned from groups such
as the Chicago Cancer Health Equity Collaborative that have commit-
ted to a multi-stakeholder approach already [108,109]. Lastly, medi-
cal journals such as the New England Journal of Medicine have
committed to amplifying the health consequences of fossil fuel air
pollution [110].
2.5. Build climate resilient health systems
The health system is buckling and at least transiently broken in
some regions of the United States with limited space for the living
and the deceased, shortages of health workers, and variable supplies
to provide high quality, evidence-based care. A transdisciplinary
approach may add reserve by reducing demands in especially
strained areas of the hospital and improving mismatches in supplies,
thus building hospital capacity. Reducing demand for acute care serv-
ices by critically ill patients with cancer help ensure patients are not
unnecessarily waiting for hours in the emergency department wait-
ing room due to preventable failures by the medical, public health,
and policy communities. Preparedness may include oncologic emer-
gency departments with dedicated rooms for patients with cancer
[111]. Similarly, strengthening existing health care infrastructure to
meet local climate hazard threats can ensure care space is secured
during times of community need. Identifying and planning for risks
for patients with a cancer diagnosis who travel for care or for recrea-
tion ought to be taken into consideration as well to minimize health
care use.
Following disasters, evidence supports that basic resources are
needed—food, water, and shelter; patients who have cancer have
additional challenges that may get overlooked in these circumstances
[112,113]. After Hurricane Harvey, capacity was reduced [114]. After
Superstorm Sandy, blackouts [115] and injuries [116] increased
emergency department visits. Location of hospitals for care may also
inﬂuence outcomes, such as rural or urban locations. In Canada,
patients with cancer who were evaluated at outside emergency
departments were less likely to be admitted but had higher a likeli-
hood of return visits [117]. Potential to avoid multiple emergency
department visits for patients is substantial with long wait times in
emergency departments and possible adverse effects from boarding
or leaving without being seen [118,119]. Increased health care
demands also highlight the need to address end-of-life cancer care
before acute events occur that match patient preferences and the cur-
rent capacity in local hospitals. One example is a patient with termi-
nal cancer who opts out of hospice care during extreme heat.
Partners in primary care, hospice, the cancer center, public health,
Emergency Medical Services, and utilities should develop plans that
best support patients and available local services.

3. Learning from the past
Historical events and the recent past have a unique way of clarify-
ing lessons and making inaction of any kind regrettable. Prior EWEs
and the COVID-19 pandemic both highlight this lens of response
rather than preparedness whereby, at times, patients and health
workers were challenged by lack of resources, inadequate support,
and strain on prehospital and hospital systems. Health care team
members have articulated the challenge of waiting until an event
occurs to react and develop actionable disaster plans, for example
[120].
During COVID-19, there was an initial decrease in the number of
patients who underwent cancer screenings (mammography, pros-
tate-speciﬁc antigen, colonoscopy, Papanicolaou test, low-dose com-
puted tomography scan) [121]. As a solution, researchers have
suggested screening at home for some conditions [122]. In the United
Kingdom, there were substantial increases in avoidable cancer-
related deaths [123]. While the highlighted example in a high-
income setting demonstrates negative impacts of COVID-19 on can-
cer care, less is known in the context of low-and-middle income
countries, but negative impacts are likely higher [124]. The intersec-
tions of the pandemic and the climate crisis create a disproportionate
burden to residents of low and middle-income countries, although
their contributions to the current climate crisis is less [78,125]. Global
health equity needs to be a central focus as we mitigate and adapt to
climate change with a focus on improving global cancer care and
reducing global inequalities in cancer outcomes. There ought to be a
renewed focus on having early goals of care discussions with patients
while incorporating the reality of local climate hazards and health
system resources [126]. With colorectal cancer, a single center had an
increase in emergency visits related to disruptions in referral pro-
cesses with COVID-19 prompting higher risk hospital presentations
and more advanced disease [127]. Developing solutions across disci-
plines has the potential to improve testing, treatment, reduce emis-
sions, reduce costs, and support planetary and patient health.
A systematic review that included 85 studies on disasters demon-
strated signiﬁcant impacts on infrastructure, communication sys-
tems, medications, and medical record keeping; there was little
information on survival outcomes in the short or long-term [24].
Prior EWEs share speciﬁc disruptions in the literature and anec-
dotally through the stories of colleagues. After Hurricanes Irma and
Maria in Puerto Rico, there were disruptions in oncology care, chal-
lenged communication with clinicians before and after the event, and
stressors on local communities for basic resources and social support
[128,129]. Survivors of cancer were also studied and additional bar-
riers to care weeks following Hurricane Maria and negative impact
on psychosocial well-being were found [130]. After Superstorm
Sandy in New York, there were carbon monoxide poisonings [131]
and emergency department visits for mental health that corre-
sponded to power blackouts, particularly in low-wealth neighbor-
hoods [115]. After Hurricane Harvey, immunosuppressed patients
were exposed to mold in their places of residence [132] and MD
Anderson Cancer Center in Houston had an increase in mold-positive
cultures due to extensive ﬂoodwater and increase in posaconazole
use following the hurricane [133]. Participants with hurricane-
related ﬂooding also reported increases in allergic symptoms and
stress [134]. A review of 113 studies of ﬂood and storm disasters
demonstrated an increase in health insults due to poisonings,
wounds, gastrointestinal infections, and skin infections following the
events [135]. Patients with cancer who are immunosuppressed or in
weakened conditions are at heightened risk of poor health from these
exposures.
Preparedness is a worthy investment of time and energy for
patients and staff as evidence by Texas Medical Center in Houston.
The facility was affected by ﬂooding with consequential energy dis-
ruptions after Tropical Storm Allison hit in 2001. Multiple hospitals
were forced to close their doors to patients and staff during a time of
great need. The community came together and invested heavily in
preparedness with dozens of stakeholders involved contributing
their expertise toward a comprehensive plan [136]. When Hurricane
Harvey hit in 2017, damage to health facilities was much less than
during Tropical Storm Allison.
Other major cancer centers in New York, California, and Massa-
chusetts are among the most climate vulnerable places in the nation
and care for some of the most critically ill patients affected by cancer.
World Health Organization guidance on building climate resilient
and environmentally sustainable health care facilities is available,
along with a United States Climate Resilience Toolkit [137]. Connect-
ing the evidence to policy priorities, then, to scale climate solutions
as health solutions may address some morbidity and mortality bur-
dens attributed to cancer in the United States. Data suggests that
political inﬂuence affects age-adjusted mortality rates [138]. Some
members of the cancer community have called for addressing climate
change for health [39,139,140], yet institutional and national policies
have not yet been prioritized by decision makers. Local and federal
policies focused on climate change and cancer care could be integral
to building sustainable cities and ensuring that people within the cit-
ies have the freedom of health and well-being [141].
4. Conclusion
Climate mitigation and adaptation is cancer prevention and con-
trol. Curative and non-curative options are available and feasible—
there are always ways to comfort and guide, to heal and be present.
Preparing now for a warming planet and disruptions in care of
patients addresses both curative and non-curative options. United
States cancer centers that are decarbonized and climate resilient sys-
tems can lead a path for others to follow. A new era of disruption-
free health care with reliable transportation and energy is on the
horizon for patients with cancer. The future is cancer centers of excel-
lence with integrated, climate-ready approaches toward cancer pre-
vention and control.
