About the report
The Resilient Cities Index was developed by Economist Impact and supported by Tokio Marine 
Group. To help policymakers and stakeholders understand risk and design effective policies for 
urban resilience, Economist Impact developed a benchmark of 25 cities. To gauge the resilience of 
these cities, we took measurements across four pillars: critical infrastructure, environment, socio-
institutional and economic. This white paper combines index analysis with expert commentary to 
identify patterns, common strengths, deficits and best practices across index cities. 
The index draws on work by institutions, scientists and researchers. Specifically, the project has 
benefited from counsel provided by a panel of experts who are prominent authorities on urban 
resilience. These include the following (listed alphabetically by surname):

The world is facing unprecedented challenges. Extreme weather events, from hurricanes and wildfires 
to flooding and heatwaves, are becoming more frequent and their effects more devastating. Emerging 
risks like cyber-attacks loom larger as technology dependence deepens. Our cities are exposed to all 
of these risks and more. Lives and livelihoods depend on our ability to understand and mitigate the 
evolving threats to our urban centres. 
There are three phases to resilience. Preparation and mitigation come first. Understanding the risks, 
how they are evolving and taking steps to minimise their impact is essential if cities are to avoid the 
worst. The second phase is response, necessitating swift reactions and timely assistance to save lives 
and diminish the impact when disasters occur. Last is recovery, emphasising the need to learn from 
tragedies and rebuild stronger, better-equipped communities for future shocks and stresses.
The Resilient Cities Index 2023 was sponsored by Tokio Marine Group to establish a research 
programme that will measure the resilience of societies and cities, identify the gaps and challenges 
and give insights into the opportunities and the way forward. We believe the Index will help to 
advance thinking on the topic of resilience while facilitating a constructive dialogue on what we can do 
to create a better tomorrow for all.
While the research provides a comparative analysis of 25 cities, it is all too easy to focus on the 
individual rankings and miss its true value. Cities face different challenges, due to their economic 
positions and geographic locations, and are at different stages on their resilience journey. It is therefore 
important to understand where gaps exist and how growth can be secured.
Tokio Marine Group is one of the largest and longest standing insurance groups in the world. Founded 
in 1879, it comprises a strategic collection of leading insurance businesses. We, at Tokio Marine 
Group, believe that dealing with emerging risks will require greater collaboration between industries, 
governments, academia, the non-profit sector and society as a whole. It is incumbent on our industry 
to work with commercial and governmental partners to strengthen cities both now and in the future.
We know the risks and will continue to work with our clients and partners to mitigate and overcome 
the unexpected to build a better society and a better tomorrow.

By 2050, cities will be home to more than two-
thirds of the world’s population, placing them at 
the crux of humanity’s ability to adapt to the risks 
and uncertainties of the 21st century. Natural 
disasters from extreme weather to pandemics, 
and human catastrophes such as industrial 
accidents, terrorism and cyber-attacks, take 
their gravest toll on citizens in densely populated 
urban centres. Cities can also be flashpoints 
for instability and conflict due to poverty and 
inequality. 
For the purpose of this research, Economist 
Impact defines urban resilience as a city’s 
ability to avoid, withstand and recover from 
shocks, such as natural disasters; and from 
long-term stresses such as poverty, decrepit 
infrastructure or migration. A resilient city 
should be able to self-organise following a shock 
event, adapt to unfolding risks and plan ahead 
rather than react.1 “With the reality of climate 
change, resilience is not just about the ability to 
withstand or absorb disturbances but [is also 
about] being sustainable. It must not add to any 
future potential problems while serving its basic 
functions,” says Lavan Thiru, executive director at 
Infrastructure Asia.

Key findings from the inaugural edition of the 
Resilient Cities Index include the following.
•	 Cities performed well in the critical 
infrastructure pillar of the index, but 
there are some weak points that require 
strategic focus. The cities with the highest 
scores were Dubai, Shanghai, New York 
and Singapore. These capital-rich market 
locations have greater opportunities to 
develop new infrastructure, compared with 
European cities constrained by decades- or 
centuries-old systems. Within this pillar, 
digital infrastructure and transportation 
were a drag on cities’ resilience.
•	 Cities that use data and technology to 
create operational efficiencies and share 
information with their citizens—i.e., 
smart cities—are better at dealing with 
shocks. Patchy internet quality, which can 
impede access to digital services, pulled down 
the overall resilience score in the critical 
infrastructure pillar. Digital technologies 
and advanced data analytics can help to 
predict risks, optimise existing systems 
and keep the public informed. Greater 
digitalisation comes with risks, especially to 
critical infrastructure, but most cities in the 
index have built safeguards against this. 
•	 Most emerging economy cities lack 
adequate regulatory frameworks, 
strategies and incentives for future-
proofing infrastructure. Only a few 
cities in the index achieved high scores 
for future-proofing, which involves 
ensuring infrastructure preparedness for 
shocks while managing current and future 
emissions. One way cities can future-proof 
is by incentivising sustainable designs for 
buildings, such as installing green roofs, 
incorporating modularity and retrofitting 
for energy efficiency—a practice only 
found in high-income cities in the index.
•	 Efforts to achieve environmental resilience 
are led by innovative solutions. Cities 
are employing a variety of nature-based 
solutions to adapt to flooding and heat 
stress, from planting rooftop vegetation and 
mangrove forests (green infrastructure) to 
rehabilitating wetlands (blue infrastructure). 
Cities are also decarbonising by adopting 
renewable energy and negative emission 
technologies, such as carbon capture, storage 
and removal. However, the scalability of these 
technologies is likely to be challenging for 
resource-constrained emerging market cities.
•	 Cities demonstrated poorer performance 
in the socio-institutional pillar, mostly 
due to income inequality and poor health 
and well-being metrics. Only nine cities 
have a single, comprehensive plan to support 
vulnerable groups. However, one bright 
spot is that cities are promoting a culture of 
readiness to act in the event of a disaster. 
The majority of cities scored highly on this 
or are working to improve their readiness.
•	 Cities had the lowest average scores in 
the economic pillar, dragging down some 
cities that performed well in other areas. 
The low penetration of financial safety nets 
hinders safeguards against threats and 
undermines a city’s ability to recover from 
shocks. Another aspect of economic resilience 
is a city’s ability to incubate innovation, 
which can foster solutions to a range of 
problems, from congestion to water stress. 
Unfortunately, most cities scored poorly 
on the indicator for start-up ecosystems.

Cities have long been celebrated as symbols 
of resilience, endurance and adaptability. They 
are often regarded as dynamic and progressive 
powerhouses, brimming with innovation and 
vitality. The promise of opportunity, in particular, 
continues to pull people towards urban centres. 
By 2050, the world’s cities will be home to 
more than two-thirds of the global population.2 
With this in mind, it is critical for societies and 
governments to evaluate their risk management 
practices and build resilient cities that can 
withstand an uncertain future.
In 2023, the planet experienced the hottest 
three-month period on record,3 with 
unprecedented sea surface temperatures and 
extreme weather. Repeated heat waves hit urban 
tourist hotspots, harming people’s health and 
disrupting their daily lives.4 China’s temperature 
record was shattered, driving people to seek 
relief in bomb shelters. Elsewhere, the heavens 
opened. Exceptional monsoon rains washed 
away bridges and homes in northern India, 
shortly after New Delhi recorded its heaviest 
day of rainfall in more than 40 years. Hilary, 
the first tropical storm to strike California in 84 
years, brought nearly a year’s worth of rain to 
Los Angeles in a single day, causing widespread 
flooding.5 In September, Hong Kong was 
drenched by the heaviest rain since records 
began 140 years ago. Unrelated to climate 
change, cities were also battered by natural 
disasters. Syria and Turkey are still reeling from 
the effects of an earthquake in February that 
killed nearly 60,000 people, prompting questions 
about urban resilience and the governance of 
building construction.6 The Russia-Ukraine war 
also continues to rage, with resulting increases 
in energy prices making households more 
vulnerable to energy poverty.7
The human toll of disasters in cities can be 
devastating, reflecting both their high population 
densities and their interdependent infrastructure. 
Poverty, inequality and urban sprawl also make 
cities potential flashpoints for social unrest and 
riots. “In every major metropolitan area in the 
world, the risk profile is just rapidly increasing, 
particularly in cities in developing countries,” 
says Gareth Morgan, executive director of future 
planning and resilience for the City of Cape Town.
The Resilient Cities Index is a comprehensive 
evaluation of urban resilience that explores cities’ 
preparedness to tackle shocks by examining 
their critical infrastructure, environment, socio-
institutional dynamics and economy. Economist 
Impact’s research captures the beginning of a 
move from theory to practice as cities start to 
implement plans to improve their preparedness 
and resilience. It also captures a growing focus 
on the relationship between resilience and 
sustainability. The research is not exhaustive, 
reflecting both the complexity and dynamics

of the urban system and the complex causal 
chain of indicators. Where possible, however, we 
have incorporated subsystems with close causal 
relationships into the same framework. For 
example, urban climate resilience is considered 
alongside carbon neutrality goals, infrastructure 
future-proofing and the electrification of 
transportation. We also recognise that aspects 
of the socio-institutional pillar play significant 
supporting roles for other indicators. For 
example, effective disaster management, which 
is an indicator in the environmental pillar, is co-
dependent on the digitalisation of a municipality, 
a city’s inclusiveness and its culture of readiness.
In the realm of urban planning and governance, 
the gap between policy and implementation will 
remain a significant challenge to cities’ resilience. 
While cities around the world are recognising 
the need to build resilience in the face of 
growing environmental, social and economic 
uncertainties, translating intentions into action 
remains a formidable hurdle.

A city’s critical infrastructure—interpreted in 
this index as electricity, water, transportation, 
buildings and digital connectivity—needs to meet 
residents’ everyday needs, withstand extreme 
events and support cities to bounce back after 
disasters. 
Back-up or blackout
In the Resilient Cities Index, high-income Gulf 
and Asian cities were the top performers in 
the critical infrastructure pillar, with Dubai, 
Shanghai and Singapore taking three of the 
top four slots. This reflects several advantages, 
including the ability of capital-rich emerging 
economies to develop greenfield infrastructure, 
unlike European cities hobbled by decades- or 
centuries-old infrastructure. It also, in the case of 
Dubai and Singapore, reflects the benefits of a 
smaller geographic footprint.
The populous emerging economy cities 
of Lagos, Dhaka and Jakarta face the most 
significant challenges as they seek to deliver 
critical infrastructure for huge metropolitan 
populations across sprawling geographies. In 
some cases, efforts are further complicated 
by poor governance. Cities with high levels of 
corruption scored poorly on most aspects of 
critical infrastructure.
Decrepit grid infrastructure is exacerbating 
energy poverty in cities. Nearly 775m people in 
the world live without electricity, according to 
the International Energy Agency.8  Lower- and 
upper-middle-income cities, concentrated in 
Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Africa, need to 
improve their electricity provision (see Figure 
1). When responding to a crisis, outdated and 
fragile infrastructure can amplify the impacts of 
a disaster, as was evident in Puerto Rico in 2022. 
“The hurricane destroyed the electricity system 
and all the critical infrastructure it powered. 
There was no way to communicate or to provide 
energy, even the hospitals didn’t have backup 
generators,” notes Katrin Bruebach, global 
director of programmes and delivery at the 
Resilient Cities Network. Failure to modernise 
the electrical grid following the 2017 hurricane 
worsened the disaster’s outcomes. 
Such events are not isolated to developing cities. 
Critical infrastructure has also failed in high-
income cities, such as during Hurricane Sandy 
in New York, when power blackouts affected 
several hospitals, leading to the evacuation of 
200 patients.9 Power providers do not sufficiently 
factor climate change into future planning, often 
failing to use materials that are temperature-
resistant or to locate facilities in areas that are 
less likely to flood.10

Figure 1: Inadequate electricity provision brings cities to a halt 
More than 107m people live in index cities with inadequate electricity provision, risking interruptions to their daily lives.
Another important aspect of resilience is 
the ability to learn from shock events and 
adapt accordingly. Some cities have become 
world leaders in preparedness and public 
communication following tragic experiences 
with natural hazards. The city of Christchurch 
in New Zealand, for example, learned painful 
lessons from an earthquake that destroyed its 
main water-supply pipeline. “They put a system 
in place that is able to keep the water supply 
running for six months if another earthquake 
hits,” says Ms Bruebach. 
Connecting in a crisis
Urban mobility goes hand in hand with quality of 
life in cities. City governments across the world 
are investing in smart mobility solutions that 
will reduce journey times and congestion and 
improve air quality. The global smart mobility 
market is expected to grow annually at a rate 
of 20% from 2020 to 2027, reaching a value of 
US$70.5bn by 2027.11 
During crises, transportation infrastructure is 
the most vital intermediary between victims 
and first responders. It facilitates response and 
recovery efforts, from the evacuation of victims 
to the delivery of supplies. However, most global 
cities are plagued by traffic congestion and only 
six of the 25 cities in the index have emergency 
services that can respond in under ten minutes.

Forty percent of cities in the index have not 
leveraged intelligent traffic management 
technologies to help manage congestion and 
optimise transportation infrastructure—for 
example, ensuring the efficient passage of 
emergency vehicles by synchronising traffic 
lights. There is also room to improve the 
efficiency of public transport, which would 
reduce emissions and provide an opportunity 
to lessen social inequality. More than half of the 
cities in the index (56%) have inefficient public 
transport systems, with outdated networks, 
irregular services and regular overcrowding. In 
New York, passengers wait a cumulative average 
of 64 minutes on platforms each month due to 
train delays.12 
Digital infrastructure is another important 
aspect of critical infrastructure (as well as 
socio-institutional resilience) as local authorities 
increasingly rely on digital technology to deliver 
essential services. Most cities in the index 
performed well overall on the indicator for 
e-government services, such as applying online 
for identification cards, filing taxes online and 
finding information online about government 
schemes for residents, with an average score 
of 68.8 (where 100 denotes most resilient). The 
flow of information must run both ways though, 
with the public providing real-time updates 
during a crisis. Cities are racing to expand their 
5G connections to improve internet speed, which 
will support digital infrastructure resilience.

As the world becomes increasingly connected, 
however, the number and severity of cyber-
threats continue to grow.13 Cyberattacks on 
government agencies increased by 95% over 
the course of a single year (2021-22)14 and 
major security flaws could affect flood defences, 
radiation detection and traffic monitoring.15 
Cities in the index scored well for cybersecurity 
preparedness, with 19 scoring 75 or above, 
indicating high levels of preparedness and 
awareness. Top performers (Dubai, Los Angeles, 
New York and Singapore) have advanced 
technical barriers, such as tools to monitor 
network security, detect intrusions and identify

security vulnerabilities, on top of efforts to 
protect key infrastructure. Some lower- and 
upper-middle-income cities such as Cairo, 
Jakarta and São Paulo have taken the lead in 
building cybersecurity capabilities (see Figure 
4). Cairo’s preparedness is driven by a national 
level task force that protects specific sectors 
such as telecommunications from cyber threats. 
This national task force also collaborates with 
educational institutions to provide cybersecurity 
training and certify talent.16
Cities must adapt to what they can’t avoid
Infrastructure accounts for 79% of all greenhouse 
gas emissions and is central to decarbonisation 
strategies.17 Future-proofing infrastructure—
which involves developing regulatory 
frameworks, policies and strategies for flexible, 
adaptable and sustainable infrastructure—can 
reduce emissions while preparing for the impacts 
of climate change. To date, cities have deployed a 
range of innovative solutions (see Figure 5).18,19
Future-proofing and retrofitting legacy structures 
with climate-friendly technology can be 
expensive and requires significant planning to 
support efficient operation for years to come.20 
For instance, switching to more efficient heat 
pumps is proving difficult in cities with older 
housing and gas boilers, as installation needs 
to be supported with extra insulation and 
requires outdoor space.21 For older houses, this 
would mean lifting floorboards to line walls 
with insulation or investing in thicker external 
insulation. 
City decision-makers can take steps to help 
embed resilience in both existing and new 
buildings. New York City provides a one-year tax 
abatement for the construction of a green roof 
that covers 50% of eligible space on residential 
and commercial buildings in the city. A recent 
mapping exercise revealed that green roofs 
cover less than 1% of New York City’s one 
million buildings, however, leaving a substantial 
opportunity for expansion.22
Building designs should also be functional, 
enduring and easy to replace to limit costs, waste 
and emissions. Valued at US$91bn in 2022, the 
global modular construction market is expected 
to grow to US$120.4bn by 2027.23 Some cities 
are developing policies to support the future-
proofing of buildings. For example, Melbourne’s 
Design and Construction Standards require 
all designs to consider long-term life-cycle 
implications and future renewal opportunities.24
Cities must also future-proof their transport 
infrastructure—for example, through rapid 
electrification. Tough emissions regulations 
have helped spur electric vehicle adoption, and 
cities will need to scramble to build supporting

infrastructure. Worldwide, new policies are 
supporting this shift too. A draft law approved 
by the EU in February could see a total ban on 
new internal combustion engine (ICE) cars by 
2035, and China is demanding that new energy 
vehicles account for 20% of cars by 2025, with a 
full switch from ICE vehicles by 2035.  
China is already home to 13 of the top 25 
“electric vehicle capitals”, as described by the 
International Council on Clean Transportation.25 
Some of our index cities are also in this category, 
including Tokyo, Paris, London, Amsterdam, Los 
Angeles and New York. Dhaka is the only city in 
the index that does not have a plan to promote 
transport electrification.

Cities are at the mercy of natural forces. The 
index measures urban environment resilience 
across six indicators: flooding, heat stress, air 
pollution, disaster management, decarbonisation 
and waste management. These reflect the degree 
of risk that cities are exposed to and the extent 
to which they are readying themselves for future 
changes. 
Responding to extreme heat
Cities must prepare and be redesigned for 
a future of deadly heat. Between June and 
September this year, nearly half of the global 
population experienced at least 30 days of 
higher temperatures, made three times more 
likely by human-caused climate change.26 Very

Note: The Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), measured in °C, is a bioclimatic index describing physiological comfort for the human body under 
specific meteorological conditions. Heat stress is measured based on the UTCI magnitude, which represents the average daily maximum UTCI values during 
the hottest month of the year (July for cities in the northern hemisphere and January for cities in the southern hemisphere). UTCI values are divided into 5 
classes of heat stress: no thermal stress (9°C-26°C),  moderate heat stress (26°C-32°C), strong heat stress (32°C-38°C), very strong heat stress (38°C-46°C) 
and extreme heat stress (>46°C). The projection for the 2030 period corresponds to the average value between  the years 2021 and 2040.

few cities are safe from heat waves in a warming 
world. Much of the Mediterranean sweltered in 
temperatures exceeding 40°C, extending from 
Madrid to Cairo, where the government was 
forced to schedule power cuts as heatwaves 
strained the national grid. “This is a completely 
new experience to think about going forward 
because it’s going to happen a lot more,” says 
Professor Christine Loh, chief development 
strategist at the Institute for Environment at 
Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. 
Rising temperatures drive frequent and longer 
heat waves, heightened in cities due to the heat 
island effect, where man-made structures and 
materials absorb and re-emit solar radiation, 
making day-time temperatures several degrees 
higher.27 Hotter, more humid conditions can have 
dire health consequences, including heat stroke, 
heat exhaustion, dehydration and respiratory 
problems. Children, pregnant women, the elderly 
and outdoor workers are the most vulnerable to 
these effects.28
Cities appear to be responding to this risk. The 
majority of cities in the index (20) have a detailed 
heat plan or have aligned their planning with 
expected heat stress challenges. Cities that do 
not have heat plans are in emerging markets. 
Heat stress strategies range from adapting 
infrastructure to appointing personnel, such as 
chief heat officers. From Miami to Melbourne, 
Dhaka to Athens, a growing number of cities 
have chief heat officers29 who co-ordinate the 
emergency response to heatwaves (such as 
establishing cooling centres and distributing 
water) and plan adaptive measures.30 
Structural interventions to lower urban 
temperatures include maximising green space 
and building artificial shade. Cooling Singapore, 
a research project supported by local research 
institutions and the Prime Minister’s Office, has 
developed a roadmap to tackle urban heat by 
incorporating more vegetation, adding water 
features that act as cool sinks, and building 
permanent and movable shade structures.31 
Successful solutions should start by identifying 
who is most vulnerable to and at the highest 
risk of extreme heat. This is particularly the case 
in developing cities, which are often resource 
constrained and where a lack of cooling makes 
heat all the more deadly. “In the last couple 
of years, we are seeing more conversations, 
especially from cities in the developing world, 
in terms of which are the communities that are 
most impacted by risks,” says Ms Bruebach. 
Cooling Melbourne: Open data for citizen support 
According to Tiffany Crawford, co-director of the City of Melbourne’s Climate Change and City 
Resilience Branch, the annual average number of days where Melbourne experiences tempera-
tures higher than 35°C is expected to increase from 11 days to 16 days by 2050.  
Melbourne, one of three cities to attain maximum scores for its social protection measures, is 
focusing on the intersection between resilience, risk and social inequality with the use of open 
data. Its heatwave and homelessness programme provides vulnerable people with access to 
climate shelters and services that offer respite from extreme heat.32 
The programme uses publicly available data and relies on coordination between government 
agencies to ensure data sets are collected and analysed effectively. The benefits of robust map-
ping are clear. According to a recent survey, just 19% of Melbourne residents leave their home 
during periods of extreme heat, rising to 45% for those living in public housing.

Managing and mitigating
Globally, 1.81bn people—one in every four—live 
in high-risk flood zones.33 Exposure is severe in 
densely populated and quickly urbanising river 
plains and coastlines in developing countries, 
where 89% of the world’s flood-exposed people 
live.34 The damage wrought by flooding directly 
affects assets and lives. Flooding also poses 
longer-term public health risks. Stagnant bodies 
of water, for example, can provide breeding 
grounds for waterborne and vector-borne 
diseases.35 In the index, most lower-income 
cities performed poorly for riverine flood risk, 
especially Dhaka and Jakarta. 
“Today, infrastructure projects must incorporate 
nature-based solutions, such as green roofs 
and natural drainage systems that can enhance 
resilience and sustainability by improving 
water management, reducing flooding and 
providing additional ecosystem services,” says 
Mr Thiru. Blue interventions that capture and 
store rainwater, such as wetlands, rivers and 
canals, are also critical.36 Policies and initiatives 
across index cities include permeable and green 
roofing to improve water retention (Amsterdam 
and Barcelona), wetlands rehabilitation and 
sewer network upgrades (Cape Town) and the 
promotion and use of stormwater storage tanks 
(Hong Kong). 
Figure 8: High riverine and coastal flood risk threatens to erode middle-income cities
The majority of the most flood-vulnerable cities are lower- and upper-middle-income cities in Asia-Pacific, such as Bangkok,  
Dhaka and Jakarta.

average year; 4 is the highest risk level.

Breathe London: pulling in pollution
London has come a long way since the Great Smog shrouded the capital in 1952, killing thou-
sands.42 However, it is still badly polluted. Cancer, asthma and lung disease associated with high 
concentrations of nitrogen oxide and small particulates kill an estimated 4,000 Londoners every 
year, according to a study conducted by Imperial College in 2021.43 In response, the capital has 
employed different tactics to clean its air. 
Breathe London is an air quality community-sensing network that observes air quality in nearly 
350 locations across the city, with priority given to schools, hospitals, museums, cultural institu-
tions and locations chosen by communities. The network is expected to support cutting-edge 
research and raise public awareness.44 
Other efforts are more punitive, such as the pollution charge targeting older diesel vehicles, 
which tend to create more harmful concentrations of nitrogen dioxide than petrol-fuelled cars. 
The pollution charge helped to cut the concentration of nitrogen oxide in central London by over 
a quarter between 2019 and 2021.45
The cost of clean air
Poor air quality damages people’s health, causing 
issues like cardiovascular and respiratory disease, 
dementia and cancer. Nine in ten people in urban 
areas breathe polluted air.37 Dhaka and New Delhi 
prove to be the least resilient to air pollution in the 
index, which kills 7m people globally each year.38
Measuring air pollution has become easier thanks 
to low-cost sensors that track trends over time, 
enabling decision-makers to identify hotspots. 
These are now in use in cities as diverse as Addis 
Ababa, Denver, Paris, Portland and Quezon City.39 
Cities are increasingly partnering with technology 
firms, universities and research institutes to help 
monitor air pollution.40,41

Fair warning
Over the past 50 years (1970-2019), a weather-, 
climate- or water-related disaster has occurred 
every day, on average, taking the lives of 115 
people and causing US$202m in losses each 
day.46 Cities need to provide advance notice 
of impending disasters like storms, floods and 
earthquakes through early warning systems 
(EWS), giving residents sufficient time to act.
Early warning works. Providing 24 hours’ warning 
of a coming storm or heatwave can cut the 
ensuing damage by a third. Spending US$800m 
on such systems in developing countries 
could avoid losses of US$3bn to US$16bn a 
year, according to the Global Commission on 
Adaptation.47 Despite the clear need for EWS, 
one in three people globally are not covered 
by such a system, with the most vulnerable 
disproportionately affected. Furthermore, 
half of countries worldwide do not have an 
operational multi-hazard EWS, and even fewer 
have the necessary legislation to connect these 
systems to emergency and response plans.48 
However, the value of such systems lies not just 
in building them, but also in their maintenance; 
failed warnings led to large numbers of fatalities 
during western Europe’s floods in 2021.49 In 
2022, United Nations secretary-general António 
Guterres called for a global effort to ensure that 
EWS protect everyone on Earth by 2027.
EWS can take various forms, but social media, 
telephone hotlines, smartphone apps, radio, TV 
and text messages are the most obvious and 
Figure 10: Alarming absence of early warning systems
One in three people globally are not covered by an early warning system. More than 20m  
people live in index cities (representing a population the size of Sri Lanka) that are not covered
by any early warning system, heightening exposure to increasingly common disaster risks.

effective means. Connectivity and coverage 
vary wildly, however, particularly in rural areas 
in developing countries, where church bells, 
loudspeakers and sirens are used as backup 
methods of communication.50 Among cities in 
the index, only Amsterdam, Barcelona, Istanbul 
and Lagos do not have EWS with multi-hazard 
approaches. Common hazard-monitoring deficits 
in the index group include hazard-monitoring 
systems that are limited to a specific risk, rather 
than multiple hazards. 
One of the top performers, Tokyo, is leveraging 
the latest technology to improve its early warning 
capabilities. J-Alert, Japan’s EWS, relies on satellite 
technology to transmit critical information 
in seconds to all municipalities before and 
after a disaster.51,52 The country has also been 
experimenting with drones to provide early 
warning and disaster relief through enhanced 
monitoring.53,54 As an example, solar-powered 
smart sensors in rivers help to detect flood risk.55 
During the Kumamoto earthquake in 2016, local 
response teams were able to act immediately 
thanks to damage estimates, including population 
exposure, shared by a real-time earthquake 
estimation system.56 To understand future 
earthquake risk, the Japan Meteorological Agency 
also has an earthquake EWS that uses artificial 
intelligence (AI) to assess seismic data patterns. 
Hong Kong has also adopted best practices. Its 
EWS consists of signals that give a ranking based 
on a storm’s distance, using scientific criteria, 
says Professor Loh. “If you’re living in Hong Kong, 
everybody understands the system … we’re so 
acculturated to this long-standing system that is 
backed by science,” she adds. 
Decarbonisation pathways: from net-zero targets to real action 
The race to net zero is picking up momentum as countries aim to reach carbon neutrality by 
mid-century. However, real action is lacking. Most index cities (76%) have a net-zero target, but 
many lack detailed action plans that are critical to developing net-zero pathways. Furthermore, 
most continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels to meet electricity demands. Indeed, all but two 
cities in the index (São Paulo and Santiago) are in countries that generate less than half of their 
electricity from renewables. While significant drops in the price of producing renewables provide 
the opportunity to transition, weak governance, poorly targeted subsidies and high capital costs 
are hindering progress.57 
Cities are also exploring ways to remove carbon from the atmosphere in their net-zero plans. 
This can be done through nature-based solutions, such as afforestation and reforestation, 
or through technology-driven solutions. Sixteen cities in our index are considering carbon 
removal—a technology-driven solution. However, nature-based solutions are more scalable, 
given that carbon capture, utilisation and storage technologies are relatively nascent and will 
require significant research and development (R&D) and feasibility assessments before being 
implemented at scale.

Urban resilience is strongly influenced by 
social and institutional dynamics, including the 
inclusivity of, access to and trust in government 
information, as well as broader health and well-
being factors. The index’s socio-institutional pillar 
measures indicators including digital government 
platforms, crime and safety, income inequality 
and social protection. Together, these can affect 
the degree to which a society can withstand 
disaster and bounce back. 
Social cohesion under strain 
Inequality is a significant consideration when 
assessing a city’s resilience. The unequal 
distribution of income and resources undermines 
the well-being of marginalised groups and limits 
a city’s capacity to respond to and recover from 
a disaster. More vulnerable urban residents, 
particularly in developing countries, tend to 
be clustered in neighbourhoods with the least 
mobility, work and educational opportunities, 
the poorest access to health services and below 
average health outcomes.58 During the covid-19 
pandemic, structural inequalities accelerated 
the spread of the virus and, in some cases, 
overwhelmed health facilities due to a highly 
uneven distribution of risk. 
The elderly are particularly vulnerable to extreme 
weather events and heat waves, partly due to 
susceptibility, but also as a result of low incomes, 
social isolation, ill health, lower personal mobility 
and poor living conditions. Some of our index 
cities, such as Tokyo, Munich, Paris, Hong 
Kong, Amsterdam and Barcelona, have older 
populations, with more than 20% aged 65 and 
above. Their plight is a concern, given that the 
number of people over the age of 65 is expected 
to double to 1.6bn by 2050.59

“People with fewer resources, or who have

can’t move away from flood risk. If you rent, you 
can’t necessarily make changes to your home to 
make it safer. If you’re isolated, you are less likely to 
survive a heatwave. That is why the Greater London 
Authority targets local funding and other support 
towards people who need it the most – building a 
better, fairer and safer London for all.”
Under my umbrella: navigating the challenges of social safety nets
Social safety nets encompass a range of policies and initiatives that protect individuals, 
households and businesses from exposure to risks, shocks and disasters. These include 
unemployment benefits, food assistance programmes, pensions for old age, healthcare, housing 
aid and insurance. 
Protecting everyone, particularly the vulnerable, remains a daunting task for many cities, 
however. A big challenge in emerging cities is identifying those who need protection. This 
challenge is exacerbated in places with a substantial informal sector, due to a lack of income 
documentation.60 In some cities, governments have collaborated with non-governmental 
organisations and local community groups to fill these data gaps. 
Lack of awareness is another challenge. In developing countries such as India, limited awareness 
of social safety nets, such as health insurance, may result in low uptake, even when offered 
at subsidised rates by the government.61 Our index revealed that in emerging economies like 
Dhaka, Jakarta, New Delhi and Lagos, over 70% of the population lack coverage by even a single 
social protection benefit. 
Other optional safety nets, such as insurance, are a harder sell, particularly in low-income 
markets. The decade preceding 2020 was the costliest for natural, weather-related disasters, but 
the protection gap is widening with an underinvestment in climate-risk protection.62 Insurance 
can help to transfer and mitigate risk, but it also plays a role in risk awareness. The index 
suggests that cities are underusing this financial mechanism, which has been identified as a 
cornerstone of recovery.
Developing comprehensive social safety nets requires inter-departmental collaboration to 
ensure a co-ordinated approach to service delivery and adequate outreach, especially to 
vulnerable communities. Countries like Kazakhstan are taking steps to improve accessibility. 
During the pandemic, informal workers in the country were provided with online access to a 
one-time cash grant application, which received 5m applications.63
Cities that performed well on the inclusion 
indicator have specific schemes and city-level plans 
to support vulnerable groups, including the young, 
the elderly and refugees. This can strengthen the 
social fabric, networks and institutional architecture 
needed to ensure an effective response during and 
after emergencies.

Be prepared
Experts argue that resilience requires broad 
consensus and public buy-in to create a strong 
culture of preparedness—a crucial aspect of 
risk management. In the majority of cities, 
readiness is nurtured through educational 
awareness and media campaigns, with high 
performers including comprehensive and 
detailed information. “A big part of resilience 
readiness involves education and dealing with 
risk reduction, which starts from kindergarten,” 
explains Professor Rajib Shaw from Graduate 
School of Media and Governance, Keio 
University. “[It’s about] how you bring risk 
reduction into the mindset of people from a 
very early age in a way that is replicable in other 
parts of the world.”
A culture of preparedness is critical to 
Japan’s success in disaster resilience. “Japan’s 
strength to tackle a disaster is not only its 
technology but also its people. The culture of 
preparedness, rooted in Japanese society, is the 
reason behind Japan’s success in tackling many 
disasters,” says Mr Shaw. New Delhi is also 
proactive in preparing its residents. The Delhi 
Disaster Management Authority conducts 
awareness campaigns across media channels, 
runs mock drills, and provides measures for 
safe action before, during and after events 
such as fires, floods and earthquakes.64

Delhi demonstrates that progress is possible for these cities.

Community-powered: how inclusion strengthens resilience
Cities can only achieve “deep resilience”—a foundation of preparedness that applies to multiple 
risk scenarios—through an inclusive approach. “A resilience strategy is not something developed 
at a desk by a city official,” says Katrin Bruebach, global director of programmes and delivery at 
the Resilient Cities Network. “Cities need to bring a variety of stakeholders together around the 
table, including community representation and the poor and vulnerable. Depending on the kind 
of shock and stress, listening to the voices of the people most affected is important.”
If an early warning is issued in the Japanese city of Kobe for a disaster such as an earthquake or typhoon, 
schools become resilience hubs for residents living within 2 km. There are 191 elementary schools that 
function as evacuation centres, storage facilities for emergency goods (such as blankets and food) and 
sites for community drills and practices. The city formalised this approach with elementary schools 
through committees, grants from local government and engagement with emergency services.

Cities are engines for economic growth, and 
access to opportunity has been the dominant 
driver of growing urban migration over the 
last half century. But urban economies face a 
number of risks, such as overreliance on a small 
number of economic sectors, which can lead to 
precipitous declines and/or inequality, leaving 
cities unable to bounce back from disasters. 
The index assesses economic resilience across 
four indicators: economic robustness, exposure 
and risk, innovation and entrepreneurship, and 
human capital. 
No economy is an island
There has been no shortage of macroeconomic 
shocks in recent years, including an economic 
slowdown led by the pandemic, disruption to the 
spread of new technologies due to geopolitical 
tensions between the United States and China, 
and rising energy prices worsened by war in 
Ukraine. Economies everywhere have felt the 
brunt of these shocks, but some have recovered 
faster than others. Our index measures economic 
exposure through fluctuations in a city’s GDP.
A city’s ability to recover depends on the extent 
to which its economy is exposed to global 
markets and the stability of its local economy to 
redirect financing to rebuilding.65 Since the late 
19th century, globalisation has created intricate 
dependencies on external goods and services, 
with global trade reaching a record US$28.5trn 
in 2021.66 Without the diversification of supplier 
bases, these dependencies translate into greater 
exposure to macroeconomic shocks that can 
hinder access to necessities such as food and 
energy. For Singapore, which imports 90% of its 
food, diversification proved crucial in ensuring 
food security during the pandemic.67     
Innovating a pathway to long-term resilience
Turning cities’ climate and resilience goals into 
action will require significant innovation, which 
in turn requires stable business environments. 
Markers of a favourable business environment 
include streamlined bureaucratic processes, 
efficient regulations and clear property rights. 
The index found a generally conducive business 
environment across the group, with countries 
averaging a score of 66.3 (out of a score of 100). 
However, significant progress needs to be made 
in terms of climate innovation, with almost half 
of the emission reductions required by mid-
century dependent on innovations that are not 
yet in the market.68 The rise in cyber-threats also 
reveals a US$2trn opportunity for cybersecurity 
technologies and services. 
Cities with innovative ecosystems provide 
opportunities to close these gaps. In our index, 
New York, London and Los Angeles received 
the top scores for the indicator measuring 
innovative business ecosystems (which looks 
at patents filed and R&D expenditure). In 2022, 
climate start-ups in the United States raised 
US$20bn, and enthusiasm for the sector remains 
intact despite a tough market.69 New York has 
prioritised entrepreneurship and innovation in 
its latest sustainability plan. For instance, the city 
plans to connect industry with existing grants to 
explore low-carbon construction materials and 
methods.70 
Emerging economy cities like Shanghai and New 
Delhi outperformed the majority of high-income 
Western cities on this indicator. Shanghai has 
become a global innovation epicentre in domains 
such as AI, robotics, chips and medicine as part of 
a strategic push in China’s 13th Five Year Plan.71 
Chapter 4:  
Economic

Resilient Cities Index

New Delhi is also expected to be at the forefront 
of innovation, with AI and machine learning 
(ML) forecast to contribute up to US$1trn to the 
economy by 2035.72
In addition to supporting business innovation, 
governments need to adopt new technologies 
to achieve resilience. For example, cities can 
use advanced data analytics and ML to model 
and predict the impact of natural disasters or 
other disruptions. This helps with planning 
evacuation routes, resource allocation and 
emergency response strategies, according to 
Mr Thiru. Ultimately, however, these analytics 
need to serve a clear purpose. “Flooding is easy 
[to predict], you know where water goes when a 
river floods. But how do we define communities 
at higher risk like the elderly?” says Ms Bruebach. 
Resilient workforce, resilient economy
Human capital encompasses a population’s 
knowledge, skills and health. It is critical to 
economic productivity, integral to driving 
inclusive urban growth and a crucial resource 
for cities as they recover from shocks. A 
highly skilled and educated workforce fosters 
innovation and productivity, enabling better 
economic navigation. Human capital also 
fuels entrepreneurship, attracts investment 
and supports institutions in shaping effective 
policies. A healthy workforce adds an extra 
layer of resilience, ensuring productivity during 
economically challenging times.

The index measures human capital by looking 
at levels of advanced education among a 
city’s workforce. James Simmie, professor of 
innovation studies at Oxford Brookes University, 
says, “When we talk about human capital and 
its link to economic resilience, the key variable 
is the quality of this human capital and this 
can be measured in terms of the proportion 
of graduates in the workforce or the level of 
education of the workforce.”
The top performer on this indicator was 
Singapore, where close to 90% of the population 
possess an advanced education. The city-state 
has also prioritised reskilling and upskilling based 
on industry needs. Through close collaboration 
with businesses, the government has gained 
valuable insights into the skills and qualifications 
in demand, enabling the creation of a highly 
skilled talent pool and further enhancing its 
attractiveness to new companies.73

Resilient Cities Index

A resilient city is not only prepared for shocks 
but has the ability to bounce back and thrive. 
Recognising both existing and looming threats will 
help cities better understand their vulnerabilities 
and design targeted actions. However, building 
such cities requires stakeholders from government, 
businesses and communities, as well as individual 
city-dwellers, to engage in holistic resilience 
thinking at community and municipality levels. 
Cities that consistently topped the index across 
all four pillars have lessons for other cities to 
consider, but they also have vulnerabilities that 
can undermine urban resilience. The report 
provides examples of how cities of all income 
levels and sizes have leveraged a variety of 
methods and interventions to improve resilience. 
While resilience needs to be tackled in myriad 
ways, a number of critical strategies have been 
identified in the course of this research and are 
summarised below.
•	 Empower the community to be active 
participants. This is contingent on the 
democratisation of information. All city-
dwellers should have equal access to 
government information, including what 
to do in an emergency. Some cities, like 
Singapore, do this very well, using digital 
channels to disseminate information to 
everyone simultaneously. Fostering a culture 
of readiness and the ability to manage hazards 
will require investment to train and educate 
people at governing and grassroots levels 
to be stewards of their city. Recognising 
that information is key, municipalities could 
consider partnering with a digital platform to 
minimise misinformation and ensure the city 
moves in one direction, despite disruption. 
•	 Social cohesion efforts need greater 
advancement across the board.  Cities 
are nothing without the people who 
inhabit them. Greater attention to social 
cohesion will help to ensure cities are less 
fragmented, adaptive and better prepared 
for shocks. City governments should overlay 
resilience efforts with initiatives that aim to 
improve the lives of urban residents. This 
process should be driven by city leadership 
and engage civil society.  The majority of 
cities in the index have some way to go to 
strengthen social cohesion through integration 
programmes for society’s most vulnerable.
•	 Early warnings are vital for safe cities 
but investment is needed to hit the 
2027 target. National governments and 
municipality leaders will have to collaborate 
to ensure universal early warning systems 
coverage by 2027. There are two challenges 
that need to be met. First, capital is needed 
to bridge the investment gap for technologies 
with a greater push for the development 
and adoption of frontier and horizon tech–
from drones to AI. Second, governments 
need to facilitate the necessary legislation 
to connect these EWS to emergency and 
response plans to ensure there are protocols 
and resources in place to deal with climate 
extremes and hazards. Community acceptance 
and responsiveness to early warnings are 
essential in the effectiveness of EWS. This 
can be achieved through systematic training 
and education and awareness programmes.
Conclusion:  
Resilience in motion

•	 Incentivise preparedness. Building 
resilience is a long-term process and should 
focus on future risks rather than current 
disruptions. However, the near-termism that 
often influences investment can undermine 
the long-term thinking needed for building 
resilience. It can also stop businesses and 
homeowners from forging their own safety 
nets through insurance. Providing clear 
incentives for businesses and individuals 
to prepare for future risks can help to build 
the necessary defences. These could take 
the form of financial benefits to retrofit 
legacy infrastructure or rewards for meeting 
benchmarks on the use of renewable materials.
•	 Identify and track the progress of resilience 
interventions. This will allow cities to 
adapt and refine their resilience strategies 
over time. An iterative process ensures that 
interventions remain effective in the face of 
evolving challenges such as climate change 
and urbanisation. Cities can also identify 
the gaps and make data-driven decisions. 
Despite having spent years planning to 
deal with climate change, the index’s top 
ranking city, New York, scrambled to deal 
with wildfire smoke in June leaving more 
than eight million residents unprepared.74 
Tracking progress will also keep city officials 
accountable and help ensure that public 
funds are used efficiently and transparently, 
maintaining the trust among citizens. 
•	 Support innovation to map risks and 
drive solutions. Solving some of the most 
pressing issues, such as decarbonisation, will 
require innovation. Advances in technology 
have offered some remedies, but they are not 
scalable or affordable enough for all cities 
to adopt. This is pushing out climate targets 
despite the existence of city-level net-zero 
plans, as in Cape Town. Cities that provide 
an enabling environment where start-ups, 
businesses and research centres can develop 
cutting-edge solutions will be better able to 
tackle complex problems. Technology will 
also help to identify, predict and monitor 
risks, which is critical to building resilience.
Cities are places of movement, flow and energy; 
they are rarely static. They can also be sites 
of debilitating natural and human shocks and 
stresses, which can have an outsized impact on 
critical infrastructure, livelihoods and the social 
fabric. Cities need to become more resilient in 
order to absorb adverse shocks, whether they are 
natural, economic or social.
