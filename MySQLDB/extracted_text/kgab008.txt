The
UN
General
Assembly
in
September
2021
will
bring
countries together at a critical time for marshalling collective
action to tackle the global environmental crisis. They will meet
again at the biodiversity summit in Kunming, China, and the
climate conference (COP26) in Glasgow, UK. Ahead of these piv-
otal meetings, we—the editors of health journals worldwide—
call for urgent action to keep average global temperature
increases <1.5C, halt the destruction of nature and protect
health.
Health is already being harmed by global temperature
increases and the destruction of the natural world, a state of
affairs health professionals have been bringing attention to for
decades [1]. The science is unequivocal; a global increase of
1.5C above the pre-industrial average and the continued loss of
biodiversity risk catastrophic harm to health that will be impos-
sible to reverse [2, 3]. Despite the world’s necessary preoccupa-
tion with covid-19, we cannot wait for the pandemic to pass to
rapidly reduce emissions.
Reflecting the severity of the moment, this editorial appears
in health journals across the world. We are united in recogniz-
ing that only fundamental and equitable changes to societies
will reverse our current trajectory.

The risks to health of increases >1.5C are now well estab-
lished [2]. Indeed, no temperature rise is ‘safe’. In the past 20
years, heat related mortality among people aged >65 has in-
creased by >50% [4]. Higher temperatures have brought in-
creased dehydration and renal function loss, dermatological
malignancies, tropical infections, adverse mental health out-
comes, pregnancy complications, allergies, and cardiovascular
and pulmonary morbidity and mortality [5, 6]. Harms dispropor-
tionately affect the most vulnerable, including among children,
older populations, ethnic minorities, poorer communities and
those with underlying health problems [2, 4].
Global heating is also contributing to the decline in global
yield potential for major crops, falling by 1.8–5.6% since 1981;
this, together with the effects of extreme weather and soil de-
pletion, is hampering efforts to reduce undernutrition [4].
Thriving ecosystems are essential to human health, and the
widespread destruction of nature, including habitats and spe-
cies, is eroding water and food security and increasing the
chance of pandemics [3, 7, 8].
The consequences of the environmental crisis fall dispropor-
tionately on those countries and communities that have con-
tributed least to the problem and are least able to mitigate the
harms. Yet no country, no matter how wealthy, can shield itself
from these impacts. Allowing the consequences to fall dispro-
portionately on the most vulnerable will breed more conflict,
food insecurity, forced displacement and zoonotic disease—
with severe implications for all countries and communities. As
with the covid-19 pandemic, we are globally as strong as our
weakest member.
Rises >1.5C increase the chance of reaching tipping points
in natural systems that could lock the world into an acutely un-
stable state. This would critically impair our ability to mitigate
harms and to prevent catastrophic, runaway environmental
change [9, 10].
GLOBAL TARGETS ARE NOT ENOUGH
Encouragingly, many governments, financial institutions and
businesses are setting targets to reach net-zero emissions, in-
cluding targets for 2030. The cost of renewable energy is drop-
ping rapidly. Many countries are aiming to protect at least 30%
of the world’s land and oceans by 2030 [11].
These promises are not enough. Targets are easy to set and
hard to achieve. They are yet to be matched with credible short
and longer term plans to accelerate cleaner technologies and
transform societies. Emissions reduction plans do not ade-
quately incorporate health considerations [12]. Concern is grow-
ing that temperature rises >1.5C are beginning to be seen as
inevitable, or even acceptable, to powerful members of the
global community [13]. Relatedly, current strategies for reducing
emissions to net zero by the middle of the century implausibly
assume that the world will acquire great capabilities to remove
greenhouse gases from the atmosphere [14, 15].
This insufficient action means that temperature increases
are likely to be well in excess of 2C [16], a catastrophic outcome
for health and environmental stability. Critically, the destruc-
tion of nature does not have parity of esteem with the climate
element of the crisis, and every single global target to restore
biodiversity loss by 2020 was missed [17]. This is an overall envi-
ronmental crisis [18].
Health professionals are united with environmental scien-
tists, businesses and many others in rejecting that this outcome
is inevitable. More can and must be done now—in Glasgow and
Kunming—and in the immediate years that follow. We join
health professionals worldwide who have already supported
calls for rapid action [1, 19].
Equity must be at the centre of the global response.
Contributing a fair share to the global effort means that reduc-
tion commitments must account for the cumulative, historical
contribution each country has made to emissions, as well as its
current emissions and capacity to respond. Wealthier countries
will have to cut emissions more quickly, making reductions by
2030 beyond those currently proposed [20, 21] and reaching net-
zero emissions before 2050. Similar targets and emergency ac-
tion are needed for biodiversity loss and the wider destruction
of the natural world.
To achieve these targets, governments must make funda-
mental changes to how our societies and economies are orga-
nized and how we live. The current strategy of encouraging
markets to swap dirty for cleaner technologies is not enough.
Governments must intervene to support the redesign of trans-
port systems, cities, production and distribution of food, mar-
kets for financial investments, health systems and much more.
Global coordination is needed to ensure that the rush for
cleaner technologies does not come at the cost of more environ-
mental destruction and human exploitation.
Many governments met the threat of the covid-19 pandemic
with
unprecedented
funding.
The
environmental
crisis
demands a similar emergency response. Huge investment will
be needed, beyond what is being considered or delivered any-
where in the world. But such investments will produce huge
positive health and economic outcomes. These include high
quality jobs, reduced air pollution, increased physical activity,
and improved housing and diet. Better air quality alone would
realize health benefits that easily offset the global costs of emis-
sions reductions [22].
These measures will also improve the social and economic
determinants of health, the poor state of which may have made
populations more vulnerable to the covid-19 pandemic [23]. But
the changes cannot be achieved through a return to damaging
austerity policies or the continuation of the large inequalities of
wealth and power within and between countries.
COOPERATION HINGES ON WEALTHY
NATIONS DOING MORE
In particular, countries that have disproportionately created the
environmental crisis must do more to support low and middle
income countries to build cleaner, healthier, and more resilient
societies. High income countries must meet and go beyond their
outstanding commitment to provide $100 billion a year, making
up for any shortfall in 2020 and increasing contributions to and
beyond 2025. Funding must be equally split between mitigation
and adaptation, including improving the resilience of health
systems.
Financing should be through grants rather than loans, build-
ing local capabilities and truly empowering communities, and
should come alongside forgiving large debts, which constrain
the agency of so many low income countries. Additional fund-
ing must be marshalled to compensate for inevitable loss and
damage caused by the consequences of the environmental
crisis.
As health professionals, we must do all we can to aid the
transition to a sustainable, fairer, resilient and healthier world.
Alongside acting to reduce the harm from the environmental
crisis, we should proactively contribute to global prevention of
further damage and action on the root causes of the crisis. We

must hold global leaders to account and continue to educate
others about the health risks of the crisis. We must join in the
work to achieve environmentally sustainable health systems
before 2040, recognizing that this will mean changing clinical
practice. Health institutions have already divested >$42 billion
of assets from fossil fuels; others should join them [4].
The greatest threat to global public health is the continued
failure of world leaders to keep the global temperature rise
<1.5C and to restore nature. Urgent, society-wide changes
must be made and will lead to a fairer and healthier world. We,
as editors of health journals, call for governments and other
leaders to act, marking 2021 as the year that the world finally
changes course.
