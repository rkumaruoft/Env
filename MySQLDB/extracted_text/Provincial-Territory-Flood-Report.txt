the
IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND EXTREME WEATHER 
risk in Canada relate to changes in the intensity, 
duration and frequency of floods, wildfires, wind, ice 
storms and permafrost loss (IPCC 2019). Nationally, 
more than 90 percent of extreme events are handled 
locally or at the provincial/territorial level and do not 
require direct federal involvement.

Considering that flooding is currently Canada’s costliest 
natural disaster (IBC 2019c), this report provides a holistic 
picture of how provincial and territorial governments 
self-assessed their flood readiness efforts relative to the 
four pillars of emergency management: mitigation, 
preparedness, response and recovery.
The flood preparedness of Canada’s provinces was 
evaluated relative to 9 criteria presented in Table 1, and 
the territories were evaluated relative to 7 criteria (i.e., 
territories determined that Waterway Management and 
Sustainable Flood Management were not applicable to 
northern communities).
Each of the criteria was self-assessed by the jurisdictions 
using a five-point scale, ranging from ‘A’ for a high state 
of flood preparedness, ‘E’ for a low state of preparedness, 
and with the good, significant, and incipient states of 
preparedness denoted as ‘B’, ‘C’, and ‘D’, respectively 
(see Appendix A for detailed description of the scoring 
protocol). Scores were determined and recorded 
based on interviews with representatives of provincial 
and territorial governments (e.g., Deputy Ministers, 
Assistant DMs, Directors, Senior Advisors, etc.) who 
had appropriate expertise relative to the criterion under 
consideration. From 2018 – 2019, 139 interviews were 
conducted and recorded.

CRITERIA
DESCRIPTION
1a
Floodplain Mapping
Floodplain maps delineate areas expected to flood, which can provide a basis for land-use 
planning. The creation and regular update of floodplain maps is vital for reducing the 
impact of flooding.
1b
Hazard Mapping
Hazard maps, used by the territories, delineate areas predisposed to hazardous events, 
including permafrost degradation. Maps are used primarily for land-use planning in 
Northern Canada.
2a
Flood Risk 
Assessment
Flood risk assessments define the probability that floods occur in a given area and the 
consequences of flooding for people, properties, and infrastructure. 
2b
Hazard Risk 
Assessment
Hazard risk assessments define the probability that hazards occur in a given area as well as 
the consequences of such events for people, properties, and infrastructure.
3
Land Use Planning
Land use planning manages development activities to minimize the risk of flooding to life, 
property, and infrastructure.
4
Waterway 
Management
Waterway management regulates actions to ensure that waterway modifications such as 
widening, deepening, realigning or clearing rivers do not increase risk of flooding.
5
Sustainable Flood 
Management
Sustainable flood management focuses on the protection of the natural features of 
floodplains, which may include residential relocation.
6
New Development 
Projects
The assessment of new development projects, with multi-decade service lives, focuses on 
changing of climatic conditions and the sensitivity of these projects to such changes.
7
Critical Infrastructure 
(CI) Assessment
CI assessments focus on the vulnerability of existing critical systems to flooding and key 
measures and actions to enhance their flood resilience.
8
Public Health and 
Safety
Public Health and Safety assessments focus on flood risks affecting healthcare facilities, 
dams, flood protection infrastructure and abandoned contaminated sites.
9
Emergency 
Management
Emergency management assessments focus on flood risks affecting emergency response 
and recovery operations including contingency planning for businesses and infrastructure 
owners/operators.

Based on the above criteria, the Canadian Average 
Score on Flood Preparedness for 2019 was C, with 
the highest score being B-, and the lowest score being 
C- (see Figure 1). An assessment of flood preparedness 
utilizing virtually the same survey method (excluding 
the Northwest Territories and Nunavut) was conducted 
in 2016 – the Canadian Average Score on Flood 
Preparedness for 2016 was C- (see Figure 2).

As is evident based on a comparison of Figures 1 and 
2, flood preparedness for Canada has improved 
marginally over the period 2016 to 2019.
At the provincial level, average flood preparedness scores 
were calculated for the western and central provinces 
(British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, 
Ontario, Quebec), as distinct from the Atlantic provinces 
(New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, 
Newfoundland and Labrador) and territories (Yukon, 
Northwest Territories, Nunavut) (Figure 3 a-m). These 
three distinctions reflected direction primarily from the 
Atlantic Provinces that considered their flood risk factors 
to be unique due to their proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. 
The most noteworthy uniting factor for the territories 
is that climate changes, including the warming trend 
recorded over the past decades in Northern Canada, 
are already significant and manifest themselves through 
the reduction of sea ice, the degradation of permafrost, 
changing precipitation levels and the increasing frequency 
of ice-jam floods.

Although there was no material difference between 
the average flood preparedness scores obtained for the 
provinces and territories, scores did differ sharply within 
individual provinces and territories. The obtained high 
level of within group (two groups: the provinces and the 
territories) variation was partially caused by the perceived 
lack of flood risk by senior officials, combined with 
limitations (e.g., technical and financial) to act despite the 
recognition of risk.
The provinces of Alberta, New Brunswick, Newfoundland 
and Labrador, and Prince Edward Island each declared 
that they have incorporated the impacts of climate change 
into their floodplain mapping initiatives. Conversely, the 
provinces of British Columbia, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, 
Ontario, Quebec and Saskatchewan all stated that they 
are not directly responsible for the development of 
floodplain mapping, but rather they collaborate with local 
governments and/or agencies to incorporate the effects of 
climate change within floodplain maps. 
Climate change was reported to have a strong impact on 
hazards that affect Northern Canada. Accordingly, the 
territories exhibited strength in relation to incorporating 
the impacts of climate change pertaining to hazards, and 
most specifically those associated with waves and storm 
surges, the degradation of permafrost, sea-level changes 
and coastal erosion.
Despite the fact that the provinces and Yukon demonstrated 
strengths in floodplain mapping and flood risk assessments, 
many jurisdictions reported a lack of regulations 
that would prohibit new development within 
floodplain areas identified as “high risk”. Although 
Local Government Acts (or their equivalent) empower 
municipal governments to enact bylaws that designate 
floodplain areas, there are limited regulations that explicitly 
prohibit new development in such areas.
As suggested by many survey respondents, provinces 
and territories should consider exercising greater 
Climate Change and the Preparedness of Canadian Provinces and Territories to Limit Flood Risk
13
enforcement of their land use policies. Although 
most jurisdictions have some formalized best practices, 
their implementation is often unrealized. In this regard, 
respondents echoed conclusions made by the 
Parliamentary Budget Office of Canada (2016), 
highlighting inconsistency in the regulation and 
enforcement of relevant policies and regulations 
by provincial governments.
Provincial and territorial governments reported strength 
in emergency management relative to flood risk, and 
more specifically in maintaining the continuity of 
communications, the operation and maintenance of 
flood forecasting and alert/warning systems. As well, 
they exhibited aptitude in the regulation of waterway 
modifications and in risk assessment of healthcare 
facilities.
Relative to critical infrastructure, the survey results also 
indicated strength across the provinces and territories 
regarding highway and water infrastructure. Alternatively, 
as nearly all governments selected the ‘non-
applicable’ option in response to electrical and 
telecommunications infrastructure questions, 
this suggests a nationally pervasive gap in these 
two areas. Moreover, nearly all Canadian provinces 
and territories reported that they do not oversee 
dam safety reviews nor the update of dam failure 
inundation maps for non-provincially owned 
dams. This may pose a potential threat to the 
safety of Canadians as it may lead to outdated or 
inaccurate dam safety information.
A precautionary note emerged from the survey relative 
to flood risk affecting Critical Infrastructure (CI). 
CI systems rely on the functional continuity of other 
systems, a concept commonly referred to as infrastructure 
interdependency. For example, if communication 
infrastructure fails during a flood, this may affect 
emergency response capacity. Despite the importance of 
assessing infrastructure interdependencies, survey results 
indicated a prevalent limitation in this area nationwide. 
Accordingly, many survey respondents suggested that 
the provinces and territories might consider 
forming flood risk task forces to examine 
interdependencies across multiple aspects of 
infrastructure resiliency.
Another key aspect of emergency management 
is the need to have validated and regularly 
updated flood risk maps. These maps provide 
important information about the location and distribution 
of vulnerable populations and threats to critical 
infrastructure, including evacuation routes. Table 2 
below presents a summary of provincial responses 
which were collected to address the following question: 
“ Have the provincial flood risk 
maps for areas subject to current 
and future risks of  flooding been 
updated within the last 5 years?”

Table 3 presents a summary of territorial responses to the

In summary, flood preparedness for Canada in 2019 
(Average Score C), juxtaposed to 2016 (Average 
Score C-), indicates that provinces and territories 
are moving slowly to address flood risk (with the 
exception of substantially improved performance 
for Yukon, British Columbia and PEI).
The slight improvement in flood risk preparedness, 
over the 4-year period ending 2019, may explain the 
discrepancy between the projections made by Canada’s 
Parliamentary Budget Office regarding annual Disaster 
Financial Assistance Arrangement (DFAA) projected 
payments of $902 million, with $673 million attributable 
to flood relief, vs. Canada’s funded liability of $100 
million (PBOC 2016). A more aggressive provincial 
and territorial effort to limit future flood risk 
could close the gap between projected and funded 
DFAA expenditures.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
This chapter provides an introduction 
to the preparedness of Canadian 
provinces and territories to address 
the impacts of flooding and climate 
change risks.
Climate Change and the Preparedness of Canadian Provinces and Territories to Limit Flood Risk
18
1.1 
Background
Climate change effects include increases in the frequency 
and intensity of hazards such as floods, wildfires, 
droughts, extreme temperatures, extreme wind, melting 
permafrost, coastal erosion, and damage to seasonal 
ice roads. These hazards pose significant risks to 
communities, the health and well-being of individuals, 
the economy, and the natural environment (Public Safety 
Canada 2019). Nationally, flooding is the costliest natural 
peril (IBC 2019c), and as such it was the imperative 
for this report – to assess and profile the state of flood 
preparedness of Canada’s provinces and territories.
The escalating costs of extreme weather events are 
illustrated in Figure 4, which profiles insurable loss 
for Canadian catastrophic (CAT) events between 1983 
and 2019. There is a discernable upward trend in losses 
covering the period, with greater than 50% of growing 
costs attributable to flooding.
The upward trend in claims in Figure 4 is not solely 
a function of extreme weather (CMOS 2018). For 
example, compounding factors that can affect flood claims 
include loss of natural infrastructure, aging municipal 
infrastructure, and housing construction practices that did 
not incorporate flood-resilience considerations (Moudrak 
and Feltmate 2019).

Determining the state of flood preparedness of the 
provinces and territories – and by extension, identifying 
the means to correct deficiencies – bears financial 
relevance to the federal government of Canada. More 
specifically, in the event of a large-scale natural disaster, 
the federal government may provide financial assistance 
to provincial and territorial governments through Disaster 
Financial Assistance Arrangements (DFAA) administered 
by Public Safety Canada. Although the provincial and 
territorial governments design, develop and deliver 
disaster financial assistance, DFAA defines what costs will 
be eligible for cost sharing with the federal government 
(cost sharing varies depending on such factors as the 
population density of the affected region and total 
financial burden impact).
The Parliamentary Budget Office estimated that over the 
five-year period beginning in 2016, DFAA demands could 
reach $673 million per year due to flooding (PBOC 2016) 
– this figure reflects a marked jump over the previously 
budgeted $100 million per year. Implementation of 
means to limit flood risk could help to redress this funding 
gap. 
Substantially costly floods are appearing across the 
Canadian landscape in a pattern consistent with 
Parliamentary Budget Office projections. For example, 
during July of 2019, the Insurance Bureau of Canada 
released the Eastern Canada Spring Flooding Review, 
indicating that spring flooding across Ontario, Quebec 
and New Brunswick caused close to $208 million in 
insured damage that year alone, suggesting that the 
trend of increasing flood damage costs shows no sight of 
abatement (IBC 2019a).
Historically, the Canadian government has tried to limit 
residential and commercial flood risk through federally 
directed programs. For example, in recognition of the 
rising costs of flooding, the federal government initiated 
the Flood Damage Reduction Program (FDRP) in 1975, 
in an attempt to discourage future development in areas 
at high risk of flooding. According to the declared aim of 
the program, following the designation of a floodplain, 
both federal and provincial governments would 
agree to avoid building any future “flood vulnerable 
developments” in flood prone areas (ECCC 2013). 
Generally, this agreement was not enforced in any 
meaningful way and development continued to 
take place in hazardous areas throughout the span 
of the program. Multiple studies documented that 
weak enforcement of the FDRP meant that the 
program had no significant impact on occupancy 
rates within floodplain areas, no reduction in 
the cost of flood damages, and failed to halt 
development in flood prone areas (Christin 1997, 
Roy and Lacroix 1997, Morris-Oswald et al. 1998, 
Shrubsole et al. 1997). The program ended in 1997.
Just as insurable losses/costs associated with flooding are 
on the rise, uninsurable losses are likewise increasing. For 
instance, “for every single dollar paid out in insurance 
claims for homes and businesses, IBC estimates that 
Canadian governments pay out $3 to recover public 
infrastructure damaged by severe weather” (IBC 2019c).
By analyzing the state of flood preparedness of Canada’s 
provinces and territories, it is the intent of this report 
to provide an informed perspective that will 
contribute to the alleviation of current and future 
flood and climate-related risks in Canada. With 
this purpose in mind, the structure of this report is as 
follows:
•	 Chapter 2 defines the scope of the study;
•	 Chapter 3 presents an overview of the major findings 
and trends across provincial and territorial jurisdictions, 
broken down by region:
•	 3.1 presents an overview of the data collected from 
the representatives of the six western and central 
provinces – British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, 
Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec;
•	 3.2 presents an overview of the data collected from 
the representatives of the four Atlantic provinces – 
Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, Prince 
Edward Island and Nova Scotia; and
•	 3.3 presents an overview of the data collected from 
the representatives of the three territories – Yukon, 
Northwest Territories and Nunavut.
•	 Chapter 4 profiles emerging trends and conclusions; 
and
•	 Appendix A provides study questionnaires.

PURPOSE AND SCOPE
In Canada, provincial, territorial 
and municipal governments 
all share the responsibility for 
emergency management. Across 
the nation, more than 90 percent 
of emergencies are handled locally 
or at the provincial/territorial level 
and do not require direct federal 
involvement (PSC 2019).
Climate Change and the Preparedness of Canadian Provinces and Territories to Limit Flood Risk
22
In recognition of this distribution of responsibility, this 
study examined the preparedness of provincial 
and territorial governments to minimize the 
negative consequences of current and future 
floods. The field component of research ran from 
January – September 2019. Research consisted of 
interviews with representatives from provincial and 
territorial governments who were responsible for the 
management of flood and climate-related risks as well as 
with emergency management personnel.
The areas of focus of the study reflected the core themes 
of the United Nations Sendai Framework for Disaster 
Risk Reduction (DRR), to which Canada is a signatory. 
DRR is a systematic, whole-of-society approach to 
identifying, assessing, and analyzing the causal effects 
of disasters and reducing the resultant risks and impacts 
based on risk assessments. The framework highlights 
the need for an integrated, all-hazard, multi-sectoral 
approach to disaster risk management (PSC 2017) relative 
to four key pillars: 
1)	 Understanding disaster risk; 
2)	 Strengthening disaster risk governance to manage 
disaster risk; 
3)	 Investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience; and 
4)	 Enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response 
and to “Build Back Better” in recovery, rehabilitation, 
and reconstruction (Canada 2017).
The criteria utilized within this study were not exclusive 
to DRR, but also drew upon the Canadian Emergency 
Management Framework (PSC 2017), which outlines the 
roles and responsibilities of Canadian governments.
2.1 
Study Design and Methodology
Flood preparedness criteria utilized in the current study 
were informed, in part, based on a 2016 study of the 
flood preparedness of Canadian provinces and Yukon 
Territory (Feltmate and Moudrak 2016). To reflect the 
evolution toward proactive prevention and mitigation 
efforts in emergency management practices, and to 
incorporate efforts to adapt to climate change, some of 
the criteria and their components were redesigned for the 
present study.
The criteria designed to assess the flood-related 
commitments of provincial governments are presented 
in Table 4. Some criteria consisted of a single dimension 
(e.g., Floodplain Mapping), whereas other factors 
consisted of sub-components (e.g., Land Use Planning). 
“	This study examined the 
preparedness of provincial 
and territorial governments 
to minimize the negative 
consequences of current 
and future floods.”

25
Data/information regarding the criteria identified in 
Tables 4 and 5 was collected in a similar manner as in a 
prior flood preparedness study (Feltmate and Moudrak 
2016). Specifically, the data was primarily collected by 
means of telephone interviews with key government 
officials. Prior to the initiation of each phone interview, 
all study participants were informed that their personal 
judgements or opinions were not sought in regard to 
the adequacy of the flood preparedness efforts of their 
respective jurisdictions. Instead, the stated goal of the 
phone interviews was to collect information on the specific 
measures, practices, and policies that were in place within 
each jurisdiction. Moreover, all study participants 
confirmed the responses that they provided, 
wherein the data was recorded and analyzed only 
following written confirmation of its accuracy by 
the study participants. 
2.2 
Survey Questionnaires
Survey questions presented to provinces and territories 
were formulated relative to the criteria specified in Tables 
4 and 5. Moreover, to enable relative continuity and 
comparison of outcomes, between the current study and 
one conducted in 2016 (Feltmate and Moudrak 2016), the 
questions and response options were consistent in design.
Several pilot interviews were conducted with provincial 
and territorial officials to ensure interview questions were 
unambiguous.
Similar to the prior study conducted in 2016 (Feltmate 
and Moudrak 2016), the present survey was designed 
using questions that were primarily quantitative in 
nature. The provincial and territorial questionnaires 
each consisted of 28 questions. These questions were 
categorized relative to the flood preparedness criteria to 
which they corresponded. 
All 28 survey questions presented to the provinces and the 
territories are presented in Appendix A. A sample survey 
question is presented below (see Data Analysis, Section 2.4).
2.3
Sample Population
Participants in this study represented governmental 
departments with responsibilities to manage and respond 
to flooding and to coordinate response to other climate-
related risks.
For territorial governments, the initial list of departments 
included those actively involved in territory-wide climate 
risk management, including flood risk management for 
the Yukon and the Northwest Territories. Nunavut, as it 
was not found to be at a significant risk to flooding, was 
only assessed from the perspective of climate risk.
Researchers on this project established a data 
base of 806 provincial/territorial contacts, all of 
whom held responsibilities related to flood or 
climate change preparedness. Following the process 
of identification, the researchers sent invitations to those 
contacts who were designated by provincial and territorial 
documents as being responsible for climate change 
and flood risk adaptation efforts, including emergency 
management. 
Following conveyance of initial invitations, some 
government officials appointed representatives to collect 
information from within their departments. However, 
in many cases, it was also necessary for the researchers 
to send additional invitations at the Assistant/Associate 
Deputy Ministerial level. 
The total number of transmitted invitations was 305 
to the provinces and territories. Interviews were 
conducted with 139 jurisdictionally designated 
representatives (see Table 6 for breakdown of the 
number of interviewees per province and territory).

2.4
Data Analysis
To enable comparability between provincial/territorial 
flood preparedness survey data obtained in 2019 vs. 2016, 
identical methods were applied to data collection and 
analysis in both studies.
The survey utilized closed-form questions, each of which 
had five response options ranging from ‘optimal’ (‘A’) to 
the low (‘E’), with the good, significant, and incipient 
options in between, respectively. During interviews, 
respondents self-reported which option out of the five 
response options best captured the level of preparedness 
of their jurisdiction. For example, to gauge the level of 
involvement of provincial governments in the creation, 
maintenance, and update of floodplain maps, participants 
were asked to select the most appropriate option (or 
combination of options) in response to the following 
survey question:
What is the level of provincial engagement relating to the 
development and update of floodplain maps, including 
coastal and riverine maps? (select between the following 
options):
Climate Change and the Preparedness of Canadian Provinces and Territories to Limit Flood Risk
27
•	 A - The province is responsible for the development and 
regular (every 5 years) update of floodplain maps. This 
includes incorporating changes in floodplain hydrology 
and hydraulics as well as the impacts of climate change 
on identified flood hazards, including flood hazards 
associated with storm surges and sea-level rise.
•	 B - The province is responsible for developing 
floodplain mapping tools and guidelines, and delegates 
responsibility for the development and update of 
floodplain maps to local governments. The province 
subsequently validates the accuracy of these maps.
•	 C - The province sets standards, policies, and provides 
guidelines for the development of floodplain maps, 
and delegates responsibility for the development and 
update of floodplain maps to local governments or 
conservation/watershed authorities.
•	 D - The province delegates the responsibility for the 
development and update of floodplain maps to local 
governments or conservation/watershed authorities. 
While the province regularly updates provincial 
guidelines for floodplain mapping, it does not supervise 
the production of floodplain maps.
•	 E - The province updates floodplain maps on an ad-hoc 
basis (e.g. following large flood events), but not on a 
regular basis.
For data analysis, the selected response options were 
codified through the assignment of a numerical value 
for each respective option: A=5, B=4, C=3, D=2, and 
E=1. In some instances, respondents chose to utilize the 
non-applicable option instead of any of the above letter 
grades. In such cases, no numeric value was assigned 
to those responses. Data analyses were then performed 
by calculating means for each participating jurisdiction. 
Criteria means were calculated by summing the response 
options selected for each component divided by the 
number of component questions considered.
These means were subsequently recoded into letter 
scores by converting the numeric values to letter grades. 
However, no data transformation was performed and 
consequently the resultant values represent the 
judgement of each jurisdiction in reference to 
their respective levels of preparedness. Finally, 
average scores for geographical groupings of jurisdictions 
were calculated, including for all of Canada, by summing 
the individual preparedness values and dividing by the 
number of jurisdictions in each respective geographical 
category. 
To enable additional insight regarding the efforts of the 
provinces and territories to address flood and climate 
change preparedness, the study incorporated several 
open-ended questions, not predisposed to quantification, 
but that nonetheless could aid in the interpretation of 
overall preparedness – this information is presented in 
Chapter 3.

CHAPTER 3
PROVINCIAL AND 
TERRITORIAL FINDINGS
This chapter provides an 
overview of major findings 
pertaining to the state of 
preparedness of provinces and 
territories relative to flood and 
climate-related risk.
Climate Change and the Preparedness of Canadian Provinces and Territories to Limit Flood Risk
29
To effectively present the performance of provincial 
and territorial governments, the report made use of the 
following three designations of jurisdictions: 
Western and Central Canada, encompassing the 
provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, 
Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec;
Atlantic Canada, encompassing the provinces of 
Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, Prince 
Edward Island and Nova Scotia; and
Northern Canada, encompassing the territories of the 
Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut. 
The following uniting factors explain each combination 
of provinces and territories. 
Namely, the provinces of Western and Central Canada 
all have an important similarity in that most of 
their population lives and works within the southern 
portions of each respective province. In addition, all 
of these provinces demonstrate a trend of continual 
transformation of the natural environment into the 
built environment in their southern regions. This 
trend negatively impacts hydrological and ecological 
systems and thereby exacerbates their pre-existing flood 
vulnerability. 
Similarly, the provinces of Atlantic Canada share unique 
geographical specifics which makes all of them susceptible 
to two primary mechanisms of flooding – namely, coastal 
flooding and inland flooding.
Finally, the most noteworthy uniting factor for the 
territories is that climate changes, including the warming 
trend recorded over the past decades in Northern 
Canada, are already significant and manifest themselves 
through the reduction of sea ice, the degradation of 
permafrost, changing precipitation levels, and the 
increasing frequency of ice-jam floods.
Due to the use of this approach, the major findings of the 
study are presented in the following three subsections:
Subsection 3.1 profiles the findings for Western and 
Central Canada;
Subsection 3.2 profiles the findings for Atlantic Canada; 
and
Subsection 3.3 profiles the findings for Northern Canada.
3.1 
Western and Central Canada 
Flood Preparedness
Each province of Western and Central Canada has a large 
population (relative to the Maritimes or Territories) of over 
1 million people (Statistics Canada 2019). Moreover, most 
of their population lives and works within the respective 
southern portions of each province, whereas the northern 
areas of each province are generally underdeveloped, 
sparsely populated, remote and difficult to access.
This region is also highly susceptible to the impacts of 
flooding. Specifically, four of the worst floods in Canadian 
history have occurred in Manitoba, and the most financially 
costly flood took place in Alberta (Mortillaro 2014).
One of the contributing factors that leads to the 
intensified risks of flooding in this region is the steady 
trend of the transformation of the natural environment. 
This is taking place due to the rapid rate of intensifying 
urbanization, the expansion of the built environment, 
and the continued growth and spread of transportation 
infrastructure networks. This transformation also 
significantly increases the ecological, social and economic 
costs of extreme weather events. 
The forecasted impacts of climate change are similar for 
the southern parts of these provinces in that daily extreme 
precipitation (that is, changes in extreme precipitation 
amounts accumulated over a day or less) is projected 
to increase throughout the region. Thus, there is the 
resultant potential for a higher incidence of local flooding 
due to rainfall events, particularly within urban areas. “An 
increasing shift toward snowmelt-related floods occurring 
earlier in the year, including floods associated with spring 
snowmelt, ice jams, and rain-on-snow events, is also 
anticipated.” (Cohen et al. 2019)
Although floods take place frequently throughout the 
Western and Central Canada, there are regional differences 
in the causes that give rise to them taking place: 
•	 In British Columbia, the mountainous and varied 
terrain creates a unique flood regime. Heavy rainfall 
combined with light snow in coastal mountain areas can 
create peak flows greater than those during the spring 
freshet, and in mountainous regions heavy rainfall 
Climate Change and the Preparedness of Canadian Provinces and Territories to Limit Flood Risk
30
can cause torrents of debris. The Province also has 
more than 27,200 km of coastline, and experiences 
coastal flooding when storms arrive during King Tide 
events, with this projected to increase in frequency and 
intensity;
•	 In Alberta, snowmelt from plains and mountains, heavy 
rainfall and ice jams are the primary causes of flooding;
•	 In Saskatchewan, the low topographical relief and 
poorly developed surface drainage system means that 
the southern parts of this Province are particularly 
susceptible to flood events (Pattison-Williams et al. 
2018). The extensive coverage of the landscape by 
water from either snowmelt or extreme rainfall is one of 
the most serious causes of flooding in the Province;
•	 In Manitoba, the vast majority of incidents stem from 
spring flooding caused by exceptionally fast snowmelt or 
large amounts of precipitation coinciding with melting 
temperatures. Large inundations occur mainly within 
the Red River watershed because of its level topography 
and diminished slope; 
•	 In Ontario, floods result from snowmelt, spring rainfall 
storms, summer thunderstorms, tropical storms or 
hurricanes, or ice jams, depending on the region of the 
Province. The major cause of flooding throughout the 
Province, however, is spring snowmelt combined with 
short term high intensity precipitation events; and
•	 In Quebec, spring snowmelt accompanied by rainfall 
and ice jams are the major causes of flooding. The 
coastal communities of Quebec, many of which are 
extremely remote, are prone to submersion floods that 
are the result of a set of marine phenomena (tides, 
storms, winds and low atmospheric pressure conditions).
This section provides an overview of the responses 
provided by the government officials of British Columbia, 
Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec.
The following six diagrams (3.1.1 – 3.1.6) illustrate the 
flood preparedness of the individual provinces within 
Western and Central Canada, assessed against nine 
criteria, and benchmarked relative to the average score 
for all six provinces. The components of the criteria were 
aggregated into a single score per jurisdiction in order 
to demonstrate the overall preparedness level of each 
province. The presentation of provinces is geographic, 
from west to east.

Climate Change and the Preparedness of Canadian Provinces and Territories to Limit Flood Risk
31
Areas of strength regarding flood preparedness for British 
Columbia were in the areas of Flood Risk Assessment, 
New Development Projects, Critical Infrastructure and 
Emergency Management.
The province stated that while it does not undertake 
assessments on its own, and does not validate flood risk 
assessments, it provides guidelines and administers the 
funding for the development and update of flood risk 
assessments.
Regarding New Development Projects, the Province 
stated that its Flood Hazard Area Land Use Management 
Guidelines must be considered for all new developments 
on provincial Crown land. As well, the Province prohibits 
landfills to be located within its provincially designated 
floodplain areas and requires the proponents of new 
landfills to complete siting assessments prior to initiating 
development.
In reference to Critical Infrastructure, the province 
reported that it actively engages with electrical utilities 
to discuss the vulnerability of their systems. Electrical 
utilities are also required to have their own emergency 
plans in place. British Columbia has also conducted 
several vulnerability studies on its highway system and has 
developed and released a guideline document for highway 
designers. The province has also developed a tool for 
the analysis of risks to its water infrastructure and has 
regulations in place that require regional and municipal 
governments to have emergency plans prepared that 
assess the potential impacts on people and property. 
Moreover, the province has funded risk assessments, flood 
mapping, as well as various methods of mitigation for this 
sector. 
In terms of its emergency management initiatives, 
the province reported that it takes responsibility for 
ensuring that critical flood risk information is transmitted 
relative to all the streams and rivers that are monitored 
by its River Forecast Centre. The province also takes 
responsibility for the accurate and timely dissemination 
of early flood warnings to the public, including flash flood 
alerts.
Conversely, the province reported certain areas of 
weakness, specifically in terms of its land use planning 
policy as well as its initiatives in the field of public health 
and safety.
Notably, the Province reported that most of its floodplain 
mapping is at least 20 years old (as of 2019). The 
Province also reported that municipalities 
largely develop flood hazard area bylaws 
without provincial involvement, and may also 
independently grant exemptions to said bylaws. 
Therefore, the Province stated that flood hazard 
assessments in British Columbia are rather 
‘patchwork’ and that land use planning within 
British Columbia is “sporadic at best.”
The Province reported that there is no 
requirement that local governments designate 
floodplains within their jurisdiction. Therefore, 
local governments can develop flood hazard 
areas without provincial approval, can grant 
flood hazard area land development exceptions, 
and may independently establish the subdivision 
requirements for their flood prone areas.
Regarding public health and safety initiatives, British 
Columbia reported that the flooding of healthcare 
facilities is not a risk that is currently being addressed 
by the province. Similarly, British Columbia stated 
that its Dam Safety Section does not require dam 
owners to undertake flood risk assessments 
whatsoever. Moreover, and perhaps most 
concurringly, the Province stated that it is the 
“role of the downstream communities to ensure 
they plan for all hazards including potential 
dam incidents.” The extent to which the provincial 
government of British Columbia would get involved, if at 
all, in such cases was not explicitly specified.
Finally, regarding ice-related flooding, the Province 
indicated that it does not presently operate an ice-jam 
flood forecasting system.
“	Local governments can develop 
flood hazard areas without provincial 
approval, can grant flood hazard 
area land development exceptions, 
and may independently establish the 
subdivision requirements for their 
flood prone areas.”
Climate Change and the Preparedness of Canadian Provinces and Territories to Limit Flood Risk
32
It is notable that Alberta is the only province 
in both Western and Central Canada that takes 
responsibility for floodplain mapping and that is 
consequently the sole producer of flood hazard 
maps for its entire territory. The Province also 
stated that its flood mapping update schedule is 
on a 10-year update cycle.
Moreover, as Figure 3.1.2 demonstrates, the Province 
reported certain areas of strength in its flood 
preparedness, particularly in terms of Sustainable Flood 
Management, Critical Infrastructure Assessment, and 
Public Health and Safety. 
Under its Watershed Resiliency and Restoration Program, 
the Province created a $35M project that funded 
NGOs focusing on the restoration and resilience 
of wetlands and riparian areas in order to reduce 
the intensity, magnitude, duration and effects 
of floods and droughts. With that said, however, 
the province noted that its provincial policies are better 
defined as “best practices” rather than as mandates.
With regard to its water infrastructure, the Alberta 
Government has funded a variety of different initiatives, 
including Alberta Innovates, to identify the risks of 
floods and droughts to 50 of its drinking water systems 
and to construct new flood barriers, conduct drainage 
improvements, create new stormwater outfalls and 
establish urban constructed wetlands.
Regarding public health and safety, Alberta stated that it 
has developed a Dam Safety Framework that regulates 
all dams within the province. Alberta has also recently 
undertaken an initiative to update and confirm the level 
of safety of the abandoned contaminated sites throughout 
its territory.
Pertaining to flood vulnerability of healthcare facilities, 
the province reported that it takes an all-hazards 
approach to reviewing facility vulnerability and undergoes 
planning and mitigation actions to protect such facilities 
from hazards, with risk assessments conducted at the 
facility level.

Conversely, Alberta reported that it falls beneath the 
regional average with respect to certain domains of flood 
preparedness. Specifically, its performance was found 
to be below average in terms of Land Use Planning, 
Waterway Management and New Project Development 
policies.
The province indicated that its Floodway Development 
Regulation is currently under development but not 
completed (2019). In addition, oil and gas wells, 
transmission lines and pipelines are all exempt from the 
requirements of the planning provisions of the Province’s 
Municipal Government Act (MGA). The Province also 
stated that while it coordinates responses regarding 
the continuity of electrical supply, it does not take 
responsibility for the emergency supply of power. Instead, 
the independent agency AESO (Alberta Electric System 
Operator) assumes leadership on this topic. 
In terms of emergency response operations in general, 
Alberta reported that it steps in only when States of 
Emergency are formally declared.
Finally, regarding ice-related flooding, the province 
indicated that flood hazard studies are conducted only in 
those parts of Alberta that have a known history of ice-
related issues, and that such studies include ice modelling 
and mapping scenarios. These studies are conducted by 
the River Forecast Centre which maintains situational 
awareness of river ice conditions using forecasting and 
specialized data collection models. Alberta stated that the 
risk of ice-related flooding varies across its territory and 
reported that some of its communities are at a greater risk 
of ice-related flooding than other causes of flooding.

It is important to note that Saskatchewan is unique 
in that it has a dedicated Water Security Agency 
(WSA) responsible for flood-related issues, including 
flood forecasting and the dissemination of information 
to provincial and municipal emergency management 
officials. The existence of an agency that takes a 
central responsibility for flood forecasting on a 
province-wide basis is unique not only for this 
region of Canada but even nationwide. 
As Figure 3.1.3 demonstrates, Saskatchewan reported 
strength in its flood preparedness initiatives in Flood 
Risk Assessment, Land Use Planning and Emergency 
Management.
Flood Risk Assessment is a well-developed sector in 
Saskatchewan when compared to the rest of the region. 
Flood risk assessments are updated annually. 
The province leads the region in Land Use Planning for 
its unincorporated communities and municipal planning 
areas. Specifically, in parts of the province, such as in 
northern Saskatchewan, it takes direct responsibility 
for conducting environmental impact assessments. 
Saskatchewan is also unique in that it maintains 
a database of all historical flood events that have 
taken place near its road network. 
With respect to Emergency Management, Saskatchewan 
stated that it is responsible for provincial flood mapping 
and monitoring but described itself generally as “a 
super-planning cell with a bit of responsibility.” 
The province elaborated that it is focused on ensuring 
that local authorities have all the information that they 
need and assists them with planning, focusing on the use 
of established local resources. 
The province also operates a public alerting system 
called SaskAlert, an AlertReady product, which it uses 
to issue alerts and advisories for various emergencies. In 
addition to this, Saskatchewan makes use of a province-
wide alerting protocol called the Provincial Public Safety 
Telecommunications Network with all local EMS services, 
as well as the RCMP, utilizing this system throughout 
Saskatchewan. The Province also has flood monitors 
operated by the aforementioned WSA. 
Alternatively, the areas of weakness for Saskatchewan 
were reported to be in a few domains of flood 
preparedness, specifically, Floodplain Mapping, 
Sustainable Flood Management, New Development 
Projects, Critical Infrastructure Assessment and Public 
Health and Safety.
Regarding Floodplain Mapping, Saskatchewan stated 
that it had not updated its flood mapping since 
1996. Moreover, riverine flood maps or models spanning 
the entire riverine watershed have not yet been developed 
in Saskatchewan. However, the province presently 
(2019) has a pilot project that is being funded through 
the NDMP, focused on updating and creating floodplain 
maps for Saskatchewan. The province also reported that 
it lacks both legislation and policy in terms of protecting 
its natural floodplains. Moreover, the province entirely 
lacks a wetland policy which is a fact that provincial 
authorities had admitted has been criticized in prior 
literature. Saskatchewan also does not have a mitigation 
policy regarding agricultural drainage. Instead, the 
province merely delegates the implementation of certain 
limited policies, and has no significant enforcement 
mechanisms in relation to these subjects. 
A stark situation was reported regarding New 
Development Projects, with decisions being made at the 
municipal rather than the provincial level. Essentially, 
this means that although provincial regulations state that 
planning must consider flood risk, the extent to which 
this is practiced is up to the municipalities. Additionally, 
most pipelines within Saskatchewan are not reviewed 
with comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessments 
(EIAs), and the province reported that only a 
small subset of pipeline projects had ever been 
comprehensively reviewed relative to the impact 
of flooding. 
In terms of Critical Infrastructure, the province noted 
that its highway system had suffered significant damage 
in recent decades due to flooding, and therefore 
Saskatchewan has expended effort to mitigate ongoing 
risk in this area. In addition, Saskatchewan reported that 
it does not fund mitigation initiatives in terms of drinking 
water and wastewater infrastructure. The province 
also stated that individual community flood maps and 
hydraulic models have either been recently updated 
or are currently being developed or updated for some 
communities which have a history of ice-influenced flood 
damages. The province also reported that it lacks a river 
ice monitoring system and does not forecast river ice 
breakups. Generally, the province reported that ice-jam 
flooding is “fairly unlikely” to occur in comparison to 
other causes of flooding.

As Figure 3.1.4 demonstrates, Manitoba reported 
areas of strength with respect to its flood preparedness 
regarding New Development Projects and Public Health 
and Safety. Notably, Manitoba is the only province 
in the region that takes direct responsibility for 
the analysis of abandoned contaminated sites 
to determine whether such sites may be affected 
by flooding, although this is currently performed on a 
case-by-case basis. The province has changed its flood 
protection standard from 1-in-100-year to 1-in-200-year 
in order to account for the effects of climate change.
Flood hazards for New Development Projects are assessed 
directly by the province – if flood risk is identified 
during the technical review related to licensing or permit 
applications, the applicant is then required to provide 
additional information on flood risk mitigation for the 
project.
With regard to its Public Health and Safety initiatives, 
Manitoba reported that its regional health authorities 
conduct general hazard assessments, and that the 
provincial healthcare sector has comprehensive health 
emergency management programs in place. In terms of 
its Structural Flood Protection Infrastructure, Manitoba 
is directly responsible for addressing, maintaining and 
upgrading the flood related infrastructure that it owns. 
The province is also responsible for updating dam failure 
inundation maps. However, conservation/watershed 
authorities, utility operators and local governments take 
responsibility for some dam infrastructure not operated by 
the province. 
Manitoba was found to score lower that the regional 
average in certain domains of flood preparedness. 
Specifically, its performance was found to be below 
average in terms of its Land Use Planning efforts as well 
as Emergency Management policies. 
The province reported that up to two-thirds of its land 
area remains unincorporated, a comparably high figure, 
and therefore land use regulations do not cover all flood 
prone areas of the province.

With respect to Emergency Management initiatives, 
Manitoba reported that the provincial 
government was not aware of any efforts by their 
government to require back-up emergency power 
within provincial health facilities. Therefore, only 
some health facilities in Manitoba have back-up 
generators, indicating that planning in this area is 
primarily ad hoc.
On a similar note, the province reported that it does 
not directly engage in issues pertaining to the continuity 
of fuel supply. Therefore, local governments and 
organizations within the province are independently 
responsible for ensuring that they have all processes 
in place to ensure the adequate supply of fuel and 
distribution capability during emergencies. The province 
would only address continuity of fuel supply if a flood 
event reached a certain scope and scale, the exact specifics 
of which were not specified.
Manitoba also reported that the provincial 
telecommunications utility provider has its own 
emergency management program and takes the lead on 
the issue of communications continuity. However, local 
governments within Manitoba are also independently 
responsible for ensuring the operable continuity of their 
own individually owned and operated communications 
equipment to ensure their ability to communicate 
information to their citizens during floods and other 
emergency events.
Regarding ice-related flooding, Manitoba reported that 
ice jams had caused severe flooding along the Red River 
north of Winnipeg in 2009. The province is presently 
working on developing ice-jam flood mapping, and while 
it stated that it does monitor ice on an annual basis, it 
does not forecast the formation of river ice. The province 
also attempts to account for ice-induced flooding in flood 
risk mapping, and it stated that ice-jam flooding is a 
concern in some regions, with evacuations taking place as 
a response to that threat. However, the province declared 
that ice jams are not a primary hazard for Manitoba. 
Climate Change and the Preparedness of Canadian Provinces and Territories to Limit Flood Risk

The Province of Ontario is unique in all of 
Canada, in that it has established a network 
of Conservation Authorities (CAs) that play a 
central role in planning for and mitigating the 
consequences of flood events throughout their 
respective watersheds. Notably, not all municipalities 
of Ontario are covered by CAs, and this results in certain 
gaps in terms of preparedness for the significant parts of 
Ontario that lack local Conservation Authorities. 
As Figure 3.1.5 demonstrates, Ontario reported areas of 
strength in its flood preparedness in terms of Sustainable 
Flood Management, New Development Projects, Critical 
Infrastructure Assessment and Emergency Management.
Regarding Ontario policies pertaining to Sustainable 
Flood Management, the province stated that any 
development activities within 120 m of Provincially 
Significant Wetlands (PSWs) and 30m of non-PSWs are 
regulated by CAs to ensure that such activities do not 
negatively impact the hydrological function of those areas. 
These standards are well above regional and national 
averages.
For New Development Projects in Ontario, oil and gas 
pipeline projects are subject to regulatory reviews by the 
National Energy Board (NEB) and/or the Ontario Energy 
Board (OEB). Similarly, new hydrogeneration projects 
are subject to Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry 
(MNRF) approval, with such approvals requiring flood 
risk assessment. Additionally, the inundation mapping 
created through this process is publicly available.
In terms of Critical Infrastructure assessments, Ontario 
reported that an assessment was conducted in 2015 on the 
climate vulnerability of its electrical transmission sector. 
The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) has 
mandated action for all nuclear utilities to ensure that they 
mitigate against all external hazards, including flooding. 
Nuclear facilities are also required to have Emergency 
Mitigation Equipment and some have installed flood 
barriers.

With respect to the construction of new 
telecommunication infrastructure in Ontario, this 
is subject to development restrictions and some CA 
regulations. Similarly, the province reported that the 
development of new water infrastructure would likewise 
be subject to certain development restrictions.
Regarding Emergency Management, Ontario reported 
that its MNRF provides notifications to municipalities 
in areas where no CAs exist and is generally responsible 
for all areas that lack municipal oversight. However, 
municipalities and CAs rely on provincial flood 
forecasting and warning systems and the province 
provides some funding to CAs to support their forecasting 
and warning activities. Throughout Ontario, the Surface 
Water Monitoring Centre (SWMC) within MNRF 
monitors water flows and levels, and issues Provincial 
Flood Advisories. The MNRF also conducts flood risk 
assessments for First Nations communities within Ontario.
Ontario was found to be below the regional average in 
terms of some of its flood preparedness efforts, specifically 
in its Flood Risk Assessment efforts and in the Public 
Health and Safety sector. 
The primary reason why Ontario was found 
to be below average in Flood Risk Assessment 
pertained to the province not always making 
assessments publicly available, and frequently 
passing the responsibility for the development of 
assessments to local governments. 
In reference to Public Health and Safety, there is no 
provincial legislation or regulation applicable to assessing 
the flood vulnerability of healthcare facilities, thus 
these facilities largely self-regulate relative to this issue. 
Additionally, the province also reported that it was not 
certain whether its Ministry of Health and Long-Term 
Care had conducted a risk assessment on Ontario 
healthcare facilities within the past 5-7 years. Regarding 
Structural Flood Protection, Ontario reported that local 
governments (or individual citizens) are responsible for 
their protection and noted that it commonly lacks access 
to the risk assessments. Finally, the province reported that 
it has no proactive monitoring or inspection program 
for SFPs, and that there are no mandatory provincial 
requirements for SFPs.
In addition, the provincial Technical Guide, River 
and Stream Systems: Flooding Hazard Limit 
(2002) provides the provincial standard for defining flood 
hazards through mapping, and includes a section on ice 
jams and computational methods. The province also has 
an Ice Management Manual (1988) which outlines 
the guiding procedures for preventing and addressing 
ice jams. Although Ontario does not have a dedicated 
ice-jam flood forecasting system, it does use gauges and 
monitors and responds to flooding caused by ice jams. 
Ontario reported that while floods caused by ice jams 
may be relatively frequent in some areas, such floods 
are not as common or as widespread as other forms of 
flooding. The most common form of flooding in 
Ontario is urban, wherein stormwater exceeds 
infrastructure capacities and capabilities. For 
example, 2013 Toronto floods caused $1 to $1.4 billion in 
damages that constituted the greatest flood-related losses 
in Ontario’s history.
Ontario reported that it assists James Bay First Nations to 
address the impacts of flooding, as ice-related flooding is 
a major concern in this remote area, and has historically 
had severe impacts, including the complete destruction 
of the community of Winisk in 1986, which was once 
located on the Winisk River, close to Hudson Bay.
“	The most common form of flooding in 
Ontario is urban, wherein stormwater 
exceeds infrastructure capacities and 
capabilities.”

39
As Figure 3.1.6 demonstrates, Quebec reported areas of 
strength in its flood preparedness relative to Sustainable 
Flood Management, New Development Projects and 
Public Health and Safety. The Ministry of Municipal 
Affairs declined to participate in the study and therefore, 
the Land Use Planning score on Figure 3.1.6 applies only 
to developments on Crown Land. Questions pertaining to 
Municipal Planning Areas and the unincorporated parts 
of the province were not addressed. 
Regarding Sustainable Flood Management policies, 
the province reported that responsibility for this issue is 
shared between provincial and municipal governments, 
whereas provincial legislation applies universally for 
isolated wetlands. Quebec has recently developed a 
compensation system that will make it possible 
to finance a prospective wetland and waterway 
restoration program.
In reference to New Development Projects, project 
proponents are required to model the impacts 
of their projects on watersheds accounting for 
climate change with a horizon of 2050-2080. 
For flood zones identified prior to the initiation of a 
particular project, the proponents of the project must 
conduct hydrologic and hydraulic modelling analyses. 
Alternatively, if flood zones are not identified prior 
to the initiation of a project, project proponents are 
required to identify them. Relative to hydroelectric dams, 
such projects are subject to the provincial Dam Safety 
Regulations. At the same time, the dams owned by the 
Province are assessed by provincial authorities.
Quebec also reported that the risk of flooding to 
healthcare facilities is addressed by the Province, in 
conjunction with municipal authorities in terms of 
mapping, mitigation and evacuation, as applicable. 
Conversely, Quebec reported that it was beneath the 
regional average primarily with respect to Emergency 
Management. The province stated that municipalities 
in Quebec are independently responsible for the spring 
Figure 3.1.6. Flood Preparedness for the Province of Quebec. The benchmark score calculated as the average of 
the results of all Western and Central Canada provinces (viz. British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, 
Ontario, Quebec) is outlined by the dashed line. The yellow area depicts the preparedness score of Quebec.

flood preparation, although they are supported by 
provincial expertise in this process. The Province stated 
that municipalities are responsible for ensuring 
the continuity of fuel supply during emergencies – 
however, they can request assistance from regional bodies 
as well as directly from the Quebec government.
Regarding ice-related flooding, the province indicated that 
Regional County Municipalities must consider the risks of 
flooding caused by ice jams.
3.2
Atlantic Canada Flood 
Preparedness
The Atlantic provinces were among the first settled 
and consequently were the first developed provinces 
in Canada, including the significant historic land 
transformations that took place in New Brunswick and 
Nova Scotia. The unique geographical specifics of this 
region make it susceptible to two primary mechanisms of 
flooding – coastal and inland. 
Since approximately 2000 onwards, storm surges have 
resulted in property destruction in all four Atlantic 
provinces (Natural Resources Canada 2015). Sections of 
the Atlantic coast are amongst the areas in Canada that 
are most threatened by sea level rise. Additionally, the 
majority of Atlantic Canada is now subsiding with the 
exception of the northernmost parts of Labrador as well 
as its Lake Melville area. The coastal areas of southern 
Atlantic Canada are sinking, and localized sea-level rise is 
estimated to be significantly greater than projected global 
sea-level rise (Bush and Lemmen 2019). This continued 
trend of sea-level rise will amplify the impacts of storm 
surges and flooding throughout Atlantic Canada.
The changing climate is also affecting the duration and 
extent of sea ice coverage, with the resultant effects 
differing throughout Atlantic Canada. Reduced ice cover 
(or no ice cover at all) is resulting in enhanced coastal 
erosion in northern and eastern Prince Edward Island 
and southeastern New Brunswick, and the instability of its 
non-vegetated coastal sand dunes, amongst other effects 
(Natural Resources Canada 2015).
Although inland flooding is also a common occurrence 
throughout Atlantic Canada (ACASA 2011), there are 
idiosyncratic regional differences behind the causes:
•	 Newfoundland and Labrador - inland floods are 
primarily caused by rain combined with snowmelt and 
ice jamming;
•	 New Brunswick - inland flooding is primarily the result 
of rainfall, rain-on-snow events, ice jamming, or a 
combination of those factors;
•	 Prince Edward Island - inland flooding is primarily the 
result of heavy precipitation, often as a result of extra-
tropical storms (in other words, hurricane remnants); 
and
•	 Nova Scotia - inland flooding is caused by torrential 
rainfalls, sudden thaws and infrastructure failure.
Ice jams are another cause of flooding across Canada, 
including the Atlantic region – to illustrate, “data for the 
Saint John River basin… indicate[s] that over two thirds 
of total flood damage costs incurred by New Brunswick 
are due to ice-related events (Canada 2013).” Similarly, 
ice jams also lead to pervasive flooding in Labrador 
(Government of Newfoundland and Labrador).
The following four diagrams (3.2.1 – 3.2.4) illustrate 
the flood preparedness of the individual provinces 
within Atlantic Canada, assessed against nine criteria, 
and benchmarked relative to the average score for all 
four provinces. The components of the criteria were 
aggregated into a single score per jurisdiction in order 
to demonstrate the overall preparedness level of each 
province. The presentation of provinces is geographic, 
from west to east.
“Sections of the Atlantic 
coast are amongst the 
areas in Canada that are 
most threatened by sea 
level rise.”
Climate Change and the Preparedness of Canadian Provinces and Territories to Limit Flood Risk
41
As demonstrated in Figure 3.2.1, Newfoundland and 
Labrador reported strength in flood preparedness in the 
domains of Floodplain Mapping, Flood Risk Assessment, 
Sustainable Flood Management, New Development 
Projects and Public Health and Safety. Notably, since 
2009, the province has updated its flood risk 
mapping study standard to include climate 
change factors, inundation mapping, LiDAR and 
land-cover analyses using high-resolution satellite 
imagery. In 2018, the Newfoundland and Labrador 
commissioned a Climate Projections Study that 
identifies how the province’s climate is projected 
to change by mid and late century.
Current land titles within the province must maintain 
a minimum 15-meter buffer between the shoreline and 
the boundary of the issued title. This is a relatively small 
buffer relative to other Canadian jurisdictions that require 
at least a 30-meter buffer.
Moreover, the province stipulates that any 
developments within flood prone areas require 
hydraulic or environmental assessments, whereas 
dam break inundation mapping is required for 
new hydroelectric projects.
In addition, there are four Regional Health Authorities in 
Newfoundland and Labrador that have each completed 
site-specific flood planning for the facilities located within 
their respective areas. The Province conducts flood risk 
mapping for such facilities and shares the results of 
these studies with local governments and infrastructure 
owners. The province also incorporates a climate change 
component, calculated to the year 2050, in its flood risk 
mapping to assist with planning and mitigation initiatives.
Conversely, Newfoundland and Labrador reported 
that it was beneath the Atlantic regional average in 
certain aspects of flood preparedness. For example, the 
Figure 3.2.1. Flood Preparedness for the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The benchmark score 
calculated as the average of the results of all Atlantic provinces (viz. Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, 
Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia) is outlined by the dashed line. The blue area depicts the preparedness score of 
Newfoundland and Labrador.

province lacks a regulatory flood risk framework for 
unincorporated areas, and therefore developments in 
those areas are not subject to any regulatory restrictions. 
Additionally, the province reported that some 
regions are at a high risk of flooding, the threat 
of which is exacerbated by inadequate health 
emergency resources in these areas.
Newfoundland and Labrador also noted that it had 
suffered a province-wide power outage in January 2014 
due to inadequate power supply. A project, sanctioned 
at Muskrat Falls to help remedy this issue, has seen 
extreme cost and schedule overruns. In the interim, 
backup capacity is required for all provincial Critical 
Infrastructure facilities in order to prevent extensive and 
extended losses of power. However, the province reported 
issues with local owners and operators in the fuel supply 
sector who are often reluctant to provide auxiliary power 
to their fuel stations, as they are concerned that this might 
void their pump warranties. Therefore, the province 
has stated that it has experienced significant 
difficulties in mandating planning in relation to 
the continuity of fuel supply.
Finally, the Newfoundland and Labrador is conducting 
studies to incorporate the consideration of the risk of ice 
jamming relative to flood risk. The province stated that it 
operates river ice flood forecasting systems on the 
Badger and Churchill Rivers, and reported that 
these systems are “amongst the most advanced 
in the country.” Newfoundland and Labrador stated 
that ice-jam flooding is the most dramatic and extensively 
damaging type of flooding within the province although 
only 5% of its flood events are the result of ice jams.

As demonstrated in Figure 3.2.2, New Brunswick reported 
areas of strength in flood preparedness in the domains of 
Floodplain Mapping, Flood Risk Assessment, Waterway 
Management and Sustainable Flood Management. 
Notably, the province has two policies that protect 
provincial streams, rivers, wetlands, and lakes – The 
Watercourse and Wetland Alteration Regulation and the 
Clean Water Act. Moreover, all in-channel alterations 
within the province require permitting and all waterway 
modifications are prohibited province-wide unless 
a project serves a necessary public function.
Regarding Emergency Management, the province 
also exceeds the regional average. The province has a 
contingency plan that assigns preparedness and response 
tasks to all government departments and response 
agencies. During the annual flooding season 
in the Saint John River, there is a provincial 
program that is focused on river surveillance 
and flood forecasting. This program informs the 
public about potential flood risks and assists 
communities with planning. 
Alternatively, New Brunswick reported that it was 
beneath the regional average in some areas of flood 
preparedness. Specifically, land use plans are optional 
and entirely un-mandated within unincorporated areas. 
Therefore, residents living in unincorporated settlements 
are particularly vulnerable to the effects of flooding due 
to their tendency of residing in high-risk areas and in low-
quality shelters, due to the lack of regulation applicable 
to these areas. Moreover, there are no specific regulations 
regarding highways and basic Environmental Impact 
Assessments are not consistently conducted for all new 
developments within the Province. 
Regarding Critical Infrastructure, including electrical and 
telecommunication networks, the Province takes a reactive 
rather than a proactive approach wherein the provincial 
authorities are consulted only after such infrastructure is 
impacted, which can lead to inefficiencies in emergency 
operations. The Province described a hospital in Perth-
Andover had been identified as particularly vulnerable 
to flooding, and has sustained damage in multiple 
prior floods, forcing evacuations. In response, the 
Province is conducting a pilot project focused on 
assessing the vulnerability of the Horizon Health 
network located in the northern section of New 
Brunswick. All hospitals in New Brunswick have 
conducted ad-hoc all-hazard assessments and a 
formal health system hazard vulnerability risk 
assessment was conducted in 2018.
Finally, regarding ice-related flooding, the province 
plans to include areas susceptible to ice 
jamming on its flooding maps, including the 
aforementioned Perth-Andover region. The 
Province also operates a river ice-monitoring program but 
does not forecast river ice coverage. New Brunswick 
reported that ice-jam flooding is an extremely 
high priority and therefore it works with several 
agencies such as the Emergency Measures 
Organization (EMO) and the Department of 
Transportation and Infrastructure (DTI) on 
communicating ice jam risk and safety and 
security information to its citizens.
Climate Change and the Preparedness of Canadian Provinces and Territories to Limit Flood Risk

Prince Edward Island is geographically the smallest 
province in Canada – as such, infrastructure present in 
most, if not all, other provinces is absent. Specifically, 
there are no appreciable pipelines, dams or 
Structural Flood Protection facilities (SFPs) within 
Prince Edward Island. 
As demonstrated in Figure 3.2.3, Prince Edward Island 
reported areas of strength in terms of flood preparedness, 
especially in the areas of Floodplain Mapping, Flood 
Risk Assessment, New Development Projects and Critical 
Infrastructure Assessment. The province also noted 
that it is currently producing province-wide flood 
maps for the first time.
Uniquely for Prince Edward Island, the province has 
the authority to establish minimum development 
standards and binding land use regulations that 
apply throughout the entire province. 
The province also has legislative protections in 
place for its riparian zones and wetlands and 
provides incentives for their protection. However, 
the wetland buffer zone within the province is 15-meters 
(as compared to the neighboring New Brunswick standard 
of 30-metres). As well, the province lacks incentive 
programs for the restoration of natural floodplain areas 
and does not provide any incentives to move or 
relocate developments from floodplain zones.
The province has conducted vulnerability assessments 
of its water facilities, covering a total of six communities, 
and reported that it was able to successfully relocate some 
of its water infrastructure to mitigate risks, utilizing a 
combination of provincial and federal funding. 
All healthcare facilities within Prince Edward Island have 
completed full hazard risk assessments, although the 
province has not yet secured funding to mitigate the risks

to some of its healthcare facilities found to be located in 
flood-vulnerable areas.
The province reported that in recognition of its electrical 
and telecommunications systems being managed by 
privately-owned entities, flood risk mitigation actions in 
relation to their operation are isolated and are not known 
to the provincial government.
Relative to fuel supply, Prince Edward Island reported that 
it is not formally involved in ensuring the continuity of fuel 
supply, but does have an informal plan with Irving Oil.
The province reported reliance on federally operated tide 
gauges which measure water levels. Therefore, related 
alerts are issued from the federal government rather than 
from the province, which the province highlighted as an 
ongoing area of concern.

Nova Scotia is the only province in Atlantic 
Canada that delegates responsibility for 
floodplain mapping, among other responsibilities, 
to its local governments. The province is creating 
provincial guidelines for floodplain mapping, that factor 
in the effects of climate change, storm surge and sea level 
rise. Updated floodplain maps have been, or are being, 
developed for some areas that were originally covered 
under the Federal Damage Reduction Program (FDRP). 
Notably, dykes play a particularly significant role within 
Nova Scotia, and the Province stated that it has recently 
updated its dyke vulnerability assessments incorporating 
impacts of climate change.
As demonstrated in Figure 3.2.4, the province reported 
strength in terms of its flood preparedness in the domain 
of Public Health and Safety. 
Relative to Public Health and Safety, the 
province is undertaking assessments of several 
provincially owned dam structures and is working 
to develop a 10-year plan for effectively managing 
those structures, including the development of 
updated flood inundation mapping. The province 
is responsible for assessing the vulnerability of dykes – 
as such, an operation and maintenance program is in 
place. Dykes protect not only agricultural lands but also 
significant pieces of public infrastructure such as roads, 
railways, sewage treatment plants, utility corridors, 
historical sites and entire communities (e.g., Wolfville, 
Grand Pre, Windsor, parts of Truro and Colchester 
County, Annapolis Royal, Chignectou Isthmus, and the 
Village of Advocate).
All health facilities within the Province have been 
strategically located away from flood plains and 
tidal surge areas. Moreover, the Department of Health 
and Wellness has committed to a three-year climate 
assessment project for the continuing care sector to 
identify climate change risks and mitigating strategies for 
profit-based, non-profit, as well as governmental health 
facilities. 
The province mandates municipalities to create 
Municipal Climate Change Adaptation Plans in 
order to be eligible for Gas Tax funding from the 
Province. These plans include infrastructure assessments, 
the incorporation of flooding impacts within designs, and 
funding infrastructure upgrades.
Conversely, the province reported that it lacks incentive 
programs for the restoration of natural floodplain areas 
and does not provide any incentives for the relocation 
of developments from floodplain zones. In reference to 
risk of flooding to highway infrastructure, the province 
reported that they have only focused on areas of known 
vulnerability, rather than assessing the highways system as 
a whole.
The province is developing a program that will include 
monitoring of river ice patterns. Nova Scotia stated that 
ice jam flooding is an issue, but it considers the likelihood 
of such events to be lower than other types of flooding 
influenced by such forces as hurricanes, tropical storms 
and intense short-duration rainfall that typically occurs 
during the winter season.

Northern Canada Flood 
Preparedness
Northern Canada is comprised of three territories – the 
Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and the Yukon. The risk 
exposure of all three territories to the impacts of climate 
change is significant (CCA 2019). However, the climate 
change risks faced by Northern Canadian jurisdictions are 
not always directly related to flooding, as opposed to the 
rest of Canada. Another differentiator for the territories, 
as relative to the provinces, has to do with the unique 
challenges that are faced by emergency management 
personnel due to extreme weather conditions, the lack of 
established infrastructure, and the remoteness of many 
communities.
As natural resource development projects are becoming 
more prevalent in northern Canada, emergency planners 
must take in account evolving challenges pertaining to 
climate risk. Territorial governments must establish an 
open dialogue with businesses operating within the region, 
to ensure they understand and plan for potential risks 
exacerbated by a changing climate. 
Table 7 profiles some climate change and extreme 
weather-related effects projected to be most problematic 
across territories (CCA 2019).
Permafrost is an important physical component of 
Northern Canada, and has a profound effect on 
the hydrology, landscape and ecology of northern 
environments – as such, changing conditions of 
permafrost must factor into the planning and 
management of virtually all infrastructure in the 
northern regions of Canada.
The following three diagrams (3.3.1 – 3.3.3) illustrate 
the flood/climate change preparedness of each of the 
territories of northern Canada, assessed against seven 
criteria, and benchmarked relative to the average score for 
all three territories. These criteria were aggregated into a 
single score per jurisdiction in order to demonstrate the 
overall preparedness level of each territory. The territories 
are presented in geographical order, from west to east.

Yukon is more ‘province-like’ in all aspects of its climate 
change preparedness initiatives relative to other territories. 
For example, Yukon conducts Floodplain Mapping and 
Flood Risk Assessments instead of the Hazard Mapping 
and Hazard Risk Assessments that are common in 
Northwest Territories and Nunavut. The rationale for 
this difference resides in Yukon being at significant risk of 
flooding, whereas the other territories regard this threat as 
insignificant.
Notably, the Yukon demonstrates leadership regarding 
land use planning as under its Environmental and Socio-
economic Assessment Act, and project proponents must 
conduct risk and vulnerability assessments that address 
land-use changes. The results of these assessments are 
validated by the territorial government and/or the Yukon 
Environmental and Socio-economic Assessment Board.
As Figure 3.3.1 demonstrates, Yukon reported strong 
performance in flood preparedness relative to Floodplain 
Mapping, New Development Projects, Public Health and 
Safety and Emergency Management. 
Relative to Floodplain Mapping, the territory reported 
that it is planning to have flood maps in place, territory-
wide, with updates scheduled to take place more 
frequently than every five years. 
In reference to New Development Projects, the 
Yukon has comprehensive regulations that make 
the territory a leader in this respect not only 
relative to other territories, but also arguably in 
all of Canada. Stewardship relative to new projects 
is due to an environmental assessment process, which 
involves the Yukon Water Board and the general public. 
An environmental assessment emphasizes whether 
a project proponent has documented and simulated 
surface and road drainage, as well as groundwater 
challenges, amongst other issues. The territory itself takes 
responsibility for preventing development projects from

interfering with water balances and quantities for both the 
duration of a project and following its termination. 
All new projects that take place within the territory are 
required to include preliminary flood risk assessments. 
This applies to all highway, electrical, water, residential 
and federal development projects. The assessment 
process for projects includes a 3-level review 
lead by a local office, an executive committee or a 
panel, and for major projects, a full joint panel. 
Regarding Public Health and Safety initiatives, the 
territory reported that it has jurisdiction over highway 
connections territory-wide, and that flood risk mitigation 
applies to culverts and related infrastructure. The territory 
also reported that Yukon Energy has risk assessments 
on file regarding the possibility of dam failures and 
their consequences. Yukon reported that it became the 
first territory in Canada to take over land and resource 
management responsibilities from the federal government 
– as such, Yukon is responsible for some abandoned mines 
located within its territory. The territory reported that it 
addresses climate change related vulnerability of sites on 
an ad-hoc basis. 
Yukon also demonstrated strengths regarding Emergency 
Management efforts. The territory reported that 
it is responsible for all crown lands, municipalities, 
unincorporated lands and non-municipal areas. Yukon 
conducts forecasting activities territory-wide and does not 
devolve this responsibility to its municipalities, in contrast 
to most provinces and territories in Canada. Moreover, 
the territory coordinates emergency preparedness 
activities from a central office that has a designated role 
for all types of emergency management initiatives. There 
are also business continuity plans in place for various 
facilities including hospitals. Hospitals also cooperate with 
one another on coordinating emergency efforts. 
Yukon reported that it, in conjunction with the federal 
government, funded establishment of the Public Safety 
Broadband Network (PSBN), and that the Territory has 
an active AlertReady system in addition to 9-1-1 service. 
The latter fact is notable because basic 9-1-1 service is 
not universally available throughout the Canadian North, 
particularly in some of its remote communities. 
Yukon has a monitoring system in place for some of its 
key watersheds. All water level monitoring efforts, as well 
as the identification of at-risk areas, is the responsibility 
of its Water Resources Branch. However, the territory 
remarked that most of its watersheds that are prone 
to flooding are not associated with any significant 
consequences. Therefore, the primary flood-related 
issue for the territory relates to ice break-up, and even 
if uncharacteristically heavy rains did take place within 
the territory, Yukon reported that this would not have an 
impact on most of its communities. 
Alternatively, Yukon performs beneath the regional 
average in reference to some domains, primarily in 
relation to Critical Infrastructure assessments. 
Specifically, the territory stated that more work is required 
on mitigating the vulnerability of its power grid to 
flooding. Yukon reported that there is no mechanism for 
ensuring that risk assessments are performed and that 
mitigation efforts remain under development. In short, 
the vulnerability of the electrical system remains largely 
unassessed. Yukon also stated that while risk assessments 
should be under the direction of a central managing body, 
no such body yet exists. 
Additionally, Yukon reported that it does not have 
adequate funding to address the impacts of climate 
change on its road network. Similarly, the territory has 
also never assessed water infrastructure. Territorial 
municipalities are responsible for their own water 
infrastructure, and it is their responsibility to manage it. 
The territory stated that it has no standards for the review 
or assessment of such infrastructure. 
Finally, the territory indicated that ice-related 
flooding is likely the second most significant 
cause of flooding in Yukon, as well as throughout 
Canada (excluding Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, 
and Nunavut).
“	Yukon has comprehensive 
regulations that make the 
territory a leader in the 
assessment of New Development 
Projects, not only relative to 
other territories, but also 
arguably in all of Canada.”

As Figure 3.3.2 demonstrates, Northwest Territories 
reported strength in climate change preparedness in 
terms of Hazard Risk Assessment, Critical Infrastructure 
Assessment and Emergency Management.
Regarding Hazard Risk Assessments, the territory 
created the Northwest Territories Hazard 
Identification Risk Assessment (HIRA) in 2014, 
which outlined the overall risk exposure of the 
territory to natural and manmade hazards. 
This assessment also incorporated regional reviews for 
subareas of the territory. The Emergency Management 
Organization (EMO) of the territory has committed 
to updating the HIRA every five years. In addition, 
when communities within the territory create or update 
community emergency plans, local HIRAs are mandated 
and are included within resultant master plans.
Regarding Critical Infrastructure, the territory 
reported that it has initiatives in place for its electrical, 
telecommunications, highway and water infrastructure. 
For pipeline infrastructure, the territory stated that the 
federal National Energy Board (NEB) would remain the 
regulator for all oil and gas developments in Northwest 
Territories until at least 2040. 
In reference to electrical infrastructure, the territory stated 
that it is the responsibility of the Northwest Territories 
Power Corporation (NTPC) to establish plans that deal 
with potential emergencies and to address vulnerabilities 
of the electrical system. The NTPC is also responsible for 
the protection of critical community electrical systems. 
For telecommunications, Northwest Territories reported 
that it works with the regional provider, NorthwesTel, to 
ensure the protection of telecom critical infrastructure

of the results of all Northern Territories (viz. the Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut) is outlined by the dashed line.

and to mitigate the impacts of the loss of telecom services, 
which was noted as a common occurrence. 
Relative to highway infrastructure, Northwest 
Territories reported that every five years a highway risk 
assessment determines the vulnerability of highways 
to climate change. The territory has two management 
systems to monitor road systems: The Highway 
Surface Management System (HSMS) and the Bridge 
Management System (BMS). Highways are inspected 
annually, and as are 75% of all bridges and culverts. 
Regarding the management of water infrastructure, 
the territory reported that water treatment facilities and 
wastewater management infrastructure are mandated to 
be planned with flood risk considerations incorporated 
into their initial design. Moreover, all territorial 
communities are mandated to have emergency plans that 
address the protection of key infrastructure. Community 
governments also receive annual funding from the 
Territory, directed to the replacement, operation, and 
maintenance of capital infrastructure. 
For emergency response operations, the Northwest 
Territories reported that its territorial Emergency 
Management Office (EMO) collaborates with individual 
communities, and that they together “do their best 
to monitor river and flood conditions.” Additionally, 
the Territory works with communities to ensure that 
local emergency plans are updated and validated and 
to maximize the limited capacity of its emergency 
management systems. All communities must establish 
a local EMO, appoint local coordinators, and have 
emergency plans in place.
The Northwest Territories stated that Environment 
Canada provides severe weather and high-water alerts 
and warnings. Moreover, communities designated 
as at-risk to the threat of flooding have formed 
flood watch committees that report on conditions 
during ice break-up and high-water periods. The 
territorial EMO advises communities and stakeholders 
when issuing high-water reports. The territory also has 
water quantity monitoring sensors that can provide real-
time data on water flows and levels. This information is 
available to the public.
The territory’s performance was found to be below 
average in terms of Hazard Mapping, New Development 
Projects, and Public Health and Safety policies.
Hazard Mapping is in preliminary stages with a working 
group that will guide mapping design. The group 
includes representatives from the territorial government 
as well as from the Northwest Territories Association of 
Communities.
Regarding New Development Projects, the territory 
follows best practices in undergoing climate change 
risk planning rather than enforcing strict guidelines. 
Therefore, while some projects are subject to formal 
environmental assessments, other projects may only go 
through pre-screening. Moreover, the territory reported 
that flood hazard assessments are not mandated and 
are done “out of principle.” Notably, the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act (2012) does not apply 
within the Mackenzie Valley region. 
The territory also reported that there has not been a 
hazard risk assessment conducted on its healthcare sector 
within the last five years (relative to 2019).
Finally, the territory has no mitigation strategy in 
reference to assessing its Structural Flood Protection 
infrastructure. The territory noted that the federal 
National Disaster Mitigation Program (NDMP) offered 
a significant opportunity to obtain funding to develop a 
community mitigation plan – however, with the NDMP 
ending in 2019, and no suggestion of follow-up funding, 
the territory expressed concern that it may not have the 
opportunity to implement any flood protection measures 
recommended under NDMP.
“	The territory reported that 
water treatment facilities and 
wastewater management 
infrastructure are mandated 
to be planned with flood risk 
considerations incorporated 
into their initial design.”
Climate Change and the Preparedness of Canadian Provinces and Territories to Limit Flood Risk
52
As Figure 3.3.3 demonstrates, Nunavut reported strength 
in climate change preparedness regarding Hazard Risk 
Assessment and Land Use Planning.
The Territory stated that its Impact Review Board 
conducts on-going revisions to its Environmental Impact 
Statement. Nunavut also reported that its communities 
have plans and bylaws that dictate how land use is to 
be regulated within the Territory’s Municipal Planning 
Areas. However, Nunavut also remarked that the 
mere existence of such plans does not in itself enforce 
municipal adherence to these practices.
The Territory stated that it has generated various maps 
related to climate risk assessment, used to rank priority 
areas across Nunavut by risk. Nunavut also reported that 
it has completed seven permafrost (loss) maps, driven by 
the perception that permafrost degradation is the 
greatest climate change related threat affecting 
Nunavut. The territory also conducted a project on the 
mining sector, assessing how climate change may convey risk.
Nunavut generally conducts land use planning 
when designing/building subdivisions. Furthermore, 
the Impact Review Board engages on-going 
reviews of its Environmental Impact Statement 
requirements. Although these practices are laudable, 
Nunavut remarked that the mere existence of such 
practices does not necessarily translate into on the ground 
practice. 
Nunavut was below average in terms of its Hazard 
Mapping, New Development Projects, Critical 
Infrastructure Assessment, and Public Health and Safety 
initiatives. 
Regarding Hazard Mapping, Nunavut reported that it 
has completed permafrost mapping for just seven of its 25 
major communities.

average of the results of all Northern Territories (viz. the Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut) is outlined by the

With respect to New Development Projects, the territory 
stated that roads that lead out of communities typically 
serve to connect to mines, thus with roads being managed 
privately their condition is often unknown. 
In reference to Critical Infrastructure, the territory lacks 
a central electricity grid, thus each community within 
Nunavut receives its electricity from individual diesel 
power generation. With communities being largely 
“off grid” and isolated, a system failure due to extreme 
weather would be isolated. Conversely, by being off grid, 
the potential for back-up power benefitting communities 
would be limited.
The territory remarked that there are no roads that 
connect any of its communities, and that all communities 
are disconnected from the rest of Canada. In the event 
of extreme weather, road capacity to serve isolated 
communities would be limited. 
Regarding the assessment of healthcare facilities, 
Nunavut assists individual healthcare facilities 
with decision making related to various hazard 
scenarios. The territory stated that their approach 
to this issue is “very ad hoc.”
Nunavut reported that it has an ongoing 
non-profit program that performs sea-ice 
hazard mapping, monitors depths, and maps 
hazard areas, supported by federal funding in 
partnership with the territorial government.
“Nunavut also reported that it has completed seven permafrost (loss) 
maps, driven by the perception that permafrost degradation is the 
greatest climate change related threat affecting Nunavut.”

CHAPTER 4
EMERGING TRENDS AND 
CONCLUSIONS
The purpose of this study, and 
its 2016 complement, was to 
determine the state of flood 
and climate related efforts 
of Canada’s provincial and 
territorial governments.
Climate Change and the Preparedness of Canadian Provinces and Territories to Limit Flood Risk
55
Findings indicate that there has been no significant 
progress in flood preparedness of Canadian 
provinces and territories over the period 2016 vs. 
2019. The Canadian average score on flood preparedness 
migrated from C- in 2016, to C in 2019. There were 
material improvements in the flood preparedness scores 
of some Canadian jurisdictions, notably Yukon, British 
Columbia and Prince Edward Island. 
Areas of strength in the flood preparedness of the 
provinces and territories included Emergency Management 
(and more specifically Emergency Preparedness and 
Response), Waterway Management, Sustainable Flood 
Management, Public Health and Safety (particularly 
Healthcare Systems), Emergency Response Operations, 
Flood Forecasting and Emergency Warning Systems.
Areas of weakness in flood preparedness included Land 
Use Planning, New Development Projects and Critical 
Infrastructure Assessments (particularly Structural Flood 
Protection Infrastructure, Dam Safety and Abandoned 
Contaminated Sites).
Regarding floodplain mapping, Alberta, New Brunswick, 
Newfoundland and Labrador, and Prince Edward Island 
reported that they anticipate and incorporate the impacts 
of climate change into flood hazard assessment. Despite 
differences in flood management regulatory regimes, 
British Columbia, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Ontario, 
Quebec and Saskatchewan stated that they were not 
directly responsible for the development of floodplain 
mapping within their provinces. However, they all stated 
that they collaborate with local governments and/or other 
parties in their efforts to incorporate the effects of climate 
change within their floodplain mapping.
Although the three territories differed in terms of the extent of 
their current hazard mapping projects, they all made significant 
efforts towards incorporating the impacts of climate change 
on identified hazards, including those associated with waves 
and storm surges, sea-level changes, coastal erosion, and 
significantly, the degradation of permafrost.
In reference to new developments, most Canadian 
jurisdictions lack regulations that would restrict 
residential, commercial, industrial and infrastructure 
development within designated floodplains. Due to this 
ongoing allowance, the upgrade and development of 
accurate floodplain maps does not consistently led to 
real reductions in flood damages. To limit ongoing flood 
damage, Canadian provinces and territories need to make 
significant improvements in the following aspects of flood 
and climate change preparedness: 
•	 Land Use Planning;
•	 Critical Infrastructure (CI) Assessment; and
•	 Public Health and Safety.
Climate Change and the Preparedness of Canadian Provinces and Territories to Limit Flood Risk
56
Land Use Planning
The Canadian Emergency Management Framework 
(PSC 2017) outlines the importance of non-structural 
measures, such as land use planning, in preventing and 
reducing disaster risk. Despite this, for all components 
of land use planning applicable to flood risk – i.e., 
for unincorporated communities, municipal planning 
areas, and for Crown Lands – provincial and territorial 
governments scored poorly. As reported by multiple 
jurisdictions, provincial and territorial governments 
commonly do not require municipalities to designate 
floodplains within their respective areas. Additionally, 
provinces and territories often do not conduct studies to 
identify flood hazard areas within their unincorporated 
areas or communities. 
However, the most significant limitation in relation to land 
use planning is that Canadian provinces and territories 
lack the legislative power to enforce their own established 
land use standards within their municipal areas. This fact 
is one of the most crucial causative factors as to why flood 
damages continue to be endemic throughout Canada. 
Like many resource-based countries, Canada faces 
challenges in relation to natural resource development 
projects that may affect local hydrology, natural land-
cover change, water contamination, extensive water 
consumption, and various forms of pollution. Resource 
development activities often have a large topographic 
footprint and that can often influence local drainage 
systems. Activities may require the diversion of rivers and 
creeks, and at times increase the risk of localized flooding 
due to the loss of natural floodplain storage. Despite these 
types of influence, the study found that only Quebec, 
Newfoundland and Labrador, and Yukon require and 
practice risk-based land use evaluations that incorporate 
the impacts of climate change for natural resource 
projects.
Regarding resource development, under its 
Environmental and Socio-economic Assessment Act, 
Yukon project proponents must conduct risk and 
vulnerability assessments pertaining to land-use change. 
The territory and/or Yukon Environmental and Socio-
economic Assessment validate these findings.
It is also notable that many survey respondents indicated 
the need to integrate hazard risk management into 
existing land-use management instruments, to ensure 
the safe development of land, not only during natural 
resource projects, but also for any new developments. 
Critical Infrastructure (CI) 
Assessment
The loss of Critical Infrastructure (CI) components such 
as those within transportation networks and within energy, 
telecommunication, water supply, and wastewater systems 
can have significant negative impacts on emergency 
response and recovery efforts. Provinces and territories 
reported limited effort in the area of flood risk and CI 
assessment – this may explain cases with 70% of Disaster 
Financial Assistance (DFAA) directed to restoration of 
critical infrastructure.
Additionally, most Canadian jurisdictions specified that CI 
assessment does not fall within their area of responsibility, 
and they therefore opted to select the non-applicable 
response option relative to CI. Furthermore, nearly all 
Canadian provinces and territories reported a 
near complete failure to address infrastructure 
interdependencies. Study respondents indicated 
that they typically address infrastructure 
interdependencies following disasters (e.g., such as 
following Northeast North American blackout of 2003).
Most respondents also volunteered that they were 
uncertain regarding whether climate change impacts had 
entered into planning and permitting decisions. Some 
respondents also indicated that they are highly concerned 
that power outages frequently lead to disruptions in the 
continuity of telecommunication services which are 
critically important for emergency response and recovery 
operations.

Public Health and Safety
Regarding flood preparedness, almost all provinces 
addressed the vulnerability assessment of healthcare 
facilities, whereas for the three territories this was an area 
of comparatively weak performance.
Climate Change and the Preparedness of Canadian Provinces and Territories to Limit Flood Risk
57
Under the flood dimension of public health and safety 
that addressed assessment of abandoned contaminated 
sites and dams, provinces and territories both documented 
weak performance. There are tens of thousands 
contaminated sites across Canada, for which the impacts 
of flooding are analyzed on an ad hoc basis. On a 
positive note, some respondents indicated that they are 
considering incorporating the impacts of climate change 
on abandoned contaminated sites, including mine tailings. 
In reference to safety of people living upstream and 
downstream from dams, and the potential threat of 
climate change induced flood risk, dam owners are not 
required to undertake flood risk assessments in most 
provinces and territories. Most provinces have transferred 
the responsibility for the assessment of dams to municipal 
governments, who in turn, frequently make only limited 
efforts with respect to this domain of preparedness. Dam 
safety is further complicated by a diverse ownership 
structure in Canada – some dams are owned directly by 
the provinces and territories, others by municipalities, 
and the remainder by a third parties including private 
companies, electrical utilities and even individual citizens.

Conclusions
Survey respondents, from provinces and territories, 
referenced the need for Canada to provide – in timely 
fashion – user-friendly and publicly accessible up-to-
date flood risk maps. Amongst an array of benefits, 
flood (or hazard) risk maps provide crucial information 
regarding the location and distribution of vulnerable 
populations, threats to Critical Infrastructure, and safe 
evacuation routes during times of flood inundation. For 
communities with increasing population densities subject 
to pressure to continue developing in high-risk flood areas, 
flood risk maps can promote public awareness, thereby 
enabling people to make informed decisions on safe places 
to live and to ensure assignment of appropriate flood 
preparedness measures.
The main types of flooding to which Canadian 
jurisdictions are exposed are fluvial, pluvial, coastal, ice 
jam, and groundwater flooding, as well as flooding due to 
the failure of artificial water retention infrastructure. This 
study presented a question related to the development 
and regular update of flood risk (or in Northern 
Canada, hazard) maps, with the following finding – of 
the primary types of flooding, only fluvial mapping had 
been developed by all provinces for some land areas. 
With respect to the other aforementioned types of 
flooding, mapping efforts remain either underdeveloped, 
incomplete or nonexistent. 
Study respondents also reported the need for significant 
improvements regarding the communication and 
dissemination of critical information before, during and 
following flood events. This direction included pre-flood 
actions by homeowners to limit flood risk, during-flood 
safety and flood mitigation efforts at the community 
level, and post-flood protocols to restore community and 
business normalcy. In remote and/or unincorporated 
communities and in northern Canada, respondents 
emphasized that the timely dissemination of emergency 
information often proved especially difficult during flood 
events.
A pervasive theme conveyed by nearly all 
(139) survey respondents was complacency by 
provinces and territories relative to the timely 
mobilization of flood risk mitigation policies and 
procedures. This study supported this perception – 
namely, from 2016 to 2019, the overall flood preparedness 
score for Canada moved from C- to C, respectively.
Recognizing that climate change is irreversible (ECCC 
2019), and that the financial and social costs of flooding 
are increasing for Canada, fiduciary duty mandates 
the near-term resolve of provinces and territories to 
mitigate flood risk. If Canada continues on its current 
path of business as usual, the 2024 flood preparedness 
score will be C+, which survey respondents identified 
as “too little too late”. Provinces and territories 
must fast-track flood risk mitigation to avoid 
predictable and costly disasters before they strike. 
Additionally, many respondents suggested that the 
Federal Government of Canada should support 
the provinces and territories to create and 
disseminate combined fluvial/pluvial flood risk 
maps, and to make them publicly available on or 
before year-end 2021.

A.1 Floodplain Mapping
There is a growing awareness that the incorporation 
of climate change projections into floodplain maps is 
crucially important. However, just incorporating climate 
change considerations into existing flood mapping is 
not sufficient, as this does not eliminate the need for the 
regular update of mapping. Such updates are necessary 
due to land-use alterations and river channel changes, 
amongst many other dynamic factors. (e.g., new tools, 
better data).
In sum, the creation and the regular update of flood 
mapping products and encouraging their active utilization 
in land use planning and emergency response efforts is 
vital to managing flood risk. It is equally important that 
such flood mapping products are made readily available 
to the public to allow the public-at-large to recognize and 
understand their exposure to the risk of flooding.
To address this criterion, participants from provincial 
governments were asked to select the most appropriate 
option (or combination of options) in response to the 
following question:
APPENDIX A
This appendix provides a description of criteria 
used to assess the flood-related commitments of 
provincial and territorial governments, along with 
provincial and territorial questionnaires.
1	
What is the level of provincial engagement relating to the development and update of floodplain 
maps, including coastal and riverine maps?
ANSWER 
KEY
A
The province is responsible for the development and regular (every 5 years) update of floodplain maps. 
This includes incorporating changes in floodplain hydrology and hydraulics as well as the impacts of climate 
change on identified flood hazards, including flood hazards associated with storm surges and sea-level rise.
B
The province is responsible for developing floodplain mapping tools and guidelines, and delegates 
responsibility for the development and update of floodplain maps to local governments. The province 
subsequently validates the accuracy of these maps.
C
The province sets standards, policies, and provides guidelines for the development of floodplain maps, 
and delegates responsibility for the development and update of floodplain maps to local governments or 
conservation/watershed authorities.
D
The province delegates the responsibility for the development and update of floodplain maps to local 
governments or conservation/watershed authorities. While the province regularly updates provincial 
guidelines for floodplain mapping, it does not supervise the production of floodplain maps.
E
The province updates floodplain maps on an ad-hoc basis (e.g. following large flood events), but not on a regular basis.

1*	 What is the level of territorial engagement relating to the development and update of climate 
change-related hazard mapping, including permafrost hazard mapping?
ANSWER 
KEY
A
The territory is responsible for the development and regular (every 5-7 years) update of hazard maps. This 
includes incorporating impacts of climate change on identified hazards, including hazards associated with 
waves and storm surges, permafrost degradation, sea-level change, and coastal erosion.
B
The territory develops hazard mapping tools and guidelines in collaboration with the federal government, 
delegating responsibility for the development and update of hazard maps to local communities. The 
territory subsequently validates the accuracy of these maps.
C
The territory sets standards, policies, and provides guidelines for the development of hazard maps, and 
delegates responsibility for the development and update of hazard maps to local communities.
D
The territory delegates the responsibility for the development and update of hazard maps to local 
communities. While the territory regularly updates territorial guidelines for hazard mapping, it does not 
supervise the production of hazard maps.
E
The territory updates hazard maps on an ad-hoc basis, but not on a regular basis.
In order to reflect the unique climate-related aspects of 
the Canadian North, the territories were asked a slightly 
modified version of Question 1, indicated as Question 1*, 
which focused primarily on permafrost-related hazards, 
and also on waves, storm surges, sea-level changes, and 
coastal erosion. 
Therefore, participants from the territories were asked 
to select the most appropriate option (or combination of 
options) in response to the following question:

A.2 Flood Risk Assessment 
Flood risk assessments, incorporating the impacts 
of climate and land use changes on people, assets, 
infrastructure, and the environment are an invaluable 
instrument for decision makers, policy makers, and 
planners. They can be used to understand and mitigate 
present and future damages, to create risk management 
strategies that are both cost effective and community 
supported, and to help plan for long-term financial 
investments in risk mitigation.
To address this criterion, participants from provincial 
governments were asked to select the most appropriate 
option (or combination of options) in response to the 
following question:

To reflect the unique climate-related aspects of the 
Canadian North, the territories were asked a slightly 
modified version of Question 2, indicated below as 
Question 2*, which was focused on climate-related 
hazards, such as floods, snow loads, ice hazards, extreme 
weather events, and the degradation of permafrost.
Therefore, participants from the territories were asked 
to select the most appropriate option (or combination of 
options) in response to the following question:
A.3 Flood Risk Maps
For communities with increasing population densities 
which are also subject to pressure to continue developing 
in high-risk areas, flood risk maps play an important role 
in helping to promote public awareness, thereby enabling 
people to make informed decisions on where to live and 
which preventive actions to take.
Flood risk maps also serve the purpose of providing 
crucial intelligence for emergency management 
professionals about the location and concentration of 
vulnerable populations and help with identifying potential 
threats to critical evacuation routes.
To gauge the level of involvement of provincial 
governments in the update of flood risk maps, participants 
were asked to select the most appropriate option in 
response to the following question: “Have the provincial 
flood risk maps for areas subject to current and future 
risks of flooding been updated within the last 5 years?” 
To gauge the level of involvement of territorial 
governments in the update of flood risk maps, participants 
were asked to select the most appropriate option in 
response to the following question: “Have the territorial 
hazard risk maps been updated within the last 5 years?”

A.4 Land Use Planning 
Land use planning is one of the fundamental components 
of flood management. Managing development activities 
to effectively minimize the risk of flooding to life, 
property, and infrastructure is a major objective of land 
use planning. Since some hazard areas will continue to be 
occasionally flooded, land use regulations must be directed 
at prohibiting development within the highest-risk areas as 
well as restricting development in lower risk areas. 
The present study assesses the declared commitments of 
provincial and territorial governments pertaining to the 
following components of Land Use Planning criteria:
•	 Unincorporated Communities;
•	 Municipal Planning Areas; and
•	 Provincial / Territorial Crown Lands.
To address these criteria, participants from provincial 
governments were asked to select the most appropriate 
option (or combination of options) in response to the 
following questions:

A.6 Sustainable Flood Management
Despite the established value of natural ecosystems, 
including their role as a flood protective element, Canada 
to-date continues to experience significant and extensive 
losses of its wetlands, forests, and intact grassland areas. 
The transformation of the natural environment has been 
most extreme in the southern parts of Canada, including 
the Great Plains region of Canada that stretches across 
southern Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, and the 
grasslands in British Columbia’s interior. 
Although floodplain regulations require the protection 
of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural 
protective barriers such as wetlands, Canada continues 
to lose its unique natural capital: namely its wetlands, 
riparian forests, and coastal marches.
The present study assesses the declared commitments 
of provincial and territorial governments pertaining 
to the following components of the Sustainable Flood 
Management criterion:
•	 Protection and Restoration of Riverine Floodplains, 
Wetlands, and Riparian Buffers; and
•	 Protection and Restoration of Coastal Floodplains, Salt

A.7 Vulnerability Assessment for 
New Development Projects
The term, new development projects, refers to the design 
and construction of infrastructure assets that may have 
very long service lives; dams, for instance, are commonly 
in use for 80-100 years, or even longer. It is therefore 
critical that the planning and design phases of new 
development projects include the assessment of the type, 
extent, and rate of change of the climatic conditions to 
which such infrastructure is predicted to be exposed and 
the level of the sensitivity of the infrastructure to such 
changes. 
The assessment of vulnerability from an engineering 
standpoint as well as general risk assessments are the 
primary methods through which climate change can be 
considered in the design, operation, and maintenance of 
physical infrastructure systems infrastructure. 
The present study assesses the declared commitments of 
provincial and territorial governments pertaining to the 
following components of the New Development Projects 
criterion:
•	 New Highways;
•	 Natural Resource Development;
•	 Oil and Gas Pipelines;
•	 Hydrogeneration; and

A.8 Risk Mitigation for Critical 
Infrastructure
Concerns over climate change and rising sea levels bring 
into question the vulnerability of Critical Infrastructure 
to flooding and to the adverse effects of climate change. 
The loss of Critical Infrastructure components such as 
those within energy systems, transportation networks, 
telecommunication systems, water supply and wastewater 
systems, as well as other lifeline infrastructure systems 
can have far-reaching societal impacts, and damage to 
these critical assets may well have significant impacts on 
emergency response and recovery efforts.
The first step in determining which adaptation or 
mitigation strategies are appropriate for a given piece 
of existing Critical Infrastructure is to assess the present 
status of said infrastructure with a comprehensive 
vulnerability assessment. On this basis, the process of 
planning mitigation measures can be initiated.
The present study assesses the declared commitments 
of provincial and territorial governments pertaining to 
the assessment of vulnerability and mitigation of risk 
for the following types of Critical Infrastructure that 
were identified as the five components of the composite 
criterion:
•	 Electrical Infrastructure;
•	 Telecom Infrastructure;
•	 Provincial Highway Infrastructure and Highway 
Drainage Structures;
•	 Pipeline Infrastructure; and
•	 Water Infrastructure.
To address these criteria, participants from provincial 
governments were asked to select the most appropriate 
option (or combination of options) in response to the 
following questions:

A.9 Public Health and Safety
Disasters resulting from natural hazards such as floods 
can directly affect human health through injuries, death, 
and disease outbreaks, and their longer-term impacts may 
include further health issues such as illnesses, psychiatric 
issues, and disabilities (World Health Organization 
2018). Floods can also trigger dam incidents, the failure 
of structural flood protection infrastructure (SFP), as 
well as the release of contaminants from abandoned sites 
into the environment, resulting in immense property and 
environmental damages and the possible loss of human life.
The present study assesses the declared commitments of

A.10 Emergency Management
Despite the efforts of governments and other groups 
to establish and enforce various types of protective 
and adaptation measures, floods do still occur. While 
mitigation and preparedness actions are undertaken 
prior to emergency events, response and recovery efforts 
are initiated after an emergency event has already 
begun. In Canada, emergency management is a shared 
responsibility between individuals and the various levels 
of government.
Collaboration with business and infrastructure owners 
and operators which have the primary responsibility 
for managing their systems in emergencies, and the 
coordination of their objectives, strategies, and tactics 
during major flooding events is critically important in 
order to ensure the robustness of emergency response and 
recovery operations. 
The present study assesses the declared commitments 
of provincial and territorial governments in relation to 
the following domains of Emergency Management that

Climate Change and the Preparedness of Canadian Provinces and Territories to Limit Flood Risk
94
Definitions
Catastrophic Event (CAT): an event that affects 
multiple policies and causes more than $25 million of 
insured damage.
Climate: the average weather, usually expressed in terms 
of the parameters temperature, precipitation, and wind.
Climate Change: a change in the mean and/or the 
variability of climate parameters over time ranging from 
months to thousands or millions of years
Coastal Flooding: flooding associated with a defined 
shoreline along an ocean or a lake. Can occur due to a 
combination of high water levels, high tides, storm surges, 
waves, tsunamis, rising sea levels.
Contaminated Site: a site at which substances occur at 
concentrations: (1) above background levels and pose or 
are likely to pose an immediate or long-term hazard to 
human health or the environment, or (2) exceeding levels 
specified in policies and regulations.
Floodplain: an area adjacent to a lake, river or coast, 
which can be expected to be regularly inundated or 
covered with water. It typically includes two zones: 
•	 Floodway: the channel of the river or stream and the 
adjacent land that must remain free from obstruction 
so that the regulatory flood can be safely conveyed 
downstream
•	 Flood Fringe: the remaining portion of the floodplain, 
where flood depths, flow velocities, or wave energies 
are relatively lower and some development may be 
permitted, if adequate levels of flood protection are 
provided. Flood Mechanisms: the condition, which 
causes a specific type of flood (e.g., blocked culvert 
leading to overland flooding).
Flood Mitigation: a sustained action taken to reduce 
or eliminate long-term risk to people and property from 
flood hazards and their effects. Mitigation distinguishes 
actions that have a long-term impact from those that are 
more closely associated with preparedness for, immediate 
response to, and short-term recovery from specific events.
Flood Risk: flood risk is a combination of the likelihood 
of occurrence of a flood event and the social or economic 
consequences of that event when it occurs. 
Flood Risk Maps: maps that contain the flood hazard 
or inundation delineations along with additional socio-
economic values, such as potential loss or property 
vulnerability levels. These maps serve to identify the 
social, economic and environmental consequences to 
communities during a potential flood event. 
Flood Protection: any combination of structural and 
non-structural improvements, additions, changes, or 
adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate risk 
of flood damage to real estate or improved real property, 
water and sanitation facilities, or structures with their 
contents.
Fluvial Flooding: excess stream flow in a watercourse, 
such that land outside the normal banks is submerged 
or inundated. Riverine flooding can be caused or 
exacerbated by extreme rainfall, snowmelt, physical 
conditions (e.g., ice, sediment and debris jams, 
watercourse configuration and capacity limitations), as 
well as elevated water levels in receiving waterbodies.
Infill: development within urban boundaries not related 
to large-scale development plans, but rather smaller scale 
development in remnant vacant parcels.
Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curve: a 
graphical representation of the probability that a given 
depth of rainfall will occur, shown in rainfall intensity 
(e.g., in millimeters per hour) with respect to rainfall 
duration (e.g., hour). Lateral: any pipe from a building 
connected to the main sewer.
Peak Flow: the maximum flow rate occurring during a 
specified flood event measured at a given point in a river, 
overland, or in a pipe system.
Permafrost: rock or soil that remains below 0°C for at 
least two consecutive years. Surface conditions including 
vegetation, organic cover and snow thickness can 
influence permafrost temperatures. Permafrost thickness is 
related to the air temperature, soil characteristics and the 
geothermal gradient as well as the geological history of 
the area.
Pluvial Flooding: the inundation of the built 
environment by rainfall, overwhelming the capacity of 
stormwater management systems.
Climate Change and the Preparedness of Canadian Provinces and Territories to Limit Flood Risk
95
Re-development: conversion of existing urban uses 
of lower value and significance to other preferred uses 
per a community plan (e.g. brownfield redevelopment to 
residential uses).
Regulatory Flood: the defined flood event used to 
delineate areas prone to flooding for the purposes of 
regulating land use. The minimum regulatory flood criteria 
standard in Canada is the 100-year return period flood, 
which is the peak flood flow with a one percent chance of 
occurring in any given year. Some regions, provinces, and 
territories implement standards that are more stringent. 
Resilience: capacity of people and systems to absorb 
negative impacts and respond to changing climate 
conditions.
Riparian Areas: the ecosystems that are located adjacent 
to streams, rivers, wetlands, and lakes wherein both soil 
and vegetation are strongly influenced by the presence of 
water.
Risk: a combination of the likelihood (probability of 
occurrence) and the consequences of an event.
Risk Management: a systematic approach to setting 
the course of action under conditions of uncertainty, by 
applying management policies, procedures, and practices 
to the analysis, evaluation, control, and communication 
about risk issues.
Runoff: the amount of water deriving from precipitation/ 
snowmelt, not otherwise evapotranspirated or stored, that 
flows across the landscape. 
Sanitary Sewer: part of the public sewage works for 
the transmission of sanitary sewage (includes human 
and industrial waste, and septic waste, but not typically 
stormwater).
Stormwater: precipitation that washes off driveways, 
parking lots, roads, yards, rooftops, and other surfaces. 
Stormwater Management: the planning, design 
and implementation of systems that mitigate and 
control the impacts of man-made changes to runoff 
and other components of the hydrologic cycle. 
Stormwater management is also referred to as “rainwater 
management” in much of the world.
