The COVID-19 pandemic and climate change are two current global threats. This study examined the rela-
tionship between climate change attitudes and COVID-19 behaviors and risk perceptions. Drivers of climate
change attitudes and COVID-19 behaviors were also assessed. Study participants were an online sample of
520 respondents from a longitudinal study of COVID-19 and well-being in the US. Logistic regression models
were used to examine the outcomes of climate change opinions and COVID-19 perceptions and prevention
behaviors (perceived COVID-19 risk, mask wearing, social distancing, and vaccine intentions). Covariates
included political ideology, conspiracy beliefs, and trust in scientiﬁc information about COVID-19. In the mul-
tivariable models of COVID-19 perceptions and prevention behaviors, climate change opinions were also
included as a covariate. In these models, climate change attitudes were signiﬁcantly associated with per-
ceived risk of COVID-19, always wearing masks, decreased time spent with others due to COVID-19, and
intention to get a COVID-19 vaccine. In adjusted models, the odds of wearing a mask increased 41% (CI: 1.11
−1.78) for every 1-point increase on the climate attitude scale and decreased 13% (CI: 0.79−0.96) if the par-
ticipant distrusted COVID-19 information. Those who reported distrust of COVID-19 information (aOR: 1.61,
CI: 1.40−1.85), politically conservative ideology (aOR: 1.24, CI: 1.04−1.47), lower concern about climate
change (aOR: 0.71, CI: 0.53−0.97), female sex (aOR: 2.39 CI: 1.38−4.13), and lower disbelief in conspiracy
theories (aOR: 0.63, CI: 0.51−0.80) had higher odds of not intending to be vaccinated. These ﬁndings suggest
that climate change attitudes are linked to COVID-19 behaviors and perceptions, which are not completely
driven by political ideology or trust in scientiﬁc information.

While community, state, and national prevention resources are
have been focused on mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic, climate
change looms as a concurrent global crisis. Furthermore, climate
change will likely accelerate the speed with which future infectious
disease outbreaks occur, through increased interactions between
humans and other species as well as altered geographic ranges of
infectious disease vectors [1−3]. The two crises share commonalities,
with each linked to political polarization, downplaying of severity,
and distrust in science [4,5]. Given the commonalities of these crises,
understanding factors associated with COVID-19 mitigation and the
interplay between COVID-19 and climate change can provide critical
insight into how the public can be motivated to address climate
change and lessen future disasters. This study aims to assess how
COVID-19 attitudes and behavior and climate change attitudes may
be linked, ﬁrst by examining the associations between them and then
by assessing whether we can decern common factors that may drive
these two seemingly disparate phenomena. At the time of data col-
lection fo rthis study, over 250,000 COVID-19 deaths and 12 million
cases had been conﬁrmed in the US with over 4.5 million deaths and
215 million cases worldwide. Regarding climate change, 2020 was
tied for the warmest year ever recorded. In 2020, major climate
events occurred, including vast Australian bush ﬁres which burned
over 45 million acres; in the US, ﬁve of the 10 largest wildﬁres on
record in California occurred, setting a state record for acres burned.
Several shared drivers of attitudes about the COVID-19 and cli-
mate change crises have been identiﬁed. One primary driver is politi-
cal ideology. Multiple studies in the US have documented that
political ideology is strongly linked to climate change attitudes. Indi-
viduals who identify as liberal, as compared to conservative, are

more likely to believe that climate change is caused by humans, to be
concerned about harms caused by climate change, and to support
actions to address it [6−11]. Political ideology has also impacted how
the COVID-19 pandemic has both been handled by various govern-
ments and perceived by their constituents [12,13]. In the US, the
Trump administration’s decision to downplay the risk of COVID-19,
ampliﬁed by conservative media outlets such as Fox News, facilitated
political polarization in both perceptions of and responses to the pan-
demic [14]. Indeed, political ideology was found to be associated with
COVID-19 prevention behaviors such as mask wearing, frequent
handwashing, decreased time spent with others, and standing at least
6-feet apart when interacting with others [14−16].
In addition to political ideology inﬂuencing attitudes and sources
of information about climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic,
political beliefs and ideologies might serve as a source of motivated
reasoning, with conservatives avoiding information on the actual
severity of the COVID-19 pandemic due in part to conservative lead-
ers and media outlets downplaying the pandemic’s severity, thus
engaging in fewer prevention behaviors. Motivated cognitions have
been well-studied in the ﬁeld of climate change [17]. Prior research
on motivative cognitions that ﬁnds that Republicans are less likely to
spend time reading climate change articles or viewing graphs about
global temperatures than Democrats [18,19].
In the US, political polarization in recent decades has also been
associated with greater distrust among conservatives in the use of
scientiﬁc evidence to guide policymaking. Distrust in science may
affect not only attitudes about the COVID-19 pandemic but also
COVID-19 prevention behaviors and COVID-19 vaccine intentions [20
−22]. Distrust in science is not unique to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Trust in scientiﬁc information has previously been associated with
climate change attitudes, with those who believe that scientists
manipulate their data more likely to deny that climate change is real
and report less trust in climate science agencies [23].
Finally, another shared association between the COVID-19 pan-
demic and climate change is the proliferation of conspiracy theories
surrounding both crises. In the US, high levels of conspiracy theories
have been documented in recent years. An NPR/Ipsos poll conducted
in late December 2020 found that 40% of Americans surveyed believe
that COVID-19 was created in a lab in China, 39% agreed there was a
deep state working to undermine the Trump presidency [24], and
almost one-quarter of Republicans thought that “A group of Satan-
worshipping elites who run a child sex ring are trying to control our
politics and media,” with an additional 38% responding “Don’t know”
to this statement. Research on conspiracy theories and climate
change attitudes ﬁnds a strong association between conspiracy
beliefs and downplaying the current climate change emergency
[25,26]. There is also an emerging body of literature on the associa-
tion between belief in conspiracy theories and adoption of COVID-19
prevention behaviors, such as mask wearing, social distancing, and
intentions to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine [27−29]. Consequently, we
examined the extent to which belief in conspiracy theories is associ-
ated with attitudes toward climate change and COVID-19 attitudes.
In the current study, using an online sample of US respondents,
we ﬁrst examined the associations between attitudes towards cli-
mate change and COVID-19 perceptions and preventions behaviors,
including mask usage, social distancing, and vaccine intentions. We
assessed whether these factors were also correlated with trust in
information about COVID-19 from scientiﬁc organizations, political
ideologies, and belief in conspiracy theories. We then used multivari-
able logistic regression models to examine the independent associa-
tion of climate change attitudes with COVID-19 attitudes and
behaviors, adjusting for trust in information about COVID-19 from
scientiﬁc organizations, political ideology, and conspiracy theories.
We examined whether trust in information about COVID-19 from sci-
entiﬁc organizations, political ideology, and conspiracy theories was
independently associated with climate change attitudes. Finally, we
examined the association between climate change attitudes and
COVID-19 behaviors and attitudes and whether this association
would be signiﬁcantly attenuated when adjusting for political ideol-
ogy and distrust in scientiﬁc sources of COVID-19 information.
Understanding these dynamics may help to tailor health communica-
tion and public engagement strategies for both climate change and
COVID-19 and potentially inform future pandemic responses.
Methods
Study respondents participated in an online longitudinal study
that began in March 2020. The study aimed to examine individual,
social, and societal-level ﬂuctuations in experiences and perceptions
amidst the rapidly changing landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Study periods occurred every few months and sought to capture
changes in scientiﬁc knowledge of infection, the extent of infectious
spread, and progress in vaccine development. All respondents who
successfully completed the ﬁrst survey were invited to participate in
the subsequent rounds of data collection. Study respondents com-
pleted the ﬁrst survey between March 24th-27th, 2020, after many
governors had declared States of Emergency and enacted social dis-
tancing measures. By March 24th, 2020, 15 states had implemented
statewide Stay At Home orders, including California, Connecticut,
Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, New
Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Washington, and West
Virginia. By March 26th, 2020, 21 states had enacted statewide Stay
At Home orders. Study respondents were invited to participate in the
second survey between May 5th-14th, 2020, and the third survey
from July 22nd-30th, 2020. At that time, there had been over 140,000
COVID-19 deaths in the US. The fourth wave of the study was admin-
istered from November 18th-28th, 2020, after Pﬁzer- BioNTech
(November 9th) and Moderna (November 16th) presented prelimi-
nary Phase 3 data indicating that their COVID-19 vaccines were efﬁ-
cacious but before any COVID-19 vaccine was approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration or available to the public. There were
584 valid surveys at wave four and 520 individuals who completed
both wave three and wave four surveys.
Study participants were recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical
Turk (MTurk) service. This approach is regularly used by health
researchers, as it allows for a diverse sample to be collected in a rapid
and timely fashion [30]. Prior research has indicated that samples col-
lected through MTurk provide better quality data in less time than
other methods for recruiting convenience samples [31]. Study popu-
lations recruited through MTurk are not nationally representative
but have been documented to outperform other opinion samples on
several dimensions [32]. Studies using MTurk have also demon-
strated good reliability [33]. The survey followed MTurk's best practi-
ces for research, which included ensuring participant conﬁdentiality,
protecting study integrity, generating unique completion codes, inte-
grating attention-checks throughout the survey, repeating study-spe-
ciﬁc qualiﬁcation questions, and removing disqualiﬁed participants
[31,34,35].
Moreover, the demographic characteristics of MTurk appear to be
stable [36]. Although MTurk is open to all US residents age 18 or
older, respondents tend to be more liberal than the general public,
but those who are conservative do not signiﬁcantly differ in their atti-
tudes from conservatives recruited from other sources [37]. Eligibility
included being age 18 or older, living in the United States, being able
to speak and read English, having heard of the coronavirus or COVID-
19, and providing written informed consent. To enhance study valid-
ity, eligible participants had to pass attention and validity checks
embedded in the survey. Participants were paid $2.50 for completing
the ﬁrst survey, $3.00 for the second, $3.50 for the third, and $4.00
for the fourth, which was equivalent to approximately $12 per hour.
The study protocols were approved by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg
School of Public Health Institutional Review Board.

Measures
The outcome variables were engagement in COVID-19 prevention
behaviors, perceived risk of COVID-19, and climate change attitudes.
These items were measured at wave 4, which was administered prior
to the availability of the COVID-19 vaccine. The three COVID-19 related
behavioral outcome variables were mask wearing, social distancing,
and vaccine intention. These were assessed with the survey items: “Do
you wear a face mask when you are outside?” (with the options of
“Never,” “Sometimes,” and “Always,” which was dichotomized to
“Never” versus “Sometimes” or “Always”) and “Are you trying to spend
less time around other people to prevent getting the coronavirus?”
(with the response options of “Yes” and “No”). Based on prior vaccine
hesitancy surveys, we also included vaccine intention as an outcome
variable based upon the question: “I am very likely to get a coronavirus
vaccine, when available.” The response options were “Strongly agree,”
“Agree,” “Neither agree nor disagree,” “Disagree,” and “Strongly dis-
agree.” These items were trichotomized for analysis as positive inten-
tions
(“Strongly
agree/Agree”),
ambivalence
(“Neither
agree
nor
disagree”), and negative intentions (“Disagree/Strongly disagree”).
Four survey items were used to assess perceived COVID-19 risk.
These included: “If I got the coronavirus, it's likely that I would get
very sick,” “People I'm close to may die from the coronavirus,” “I am
very worried about my family and friends getting the coronavirus,”
and “I am very worried about getting the coronavirus.” The response
categories were "Strongly agree (5)," "Agree (4)," "Neither agree nor
disagree (3)," "Disagree (2)," and "Strongly disagree (1)." The Cron-
bach’s alpha for the 4-item perceived COVID-19 measure was 0.84.
For the logistic regression models, a median split was used to differ-
entiate between high and low perceived risk.
We assessed climate change attitudes using two standard ques-
tions: “How concerned are you about climate change?” and “The
future of many young people will be much worse due to climate
change.” In addition, we included the items: “With everything else
going on in the world, I don't have much interest in climate change,”
and the behavior of “I tend to avoid news on climate change.” The
ﬁrst question had response categories of “ A great deal (5)," “Quite a
bit (4),” "Some (3)," and "Very little or none (2).” The latter three
questions had the response categories of “Strongly agree (5),” “Agree
(4),” “Neither agree nor disagree (3),” “Disagree (2),” and “Strongly
disagree (1).” Exploratory principal component analysis revealed one
factor that accounted for 73% of the variance. After the reverse coding
of the negatively worded statements, these items were added
together for a scale with a range from 5 to 20, with a Cronbach’s alpha
of 0.87. We also used a median split at 16 to dichotomize the climate
change attitude scale when it was used as a dependent variable.
Three key predictors were (1) distrust in sources of COVID-19 infor-
mation, (2) political ideology, and (3) having conspiracy beliefs. To
assess distrust in sources of COVID-19 information, a set of questions
asked participants, “How much do you trust information from [....]
about coronavirus?” The following were sources of information: the
CDC, Johns Hopkins University (which hosts the online COVID-19
tracker), and your State Health Department were included. Response
options were “A great deal (1),” “Quite a bit (2),” "Some (3)," and "Very
little or none (4)." Based on factor analyses, these items were added
together for a scale with a range from 3 to 12, with a Cronbach’s alpha
of 0.80. Political ideology was assessed with the question, “Where
would you place yourself on a scale running from “Very liberal” to
“Very conservative?” The response categories were “Very Liberal (1),”
Liberal (2),” Slightly Liberal (3),” “Moderate (4),” “Slightly Conservative
(5),” “Conservative (6),” and “Very Conservative (7).” Conspiracy beliefs
were measured by the standard question of, “Much of what happens
in the world today is decided by a small and secretive group of individ-
uals,” with response categories of “Strongly agree (1), ” “Agree (2), ”
“Neither agree nor disagree (3), ” “Disagree(4), ” and “Strongly disagree
(5)” with higher scores indicating disbelief in the conspiracy item [38].”
Gender, education, and income were also assessed. Level of educa-
tion was collapsed to reﬂect some college or less versus bachelor’s
degree or higher. Income was dichotomized at the median of $60,000
or below. The response categories for self-reported race/ethnicity
included
“White,”
“Non-Hispanic
Black,”
“Asian,”
“Hispanic,”
“Mixed,” or “Other.” All demographic variables were collected during
the ﬁrst wave.
Analyses
To examine common signiﬁcant covariates among COVID-19 atti-
tudes and behaviors and climate change attitudes, descriptive analyses
and logistic univariable and multivariable regression models were used
to evaluate outcomes of the level of concern about climate change, per-
ceived risk of COVID-19, mask wearing, social distancing, and vaccine
intentions. Three vaccine intention groups were examined: those with
(1) positive vaccine intentions, (2) ambivalent intentions, and (3) nega-
tive intentions. Multinomial models were used to model the three-level
vaccine intention variable. There was no evidence of collinearity in the
multivariable models. For the multivariable logistic regression models,
all sociodemographic variables and other variables with a p-value of
<0.20 in the bivariate models were included in the ﬁnal adjusted
model [39,40]. In order to compare the models, if one of the covariates
met this criterion in one of the bivariate models, it was included in all
of the multivariable models. We excluded the variable of race/ethnicity
due to small Ns in some of the cells.

38 years (IQR: 32−46 years), 56.9% (n = 296) were female, and 81%
(n = 421) self-identiﬁed as White race. Roughly half (n = 270, 52.0%)
of the participants stated that they were worried about getting
COVID-19. When asked about engagement in COVID-19 prevention
measures, nearly two-thirds (n = 337, 64.8%) of the participants
stated that they “Always” wore a face mask when they went outside,
compared to 35.2% (n = 183) who reported “Sometimes” or “Never,”
and 87.7% (n = 456) said they had decreased the amount of time spent
around other people. Almost 60% (n = 297, 57.1%) of the participants
reported that they were very likely to receive the COVID-19 vaccine
once it became available. By comparison, 25.2% (n = 131) and 17.7%
(n = 92) stated that they were not likely to get the vaccine or were
ambivalent, respectively. We found that the mean for the climate
change attitude scale was 15.20 (Median=16, SD=3.96, range 5−20),
suggesting that, on average, the concern for climate change was
skewed to the high end. The trust in COVID-19 information sources
scale had a range of 3−12 with a mean of 6.2 (Median=6, SD=2.28),
and the perceived risk of COVID-19 scale had a range of 4−12 with a
mean of 10.3 (Median=9.5, SD=3.72).
Predictors of the perceived risk of infection, personal prevention
measures, and climate change beliefs are presented in Tables 2a and
2b. In the univariable analysis, found in the righthand columns, we
found that distrust of COVID-19 related information from ofﬁcial
sources (CDC, Johns Hopkins University, and health departments)
(OR: 0.77, CI: 0.71−0.84), and conservative political beliefs (OR: 0.71,
CI: 0.64−0.79) were both associated with lower perceived risk of
COVID-19. By contrast, for every 1-point increase on the climate
change attitude scale, the odds of greater perceived risk of COVID-19
more than doubled (OR: 2.03, CI: 1.66−2.48). Similarly, not believing
that the government was run by a small secretive group of people
was also associated with higher perceived risk of COVID-19 (OR:
1.21, CI: 1.04−1.39), but the association did not persist in the
adjusted model. In the multivariable analyses, the relationships
between perceived risk of COVID-19 and more liberal political ideol-
ogy (aOR: 0.84, CI: 0.73−0.95), greater trust in public health sources
of COVID-19 information from public health sources (aOR: 0.85, CI:
0.76−0.93), and concerns regarding climate change (aOR: 1.53, CI:
1.20−1.95) persisted, although the associations were attenuated.
In terms of efforts made to prevent COVID-19 transmission,
results from the univariable analysis found that the odds of more fre-
quent mask wearing were lower among participants with conserva-
tive political ideology (OR: 0.74, CI: 0.67−0.83) and those who
distrusted public health sources of information (OR: 0.79, CI: 0.72
−0.85). We did ﬁnd that the odds of mask wearing were higher
among individuals who reported concern regarding climate change
(OR: 1.84, CI: 1.53−2.22) and those who did not believe in conspiracy
theories (OR: 1.30, CI: 1.12−1.50). In the multivariable model, the
odds of wearing a mask increased 41% (CI: 1.11−1.78) for every 1-
point increase on the climate attitude scale and decreased 13% (CI:
0.79−0.96) if the participant distrusted COVID-19 information. When
participants were asked how COVID-19 impacted the amount of time
spent with others, the odds of decreasing the amount of time spent
with others were lower if a participant did not trust ofﬁcial sources
of COVID-19 information (OR: 0.66, CI: 0.58−0.75) and had conserva-
tive political beliefs (OR: 0.63, CI: 0.54−0.74). However, decreasing
the amount of time spent with others was positively associated with
concern for climate change (OR: 2.57 CI: 1.98−3.34), disbelief in con-
spiracy theories (OR: 1.66, CI: 1.34−2.06), and female sex (OR: 1.97,
CI: 1.16−3.35). In the multivariable analyses, distrust in COVID-19
information from public health sources (aOR: 0.78, CI: 0.67−0.91)
and conservative political opinions (aOR: 0.79, CI: 0.65−0.97) contin-
ued to be associated with no decrease in time spent with others.
Increasing concern about climate change (aOR: 1.71, CI: 1.22−2.39)
was positively associated with decreased time spent with others due
to COVID-19 in the adjusted model.
With respect to vaccine hesitancy, compared to participants that
were likely to get the COVID-19 vaccine, groups who were undecided
about the vaccine tended to be distrustful of scientiﬁc information
about COVID-19 (OR: 1.35, CI: 1.20−1.53), have conservative political
opinions (OR: 1.16, CI: 1.01−1.33), and believed in conspiracy theo-
ries (OR: 0.70, CI: 0.57−0.86) in the univariable analysis. Only distrust
of COVID-19 related information remained signiﬁcantly associated
with indifference to the COVID-19 vaccine (aOR: 1.32, CI: 1.16−1.51)
in the multivariable regression model. Similarly, compared to partici-
pants who planned on getting the COVID-19 vaccine, the odds of not
intending to be vaccinated were higher if the participant did not trust

COVID-19 related information provided by public health sources (OR:
1.87, CI: 1.66−2.12), were politically conservative (OR: 1.52, CI: 1.35
−1.73), female (OR: 1.55, CI: 1.01−2.38), and believed in conspiracies
(OR: 0.45, CI: 0.37−0.55). By contrast, the odds of not getting the
COVID-19 vaccine decreased for every unit increase in climate change
attitudes (OR: 0.41, CI: 0.33−0.51), indicating higher concern regard-
ing climate change, and if a participant had a college or graduate
degree (OR: 0.60, CI: 0.40−0.91), compared to participants with some
college education or less. After adjusting for other factors in the mul-
tivariable model, those with distrust of public health sources of
COVID-19 information (aOR: 1.61, CI: 1.40−1.85), politically conser-
vative ideology (aOR: 1.24, CI: 1.04−1.47), lower concern about cli-
mate change (aOR: 0.71, CI: 0.53−0.97), female sex (aOR: 2.39, CI:
1.38−4.13), and belief in conspiracy theories (aOR: 0.63, CI: 0.51
−0.80) all continued to have higher odds of not intending to be vacci-
nated compared to those intending to get the COVID-19 vaccine.
Finally, similarly to those with low perceived risk of COVID-19 and
poor engagement in prevention measures, individuals with signiﬁ-
cantly lower odds of concern for climate change had conservative
political ideology (OR: 0.57, CI: 0.51−0.65) and distrust of public
health sources of COVID-19 information (OR: 0.68, CI: 0.62−0.75) in
the univariable analysis. High levels of disagreement with the state-
ment “Much of what happens in the world today is decided by a small
and secretive group of individuals” was associated with higher odd of
high climate change concern (aOR: 1.47, CI: 1.27−1.71), compared to
those who were supportive of the conspiracy theory. Only distrust of
COVID-19 information (aOR: 0.75, CI: 0.67−0.83) and conservative
ideology (aOR: 0.62, CI: 0.54−0.71) continued to be associated with
signiﬁcantly lower odds of climate change concern in the multivari-
able model.
Discussion
In the current study, we found that COVID-19 prevention behaviors
(with the exception of ambivalent vaccine intentions) were signiﬁcantly
associated with climate change attitudes. After adjustment for political
ideology, endorsement of conspiracy beliefs, trust in public health sour-
ces of COVID-19 information, and demographic variables, the associa-
tions between COVID-19 prevention behaviors and attitudes and
climate change attitudes remained statistically signiﬁcant.
There are several potential explanations for these ﬁndings on the
relationship between climate change attitudes and COVID-19 behav-
iors and attitudes. One possible explanation for the identiﬁed associa-
tions is that there are additional factors not assessed that are
correlated with both climate change attitudes and COVID-19 preven-
tion behaviors. One domain we did not assess was speciﬁc sources of
news information. Prior studies have shown news sources to be
related to climate change attitudes and COVID-19 behaviors [42].
Unmeasured factors such as social identity and social norms may also
help account for the association between climate change attitudes
and COVID-19 prevention behaviors. Our inability to rule out alterna-
tive explanations to explain the association between climate change
attitudes and COVID-19 prevention behaviors suggests there could
be a constellation of attitudinal factors, beliefs, and cognitive biases
that overlap. These components may include political ideology, news
sources, peer inﬂuence, social and individual identity, and distrust in
government, all of which may inﬂuence both climate change atti-
tudes and COVID-19 behaviors.
Two of the items of climate change attitudes scale involved avoid-
ance or lack of interest in the topic of climate change. This ﬁnding of
the association between the climate change avoidance/interest items
and the concern/impact items suggests that there may be motivative
cognitions in climate attitudes that includes avoiding information on
climate change which ﬁts with prior research on motivative cognitions,
political ideologies, and party afﬁliation [18,19]. This line of research
suggests that we need to view climate change attitudes as more than a
positive or negative valence at a given level of intensity. These atti-
tudes are integrally linked to proclivity to engage in the topic. This
association among the climate change attitude items also suggests that
those who acknowledge climate change will need to start climate
change conversations with those who avoid the topic. Moreover, dis-
counting the severity of climate change should be viewed in context.
Individuals may express that they have many competing priorities to
address in their lives, and hence linking climate change to those priori-
ties may be a viable method to reduce avoidance.
Hoffath and Hodson found that both climate change denial and
denial that climate change was caused by humans were strongly
associated with perceived environmentalism threat [41]. This con-
struct of environmentalism threat contained items such as, “The

environmentalists,” and “Hard-working Americans are negatively
impacted by environmentalists.” These sentiments are similar to con-
cerns voiced by conservative leaders that an overreaction by public
health ofﬁcials and liberals to the pandemic led to a negative eco-
nomic impact. Hence, it may be, in part, economic concerns that drive
discounting of both climate change and the severity of the COVID-19
and appropriate prevention behaviors.
The role of political ideology in climate change attitudes is in line
with prior climate change research, highlighting the importance of
encouraging conservative leaders who are concerned about climate
express publicly their views publicaly. [43−46]. However, it may be
more comfortable for many climate change advocates to afﬁliate
with more politically like-minded individuals who may not be politi-
cally conservative. Involving political conservatives in establishing
common concerns on climate change and developing feasible solu-
tions is critical in order to develop sustainable change. Individual-
level, voluntary solutions are likely to be more agreeable for those
who have an individualistic perspective [47,48]. However, these
approaches are clearly insufﬁcient for addressing climate change and
may be counterproductive if people believe that they are sufﬁcient.
Another approach to addressing the political polarization is to forge a
new superordinate identity that includes a wide political spectrum,
link political identity to pro-environmental outcomes such as sus-
tained ﬁshing and hunting for conservatives, or promote pro-envi-
ronmental ingroup norms by comparisons to an outgroup [49].
Findings on the distrust of scientiﬁc news sources emphasize the
importance of communication strategies in addition to mainstream
media. Disseminating information on COVID-19 and climate change
through informal and personal networks may be an effective way
to reach those who distrust governmental information. Training
individuals on initiating conversations about climate change or cre-
ating compelling climate change content on social media may be
critical and novel avenues for reaching such individuals. In addition,
discussions of climate change with family and friends are not nor-
mative for many individuals [50]. Hence, increasing these discus-
sions can normalize such discourse and thereby increase its
acceptability. Providing guidance on how to start such conversa-
tions is likely to be helpful. Still, there is a need for empirical data
to test what approaches are most effective to foster and diffuse
such conversations both via social media and in person. It is also
well documented that conservative news sources such as Fox News
have downplayed the severity of climate change and the severity of
the COVID-19 pandemic [51,52]. We do not know if such news
sources are in themselves inﬂuential or whether to be inﬂuential, it
is necessary for them to be seen as an alternative to the mainstream
narratives.
One reason for discounting climate change and COVID-19 severity
may be that many individuals have inadequate mental models of
these phenomena [53]. Mental models can be conceptualized as pro-
viding individuals with predictive and explanatory power for under-
standing the world, themselves, the tasks they perform, and their
social and physical interactions [53]. Much of the focus on providing
the public with mental models of climate change has been on com-
municating brief mechanistic models to describe climate change
physics. There is evidence that this approach can change attitudes;
however, these models do not focus on the impact of climate change
on individuals or societies or provide information on how to mitigate
climate change. Moreover, individuals may approach a topic with
their own mental models. Prior research suggests that the term
“environmentalists” often carries negative connotations, as this term
may conjure up negative attributes [54,55]. It is therefore important
to understand these negative mental models associated with climate
change and mitigation. For example, components of mental models
may include the belief that scientists, public health ofﬁcials, or acti-
vists mandate and/or vilify certain behaviors or advocate for pro-
grams that will increase taxes and decrease competitive advantages.
Similarly, mechanistic models often include information on how
greenhouse gases lead to climate change, which may promote feel-
ings of helplessness or inability to take action. These models also do
not discuss the potential social, health, and economic repercussions
of climate change. Research on mental models suggests that three
main criteria in providing conceptual models to individuals are learn-
ability, functionality, and usability [56,57]. Rather than simply pro-
viding models that explain the mechanism of climate change, it may
be beneﬁcial to provide conceptual models of both the impact of cli-
mate change on factors that are important to the individual and sug-
gest different approaches to addressing climate change. For example,
for individuals concerned about impacts on the employment sector,
information on types and quantities of high-paying jobs that can be
implemented to address climate change, such as solar panel instal-
lers, may be helpful. For individuals with economic concerns, provid-
ing information emphasizing US leadership and the use of economic
power, such as tariffs based on levels of greenhouse gasses, may be
another salient approach. To address the nationalism rhetoric and
threat of social change, mental models and communications could
also incorporate nationalistic themes, such as emphasizing that
American life will disappear if we do not tackle climate change and
freedoms may be lost due to climate change disasters. In addition,
models that include how individual-level behavior may lead to more
macro-level change may help to motivate and engage people in cli-
mate change action.
While the majority of respondents believed that climate change
would make the future of youth much worse, 32% were ambivalent or
disagreed with this statement. These results were slightly higher than
the 14% who reported very little or no concern about climate change.
Providing information to help people understand the impact of climate
change on younger generations may allow individuals to develop more
accurate and accessible mental models of the impact of climate change
on the health and well-being of future generations. For those who
actively avoid climate change news and information, it is important to
develop content that is easily disseminated and contain materials that
may reduce avoidance. Future research should examine those topics
that those who tend to avoid climate change are interested in viewing
which, could be combined with climate change messages.
In addition to mental models that can address the concerns,
beliefs, and values of climate change deniers and skeptics, it is critical
to provide models of how to address climate change effectively and
meaningfully. Two key aspects are (1) symbolic actions such as recy-
cling that identify commitment and concern and (2) political action.
Given the potential negative connotations of the label of environ-
mentalist, materials that promote alternative social identities and
social roles, such as parents protecting their children and future gen-
erations or individuals concerned about the future of their country,
may have more appeal to certain groups than a focus on traditional
environmentalist issues [49]. The sustainability triad that includes
economic and social factors may also be a potentially beneﬁcial
model for addressing concerns of those who tend to have negative
attitudes toward acknowledging and addressing climate change [58].
Although this was a cross-sectional study and, similar to other
Mturk studies, assessed a predominantly white population which
limits generalizability, the study results suggest that COVID-19
behaviors and attitudes and climate change attitudes are correlated,
and that this association cannot be explained solely by measures of
political conservatism, conspiracy beliefs, or trust in news sources.
That is, even when these three variables were controlled for in
adjusted models, there was still an association between COVID-19
behaviors and attitudes and climate change attitudes.
Future research is warranted on the interrelationship of climate
change and COVID-19 perceptions, how to frame the topic of climate
change to respond to those who discount and deny this existential
threat, and how perceptions and mental models of climate change
can lead to effective actions to mitigate climate change. This study

highlights that there are overlaps between those who discount cli-
mate change and the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. Conse-
quently, it should be anticipated that such individuals may be an
impediment to addressing human and planetary health in the con-
text of a pandemic and climate change.
