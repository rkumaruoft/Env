What are the different types of risk associated with climate change?

—
Identifying the risks to which a municipality’s water assets are exposed is the first step in assessing 
its resilience to those risks. In this case, the focus is on hazards associated with known weather 
events, as well as on predictions and projections based on long-term trends associated with 
climate change, particularly in terms of the increase in precipitation and heavy rainfall events.
The risks to be considered can be identified in different ways:
History of events and consequences observed
This category explores the history of precipitation and climate data of a given territory to draw 
up a portrait of major climate events, particularly in relation to the increase in heavy precipitation 
events. This will allow for the adjustment of, among other things, design criteria based on past 
observations.
Projected risk assessment
In addition to historical data, it is important to consider climate change projection data. A number of 
organizations at the national and provincial levels provide data to help provide an overview of the 
climate changes expected in the coming years for a given territory.
Vulnerability assessment
In addition to climate data, it is also important for a municipality to have full control of its water 
assets in order to be able to determine those that may be vulnerable to, and therefore impacted by, 
the risks identified in A and B.

Identifying the risks to which a municipality’s water assets are exposed is the first step in assessing 
its resilience to those risks. In this case, the focus is on hazards associated with known weather 
events, as well as on predictions and projections based on long-term trends associated with climate 
change, particularly in terms of the increase in intense heat and prolonged drought. These have an 
impact on many aspects of water management and water infrastructure, including drinking water.
Rising temperatures and longer drought periods are impacting water assets on several fronts, 
including drinking water management. The risks to be considered can be identified in different ways:
History of events and consequences observed
This first category explores the history of precipitation and climate data of a given territory to draw 
up a portrait of major climate events, particularly in relation to the increase in heavy precipitation

Projected risk assessment
In addition to historical data, it is important to consider climate change projection data. A number 
of organizations at the national and provincial levels provide data outlining the climate changes 
expected in the coming years for a given territory.

—
Identifying the risks to which a municipality is exposed is the first step in assessing its resilience to 
those risks. It is important to know about weather events in a given territory. 
In recent years, the frequency of storms with high winds has increased. Several municipalities, 
including their drinking water and wastewater systems, have been impacted to varying degrees by 
these events. In this case, the hazard mainly affects the power supply to water assets.
This guidance sheet presents the impacts of storms and high winds in terms of the power outages 
it can cause.
History of events and consequences observed
This first category explores the history of precipitation and climate data of a given territory to draw 
up a portrait of major climate events, particularly in relation to the increase in heavy precipitation 
events. This will allow for the adjustment of, among other things, design criteria based on past 
observations, particularly in terms of redundancy or the installation of emergency generators. 
Projected risk assessment
In addition to historical data, it is important to consider climate change projection data. A number 
of organizations at the national and provincial levels provide data outlining the climate changes 
expected in the coming years for a given territory.
Vulnerability study
In addition to climate data, it is also important for a municipality to have full control of its water 
assets in order to be able to determine those that may be vulnerable to, and therefore impacted by, 
the risks identified in A and B. Depending on how the municipality’s systems are built, this hazard 
may impact both drinking water and wastewater assets.

What measures should be put in place to reduce the vulnerability of water infrastructure and 
the resulting loss of associated functions following a weather event?
—
After identifying and understanding the risks to which it is exposed, a municipality can put in 
place practices to improve alertness to weather events that could put a huge strain on its system. 
Adjustments can also be made to the system to make it more resilient during a heavy precipitation 
event, for example.
Infrastructure configuration and condition to address risks
In order to improve the resilience of assets, solutions related to their configuration can be 
implemented. These involve both design elements to address greater (increased volumes, 
flows) and more frequent precipitation. This category includes, for example, optimal stormwater 
management practices.
Hazard and asset monitoring
In addition to a design better adapted to hazards, it is relevant to have a system to monitor and 
predict them in order to improve a municipality’s preparedness for weather events. The same is 
true for assets. Monitoring their status allows for intervention at the right time.
Prevention program and regulations
Solutions in line with the regulations in place to reduce the amount of rainwater being returned to 
the system.

For a municipality, the drinking water supply is essential. Planning actions to increase resilience is 
therefore also essential. Such planning helps you to respond quickly to problems associated with 
water quantity or quality. It is recommended to draw up a list of potential problems (e.g., shortages, 
breakdowns) in advance, based on your specific situation.

When a weather event affecting water assets occurs, various measures can be put in place to 
mitigate the impact on these assets, the functions they perform, and the population that benefits 
from them. These measures differ from those presented in Section 2, Prevention and adaptation, 
as they are measures implemented in the very short term, either during the event, when conditions 
permit, or immediately afterwards. These are included, among other things, in an emergency 
response plan that includes the roles and responsibilities of the authorities, as well as those of the 
actors responsible for water assets. The emergency response plan also includes how information 
is communicated internally, within the municipality, as well as externally, to inform the public about 
the situation and the role they can play in helping respond to the event.
Emergency response plan
A set of resources and procedures for a rapid response by operational intervention teams in the 
event of an emergency affecting water infrastructure service levels. These measures include 
resources that can be put in place to mitigate a short- or medium-term disruption (interruption or 
breakdown) in service. They can also include what residents should do to preserve their own safety 
during a major event affecting their quality of life. Often, the emergency response plan answers the 
question: Who does what?  This is about governance.
Alert and communication
Who needs to know about your municipality’s alert channel? What information should be 
communicated during a hazard event? These are examples of relevant questions that a municipality 
must answer in order to build an effective communication plan that will be used to complement the 
emergency response plan in the event of risks affecting water infrastructure service levels.

water quantity or quality. It is recommended to draw up a list of potential problems (e.g., shortages, 
breakdowns) in advance, based on your specific situation.

After experiencing several drought events, the Quinte region in Ontario put in place a drought 
management plan that helps municipalities identify the actions to be taken during a prolonged 
extreme heat event. Some of these actions concern preparedness and others concern the response 
to the event in the form of an emergency response plan. The latter is described in section 4.3, 
Drought action plan, which identifies the actors and the actions to be carried out. Section  4.2, 
Drought warning plan, covers the measures put in place to warn the population.

What measures should be implemented during and immediately after the event?
Who is responsible for what?
—
When a weather event affecting water assets occurs, various measures can be put in place to 
mitigate the impact on these assets, the functions they perform, and the population that benefits 
from them. These measures differ from those presented in Section 2, Prevention and adaptation, 
as they are measures implemented in the very short term, either during the event, when conditions 
permit, or immediately afterwards. These are included, among other things, in an emergency 
response plan that includes the roles and responsibilities of the authorities, as well as those of the 
actors responsible for water assets. The emergency response plan also includes how information 
is communicated internally, within the municipality, as well as externally, to inform the public about 
the situation and the role they can play in helping respond to the event.
The consequences of the hazard covered by this guidance sheet mainly affect drinking water assets.
Emergency response plan
A set of resources and procedures for a rapid response by operational intervention teams in the 
event of an emergency affecting water infrastructure service levels. These measures include 
resources that can be put in place to mitigate a short- or medium-term disruption (interruption or 
breakdown) in service. They can also include what residents should do to preserve their own safety 
during a major event affecting their quality of life. Often, the emergency response plan answers the 
question: Who does what?  This is about governance.
Alert and communication
Who needs to know about your municipality’s alert channel? What information should be 
communicated during a hazard event? These are examples of relevant questions that a municipality 
must answer in order to build an effective communication plan that will be used to complement the 
emergency response plan in the event of risks affecting water infrastructure service levels.

How can expected functions be recovered after the event?
Is reinforcement or adaptation work also required?
—
Various measures have been presented to prepare for and respond to an extreme event that 
disrupts a municipality’s water assets. However, resilience also depends on the implementation 
of resources and solutions to recover the functions lost, suspended or affected by the event under 
study. The faster a municipality is able to return its assets to normal operations, the more resilient 
it is. This involves not only implementing temporary measures, but also introducing practices that 
enable feedback on how the municipality reacted during the event in order to learn from it and 
adjust to better prepare for the next event.
Temporary measures planned to restore service
A set of measures to temporarily restore water asset functions that have been lost, suspended or 
altered by the hazard. These are short- and medium-term measures to be taken before the system 
can be restored to normal operation. 
Feedback on events for continuous improvement
With a view to continuous improvement and resilience to hazards that disrupt the operation of a 
municipality’s water assets, it is advisable to implement internal practices for reviewing the actions 
and resources put in place in response to a weather event. This will help identify the municipality’s 
strengths and weaknesses while targeting areas for improvement for future events.
Adjusting infrastructure design parameters
Feedback helps identify system deficiencies that could be corrected by upgrading design standards 
and parameters. (Next development to avoid repeating past mistakes.)

How can we close the gaps, address risks and adapt to them?

Proper management of municipal infrastructure requires a methodical approach to planning and 
decision-making. This approach is all the more important in the context of climate change. In 
addition to short- and medium-term solutions that can be implemented in response to an event, 
how can a municipality improve its long-term resilience by integrating measures into its asset 
management plan? High-level consideration of the approach is therefore needed to determine, 
among other things, how to characterize the risks that threaten a municipality and how to ensure 
that emergency and response plans are kept up to date. 
The risks to be considered can be identified in different ways:
Policy, strategic plan and action plan
These documents play an important role in asset management. Policies make it possible to 
monitor the application of certain measures, while informing the residents and stakeholders of 
the reasons for their application. The strategic plan enables planned management that includes 
the development and implementation of action plans and programs for asset creation, operation, 
maintenance, rehabilitation or replacement.
Project funding: identify necessary projects and advocate for funding 
In addition to policies, it is important to identify a funding plan for projects covered by the strategic 
asset management plan.
Monitoring and continuous improvement
In the context of climate change, it is appropriate to adopt living plans both to reflect the changing 
climate itself, but also to promote the continuous improvement of practices within a municipality.

A guide developed by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities addressing actions to improve 
climate change resilience within a municipality’s water asset management plan. Measures are 
presented, among others, to:
	
• Integrate climate change considerations into decision-making;
	
• Identify strategies to address gaps and risks due to climate change;
	
• Monitor progress and explore opportunities for continuous improvement.
A guide designed to support professionals in municipalities working to combat climate change in 
the broadest sense of the term. It addresses the role of municipalities, the hierarchical structures 
that need to be put in place to combat climate change, and the profitability of the projects to be 
implemented.
GMF is a program offered by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities that provides Quebec 
municipalities with funding and knowledge-sharing services to support sustainable community 
development. GMF-funded initiatives focus on cleaning up the air, water and soil, and reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
This program offers:
	
• Grants for the development of plans;
	
• Grants for feasibility studies, design studies and field tests;
	
• Loans at below-market interest rates, usually combined with grants, to implement capital 
projects.
