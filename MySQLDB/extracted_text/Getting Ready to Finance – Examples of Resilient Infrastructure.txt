Foreword
Climate change is getting costlier to Canadians and our economy, and beginning to disrupt 
health and quality of life. The impacts of the increasing frequency and severity of climate-
related events are set against Canada’s pre-existing infrastructure gap. In fact, the Federation 
of Canadian Municipalities estimates that adapting infrastructure just at the municipal level 
to avoid the worst impacts of climate change will require investment of $5.3 billion per 
year in Canada. While efforts to mitigate climate change are underway and expanding, with 
governments and businesses setting net-zero targets and ramping up investment to reduce 
emissions, investment in climate adaptation is lagging woefully behind the projected costs, 
which are poised to worsen over time. Importantly, even those mitigation investments are at risk 
if they are not themselves resilient to the changing conditions in the decades ahead.
Indeed, there can be no smooth transition to a net-zero future without enhancing resilience 
along the way. More investment is needed to help Canadian communities adapt to climate 
change. This is at the root of why Co-operators and its asset management arm, Addenda Capital, 
engaged with Canadian municipalities through ICLEI’s Financing Resilient Infrastructure Project.
Through this project, we aimed to understand barriers while also raising the art of the possible 
about the role private capital can play in building community resilience. Outputs from the 
rich dialogues that occurred through this work will support municipalities as they consider 
innovative approaches involving private finance, as a complement to public funding, in the spirit 
of accelerating and scaling the mission-critical work of building communities that are resilient to 
climate change.
Taking action to prepare for a changing climate is a priority for municipalities and towns across 
Canada. The latest science and recent experiences highlight the devastating risks climate 
change represents for our communities. While it is clear that resilience to these risks must 
be incorporated into planning and growth, this must be done in a way that is sustainable and 
financially viable.
How can this be achieved? Put simply, new and innovative financing approaches are needed to 
build resilience at the local level. Such approaches need to include mechanisms that can be used 
to acquire, structure, govern, and allocate financial resources towards resilient infrastructure. In 
addition, financial resources must come from a variety of sources including financial institutions, 
private investors, and institutional investors to support and complement traditional sources of 
public funding. The Financing Resilient Infrastructure Project (FRIP) brought together municipal 
practitioners, project developers, financial experts, and climate risk experts to explore practical 
strategies to put this approach into practice.
Through FRIP, municipal practitioners examined a range of possible projects that could be 
implemented in their communities and worked to identify possible financial instruments 
that could be used to finance their implementation. This document, Getting Ready to Finance: 
Examples of Resilient Infrastructure Projects, provides an overview of 22 projects that emerged 
from this work. These projects aim to address a variety of climate hazards across a range of 
infrastructure sectors.
Building resilient infrastructure at the pace and scale needed to address the climate
challenge requires innovation, agility, and new ways of thinking. It is our hope that these 
examples will inspire others to explore innovative ways to finance and implement resilient 
infrastructure projects in communities across the country. Together, we can build tomorrow’s 
infrastructure today.

Introduction
Financing 
Resilience
Despite the strong economic case for investing in climate adaptation, public funds 
are significantly limited. This challenge is particularly acute for municipalities which 
own and operate 60 percent of Canada’s public infrastructure, have limited capacity 
and revenue sources to address climate impacts, and are facing a large price tag 
for infrastructure adaptation. Given the accelerating changes in our climate and the 
multi-billion-dollar loss events recently experienced in communities across Canada, 
a whole-of-society approach is needed. Through a financing model where private 
investors work alongside all orders of government, municipalities can achieve the 
scale and speed of the resilient infrastructure construction required to withstand 
and recover from climate impacts. 
The effectiveness of this approach depends on the collaboration of municipal 
climate practitioners and financial experts. The opportunity to exchange insights on 
topics related to project feasibility and bankability (i.e., the unlocking of cash flows) 
and explore other finance-related questions is immensely valuable in the design 
and implementation of finance-ready infrastructure projects. This is exactly what a 
group of municipal practitioners from 10 communities across Canada and financial 
experts from both the public and private sectors did as part of the Financing 
Resilient Infrastructure Project (FRIP). Through FRIP, participating municipalities 
worked with financial experts to identify a suite of possible resilient infrastructure 
projects that private investors could help realize.

Getting Ready to Finance: Examples of Resilient Infrastructure Projects provides an 
overview of 22 projects identified through FRIP. While FRIP participants identified 
projects that could theoretically be implemented in their respective communities, 
they did not commit to implementation. Rather, the projects are meant showcase 
possible resilient infrastructure projects that address a range of climate hazards 
and could be implemented in any Canadian community. For this reason, the projects 
are grouped based on project type rather than location. Colours and icons are used 
throughout the resource to represent the types of resilient infrastructure projects 
and the climate hazards these would address.

Building
Upgrades
Project summary
The primary goal of this project would be to upgrade 
the existing mechanical systems to reduce the selected 
municipal buildings’ greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions by approximately 80 tonnes, decrease 
building energy use by 40%, and increase the buildings’ 
accessibility rating above the previous Rick Hansen 
Foundation Accessibility Certification score of 66%. 
This would involve upgrading the existing mechanical 
and electrical systems and installing new mechanical 
systems in the buildings. Mechanical systems include 
base building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. 
While some systems still have useful life remaining, they 
would be replaced to minimize GHG emissions. This 
project would also involve the implementation of energy-
efficient measures and heat pump cooling in municipally-
owned single-family homes that qualify based on 
income.
Energy Systems Resilience
Community outcomes
By retrofitting municipal and private buildings, the municipality would improve energy efficiency, 
add cooling, and improve air quality. The project would upgrade heating and cooling for public 
and income-qualified homes, prevent extreme heat- and cold-related diseases and health 
concerns, increase the efficiency of heating and cooling systems to save energy and
electricity, and reduce the operating costs of heating and cooling systems. This project would 
decrease GHG emissions linked to operating specific buildings. Additionally, it would improve 
community resilience to the impacts of climate change by providing cooling and heating to 
vulnerable populations. The selected buildings would also serve as public emergency comfort 
centers.
Intended beneficiaries
Municipality, municipal staff, residents, low-income 
homeowners, community visitors, youth, First Nations, 
seniors, and the broader community.
Possible sources of cash flows
Municipal grants (e.g., GICB, etc.) and heating and cooling 
user fees where possible.

Downtown District 
Energy 
Project summary
This project would involve using district energy (DE) in the municipal Downtown area. DE 
is known as an efficient building heating and cooling system which consists of three main 
components: (1) a central plant that produces thermal energy (i.e., hot and cold water); 
(2) an underground network of pipes that distribute the hot and cold water to individual 
buildings; and (3) an energy transfer station at each building to connect them to the DE 
system. This project would span the first phase of the development and construction of 
a DE system. This would include incorporating DE into three municipal buildings in the 
Downtown area and buildings on the local college campus.
Municipality, any buildings connected to the 
DE system, building users, and the general 
community.
Heating and cooling user fees could be the main 
sources of revenue for this project. Various 
ownership models could also be explored.

Community outcomes
Once implemented, the district energy system would be expected to yield numerous 
benefits. Its development would contribute to a decrease in greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions from energy production, thanks to increased efficiencies, centralized energy 
production, and the use of renewable energy as the main fuel source. DE systems 
enhance community resilience as they can largely rely on local energy and fuel sources 
(e.g., geothermal), which decreases a community’s reliance on external fuel sources. At 
the same time, the central plant typically include a back-up, increasing the resiliency and 
reliability of the system. The system also delivers thermal energy through underground 
pipes. This means that the system is more resilient to extreme weather events like ice and 
wind storms.

Emergency Centre
Microgrid
Project summary
The objective of this project would be to design and build a solar microgrid specifically 
tailored to supply power to an emergency center located in a municipally owned arena 
during extended power outages and extreme weather events. The core mission would 
be to provide critical assistance to the most vulnerable residents during emergencies
by offering safe shelter, enhancing energy resilience, and fostering independence. 
The enduring benefits of providing critical assistance to vulnerable residents during 
emergencies would include improvements in both physical and mental well-being.
Municipality, vulnerable residents during 
emergency events, local businesses, essential 
service providers, visitors to the city, and the 
broader community.
Energy generation through the solar microgrid 
has the potential to generate revenue.
Community outcomes
A functional emergency centre ensures the safety and well-being of vulnerable 
populations and allows access to essential services during extended power outages 
and extreme weather events. This project would enhance public safety, increase access 
to medical supplies and essential resources, reduce greenhouse gas emissions emitted 
from the building as the microgrid would be powered by renewable energy, and 
increase energy efficiency of the centre. Implementation of this microgrid would also 
enhance the resiliency of the surrounding community, create a more reliable electricity 
output, and reduce stress and workload of emergency service providers.

Building Rainwater 
Retention (Blue
Roofs)
Project summary
Blue roofs are a sustainable stormwater management 
solution engineered to effectively store and control 
rainwater on building rooftops. They serve as temporary 
reservoirs, releasing retained rainwater into stormwater 
systems after rainfall events. These innovative systems 
yield a host of advantages primarily centered around 
the management of stormwater runoff in urban areas. 
By mitigating runoff, they play a pivotal role in curbing 
flood risks and decreasing the need for water treatment 
such as cleaning and chlorination. As a whole, they 
contribute to both the environmental sustainability and 
the resilience of water sources.
Flood Resilience
Intended beneficiaries
Municipality, flood-affected residential, commercial, and 
municipal infrastructure, businesses, and the broader 
community.
Possible sources of cash flows
Directly from the resiliency infrastructure through 
insurance premium benefits. Indirectly from the 
infrastructure but dependent on it through monthly/ 
annual stormwater charges.

Community outcomes
It is expected that the installation of blue roofs would mitigate flooding within flood- prone 
neighbourhoods and prevent infrastructure damage, transportation interruptions, displacement, 
and flood-related health impacts. Using blue roofs as a proactive flood mitigation measure 
would also reduce costs from repair and restoration typically necessary after flood events.

Possible sources of cash flows
A PACE-style program could provide 
participating homeowners with very low 
interest rates loans to implement the suggested 
renovations from their evaluation. The 
interests could be kept in this specific fund and 
reinvested.
Project summary
This project would develop and operationalize a residential flood resiliency home 
assessment process to allow residents located in flood-prone areas to identify how their
homes might be vulnerable to water damage. A home assessment of about 50 residences 
would be carried out with certified home inspectors to identify these vulnerabilities. 
The results would be provided to the participating homeowner in the form of a curated 
report that includes various adaptation strategies and how to implement these. Through 
the assessment process, the municipality would also have the chance to gain a better 
understanding of the most prevalent weaknesses found in local homes, the cost of 
adaptation strategies, and whether flood resilience home assessments should become a 
permanent municipal program. The provincial government would be able to use findings 
shared by the municipality to support the reassessment of flood plains regulations.
Community outcomes
Social benefits would include increasing citizens’ flood risk awareness, preparedness,
and resilience. Citizens would also gain knowledge of financial programs available at
various government levels, thus reducing impacts on household and community
healthcare. Once implemented, the adaptation strategies recommended in the flood
resiliency home assessment reports would help reduce flood costs at the household level and 
better control insurance cost as well as insurance availability in concerned neighbourhoods. 
Environmental outcomes would include reducing the amount of post-flood construction 
materials in landfills and decreasing contaminants in the water and soil from hazardous 
materials. The flood-risk adaptation strategies could also consider GHG emissions reduction, 
therefore supporting climate change mitigation.

Possible sources of cash flows
Dedicated drainage levy/utility fees funded
through monthly/annual taxation, development
cost charges (DCCs), drainage levies, and
insurance premium reductions and costs.
Project summary
Through a multi-faceted approach, this project would enhance engineered and natural 
assets in a coordinated way to manage stormwater for future climate scenarios and reduce 
flooding risks. This would include upgrading storm sewers to increase capacity, restoring 
stream habitats and daylighting culverted streams, and integrating green infrastructure 
solutions in the municipality’s centre. The primary focus would be to implement flooding 
control measures, bioswales, rain gardens, and erosion mitigation all of which play a crucial 
role in protecting watershed health including important aquatic habitat. Furthermore, 
essential infrastructure upgrades would be completed to accommodate updated Intensity-
Duration-Frequency (IDF) curve flows that describe the likelihood of a range of extreme 
rainfall events driven by the challenges of climate change. 
Community outcomes
This project would preserve and enhance natural ecosystems and municipal infrastructure 
against the impacts of a changing climate. Additionally, the project would improve the 
economic resilience of the community, particularly small businesses, and reduce the 
chance of property damages and impacts from overland flooding. There would also be co-
benefits with the green infrastructure relating to heat island effects, shade, human health, 
well-being, and air quality. This project would improve access to active transportation and 
recreation options in rainy conditions, improve drainage, increase safety, ameliorate bank 
stability, and decrease erosion potential.

low-income households, and the broader 
community. Certain vulnerable groups such as 
the elderly and people with mobility challenges 
may especially benefit.
Climate hazards addressed
Possible sources of cash flows
Municipal taxes and fees.
Project summary
Due to a high groundwater table and minimal grade from developed areas to water bodies,
traditional piped stormwater collection systems do not exist in part of the community.
Instead, stormwater runoff is injected into an unconfined aquifer which is also used as a
source of potable water. This approach results in a risk of source water contamination and
can lead to localized pluvial flooding in high intensity rain events. This project would involve
conducting a comprehensive community assessment to identify areas where the existing
storm infrastructure is inadequate.
Community outcomes
Using green stormwater infrastructure would provide additional stormwater capacity 
and would reduce the severity of flooding during high intensity rain events by absorbing 
peak rainfall in a distributed fashion. Green stormwater infrastructure would also 
remove pollutants from stormwater runoff, protecting the municipality’s source water. 
Implementing a suite of green stormwater infrastructure retrofits would improve 
stormwater quality management, reduce localized pluvial flooding, mitigate for urban 
heat island, increase biodiversity and habitat connectivity, and improve well-being and 
mental health.

Project summary
This project would develop a dual-purpose soccer field and skatepark combined with
the use of the area as green space during the dry season — an innovative approach
to community development. In times of flooding, this versatile area would transform
into a vital water retention zone to mitigate potential flood risks. This project would be
strategically designed to achieve comprehensive benefits to the entire community with
a particular focus on neighbourhoods susceptible to flooding. By providing recreational
amenities during fair weather and flood resilience during inclement conditions, this 
project would exemplify how forward-thinking initiatives like this one can enhance 
community wellbeing and safety.
Community outcomes
During the dry season, this green space would function as a soccer field and skatepark 
and, during the wet season and flood events, it would function as a water retention area. 
By providing recreational amenities for the community, the space would increase physical, 
mental, and social well-being of individuals. It would also increase flood resilience during 
inclement conditions and play a pivotal role in curbing flood risks. The water retention
pond functionality would prevent flooding that would otherwise potentially destroy
infrastructure, housing, and put the community’s health and safety in harm’s way. By 
diverting excess water, it would mitigate flooding while also providing dynamic green and 
blue space for the community leading to community engagement and interest.

Project summary
This project would involve identifying buildings that are suitable for relocation within a 
flood zone. These relocations would enable the restoration of the watercourse’s freedom 
of movement. The buildings targeted by this project are those at very high risk of
flooding whose relocation would allow private land on the riverbank to become public 
land. The project would focus on flooding protection, maintenance of safe access 
to houses, and the ecological revitalization of the area. Wetland restoration and the 
creation of an urban park accessible to citizens would also be included in this project. 
Additionally, a dike would be built further downstream to maintain the protection of 
nonexpropriated residences.
Community outcomes
These permanent relocation measures would greatly reduce the stress on citizens and 
municipal employees. Reducing the vulnerability of local residents to flooding would 
greatly reduce the time, effort, and expenses required in the long term to protect 
their assets. This would also be an important improvement for the protection of the 
community’s mental and physical wellbeing. Additionally, this would be an opportunity to 
improve access to public green spaces and present an opportunity to implement green 
infrastructure for stormwater management which would benefit citizens beyond the 
immediate intervention area.

Project summary
The renewal of municipal stormwater infrastructure in key areas is important in light
of climate change impacts and related challenges. With the increasing frequency and
intensity of heavy rainfall events due to climate change, addressing inundation issues is
of paramount importance, particularly for certain neighbourhoods. This infrastructure
renewal project would not only mitigate flooding concerns from increasingly frequent
heavy rainfall events but would also contribute significantly to enhancing the
municipality’s overall resilience in the face of changing weather patterns. By effectively
managing stormwater, the municipality would not only protect property and public
safety but also reduce the environmental impact of runoff, ultimately creating a more
sustainable and resilient urban environment for current and future generations.
Community outcomes
Infrastructure upgrades would increase the capacity of the municipal storm sewer system
to withstand increased flows and create safe routes for runoff. It would also help ensure
the health and safety of vulnerable residents during and after extreme rainfall events. 
Once completed, people living or working in the area targeted by this project would be
less exposed to the risk of pluvial flooding, emergency service routes would be protected
from disruption, impacts to health and safety concerns (e.g., ponding water, sewer 
backup) would be reduced, significant economic activity disruptions would be minimized, 
and costs due to damage would be avoided.

Climate hazards addressed
Possible sources of cash flows
Existing stormwater utility fee and local 
improvement charges could be implemented
if improvements are clustered in one area using 
a eighbourhood-by-neighbourhood approach, 
or if enhanced stormwater management
systems are introduced in new developments.
Project summary
This surface flood mitigation initiative would substantially lower flooding risks by
implementing measures to improve the stormwater management system as a whole. This 
would involve above-ground measures that slow overland runoff into the stormwater 
system, thereby reducing the peak flow and increasing the level of storm that the system 
can handle without backup or flood. These measures would also manage the flow of 
water across the urban landscape and reduce hazards caused by flooding or ponding 
in low-lying areas. In some cases, an additional benefit would include stormwater reuse 
where water is stored and used on site. Measures could include bioswales, improved and 
vegetated drainage ditches, rain gardens, low impact design (e.g., increased permeable 
surfaces), naturalized dry ponds, culverts, and native plantings. The project would add 
natural assets to an existing structural system.
Community outcomes
Surface flood mitigation and stormwater management places a strong emphasis on
addressing the most vulnerable flood-prone areas of the municipality which typically 
consist of older neighbourhoods, and neighbourhoods that possess underground storm

Climate-Resilient
Roads
Project summary
This three-phase project would make the municipality’s 
road network more resilient to climate change 
hazards. Prioritized projects would be involved to 
adapt existing neighbourhoods to climate hazards 
such as flooding, sea level rise, storm surge, and
wildfires. The first phase would use stormwater 
management to reduce roadway flooding during high 
intensity rainfall events. The second phase would 
involve relocating a coastal road that also acts as 
emergency access for a neighbourhood. The final 
phase would involve creating new egress roads for two 
neighbourhoods affected by wildfires. Overall,
the project would improve the safety of residents by 
upgrading road infrastructure in order to maintain 
egress and evacuation routes during high intensity 
rainfall events, wildfire, or other climate-related 
emergencies.
Resilient Community Planning
Intended beneficiaries
Municipality, local residents and road users, emergency 
management/services.
Possible sources of cash flows
Insurance premium reductions for local residents.
Climate hazards addressed
Community outcomes
It is expected that each of the three phases of the project would have a variety of benefits
that would improve the health and safety of the broader community. Phase one would
mitigate conditions of the roadway to better maintain evacuation routes during high
intensity rainfall events or other climate-related emergencies. Phase two would maintain
egress and evacuation routes during extreme storm surge and wave run-up events. And phase
three would provide additional egress during emergency events such as wildfires. All three
phases of the project would achieve safer and faster evacuations for all neighbourhoods
involved and decrease risks from climate hazards.

Possible sources of cash flows
User fees with a range of ~$30-60 per month, 
insurance premium benefits, and various grant 
options.
Project summary
This project would involve building a multifunctional facility that would play a pivotal
role in both emergency response relief and year-round recreation services for residents,
especially vulnerable populations. This versatile hub would function as a population
displacement facility, offering essential services such as warming and cooling centers,
along with its primary role as a year-round multi-use recreation center. Equipped with
hydration stations, it would ensure that the community has access to critical resources
during times of crisis while also promoting recreational activities and overall well-being
throughout the year.
Community outcomes
The creation of a disaster management hub would serve as a multifunctional facility. It 
would offer essential services such as warming and cooling centers to displaced

community.
Climate hazards addressed
Possible sources of cash flows
Sources may include provincial funding and 
taxation, and increasing property values and 
taxes around the new multi-use pathways.
Project summary
The project would involve the use of active transportation infrastructure as emergency 
exit routes during extreme weather events, flooding, or wildfires. These emergency exits 
would serve neighbourhoods that currently only have one access/ egress point. The 
project would have numerous potential benefits — beyond ensuring the safety and well-
being of residents’, this project presents a significant opportunity for reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions through a transportation modal shift. It would also increase resident’s 
physical fitness, mental well-being, and overall public health while promoting
sustainability, resilience, and the overall quality of life within the community.
Community outcomes
The new multi-use paths would improve the resilience of the municipality by enhancing 
public safety during extreme weather events. They would also have a strong climate 
mitigation and public health benefit. The paths would increase the length of the 
municipality’s active transportation network and provide new links to neighbourhoods, 
thereby reducing vehicle dependance. They would also improve and promote active 
urban mobility, provide potential mental and physical health benefits to residents, reduce 
vehicular traffic and associated greenhouse gas emissions, and improve air quality.

Snow Management
Upgrades
Intended beneficiaries
Municipality, critical infrastructure including
hospitals and emergency services, residents
and property owners in neighbourhoods
surrounding the existing snow storage site, and
the broader community.
Climate hazards addressed
Possible sources of cash flows
Service fees for private contractors using
the site, development charges for future
development near the site, and traditional grant
funding or operating funds.
Project summary
This project would relocate the municipality’s snow storage site away from a natural
wetland which is a sensitive ecosystem that contains a species of concern. Relocation of
the snow storage site would allow the municipality to restore the wetland area, reduce
the pollutants in this sensitive area, increase biodiversity, and provide valuable ecosystem
services. Simultaneously, the project would include the construction of a dedicated snow
management facility situated off-site. This purpose-built snow management facility would
employ engineered controls to ensure salts and contaminants from melting snow are
managed to reduce adverse effects to the surrounding environment.
Community outcomes
This proactive approach to snow management would not only mitigate environmental
impacts such as pollutant runoff and ecosystem service decline, but would also 
significantly enhance the municipality’s capability to manage snow effectively as large-
scale snow events are expected to increase due to climate change. In turn, this would 
ensure the well-being of both the community and the environment. The project would 
also reduce costs associated with snow removal services, business interruptions, and 
increase the resilience of the community and city operations during severe winter storms.

Housing and Fire
Station
Project summary
This project would involve constructing affordable 
housing units designed with climate resilience at the 
forefront. The architectural approach used would 
embrace the principles of passive house design 
featuring robust insulation, well-planned window 
orientation, thoughtfully landscaping for shade and 
efficient stormwater management, and the integration 
of heat pumps for cooling. The municipality could also 
bundle this initiative with a fire station project by co-
locating the two projects. The same approach could be 
used to incorporate climate resilience benefits in the 
design and construction of both buildings. In addition, 
locating the fire station with affordable housing and 
other organizations would support densification and 
maximize use of city land. The project would primarily 
focus on structural elements while incorporating 
functional natural features.
Resilient Development
Possible sources of cash flows
Development levies could be implemented to prepare 
services for each site. The municipality could also explore 
large onsite rainwater storage, as well as tax increment 
financing at a larger scale (legislation would need to be 
enacted).
Climate hazards addressed
Community outcomes
This project would increase the availability of affordable housing in the municipality while 
providing climate-resilient housing that addresses expected hazards of extreme heat, air quality, 
flooding, and severe storms. It would also demonstrate climate-resilient building practices for 
housing and municipal buildings. Moreover, the project would increase community safety by 
improving the ability of emergency services to continue to function during and after extreme 
weather events.

Project summary
This project would involve developing a resilient innovation eco-district in order to 
take advantage of the strategic location and exceptional assets of a municipal site. This 
site would be adapted to the urban realities of the 21st century through mixed-use 
development with a low carbon footprint. Companies, research groups, start-ups, and 
local service providers would share the space with high-density residential buildings. The 
development would be structured around a vast regional park and a network of
pedestrian-friendly public spaces that would place humans and nature at the heart of the 
design approach. The municipality would also use a smart energy grid.
Community outcomes
Addressing the urban heat island phenomenon with natural infrastructure would reduce
the local population’s sensitivity and vulnerability to climate events such as heat waves. 
The stormwater management aspect would reduce risk of urban flooding, protect the 
community’s natural water assets from contamination, and also protect commercial and 
residential properties. Development of green infrastructure would improve air quality, 
increase resilience of natural habitats, improve the quality of life for residents, workers, 
and visitors, and provide public health benefits. This project would also increase land 
value and revenues for the municipality, create socioeconomic innovation, and showcase 
innovation of onsite research and development.

Flood Protection of
Wastewater
Treatment Plant
Project summary
Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTP) are critical for 
community wastewater services. The primary objective of 
this project would be to construct a protective berm around 
the municipal WWTP by elevating the access road encircling 
both the WWTP and the waste management centre. This 
would address heightened flood risks due to climate 
change and intensifying weather extremes and the threat 
of erosion from the river encroaching upon the facility.
Water and Wastewater Systems Resilience
Intended beneficiaries
Municipality, community members relying on the WWTP 
for essential sanitation services, local businesses, tourists 
and visitors to the Town, neighbouring municipalities that 
also rely on this WWTP and the surrounding ecosystems.
Possible sources of cash flows
Municipal taxes, grant funding, and utility fee 
opportunities. A resilience surcharge could also possibly be 
added to the water utility bill and private sector cash flow 
opportunities can be researched.
Climate hazards addressed
Community outcomes
Protecting the WWTP is paramount for ensuring consistent community services, preserving 
ecological health, and safeguarding the municipality’s economic interests particularly for 
residents and businesses. In doing so, this project would increase resiliency of critical 
infrastructure during a river flood, and/or a creek flood, minimize risk of flooding in part of the 
municipality, minimize risk of wastewater service disruption during and after flood events, and 
minimize risk of riverbank erosion during high flow events.

Lake Dam 
Stabilization
and Spillway
Project summary
This project would stabilize a drinking water reservoir dam and spillway. Dams that were
designed to be stable for historic climate and related weather events may be inadequate
for the more frequent and intense storm events caused by climate change. Potential dam 
instability can pose a risk not only to municipal drinking water supply but also to residents, 
ecosystems, and infrastructure on the downstream side of the dam in the event of a failure. 
To allow water levels to be managed in the event of a large volume single rain event, rapid 
snow melt, or a series of closely spaced rainfall events, the spillway of the dam would be 
redesigned and rebuilt. A hydro turbine could also be incorporated into this redesign to 
capture the energy potential from water exiting the reservoir through the spillway.
Community outcomes
Once the dam is stabilized and the spillway redesigned, the potential threat of a 
catastrophic dam failure, ecosystem degradation, and public safety hazards would be 
significantly reduced. By enhancing the dam’s resilience, the project would also ensure 
consistent water supply. Potential dam failure or disruption in water supply could lead to 
significant economic losses, ranging from business disruptions to potential loss in
property values. With the dam’s stabilization, these potential economic pitfalls would effectively 
be negated. Electrical generation could be used to offset the impacts of electrical consumption, 
GHG emissions, and expenses of the project.

Fire-Resistant
Metal Roofs
Project summary
This project would involve collaborating with the 
province to encourage smarter reconstruction efforts 
following wildfires within the municipality which 
recently destroyed over 100 homes. This would include 
initiatives such as the widespread adoption of metal
roofing systems to safeguard against fires, the 
establishment of a buyout program designed to 
facilitate managed retreats in high-risk wildfires 
regions and floodplains, and the active promotion of 
guidelines inspired by FireSmart principles. Ideally, 
this project should be completed in advance of future 
wildfires and while rebuilding is taking place as 
opposed to installing a metal roof as a retrofit in a few 
years, which would be more expensive.
Wildfire Resilience
Intended beneficiaries
Municipality, local residents and neighbourhoods, 
emergency management operations, and emergency 
services.
Possible sources of cash flows
Local Improvement Charges (LICs), insurance premium 
reductions for local residents, and a climate action tax.
Climate hazards addressed
Community outcomes
Incorporating protective measures in line with the recommendations put forth by FireSmart
Canada would significantly enhance the survivability and resilience of various structures.
Incorporating metal roofing systems in reconstruction would lessen the spread of wildfires,
decrease the destruction of infrastructure and buildings, and improve the health and safety of
vulnerable populations. FireSmart would also help residents learn about ways to reduce the
impact of a wildfire on their home and a buyout program would facilitate managed retreats
in high-risk wildfire regions and floodplains to further reduce impacts on infrastructure,
health, and essential services. As a whole, this project would improve the resilience of the
municipality and mitigate GHG emissions through preventable means.

where possible.
Project summary
The project would enhance community resilience against wildfire risk by fortifying critical
buildings through FireSmart measures, establishing backup power for two recreation
centres and five pump stations, as well as launching a community incentive program
to promote FireSmart implementation on private properties. Through these proactive
initiatives, the municipality would become a safer and more resilient community in the 
face of wildfire threats.
Community outcomes
The results of this project would allow residents to implement FireSmart measures 
on their properties, making them more resilient to wildfire risks. The program would 
empower residents to “help themselves” in the case of a wildfire. This project would also 
ensure the municipality has the backup power supply needed to house residents and
provide water as well as fire suppression services during emergencies. Fortifying
critical municipal infrastructure would support the community by providing them
with a safe place to shelter and access to water and would lessen cleanup costs in
the case of a catastrophic wildfire. Having fortified critical infrastructure would also
help the community bounce back quicker after emergencies.

Project summary
This project would create a climate resilient wildland urban interface area to help 
mitigate climate risks using a low carbon resiliency approach. It would also support the 
goals of the municipality’s recently adopted Urban Forest Management Strategy and the 
implementation of the municipality’s existing Community Wildfire Protection Plan by 
implementing fuel treatment. The scope of this project would involve the removal of some 
trees and excess woody debris identified as high fuel loads. It would also address hazard 
trees and areas of potential windthrow, transforming these into resilient interface zones 
characterized by healthy urban forests, high biodiversity, and enhanced wildfire resiliency. 
The primary focus would be on reducing wildfire risk in urban and natural forest stands 
adjacent to urban neighbhourhoods and implementing stand conversions, invasive plant 
management, and natural restoration plantings to create a more robust and climate 
resilient forest ecosystem.
Community outcomes
This project would preserve the natural ecosystems and biodiversity values as well as 
protect public safety and infrastructure against climate change impacts with a focus on 
wildfire hazard. The project would have additional benefits associated with increasing 
economic resilience of the community (particularly for homes and businesses) and reducing 
the chance of residential property damage. This project would mitigate wildlife risk, 
increase slope and bank stability for post-fire recovery, and decrease erosion potential. 
There would also be many co-benefits including mitigating heat island effects, providing shade, 
improving air quality, increasing safety, and improving human health and wellbeing.
