Introduction: Assessing the psychological impact of climate change is of crucial importance as it is widely rec-
ognized that human mental health is negatively affected by changing weather patterns. Worry about climate
change is commonly used as a measure of risk perception, and includes concepts such as concern, perceived
seriousness, and perceived risk. In order to better evaluate the levels of climate change worry, Alan E. Stewart
developed the Climate Change Worry Scale (CCWS).
Methods: The aim of the present study was to validate Stewart’s CCWS in Italy. To this purpose, CCWS was
translated into Italian and its psychometric properties were tested on a sample of 130 Italian adults who
were required to complete the CCWS, as well as other standards of measurement, such as the Depression
Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS), Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ), New Ecological Paradigm (NEP), Pro-
Environmental Behaviours Scale (PEBS) and Climate Change Anxiety Scale (CCAS). Patients were retested
after three months. In this study, Stewart's original single-factor scale was used. Additionally, internal consis-
tency, test-retest reliability, and discriminant validity were speciﬁcally analysed.
Results: Factor structure of CCWS was investigated, and a Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) showed a good
ﬁt for the single-factor model. Climate Change Worry Scale items exhibited excellent internal consistency.
Test-retest reliability at a three-month evaluation proved to be good. Climate change worry was associated
with concern, climate change anxiety, pro-environmental behaviors and political orientation.
Conclusions: The Italian version of the Climate Change Worry Scale is a valid and reliable tool to assess climate
change worry in the general population.

1. Introduction
Extreme weather events due to climate change are occurring all
over the planet with serious direct and indirect consequences on the
environment [1] and on mental [2,3,4] and general human health [5].
The American Psychological Association (APA) recognizes that cli-
mate change can lead to mental health issues such as an increase in
the incidence of stress, depression, and anxiety [6]. Climate change,
perceived as an aversive stimulus, may also enhance strongly nega-
tive emotional experiences [6,7].
Anxiety is activated whenever potential future events are per-
ceived as threats. It determines a high degree of somatic activation
which is useful for generating an adaptive response to the threaten-
ing stimuli [8]. Anxiety is usually associated with somatic alterations,
autonomic arousal, and modiﬁcation of cognitive processes, such as
worry [8]. Worry is a common cognitive effect of climate change and
is a common symptom of most of the emotional disorders associated
with climate change, such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) [6,9]. Worry is deﬁned as “a chain of thoughts
and images, negatively affect-laden and relatively uncontrollable."
However it also can trigger an "attempt to engage in mental prob-
lem-solving on an issue whose outcome is uncertain", and healthy
people can feel worried without experiencing associated anxiety or
depression [10].
Worry can be classiﬁed in two ways: adaptive and maladaptive.
Adaptive worry is deﬁned as a functional cognitive process, as a chain
of thoughts directed at solving a potential problem or threat, while
maladaptive worry is when the process becomes excessive, persis-
tent, and ineffective in solving the problem for which it has been acti-
vated [11,12]. Extreme levels of worry are associated with poorer
mental and physical health [13].
Worry about climate change generally may be intended as an
adaptive process, because it drives ﬁnding a strategy to act against
the consequences of climate change, but whether climate change

worry is adaptive depends on its intensity and if it activates excessive
negative emotions [14]. Solutions for climate change are hard to
develop and implement, and evidently, they are slow to be put into
practice and their use is often hindered by political and economic
interests. Due to the lack of implementation of large-scale climate
change solutions, worry about climate change may therefore become
chronic and maladaptive, thus leading to anxiety and/or depression
[14]. It is important to note that climate change anxiety differs from
general anxiety in that it is not deﬁned as a mental disorder and is
not included in DSM-V. Stewart’s CCWS does not take into consider-
ation Clayton’s climate change anxiety scale (CCAS), which had not
yet been developed when Stewart started his work on CCWS. In the
absence of this speciﬁc measure, Stewart used DASS, the Fear of
Weather Scale (FOWS) and the Storm Fear Questionnaire (SFQ) to val-
idate his scale. In this study CCAS, a measure of anxiety speciﬁcally
associated with climate change, was used alongside DASS, a general
anxiety measure, to form our hypothesis. The concept of worry is also
closely connected to the personal goals, preferences and behaviors of
different individuals [14]. Moreover, personal feelings of worry about
climate change are associated with higher levels of support for public
actions on global warming [15]. It is well known that political orien-
tation is highly predictive of climate change worry [16,17]. Several
studies have conﬁrmed this view and highlighted the necessity of
promoting climate change mitigation and adaptation policies [18,19].
Bouman and colleagues [14] stated that “worry about climate change
can play an important role in motivating individuals to support spe-
ciﬁc climate policies and to undertake personal behaviours to miti-
gate climate change.” Therefore, worry about climate change is the
preferred indicator if the goal is to understand the association
between environmental emotions and behavior and/or policy sup-
port [20].
In light of these considerations, measuring worry is extremely
useful in assessing the emotional response to climate change, which
is why it is fundamental for this study to use a standard measure of
Climate Change Worry. Alan E. Stewart [21] validated a speciﬁc self-
report questionnaire for measuring worry related to climate change:
the Climate Change Worry Scale (CCWS). Given the lack of an Italian
validation of the CCWS, the aim of this study was, in addition to
translating the scale into Italian, to verify the psychometric proper-
ties of the Italian version of the CCWS in a healthy sample of 130 indi-
viduals. Internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and discriminant
validity were speciﬁcally addressed.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Participants and procedure
2.1.1. Italian adaptation of the CCWS
Two English native speakers independently translated the original
English CCWS items into Italian and resolved any potential disagree-
ments in discussion. Two Italian native speakers with proﬁcient
knowledge of English checked the translation. All items of the Italian
version were then back-translated into English by two additional
researchers who were not aware of the original scale. After the three
stages of translations, corrections, and adjustments, the ﬁnal wording
of the Italian adaptation of the CCSW was determined.
In the translation of the scale, excessively complicated terms have
been replaced by simpler syntax. No adaptations were made for spe-
ciﬁc Italian dialects because, although there are many different dia-
lects in Italy, the Italian language is well understood by the majority
of the population.
The questions of the original CCSW were clear and simple; there-
fore, minimal adjustments were made during translation. For exam-
ple, with regard to question number seven, “I worry that I might not
be able to cope with climate change”, the correct translation of the
verb "to cope" in Italian corresponds to an extremely speciﬁc term,
which may not be understood by the general population. Therefore,
the Italian verb meaning “to face” was used instead, in order to make
the question easier for everyone to understand.
2.1.2. Sample size
In his validation scale study, Stewart relied on a sample of 600
participants. We opted to follow Nunnally, who recommends an ideal
ratio of ten respondents per scale item [22]. As a result, our a priori
targeted sample size was at least 130 participants [23].
2.1.3. Participants
Participants were recruited using convenience and snowball sam-
pling methods, provided they met the following inclusion criteria:
age between 18-80 years, Italian nationality, and Italian residency.
The exclusion criteria included: illiteracy, inability to provide con-
sent, or inability to complete the survey online. On the basis of the
methodology adopted, a set of 45 participants was initially selected
to reduce selection bias associated with the non-probabilistic sam-
pling method. The ﬁrst subjects were selected by sharing the research
protocol in university social spaces. Each participant was then asked
to choose ﬁve individuals and send them the questionnaire. This
recruitment procedure was carried out until data saturation was
achieved.
In total, 174 Italian adults (65.3% female, 34.7% male, aged 18-77
years) were recruited after providing informed consent. The follow-
ing demographic and socio-economic data were collected: age, gen-
der, marital status, education, profession. 130 participants correctly
completed the survey, 30 participants did not complete the survey,
and 14 missed at least one response and were excluded from the
study. Another 60 participants who had correctly completed the sur-
vey were retested after three months in order to verify the stability
of the construct of climate change worry over time. A long-term
retest interval was chosen to avoid bias due to short term retest
interval (e.g., participants remembering the answers, motivational
factors). The ﬁnal sample consisted of 130 participants. Data were
collected from January to June 2021. The Google Forms platform was
used for data collection. The study protocol was approved by the local
Institution Ethics Committee.
2.2. Current study
For the purpose of this study, Stewart’s Climate Change Worry
Scale was translated into Italian, and its psychometric properties
were tested on a sample of Italian individuals in order to validate its
use in Italy. Currently, Clayton’s Climate Change Anxiety Scale, the
only validated measure of climate change distress in Italy, is the most
commonly used measure to evaluate the psychological effects of cli-
mate change. However, it is crucial also to evaluate levels of climate
change worry, as literature shows a positive relationship between
constructive climate worry and environmentally friendly behavior.
The results of previous studies revealed that, while anxiety is gener-
ally correlated with negative emotional responses, worry triggers
behavioral responses and a potential increase in pro-environmental
attitudes [14,24].
2.2.1. Summary of hypotheses
The study assessed the following hypotheses:
1. It was hypothesised that climate change worry could be positively
correlated with anxiety about climate change, measured through
the Climate Change Anxiety Scale (CCAS), because existing litera-
ture demonstrates that worry is the cognitive correlate of anxiety
[25]. As stated by Verplanken, “When worrying becomes a domi-
nant feature of the mind, and occurs repetitively and persistently,
it may become dysfunctional, and may be a symptom of deeper-

2
seated pathological conditions, such as generalised anxiety disor-
der” [24,26,27].
2. No correlation was hypothesised between CCWS and anxiety and
depression symptoms, measured through the DASS-21 subscales.
This was based on Stewart’s validation study which examined all
of the DASS-21 subscales and showed that “only the DASS stress
subscale exhibited the most robust correlation with climate
change worry” [21,28]. In fact, even though Stewart found a corre-
lation between CCWS and both the DASS-21 anxiety and depres-
sion subscales, control for the DASS-21 stress subscale was not
statistically signiﬁcant. By contrast, the correlation between the
CCWS and DASS-21 stress subscale remained signiﬁcant even
after controlling for the DASS-21 anxiety subscale and DASS-21
depression subscale [21].
3. It was hypothesised that subjects with higher levels of Climate
Change Worry might be better informed about climate change
issues based on evidence provided by relevant literature of a posi-
tive correlation between information about climate change and
climate-change-related psychopathology [31].
4. It was hypothesised that Climate Change Worry would positively
correlate with Pro-Environmental Behaviours (measured using
the Pro-Environmental Behaviours Scale, PEBS) and with an
environmentally sustainable lifestyle (measured using the New
Environmental Paradigm - New Social Paradigm subscale, NEP-
NSP), as it has been demonstrated that individuals with worry
related to climate change are more prone to implement pro-envi-
ronmental behaviors and to behave in an eco-friendly manner
[24,29,30].
5. Based on hypothesis 4, it was hypothesised that Climate Change
Worry would negatively correlate with a measure of an environ-
mentally unsustainable lifestyle (measured using the New Envi-
ronmental Paradigm −Dominant Social Paradigm subscale, NEP-
DSP).
6. It was hypothesised that Climate Change Worry would have a
positive correlation with political orientation based on the ﬁnd-
ings of previous literature, according to which individuals with
psychopathological conditions related to climate change, and
with worry about climate change, are more likely to support polit-
ical policies that address climate change-related issues [32,33].
7. It was hypothesised that participants with higher levels of Climate
Change Worry might be better informed about climate change
issues, as a positive correlation between information about cli-
mate change and climate change-related psychopathology has
been found in the literature [31].
2.3. Instruments
2.3.1. Penn State Worry Questionnaire
The Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) [34] is a self-report
questionnaire, created with the purpose of measuring worry. It is
widely used for assessing generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) and
other disorders affected by worry, and it is composed of 16 items
rated from 1 (= “not at all typical of me”) to 5 (= “very typical of me”).
The PSWQ shows a high level of internal consistency (a = .95) and
high level of test-retest reliability (r = .93) [34].
The scale has been validated in Italian with similar psychometric
characteristics [35].
2.3.2. The New Ecological Paradigm Scale-Revised
The New Ecological Paradigm Scale-Revised (NEP-R) [36] is an
updated version of the New Ecological Paradigm Survey [37] used to
measure personal attitude, beliefs and values about environmental
protection [36].
The NEP-R consists of 15 Likert items presented as statements
with which respondents must express their degree of agreement
from 1 (= “strongly agree”) to 6 (= “strongly disagree”).
The NEP-R presents a good internal consistency (a = .83) [36].
The scale has been validated in Italian and shows similar psycho-
metric characteristics [38].
2.3.3. Pro-environmental Behaviours Scale
The Pro-Environmental Behaviours Scale (PEBS) [39] is a self-
report questionnaire, created for measuring attitudes related to eco-
friendly behaviors. The PEBS is composed of 19 Likert items rated
from 1 (= “never”) to 5 (= “always”). The PEBS is structured into four
factors: conservation (attitude to reduce daily consumption), envi-
ronmental citizenship (tendency to take part in eco-friendly activi-
ties),
food
(disposition
to
reduce
beef
consumption),
and
transportation (attitude about eco-friendly transport).
The PEBS presents good internal consistency (a = .80) and good
test-retest reliability (r = .85) [39].
The Italian version of the PEBS shares similar psychometric char-
acteristics to the original [40].
2.4.4. Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS)
The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) [41] is a self-report
questionnaire that concerns three dimensions: depression (example
of item: “I felt like I had nothing to look forward to”), anxiety (exam-
ple of item: “I feel close to a panic attack”), and stress (example item:
“I found it difﬁcult to relax”).
Respondents are asked to indicate how much each statement
applies to them on a four-point Likert scale (0 = “It doesn’t apply to
me at all” to 3 = “It applies a lot or most of the time to myself”) in the
context of the previous week.
The DASS presents a high level of internal consistency (a = .93)
[41].
The Italian version of the DASS is a valid and reliable question-
naire to investigate depression, anxiety and stress in both community
and clinical settings [40].
2.4.5. Climate Change Anxiety Scale (CCAS)
The Climate Change Anxiety Scale (CCAS) [42] is a self-report scale
that investigates self-perceived anxiety in relation to climate change.
The ﬁrst version of the CCAS consisted of 22 items with a four-factor
structure, but it was noted that the ﬁrst 13 items and two factors
were most useful for deﬁning climate change anxiety [42,43]. There-
fore, a 13-item version containing only the ﬁrst two factors was used
in the German validation study [43]. The scale consists of 13 state-
ments in which the interviewee evaluates the frequency with which
he/she experiences the phenomenon described by the item using a
Likert scale from one to ﬁve, where 1 = Never; 2 = Rarely; 3 = Some-
times; 4 = Often; 5 = Almost always. The CCAS is divided into two
subscales: cognitive and functional impairment. The Italian version of
the scale showed a good internal consistency (a = 0.78 for Cognitive
Impairment subscale, and a = 0.73 for Functional Impairment sub-
scale) [44].
2.4.6. Information about degree of information about climate change
and political orientation
To better assess the reciprocal relationship between information
about climate change and Climate Change Worry, subjects were
asked to estimate their level of information on climate change, as
well as the time spent acquiring information about climate change
using a Visual Analogue Scale ranging from 0 to 5. Subjects were then
asked to answer four questions regarding the role played by climate
change in their political orientation. Answers were rated using a Lik-
ert scale ranging from 0 (“totally disagree”) to 5 (“totally agree”) and
then total score was acquired by adding each item.

2.5. Data analysis
Reliability was assessed by estimating Cronbach’s alpha coefﬁ-
cients for each subscale. Convergent validity was assessed by evaluat-
ing correlation between CCWS total scores and CCAS subscales scores.
A direct correlation was hypothesised between these two measures
of climate change-related distress.
Divergent
validity
was
assessed
by
evaluating
correlation
between CCWS total scores and PSWQ, and CCWS total scores and
DASS-21 stress and anxiety subscales. No correlation was hypothes-
ised between these measures of psychopathology and CCWS.
Concurrent
validity
was
assessed
by
evaluating
correlation
between CCWS total scores and political engagement, CCWS total
scores and NEPS subscales, and CCWS total scores and PEBS total
scores. Higher levels of political engagement, information about cli-
mate change, and pro-environmental behaviors were hypothesised
in subjects with higher levels of Climate Change Worry.
Test-retest reliability was estimated by evaluating absolute agree-
ment between two measures taken in three months’ time via estima-
tion of intraclass correlation coefﬁcient, two ways, mixed, for mean
values for each subscale.
The factor structure of the Italian version of the CCWS was ﬁrst
investigated through Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), then con-
ﬁrmed via Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). In the EFA, a scree test
was used to select the number of factors. A scree test consists of a
graph representing the decreasing curve of the eigenvalues and
allows the selection of the factors that precede the ﬂattening of the
curve [45]. This method has shown good reliability in identifying the
strongest eigenvalues, despite the subjectivity of the method [46].
Factors with an eigenvalue greater than 1 were not selected, since
this method has been shown to select an excessive number of factors
[47]. In CFA, in line with literature recommendations, it was decided
to use multiple ﬁtness indexes [48]. Root Mean Square Error of
Approximation (RMSEA) was not calculated, as some authors suggest
that it tends to refuse correctly estimated models for small sample
sizes and recommend avoiding its use for sample sizes below 200
[47]. Therefore, Standardised Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR),
Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) were calcu-
lated. Indices of acceptable ﬁtness are values below 0.08 for SRMR,
values above 0.9 for CFI, and 0.95 for TLI [49].
Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS 25.0 and
AMOS 24 [50], with p values < .05 indicating statistical signiﬁcance.
3. Results
The ﬁnal sample was composed of 130 participants, 69 (53.1%)
were female and 61 (46.9%) were male. Of the total sample, 40 sub-
jects (30%) were in a stable relationship, 91 (70%) were not engaged
in a relationship. Regarding education levels, eight subjects (6.2%)
completed junior high school, 12 subjects (9.2%) completed high
school, 100 subjects graduated college (76.6%), and 10 subjects had
postgraduate degrees (7.7%). Regarding occupational status, ﬁve sub-
jects were students (3.8%), four subjects were unemployed (3.1%),
and 121 subjects were employed (93.1%). The mean age of partici-
pants was 35.02§10.68 years. The mean result of the Likert scale
evaluating information about climate change was 2.35§1.29, mean
time spent informing was 2.19§1.36, and mean political engagement
against climate change was 40.74§13.02.
Descriptive analysis for the psychometric indexes used in the
study are reported in Table 1.
An exploratory factor analysis was conducted to evaluate the fac-
tor structure of the Italian version of the CCWS. Only one factor
showed an eigenvalue > 1 (Table 2) and the scree test conﬁrmed that
the better option was a single-factor model (Figure 1).
Communalities and loadings with the factor are reported in
Table 3.
Items six and seven were removed due to factor loading <0.7 fol-
lowing the suggestion of Beavers [51] that the ideal communality
value should be above 0.7.
The single factor model for the eight items scale was then tested
with Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis. SRMR was 0.06 and CFI was 0.91,
suggesting that the single factor model had a good ﬁtness to data.
However, TLI was 0.88, below the cut-off for acceptable ﬁtness.
Descriptive analysis for the 8-item scale is reported in Table 4.
Internal consistency for the 8-item scale was estimated via calcu-
lation of Cronbach’s alpha: Cronbach’s alpha was 0.975, therefore it
was excellent [52].
Correlations between CCWS and the other measures used in the
analysis are reported in Table 5. A positive, signiﬁcant correlation
was detected between CCWS and CCAS subscales, between CCWS
and measures of Pro-Environmental Behaviours (NEPS-NEP, PEBS),
and between CCWS and information and political engagement on cli-
mate change-related topics. A signiﬁcant negative correlation was
detected with NEPS-DSP. No correlation was detected between
CCWS and PSWQ or DASS-21 anxiety and depression subscales. A
negative correlation was detected between CCWS and DASS-21 stress
subscale.
After three months, 60 subjects were retested. Intraclass correla-
tion coefﬁcient, two ways, mixed, for mean values was 0.987 (F
(59,59)=76.24, p<0.001).
4. Discussion
The present study provides support for the psychometric proper-
ties of the Italian version of the Climate Change Worry Scale. Since

worry is the cognitive correlate of anxiety, some items on this scale
are similar to those on the Climate Change Anxiety Scale and the
Hogg Eco-Anxiety Scale [53]. However, the Climate Change Worry
Scale does not include questions about health issues deriving from
climate change anxiety, such as sleep difﬁculties, lack of concentra-
tion, and the insurgence of nightmares during sleep. This is because
the main purpose of the CCWS is to identify and investigate triggers
of climate change worry. Along this line, the Italian version of the
CCWS maintains a focus on worry rather than anxiety, fear, or
depression. For this reason, the term worry is included in every ques-
tion on the scale except for question three. This is, to the best of our
knowledge, the ﬁrst study which validates an Italian version of the
CCWS. Reliability proved to be excellent [21] even if slightly lower
than reliability indexes of the original validation study. Climate
Change Worry Scale items exhibited excellent internal consistency,
and the one-factor model showed adequate ﬁtness to data. Test-
retest reliability at a three-months evaluation proved to be good.
The results of this study conﬁrm that there is a relationship
between Climate Change Worry and Climate Change Anxiety, which
is explained by the fact that worry is a cognitive correlate of anxiety
[25]. However, while high levels of Climate Change Worry can lead to
an increase in Climate Change Anxiety, which reduces an individual’s
ability to act against climate change [21], low levels of Climate
Change Worry tend to encourage individuals to implement actions to
combat climate change.
The absence of correlation between CCWS and PSWQ could be
explained by the speciﬁcity of Climate Change Worry, which does not
necessarily generate worry about other issues [24]. The absence of
correlation between the CCWS and DASS-21 Anxiety and Depression
subscales could be explained by the mainly adaptive nature of the Cli-
mate Change Worry construct, which only under speciﬁc circumstan-
ces - female, age under 35, pro-environmental orientation, anxious
personality traits - may lead to generalised anxiety or clinical depres-
sion [54].
The negative correlation between CCWS and DASS-21 Stress sub-
scale was unexpected but could be interpreted as a consequence of

an unconsidered variable, education, which correlated positively
with Climate Change Worry and negatively with stress. For instance,
since individuals with higher levels of education show higher levels
of Climate Change Worry, it can be hypothesised that a coping mech-
anism is triggered in educated individuals that enables them to trans-
form negative worry/stress into constructive worry [29,43].
The experience of climate change worry proved to be related to
pro-environmental behaviors, and degree of knowledge and political
engagement regarding climate change-related topics. This is in line
with evidence showing a direct relationship between climate change
worry and pro-environmental behaviors [55,56] and between climate
change worry, level of knowledge and political engagement on cli-
mate change-related topics [15,18,19].
While the ﬁndings of this study show that climate change worry
cannot be considered a measure of serious psychopathology, such as
anxiety and fear, investigating it is still of crucial importance, as cli-
mate change worry is not only responsible for climate change anxi-
ety; it is also an effective measure to predict the extent to which
individuals who worry about climate change and its consequences
are likely to adopt pro-environmental behaviors as supported by the
hierarchy of concern model [29] and gateway belief model [15,57].
Previous studies also show that whereas pathological worry leads
to anxiety, stress and impaired health, constructive worry, including
climate change worry, tends to generate positive mental attitudes
and functional cognitive operations/behaviors (e.g., generating plans,
taking initiatives and problem solving), especially if associated with a
sense of responsibility [14]. As recently stressed by the Intergovern-
mental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2021 [58], it seems critical to
raise awareness of issues deriving from climate change and encour-
age pro-environmental behaviors.
5. Limitations
The present study must be considered in light of some limitations.
The sample examined was not fully representative of the Italian pop-
ulation, as it was composed of individuals with an average age below
that of the general Italian population and did not present an adequate
representation of ethnic minorities and non-native speakers. This
could lead to a reduction in the possibility of generalising the
observed results. Moreover, the meaning of the correlation observed
between the CCWS and the DASS-21 stress subscale needs further
evaluation in order to be more accurately explained.
6. Conclusions
It is of fundamental importance to use a measurement tool to esti-
mate levels of climate change worry in Italy in order to appropriately
address the psychological impact of climate change among the gen-
eral Italian population. Moreover, it is important to assess Climate
Change Worry during educational programs aimed at increasing cli-
mate change awareness. Worry is also signiﬁcant since it is a cogni-
tive phenomenon related to anxiety [44] and to the enhancement of
pro-environmental behaviors. Therefore, it would be useful to assess
the interplay between worry and other cognitive dimensions, in
order to understand how worry could lead to psychopathology or to
adaptive behaviors. This could be helpful to develop appropriate
environmental educational programs and to develop clinical proto-
cols to reduce excessive climate change worry. This study should be
followed by more extensive research to evaluate the levels of climate
change worry within the Italian population. These results are consis-
tent with the fact that feelings of worry are rapidly increasing among
the population, especially in youth populations. Climate change
effects and inadequate governmental responses are leading to cli-
mate change worry among adults and young people globally.
Extreme climate change worry, though it has the potential to make
individuals feel personally responsible to take action to mitigate
climate change, threatens the health and wellbeing of those who
experience it. Given this, there is an urgent need to develop measures
to evaluate the mental health effects of climate change.
