Contribution of Forest Management Credits in Kyoto
Protocol Compliance and Future Perspectives

Abstract
Article 3 paragraph 3 and paragraph 4 of the Kyoto Protocol (KP) allow parties to use credits from land-based
activities for oﬀsetting their emission reduction/limitation target committed in the KP. Forest management (FM) is
the dominant activity accounted by Annex I parties of the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change
in the ﬁrst commitment period of KP (2008–2012). Data reported for 2008 and 2009 indicate that over half of the
emission reduction target of 24 Annex I parties that expect to use FM removals can be oﬀset by FM credits in the
ﬁrst commitment period. Especially the majority of the emission reduction target of Slovenia, Sweden, Latvia, Finland,
Japan, and Croatia may be achieved through FM credits. The total FM CAP as contained in decision 16/CMP.1 in
the ﬁrst commitment period was over-estimated signiﬁcantly by 50% for all KP parties and 36% for parties that elected
FM. Some parties such as Russia, Japan, Italy, Germany, and Switzerland that elected FM activity may beneﬁt largely
from the over-estimated CAP. Presuming a signiﬁcant increase of the harvest rate, the FM reference level (FMRL) for
2013–2020 is only 1/5 of the historical mean value of FM removals even though most parties show an increasing or a
steady trend of net removals from 1990 to 2009. As a result Annex I parties would be able to use FM credits in the
future that are over 4 times of FM CAP in the ﬁrst commitment period. This potential FM credit would account for
7.7% of total emissions by sources without land use, land-use change and forestry activities (LULUCF) in the base year
or 1990, and more Annex I parties would share the “beneﬁt” from the FMRL accounting approach.

1 Introduction
Article 3 paragraph 4 (Art 3.4) of the Kyoto Pro-
tocol (KP) allows parties to the KP to use credits from
additional human-induced activities related to changes
in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by sources and re-
movals by sinks in the agricultural soils and the land-
use change and forestry categories that have taken
place since 1990 to be added to, or subtracted from,
the assigned amounts for parties included in Annex
I. Forest management (FM) is one of the eligible ac-
tivities under the Art 3.4 that the Annex I parties
may choose, as contained in the annex to decision
16/CMP.1 which set deﬁnitions, modalities, rules and
guidelines relating to land use, land-use change and
forestry activities (LULUCF) under the KP, includ-
ing those for FM activities [UNFCCC, 2005]. Over a
half of the ﬁrst commitment period (2008–2012) has
passed and the latest KP LULUCF data for the year
2008 and 2009 have been submitted by respective KP
parties. In the negotiation for the KP second commit-
ment period since 2005, LULUCF negotiation have

proceeded very slowly and the FM accounting rules
have been one of the main bottlenecks.
Decision
2/CMP.6 requested each Annex I party to submit to
the secretariat, by 28 February 2011, information on
the FM reference level (FMRL) that shall be subject to
a technical assessment by a review team in accordance
with relevant guidelines as outlined in the Appendix
II to this decision [UNFCCC, 2010a]. It is most likely
that the FMRL will be an approach for FM accounting
in case the agreement of KP second commitment pe-
riod can be achieved. Questions arising are how much
FM credits the Annex I parties are expected to use
for the compliance of the KP ﬁrst commitment period
based on submitted KP LULUCF data for the period
2008–2009, and what is the implication of FMRL for
the KP second commitment period. This paper col-
lected latest relevant information submitted by Annex
I parties and tried to answer the questions.
2 Data sources
Data used for the analyses include national GHG
inventory for 1990–2009 reported in 2011 by Annex
I parties including common reporting format (CRF)
and national inventory report (NIR) 1
○and the FMRL
submitted by Annex I parties in 2011 as requested by
the decision 2/CMP.6 2

3.1
FM credits expected for the ﬁrst commit-
ment period
In 2008 and 2009, 24 Annex I parties are expected
to account for 246 million tons of CO2 equivalent (Mt
CO2-eq) per year in average from FM activity, which
amount 2.32% of the total emissions by sources with-
out LULUCF of these parties in the base year. This
includes 34.6 Mt CO2-eq for oﬀsetting the net emis-
sions under Art 3.3 of 12 parties based on paragraph
10 of annex to decision 16/CMP.1, and 212 Mt CO2-eq
for elected FM activity of 24 parties in terms of para-
graph 11 of annex to decision 16/CMP.1. Other An-
nex I parties are not subject to account for FM credits
(they did not elect FM). The total quantiﬁed emission
reduction target of these 24 parties is calculated as
4.38% of the emissions in the base year according to
Annex B of the KP. Assuming that the mean annual
FM credits for 2010–2012 remain at the same level as
2008–2009, this implies that the FM credits may con-
tribute to 53% of the emission reduction target.
The contribution of FM credits varies from party
to party.
The FM credit of Slovenia is expected to
account for 7.72% of its emissions by sources in the
base year which means that almost all emission reduc-
tion target (8%) can be oﬀset by FM credit in case the
same level of FM credits can be achieved in 2010–2012.
Similarly, FM credits of Sweden, Latvia, and Finland
are expected to oﬀset around 80% of their commit-
ted emission reduction target (8% of emissions in base
year), and it is 65% for Japan, 62% for Croatia, 30%
for Lithuania, 24% for Italy, 22% for Switzerland, and
8% for the European Union (15 member states). Rus-
sia committed zero emission reduction in the commit-
ment period, but its FM credits are expected to allow
it to increase 4.11% of emissions by sources compared
to the base year (Table 1).
3.2 Assessment on FM CAP for the ﬁrst com-
mitment period
To exclude removals resulting from elevated CO2
concentrations above their pre-industrial level, indi-
rect nitrogen deposition and the dynamic eﬀects of
age structure resulting from activities and practices
before the reference year, paragraph 11 and appendix
in annex to the decision 16/CMP.1 set a CAP for the
FM credits that each Annex I parties is allowed to
add to and subtract from the assigned amount of a
party resulting from FM activity. The CAP was de-
termined by the application of an 85% discount factor
and a 3% CAP on FM, using a combination of data
provided by parties and by the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, as well as
a consideration of national circumstances [UNFCCC,
2005]. Applying true values of FM removals in 2008
and 2009 submitted by each party in 2011 (for parties

d Excluding LULUCF
that did not elect FM in the ﬁrst commitment pe-
riod, emissions/removals for forest land remaining for-
est land are used), we found that the total FM CAP
for all KP parties in the ﬁrst commitment period was
over-estimated by around 50%. FM CAP of 15 parties
were over-estimated, including Canada by 10 times,
Switzerland by 12 times, Japan by 5.7 times, Slovakia
by 4.4 times, Hungary by 2 times, and Russia, Lithua-
nia, Germany, Czech, and Italy by 59%, 56%, 48%,
44%, and 36%, respectively. New Zealand’s FM was a
net emission of 0.42 Mt C per year in 2008–2009 com-
pared to a net removal CAP of 0.20 Mt C. When only
parties that elected FM are accounted for, FM CAP
is over-estimated by 36% or 15.70 Mt C per year.
However not all parties with over-estimated FM
CAP get beneﬁt in the ﬁrst commitment period as
some of these parties did not elect FM activities. Rus-
sia and Japan would get beneﬁt as high as 12.2 Mt
C per year and 10.94 Mt C per year respectively, fol-
lowed by Italy (0.74 Mt C per year), Germany (0.40
Mt C per year), Switzerland (0.21 Mt C per year),
Hungary (0.19 Mt C per year), etc. Switzerland and
Japan are able to use all their FM removals.
Rus-
sia, Japan, and Italy are coincidently the parties that
raised their CAP after the Marrakech Accord. Fortu-
nately, the FM CAP of 23 parties was under-estimated
as compared to existing FM removals by a 85% dis-
count factor (Table 2).

Assessment on FMRL
Forest land remaining forest land (FL-FL), a land
use category under the national GHG inventory re-
ported to UNFCCC that basically represents FM land,
showed an increasing net removal from 1990 to 2009,
with a mean annual value of 1,166 Mt CO2 (excluding
Canada). However, due to the increasing harvest rate
presumed by most parties, FMRL for 2013–2020 sub-
mitted by Annex I parties show only a removal of 252
Mt CO2-eq (excluding Canada), accounting for 21.6%
of FL-FL CO2 removals (Fig. 1). This percentage

175
is only 0.5% for Australia, 4.1% for Germany, 6.4%
for Ireland, 9.8% for Slovakia, 13.3% for Austria, and
56.8% for European Union 15 member states.
FL-
FL of most parties historically shows increasing trend
of net removals (such as Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia,
Finland, Greece, Ireland, Italy, European Union 15,
Latvia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Slovenia,
and United Kingdom) or no obvious decreasing trend
(such as Australia, Belgium, Hungary, Japan, Slo-
vakia). FL-FL in Russia historically showed huge and
increasing net removals with an annual mean value of
488 Mt CO2-eq, but FMRL is set as a net emission
of 94.7 Mt CO2-eq. Similarly, Japan sets its FMRL
as zero compared to a huge historical net FL-FL re-
movals (87.4 Mt CO2-eq per year). The FMRL of New
Zealand is set as an emission of 11.15 Mt CO2-eq per
year, which is 7 times of its mean annual emission for
FL-FL 1990–2009. Only a few parties to the KP such
as Belarus, France, Iceland, and Spain have set their
FMRL as net removals that are a bit higher than his-
torical mean annual FL-FL removals (Table 3).
3.4
Potential FM credits for 2013–2020
Under the reality of increasing or steady historical
FL-FL removals of Annex I parties as a whole or most
of the individual party, assuming that the FM emis-
sions/removals for 2013–2020 keep at the same level
as the mean value in 1990–2009, expected FM credits
relative to FMRL are up to 919 Mt CO2-eq per year
for all Annex I parties in 2013–2020, accounting for
7.7% of total emissions by sources without LULUCF
in the base year or 1990. This credit is 4 times that of
the FM CAP set for the ﬁrst commitment period. In
case that gross emission reduction is 20%, over 1/3 of
the emission reduction target would be oﬀset by FM
credit. Russia is expected to get 583 Mt CO2-eq per
year or 63% out of the total FM credits of all parties,
amounting 17.4% of its emissions by sources in 1990.
Compared to the 15%–25% of emission reduction sub-
mitted by Russia [UNFCCC, 2011b], most or all of its
emission reduction target would be oﬀset. Excluding
Russia and Canada, FM credits would amount to 3.9%
of total emissions by sources in 1990 or base year.
FM credits of Norway are expected to account
for 20.3% of its total emission by sources in 1990 and
oﬀset 1/2–2/3 of its submitted emission reduction tar-
get (30%–40% reduction relative to 1990). Japan, by
a zero FMRL, would get FM credits worth 87 Mt
CO2-eq per year that would oﬀset 29% of its submit-
ted emission reduction target (25% reduction relative
to 1990). FM credits of New Zealand are expected to
account for 16.2% of its total emission by sources in
1990 and would oﬀset 54%–81% of its submitted emis-
sion reduction target (20%–30% reduction relative to
1990).

FL-FL in Annex I parties (minus represents net removals)
4 Conclusions and discussion
CO2 removals by sinks from aﬀorestation and re-
forestation are very limited for Annex I parties. Many
parties to the KP are even unable to oﬀset emissions
by sources from deforestation, resulting in net emis-
sions under Art 3.3 as a whole. Similarly, except FM,
all other Art 3.4 activities are expected to contribute
very limited credits for KP compliance because few
parties elected these activities and “net-net” account-
ing rule (net GHG emissions/removals in commitment
period minus those in the base year or 1990) is applied.
However, existing managed forest since 1990, with its
huge CO2 removals, provides an opportunity for par-
ties to oﬀset their emissions by sources by deﬁning
speciﬁc accounting rules, as a result to reduce emis-
sion mitigation eﬀorts in source sectors.
Data in the ﬁrst two years (2008–2009) of the ﬁrst
commitment period of the KP indicates that FM cred-
its from 24 Annex I parties account for 2.32% of total

b Emission reduction relative to 2000
emissions by sources without LULUCF in the base
year, compared to 4.38% of emission reduction target.
This implies a contribution to over a half of the emis-
sion reduction target. The contribution of FM cred-

Croatia is above the average level. The total FM CAP

for all KP parties in the ﬁrst commitment period was
over-estimated by 50%. Some parties that elected FM
activity would beneﬁt from the over-estimated CAP,
such as Japan (10.94 Mt C per year), Italy (0.74 Mt C
per year), Germany (0.40 Mt C per year), Switzerland
(0.21 Mt C per year), Hungary (0.19 Mt C per year),
etc.
By presuming a signiﬁcant increase of the har-
vest rate, FMRL for 2013–2020 submitted by An-
nex I parties is about 1/5 of the historical mean
value of FM removals, even though most parties show
an increasing or steady trend of net removals from
1990 to 2009.
This would create a huge amount
of FM credits for the second commitment period.
Assuming FM removals/emissions keep at the same
level as historic mean value, we found that poten-
tial FM credits relative to FMRL would be over 4
times that of FM CAP for the ﬁrst commitment
period that has been signiﬁcantly over-estimated.
This FM credits would account for 7.7% of total
emissions by sources without LULUCF in the base
year or 1990.
In addition to parties that are ex-
pected to get unreasonable beneﬁts from FM activ-
ity in the ﬁrst commitment, more Annex I parties
would join the group sharing the potential “bene-
ﬁt” by creating a bigger loophole for FM accounting
rule.
