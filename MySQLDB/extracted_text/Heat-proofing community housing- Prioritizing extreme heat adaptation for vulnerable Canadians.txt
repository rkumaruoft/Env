EXECUTIVE 
SUMMARY
While Canada is better known for 
its cold climate, extreme heat is 
increasingly prevalent in many 
areas of the country, significantly 
impacting the suitability and 
livability of our housing.
It is estimated that if greenhouse gas emissions continue to 
rise at the same pace, many Canadian cities will see at least 
four times as many days per year with greater than 30 degrees 
Celsius temperatures between 2051 to 2080 compared to 
today.1 Residents of community housing are amongst the most 
vulnerable members of Canadian society. Compared to the 
broader population, community housing residents are at a 
heightened risk for heat-related morbidity and mortality.

HEAT-PROOFING COMMUNITY HOUSING: PRIORITIZING EXTREME HEAT ADAPTATION FOR VULNERABLE CANADIANS
While there is research on the impacts of 
extreme heat on Canadians and specific 
engineering interventions that can be 
adopted to retrofit or build climate 
resilient housing, there is little research on 
broader policy mechanisms to specifically 
protect tenants in community housing. 
We focus on urban areas, as they are 
generally most vulnerable to the impact 
of extreme heat events due to the urban 
heat island effect, which is an urban or 
metropolitan area that is significantly 
warmer than its surrounding rural areas 
due to human activities.
Canadian cities will 
see at least four 
times as many days 
per year with greater 
than 30 degrees 
Celsius temperatures 
between 2051 to 2080 
compared to today
In this paper, we explore how policymakers 
can better protect community housing 
tenants from increasingly prevalent and 
severe extreme heat events.

HEAT-PROOFING COMMUNITY HOUSDING: PRIORITIZING EXTREME HEAT ADAPTATION FOR VULNERABLE CANADIANS
Based on our literature review as well as 44 
interviews conducted with stakeholders 
and experts across the country,2 our paper 
provides four key recommendations:
Generate more private investment to  
support the development of climate  
resilient community housing through 
replicating and scaling up proven approaches.

Adjust government policy, code,  
funding and programs to protect 
community housing tenants;

of urban heat islands on community 
housing in the mid- to long-term; 
3

plans to protect community housing 
tenants from extreme heat;

This report is intended for climate change adaptation, public health, and community housing 
policymakers from all levels of government. To avoid preventable deaths as extreme heat 
worsens, we call on decision makers to take immediate action to improve the livability of 
community housing units and to enhance tenants’ quality of life.
These recommendations would complement 
proposed government action under the 
National Adaptation Strategy and support 
the federal government’s objectives of 
protecting human health and wellbeing 
through climate change adaptation. While our 
recommendations would benefit community 
housing tenants living in urban centres, they 
would also benefit Canadians as a whole.

HEAT-PROOFING COMMUNITY HOUSING: PRIORITIZING EXTREME HEAT ADAPTATION FOR VULNERABLE CANADIANS
Canadians are experiencing increasingly 
severe and frequent heat events due to 
a quickly changing climate.3 On average, 
Canada is warming at twice the global rate, 
with disproportionate negative impacts on 
marginalized communities, including those 
living in community housing.4, 5, 6 
A ‘silent killer,’ extreme heat has 
the potential to cause widespread 
fatalities. Those living in Canadian 
cities, which have significant built-up 
environments, low vegetation and 
greater concentrations of poverty, are 
especially at risk.7 
Housing is a critical factor in predicting 
heat-related mortality. The 2021 heat 
dome in British Columbia led to 619 
heat-related deaths in a single week, 
98% of which occurred inside peoples’ 
homes. Many of the deceased lived 
in “socially or materially deprived 
neighbourhoods’’ and “homes without 
adequate cooling systems.” Even 
though only 3.8% of Canadians live 
in social and affordable housing,8 
they comprised approximately 10% of 
the deaths.9,10  Recent extreme heat 
events in other urban centres have also 
resulted in fatalities: 66 individuals died 
in Montreal’s 2018 heat wave.11

HEAT-PROOFING COMMUNITY HOUSING: PRIORITIZING EXTREME HEAT ADAPTATION FOR VULNERABLE CANADIANS
Tenants in community housing have 
disproportionately higher rates of heat-
related morbidity and mortality during 
extreme heat waves. This increased 
vulnerability is likely related both to reduced 
resources to adapt to rising temperatures, 
as well as a variety of social and behavioural 
factors, including reduced heat risk 
perception, lack of access to air conditioning 
and cooling centres, inherent community 
housing characteristics (i.e. less surrounding 
natural vegetation), higher cognitive and 
physical disability limiting mobility, and 
greater rates of chronic disease limiting 
physiologic reserve.12, 13, 14 Adapting and 
preparing community housing for extreme 
heat is thus imperative to reduce fatalities, 
increase livability, and ensure community 
housing tenants are well protected from this 
growing public health crisis.

Climate Change Scenarios
Less Climate Change / “LOW CARBON” Scenario
Greenhouse gas emissions slow, peak mid-century, 
and then drop rapidly.
More Climate Change / “HIGH CARBON” Scenario
Emissions continue to increase at current rates.
Defining Extreme Heat and Identifying 
Risks to Canadians 
By mid-century, the cost of  
heat-related illness in Canada will 
likely be over $3 billion a year.
Rising temperatures and an increase in 
the frequency and severity of heat waves 
have significant public health implications, 
increasing morbidity and mortality. For 
example, prolonged exposure to extreme 
heat can lead to dehydration, fatigue, and 
a spectrum of heat-related illnesses (HRI), 
including heat stroke. Extreme heat can also 
exacerbate pre-existing chronic conditions 
such as cardiovascular and respiratory 
disease while increasing susceptibility to 
infectious diseases.16 By mid-century, the 
cost of heat-related illness in Canada will 
likely be over $3 billion a year.17 
The dangers of extreme heat for Canadians 
are further amplified by the fact that the 
vast majority of the population — over 
70% as of 2020 — live in urban centres. 
Cities are often significantly warmer than 
surrounding rural areas.18 This temperature 
difference is due to urban heat islands — 
areas where natural vegetation and water 
bodies are replaced by buildings, asphalt, 
concrete roads, and other human-made 
structures. Urban heat islands absorb, 
rather than reflect, the sun’s heat, leading 
to significantly higher surface and overall 
ambient temperatures.  
Although the definition of “extreme heat” 
varies by region, Environment Canada 
issues Heat and Humidex Advisories 
when temperatures are expected to 
reach or exceed 30 oC or the Humidex 
value (a combination of humidity and 
temperature) is expected to reach or 
exceed 40 oC. Similarly, a “heat wave” is 
defined by Environment Canada as “a 
period with more than three consecutive 
days of maximum temperatures at or 
above 32 oC or 90 oF.”15   
ACTION CANADA

HEAT-PROOFING COMMUNITY HOUSING: PRIORITIZING EXTREME HEAT ADAPTATION FOR VULNERABLE CANADIANS
Heavily developed areas are particularly 
at risk, as air flow is reduced and hot air 
becomes trapped between tall buildings 
and narrow streets.19 The generation of heat 
by cities, released through sources such as 
vehicles, furnaces and air conditioners, further 
exacerbates the rural-urban heat difference.20 
As a result of these cumulative impacts, large 
cities can be as much as 12 oC warmer than 
surrounding areas.21
According to a recent study by the Intact 
Centre on Climate Adaptation, major cities 
such as Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa are 
all expected to see significantly more days 
over 30 oC, longer heat waves, and higher 
maximum temperatures by the end of the 
century.22 Other cities including Kelowna, 
Lethbridge, Regina, Winnipeg, Windsor, 
Brantford and Hamilton are also projected to 
be at a high future risk.23
A ‘silent killer,’ extreme heat has 
the potential to cause widespread 
fatalities. Those living in Canadian 
cities, which have significant built-
up environments, low vegetation 
and greater concentrations of 
poverty, are especially at risk.
2021 British Columbia heat dome

The 2021 heat dome in British Columbia 
led to 619 heat-related deaths in a 
single week, 98% of which occurred 
inside peoples’ homes.
Recent extreme heat events in other 
urban centres have also resulted 
in fatalities: 66 individuals died in 
Montreal’s 2018.

The National Adaptation Strategy and 
Existing Efforts to Address Extreme Heat
Released in November 2022, Canada’s first National Adaptation Strategy (NAS) proposes a whole-
of-society approach to climate adaptation and commits the federal government to 70 actions to 
address current and anticipated climate risks to Canadians.24 While the NAS is comprehensive, the 
strategy places limited emphasis on how to specifically protect residents of community housing. 
The NAS acknowledges that “Canadian homes and communities are unprepared for increasingly 
severe and frequent extreme heat.”25  Eliminating extreme heat mortality and reducing heat-related 
hospitalizations are identified as disaster resilience objectives under the NAS. 
Targeting extreme heat, the NAS commits the federal government to:

Community 
Housing in Canada 
and Vulnerabilities 
to Extreme Heat
The Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation (CMHC) has specified that 
“community housing” is “an umbrella 
term that typically refers to either housing 
that is owned and operated by non-
profit housing societies and housing co-
operatives, or housing owned by provincial, 
territorial or municipal governments.”26,27 
Community housing is administered by 
roughly 3,000 housing providers across 
the country.28 According to the Canadian 
Housing Survey, in 2021 there were 576,000 
households in Canada living in social and 
affordable housing units, representing 
3.8% of all households and 11.9% of renter 
households.29 A further 227,200 Canadian 
households were on the waitlist.30

Seniors 70 years of age and older 
and people with chronic physical 
and mental conditions represented a 
disproportionate number of the 2021 
BC heat dome deaths at 67% and 
91%, respectively.33
A significant portion of community 
housing units were built before 
the 1990s and many are in need 
of repairs. This creates unique 
challenges when it comes to climate 
change adaptation and extreme heat 
preparation. According to the CMHC’s 
Social and Affordable Housing 
Survey, approximately 121,800 units 
were built pre-1970s, and 370,900 
built between 1970-1989.34 Of the 
576,000 households living in social 
and affordable housing, 62,200 or 
10.8% report living in units in need 
of major repairs. 127,800 or 22% of 
households report living in units in 
need of minor repairs.35
These intersecting identities place community 
housing tenants at a heightened risk for heat-related 
morbidity and mortality due to decreased adaptive 
capacity. For example, low-income individuals and 
households often cannot afford air conditioning and 
other interventions that provide cooling.32
In some cases, buildings may be so 
old and in need of such deep retrofits 
that the cost of heat-proofing proves 
unfeasible.36, 37  In these cases, it may 
be more affordable to demolish and 
rebuild than it is to invest in retrofits. 
The state of disrepair of Canada’s 
community housing stock creates 
a significant financial burden on 
community housing providers, 
limiting their capacity to advance 
retrofits and to build new heat-
resilient housing.

providing policy solutions to 
protect community housing 
tenants in Canada’s urban centres 
from extreme heat. If no action 
is taken by governments, health 
professionals and community 
housing providers, extreme heat 
will cause many preventable 
deaths, especially as heat waves 
become more common and 
intense throughout Canada.

This paper does not delve into the specific

exhaustive research on the building science 
and engineering topics related to this subject. 
Instead, this report focuses primarily on 
policy mechanisms that will not only enable 
engineering and design changes to be made 
effectively, but also create conditions in 
which community housing and its tenants 
will thrive.

This paper rarely specifies 
the policymakers that need 
to take action on each 
sub-recommendation, 
recognizing this inter-
jurisdictional complexity. 
For clarity, this report 
also does not provide 
recommendations for 
how individuals or families 
should take actions 
to protect themselves 
from extreme heat. The 
recommendations in this 
report are intended for 
policymakers focused on 
climate change adaptation, 
public health and 
community housing at all 
levels of government.
While these recommendations would 
benefit society as a whole, they are 
targeted to community housing tenants 
living in urban centres who are at 
significant risk of extreme heat morbidity 
and mortality. For example, enhanced 
data tracking of Heat Related Illnesses 
(HRI) using syndromic surveillance 
would benefit all Canadians but would 
be particularly beneficial to community 
housing residents given their enhanced 
vulnerability to extreme heat. 
To tackle extreme 
heat effectively

RECOMMENDATION 1: 
CREATE CO-ORDINATED HEAT RESPONSE 
PLANS TO PROTECT COMMUNITY HOUSING 
TENANTS FROM EXTREME HEAT
Key barriers to climate 
adaptation in Canada and 
extreme heat adaptation 
in particular include 
a shortage of quality 
data and a lack of well-
co-ordinated response 
plans. Collecting the 
right data to inform 
the development of 
response plans and to 
ensure ongoing evaluation 
is a key step towards 
promoting heat resilience.
1.1 – Enhance partnerships 
to promote better co-
ordination of programs and 
policies to meet the needs of 
community housing tenants
Strategic partnerships between a wide 
range of non-government and government 
stakeholders will also be required to meet 
the challenge of extreme heat. These 
include municipal planners, public health 
professionals, emergency health services, 
non-profit organizations, community 
housing groups, environmental associations 
and private companies.38 
Community housing organizations 
can collaborate with public 
health agencies on extreme heat 
awareness campaigns.
In recognizing the significant 
impact of social isolation on 
deaths during heat domes, 
community housing groups, non-
profit organizations, and home 
and community care services can 
create region-specific “check-
in” systems to ensure that the 
most vulnerable members of 
their community (i.e. the elderly 
or those with chronic medical 
conditions, limited mobility or 
cognitive concerns) are supported 
during heat domes;
Public health officials can provide 
technical advice, organizational 
oversight as well as education 
and training to key stakeholders 
and the general public. Public 
health professionals can also 
play an important role in building 
heat-health vulnerability maps 
and health impact assessments 
to guide municipal planning 
and evaluating the impact of 
measures taken to reduce extreme 
heat mortality via the creation 
of a monitoring plan with multi-
sectoral data input;39 and
Examples of partnerships between government 
and non-government partners that can meet 
gaps in current response plans include:
Government alone 
may not be able 
to identify the 
most vulnerable 
individuals. We 
need to better 
engage with 
on-the-ground 
workers including 
non-profit 
organizations that 
have the ability to 
reach the socially 
isolated.”

imagineCALGARY was a long-term city 
planning initiative with over 150 core 
participants from multi-disciplinary 
backgrounds, involving the extensive 
community consultation of more 
than 18,000 Calgary residents. Since 
it was endorsed by Council in 2007, 
the initiative has laid the foundation 
for many of the City’s plans and 
policies. For example, one part of the 
imagineCALGARY plan referenced a 
need to reduce the urban heat island 
effect; hence, Calgary’s transportation 
plan, published in 2009, integrated 
the use of natural vegetation and a 
layered tree canopy in transportation 
corridors. The involvement of public 
health professionals in municipal

integration of key health priorities.41
A key finding of the British Columbia 
Coroners Service Report to the Chief 
Coroner following the 2021 heat dome 
was the need for greater co-ordination in 
responding to extreme heat events.
40
The NAS similarly highlights the 
importance of developing region-
specific Heat Alert and Response 
Systems (HARS). Focused response 
plans, combined with multi-partner 
collaboration, are needed to reduce 
extreme heat mortality. These systems 
have the core elements of: community 
mobilization and engagement, an 
alert protocol, community response, 
a communication plan, and an 
evaluation mechanism.

Further data is specifically required to: 
Understand region-specific 
heat trends to assess the 
vulnerability of exposed 
individuals and communities; 
Develop an explicit baseline 
for future evaluation of 
adaptation measures; and 42   
Describe and evaluate the 
effectiveness of policies and 
programs.
1.2 – Improve heat-
related data collection 
to develop and evaluate 
evidence-based 
response plans for 
extreme heat events
A key barrier to extreme heat adaptation 
in Canada is the shortage of quality 
data on extreme heat related illnesses. 
Investing in research to determine region 
and population-specific heat-related risks 
is critical in guiding interventions. Public 
health organizations should thus liaise with 
municipal governments and community 
housing providers to improve heat-related 
data collection related to community 
housing tenants, recognizing the increased 
mortality risk in these populations.

The online heat-health mapping tool developed by the Institut National de Santé 
Publique du Québec (INSPQ) in Quebec sends automated alerts based on land surface 
temperatures in the southern portion of the province. The interactive map also contains 
key population-vulnerability data including cooling centres, vegetation, socio-economic 
deprivation, access to air-conditioning, etc.44,45

These assessments will identify gaps, and 
inform the need for targeted policies and 
programs. Information and data from 
assessments can guide municipal programs 
to increase urban greenery around high-risk 
residences or strengthen the ability of heat 
alert and response systems (HARS) to respond 
to the specific vulnerabilities of community 
housing tenants. The development of heat-
health maps can serve as a powerful aid in 
analysis and communication.
Municipalities, provinces and public 
health professionals should also 
establish an iterative process for 
managing and monitoring health risks, 
specifying milestones for evaluation 
and identifying an agreed-upon set 
of minimum indicators to track health 
outcomes and progress.43
25
HEAT-PROOFING COMMUNITY HOUSING: PRIORITIZING EXTREME HEAT ADAPTATION FOR VULNERABLE CANADIANS
Following the heat dome in western 
Canada in 2021, the BC Coroners Service 
stated that, “There was a lag between 
the heat alerts issued by Environment 
and Climate Change Canada and public 
agencies and the public response.”46 It is 
well understood that extreme heat can 
become a life-threatening event if not 
responded to promptly and appropriately. 
During extreme heat events, calls to 
local public health departments that 
require a response typically increase.47  
A standardized method is needed to 
activate a co-ordinated emergency 
response system, including surge staffing 
for EMS and fire services to aid in direct 
assessments and response to HRI.
Syndromic surveillance is a system that 
allows public health agencies to keep in 
touch with the health of the community 
in real time.48 It is commonly used in 
public health for early detection of 
outbreaks; to follow the size, spread, and 
tempo of epidemics; to monitor disease 
trends; and provide reassurance that 
an outbreak has not occurred.49 Using 
syndromic surveillance, health-care teams 
can co-ordinate their response when 
individuals start to present clusters of 
syndromes through emergency response 
dispatch, urgent care or clinic, or in the 
emergency department.
1.3 – Add heat-related 
illnesses (HRI) to 
syndromic surveillance
ACTION CANADA 
26
During an extreme heat event, syndromic 
surveillance can therefore provide 
geographic data on which areas are most 
affected, enabling an immediate and 
focused response.50 At the same time, 
syndromic surveillance would provide 
ongoing information for short- and long-
term emergency response planning. 
Community housing agencies and public 
health providers should leverage syndromic 
surveillance data to create detailed extreme 
heat action plans.
Medical professionals must also correctly 
code HRI into electronic medical records 
for syndromic surveillance to work and 
effectively inform a localized response 
during extreme heat events. Thus, part 
of implementing syndromic surveillance 
requires localized training related to HRI.

Analysis
The Plan Integration for Resilience 
Scorecard (PIRS) assesses how 
well a given community’s network 
of plans addresses hazards.51 More 
specifically, PIRS analyzes how well 
the built environment and policies at 
the community level are prepared for 
heat through a seven-step process 
designed to understand how a 
municipality is applying the following:
1. Policy tasks
2. Policy scoring for heat hazard
3. Mapping tasks
4. Assessing physical vulnerability
5. Assessing social vulnerability
6. Resilience through planning
7. Stories
The output of PIRS is a map that 
presents policy incongruities spatially.
In Seattle, a review of the policies 
on land use analysis, capital 
improvements, financial incentives, 
and penalties highlighted where the 
city had focused and what areas 
could use improvement. The spatial 
output of Seattle’s PIRS is provided 
below. Higher scores in dark blue 
indicate greater “policy attention” to 
heat mitigation.52
PIRS scored how well Seattle had 
implemented heat-related policies 
and if these policies and related 
actions would reduce the effects 
of extreme heat. Additionally, PIRS

highlighted whether the measures 
reduced heat in the targeted policy 
areas and as well as whether there is a 
focus on the socially vulnerable, a lens 
that is particularly helpful for extreme 
heat response in community housing. 
Ultimately, using PIRS will help Seattle 
understand how well it is responding 
to extreme heat. Lessons from the 
Seattle experience can be exported to 
jurisdictions in Canada.

Because community housing tenants 
are at heightened risk for extreme heat 
morbidity and mortality, governments’ 
prioritization of extreme heat, matched 
with a focus on community housing, will 
lead to significant benefits for community 
housing tenants, as well as all Canadians 
nationwide. Mainstreaming extreme heat 
into government policies, programs and 
regulations would also address a key 
shortcoming with the NAS as identified by 
climate adaptation experts. In its current 
form, the NAS does not sufficiently identify 
the top risks facing Canadians.54  
RECOMMENDATION 2: 
ADJUST GOVERNMENT POLICY, CODE, 
FUNDING AND PROGRAMS TO PROTECT 
COMMUNITY HOUSING TENANTS
The federal government has 
emphasized the importance of 
climate adaptation with the recent 
publication of the NAS. While its 
commitments to developing and 
implementing action plans with 
the provinces, territories, and 
Indigenous leadership is beneficial, 
extreme heat requires explicit and 
immediate prioritization.

2.1 – Establish a 
maximum indoor 
temperature in 
community housing
It is generally accepted that extreme 
heat morbidity and mortality would 
be significantly reduced through the 
introduction of a maximum indoor 
temperature in provincial 
legislation. Municipal 
governments should 
use their bylaw making 
powers to implement 
maximum indoor 
temperatures at the local level. The 
federal government should support these 
efforts by introducing clear guidelines on 
maximum indoor temperature. 
Traditionally [in Canada] we worry more about people 
succumbing to cold weather. […] If you look at our 
building codes, [we] tell you how much insulation you 
need to put in walls. But very little is written about 
how you cool, and actively cool and passively cool the 
buildings and structures that we choose to live in. […] 
All of these things make a huge difference.”

2.2 – Modernize Canada’s 
building codes to ensure 
community housing  
is climate resilient
Canada’s national building code regulations 
are outdated and do not account for climate 
change.56  The National Building Code 
and standalone provincial building codes 
should be modernized to 
account for the impact 
of climate change and 
specifically extreme heat. 
Alterations to Existing 
Buildings, which is the 
proposed retrofit building code anticipated 
to be in place by 2030, should also include 
provisions that protect Canadians from the 
impact of extreme heat.
In our society, indoor cooling is seen as a luxury 
instead of a necessity. This thinking is increasingly 
problematic in the context of climate change. We 
need a reasonable maximum indoor temperature 
established in Canada to prevent more deaths, 
especially among the elderly and people with 
chronic health conditions.”

2.3 – Revamp and increase 
existing government 
funding programs to 
provide preferential 
funding for projects 
that increase heat 
resilience, with a focus on 
community housing
The federal government already 
requires housing providers to consider 
climate mitigation and greenhouse 
gas reductions when designing 
projects. The same should be done for 
climate adaptation more broadly and 
extreme heat in particular. 
Given the extent of the capital needed 
to build and retrofit community 
housing units, governments at all 
levels should consider increasing 
overall funding for projects specifically 
focused on climate adaptation 
measures and extreme heat. While 
funding increases can be channelled 
through existing programs, 
governments should also consider 
launching new targeted programs. 
Creating more funding for community 
housing climate adaptation would 
help address expert concerns that the 
NAS is insufficiently resourced.57   
Governments at all levels should 
amend housing-related and climate 
change-focused funding programs 
to make extreme heat adaptation 
an explicit area of focus. This would 
ensure preferential funding of 
projects seeking to increase heat 
resilience, including projects in 
community housing that would better 
protect tenants from extreme heat.

Case Study: British Columbia’s Community Emergency Preparedness Fund
The 2 Billion Trees program provides 
a significant opportunity to help heat-
proof community housing by leveraging 
an existing government initiative. Canada 
should launch an intake under the program 
calling for proposals for tree planting 
initiatives to be delivered in partnership 
with community housing providers and 
their residents. Planting trees in community 
housing neighbourhoods will increase shade 
and reduce overall ambient and surface 
temperatures in the mid-to-long term, 
helping to reduce the urban heat island effect 
and increasing livability for tenants. 
2.4 – Launch a community 
housing intake under the

Provinces and territories should follow 
the lead of British Columbia (B.C), 
which has already made significant 
progress in allocating funding to

B.C., including First Nations and 
local governments, will receive this 
funding for “extreme heat projects and 
strategies, such as extreme heat risk 
mapping, risk assessments, extreme 
heat response plans and climate 
adaptation planning.”58 B.C. should 
set aside a portion of this funding to 
ensure new and existing community

Urban design and 
land use planning 
strategies can 
have a significant 
impact on 
mitigating climate 
change hazards 
such as extreme 
heat in the mid- 
to long- term.59
RECOMMENDATION 3: 
LEVERAGE HOLISTIC LAND USE AND URBAN DESIGN 
PRACTICES TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF URBAN HEAT ISLANDS 
ON COMMUNITY HOUSING IN THE MID- TO LONG-TERM
The built environment has a direct 
impact on local climates. This 
means that poor planning and 
urban design decisions of the 
past have played a significant role 
creating the increasingly hazardous 
conditions facing community 
housing tenants and other low-
income residents in Canada’s urban 
centres. Incorporating holistic 
land use practices in existing, 
infill and new community housing 
developments can lead to smart 
growth, reversing and preventing 
the urban heat island effect while 
creating more heat-resilient 
neighbourhoods for tenants. 
3.1 – Establish ambitious 
local urban tree canopy 
cover goals and concentrate 
planting efforts near 
community housing 
Planting heat-resistant native trees 
and shrubs near community housing 
can contribute to lower air and ground 
temperatures,60 reducing the risk of extreme 
heat for tenants. Not only do trees reduce 
ambient temperatures by creating shade, 
they also transpire, releasing water vapour 
throughout the day and cooling their 
surroundings at a city block-level scale.61
For many years, experts in the United States 
recommended a tree canopy coverage goal 
of 40%, meaning that 40% of land within a 
community is covered by vegetation.62 While 
40% remains a strong benchmark, research 
now recommends that cities set specific tree 
canopy coverage goals based on the optimal 
canopy cover level of the local community, 
considering factors like existing land uses and 
weather patterns.63 Tree canopy coverage 
goals can also be linked to the amount of 
vegetation necessary to reduce the urban 
heat island effect or to reduce stormwater 
runoff flows.64 Establishing a measurable 
target can help cities track efforts towards 
implementation, increasing the likelihood of 
success. 
HEAT-PROOFING COMMUNITY HOUSING: PRIORITIZING EXTREME HEAT ADAPTATION FOR VULNERABLE CANADIANS
35
New developments should contribute to 
the expansion of the urban tree canopy 
through tree planting and park creation. 
Existing community housing projects can 
be transformed by leveraging underused 
parcels and open spaces and by planting 
large trees and creating parkettes designed 
to mitigate or reduce the risk of the urban 
heat island effect. A summertime study 
in Montreal found that tree coverage can 
reduce air temperatures at the tree level 
(up to 20 metres above the ground) by 4 
degrees Celsius.65 Notably, trees can similarly 
produce a significant cooling effect above the 
tree level. This same study found that tree 
coverage reduced ambient temperatures by 
up to 2 degrees Celsius at 60 metres above 
the ground, the equivalent of a 20-storey 
building.66 A study in Toronto also found 
that increasing the tree canopy cover by as 
little as 5% at the neighbourhood level can 
reduce heat-related ambulance calls to that 
neighbourhood by approximately 80%.67 
To concentrate the benefits of urban 
tree canopy coverage in lower-income 
communities most impacted by extreme 
heat, cities should focus tree planting efforts 
near community housing. Canada’s 2 Billion 
Tree commitment, the proposed creation of 
a network of national urban parks and other 
reforestation initiatives can support this work. 
ACTION CANADA 
36
3.2 – Prioritize the 
installation of a variety 
of green infrastructure in 
community housing
While trees can play an important role 
in reducing ambient temperature, green 
roofs, urban wetlands, permeable surfaces 
that help with water retention, and other 
forms of green infrastructure are similarly 
known to have a cooling effect in local 
neighbourhoods. For example, green roofs 
can actually reduce indoor air temperature 
by 1.5 to 3.0 degrees Celsius.69 Retrofitting 
existing community housing units with green 
features and working with natural heritage 
systems when designing new buildings 
can therefore create notable benefits for 
communities when it comes to reducing or 
preventing the urban heat island effect.   
In 2018, Toronto Community Housing (TCHC) 
and the City of Toronto partnered with 
Local Enhancement and Appreciation of 
Forests (LEAF) and Park People to work with 
tenants to plant native species trees on three 
separate TCHC properties. The focus of this 
project was to replace trees lost to weather 
events and to disease while combating the 
urban heat island effect and securing other 
environmental benefits for tenants.68

A mix of housing types

Complete communities are neighbourhoods 
with a mix of housing types, a diversity of 
land uses, robust amenities like community 
centres, schools and parks, and high levels 
of street connectivity. Key attributes 
of communities designed, planned and 
developed or redeveloped with these 
features are their vibrancy, their walkability 
and the ability of local residents to work, 
learn and play all within a short distance of 
their homes. 
Complete communities are also more 
resilient when it comes to extreme heat. A 
mix of housing types and land uses can lead 
to an improved urban geometry, preventing 
heat traps by promoting the release of 
heat.70 They similarly reduce heat waste 
from vehicle use by prioritizing walkability, 
bikeability and public transit. Complete 
communities also feature community centres 
and schools, both of which can double as 
cooling centres during extreme heat events.

Though it does not include 
community housing, a positive 
example of infill development and 
re-urbanization benefiting low-
income tenants is the creation of 
Emerald City in Toronto’s North 
York. Originally consisting of car-
centric 1960s-era high rise rental 
towers surrounded by parking lots 
and green lawns, the area has been 
transformed through the addition 
of tree lined paths, parkettes, the 
creation of a community centre and 
the introduction of townhomes, new 
purpose-built rental apartments and 
condos as well as new commercial 
spaces. The neighbourhood is also 
linked to public transit and now 
has robust pedestrian and cycling 
facilities. Many of these changes 
were facilitated by converting open 
air asphalt parking lots into parcels 
zoned for mixed use and by better 
leveraging open green spaces to 
create shade and new community 
amenities.

Many of our interviewees indicated 
that known solutions exist; the 
challenge is raising the sufficient 
financial investments to conduct the 
necessary construction. Retrofitting 
housing stock is expensive. For 
example, Toronto Community 
Housing Corporation has a capital 
budget for 2023 to 2031 of over $4 
billion, with approximately 85% 
of this budget earmarked for 
capital repairs and maintenance 
and only 15% budgeted for new 
developments. There is also more 
financial capital needed to build 
new community housing units that 
protect residents from extreme heat. 
Compared to similar countries, such as the 
United States and the United Kingdom, 
the Canadian community housing sector 
raises far less capital for projects from the 
private sector. This is likely because Canada’s 
community housing sector is fragmented 
and contains many small housing agencies, 
limiting scalability and the expertise 
necessary to advance innovative financing 
approaches. Many community housing 
providers struggle to service loans because 
of limited revenue, thereby limiting the ability 
to raise private investment. 
RECOMMENDATION 4: 
GENERATE MORE PRIVATE INVESTMENT TO SUPPORT THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF CLIMATE RESILIENT COMMUNITY HOUSING 
THROUGH REPLICATING AND SCALING UP PROVEN APPROACHES
Compared to similar 
countries, such as the 
United States and the 
United Kingdom, the 
Canadian community 
housing sector raises 
far less capital for 
projects from the 
private sector.
It is critical that both the private sector and 
governments provide financial investments to 
support community housing agencies. Advocating 
for increased private investment in no way 
abrogates the obligation of governments to 
provide funding to support the development and 
maintenance of community housing.
In general, the Canadian community housing 
sector needs significant investments. The 
solutions identified below will also help 
tackle the insufficient supply of community 
housing units that has resulted in long wait 
lists, contributing to Canada’s homelessness 
challenges. In investing in community 
housing, policymakers should also consider 
how they can support community housing 
providers to develop the capacity to pursue 
innovative financing approaches.
Policymakers must scale 
the amount of private 
financial capital available to 
support the development 
of climate resilient 
community housing that 
protects residents from 
extreme heat.

Municipal bonds are one of the principal 
methods that municipalities leverage to 
fund community housing projects. The 
interest on Canadian municipal bonds is 
taxable, unless the purchasing entity is 
tax exempt. By contrast, the interest on 
municipal bonds has been tax exempt 
for over a century in the United States.
Though municipal bonds may be 
a potentially inefficient vehicle for 
increasing funding to municipalities,71 
now is the time to make municipal bonds 
tax exempt due to the perilous state 
of many municipal finances, the lack of 
political will to make changes to fiscal 
federalism, and the pressing need to 
address capital deficits. Doing so could 
significantly lower the interest rates 
that municipalities pay to bond holders, 
allowing municipalities to take on 
more debt and invest further in capital 
projects such as retrofitting community 
housing for extreme heat. 
As this policy change is essentially a 
transfer from the federal treasury to 
municipalities, policymakers should 
exercise caution. It may make sense 
to only make municipal bonds funding 
specific projects as tax exempt. 
Specifically, policymakers should 
consider designating municipal bonds 
that go towards funding climate resilient 
community housing as tax exempt.

4.2 – Fund Energiesprong Canada to scale its approach
Energiesprong, which originates from 
the Netherlands, is a unique program 
that aims to aggregate individual retrofit 
opportunities into large segments of 
demand for equipment suppliers and 
constructors, encouraging large scale 
investment and economies of scale in 
providing products and services to meet 
the retrofit demand.72 Community housing 
tenants also exchange their utility bill for 
a similar fee to their community housing 
provider to pay off a net zero retrofit with 
a 30-year warranty. Energiesprong can cut 
community housing retrofit installation times 
from two weeks to several days and reduce 
retrofit costs by 50%.73 As of October 2017, 
Energiesprong has retrofitted over 2,000 
dwellings in The Netherlands. 
While the Energiesprong model is very 
active in European countries, the approach 
is not currently being utilized in Canada 
beyond initial feasibility studies. The 
Government of Canada should fund 
Energiesprong Canada to promote 
awareness of the Energiesprong model and 
to encourage community housing providers 
to undertake retrofits using this approach, 
with the goal of protecting community 
housing residents from extreme heat. 
According to a report from The Pembina 
Institute, “aggregating demand from a 
large number of dwellings can act as a 
catalyst to remove barriers to deep retrofits 
and trigger innovation to reduce costs, 
minimize disturbance, and increase value 
to residents.”74 The lack of co-ordination 
amongst community housing providers 
means that retrofit projects are often 
needlessly inconvenient to residents or 
simply too expensive.

4.3 – Use social impact bonds 
to fund climate resilient 
community housing
In many cases, there is no difference between municipal 
bonds and social impact bonds, other than the 
labelling. The main benefit of repackaging a municipal 
bond as a social impact bond is the ability to sell the 
bond to Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
investors and therefore access new sources of capital. 
Many large financial institutions are getting into the 
business of raising private capital to support affordable 
housing projects. Though affordable housing finance 
has been an important part of the “E” in environmental, 
social, and governance (ESG) investing for over 15 
years, the “S” is emerging as an additional driver 
of demand.75 In 2021, ESG bonds going to support 
affordable housing projects increased by 288% year on 
year, to a total of $14.5 billion USD.76 In Fall 2022, The 
City of New York raised $400 million USD to finance 
the construction of 3,000 affordable housing units. In 
Canada, Toronto Community Housing Corporation was 
the first organization to raise a $100 million social bond 
from investors to fund community housing. 
Policymakers should issue social impact bonds that 
enable the development of community housing units 
that protect residents from the impact of extreme 
heat. In the United States, many municipalities raise 
funds for affordable housing via social impact bonds. 
The rise of the ESG investing movement means that 
more institutional investors are looking for financial 
instruments that also generate significant positive 
impact for communities. Social impact bonds focused 
on supporting the adaptation or construction of 
climate resilient community housing could appeal 
to investors interested in generating social and 
environmental impact. Social impact bonds are 
generally better suited to large community housing 
providers, as they have the scale and in-house 
capabilities to issue large bonds, which are more 
attractive to institutional investors.
In 2021, ESG bonds

4.4 – Leverage

4.5 – Create social impact 
focused Real Estate 
Investment Trusts
Community bonds can be sold 
to both retail and institutional 
investors. Like municipal bonds, 
these financial instruments can 
have varying interest rates and 
maturity dates. Unlike municipal 
bonds, community bonds are 
largely purchased by individuals 
or local small businesses. Tapestry 
Community Capital provides 
a compelling example. As a 
leader in the Canadian social 
financing space, Tapestry supports 
community housing providers 
to structure community bonds. 
Tapestry’s additional services 
include community bond feasibility 
studies, as well as supporting the 
development of community bond 
sales campaigns.
For very large community housing 
providers, like TCHC, social 
impact bonds, which target large 
institutional investors, are a better 
fit. However, for smaller non-profit 
community housing associations, 
community bonds can be a great 
way to leverage organizational 
social capital into financial capital. 
Policymakers should consider 
how to scale up the work of 
organizations such as Tapestry 
and further promote capacity 
building in small community 
housing providers, so that they can 
effectively raise this kind of capital.

profits focused on housing.77 HPET 
partners with 14 non-profit housing 
developers, offering them low-
cost, long-term capital to acquire 
multifamily residences across the 
country. The trust is capitalized with 
funding from a mixture of banks and 
family foundations.
Canadian community housing providers 
should collaborate to create social impact 
real estate investment trusts (REITs) focused 
on the development of sustainable, climate 
resilient affordable housing. There is an 
opportunity for Canadian philanthropic 
foundations to direct billions of dollars to 
funding these kinds of projects, and there is 
the potential that foundations could invest 
much of the initial startup capital.

4.6 – Leverage Energy Service Companies to retrofit 
community housing
Policymakers should fund 
further research on best practices 
for how community housing 
providers can work with Energy 
Service Companies (ESCos) in 
the Canadian context to support 
retrofits that protect residents 
from extreme heat. 
ESCos develop, design, build, and arrange 
financing for projects that save energy, 
reduce energy costs, and decrease operations 
and maintenance costs at their customers’ 
facilities.78  In most cases, ESCos finance 
their projects by receiving compensation 
for the energy savings they create. By 
working with ESCos, community housing 
providers can complete retrofits while 
incurring minimal direct expenses. 
While ESCos are generally thought of 
as a tool to reduce carbon emissions, 
they can also support the adaptation of 
buildings to climate change. If an ESCo 
completes a project that reduces the 
temperatures in a building without the 
use of air conditioning, this could save 
energy costs as well as protect residents 
from extreme heat.

The Toronto Atmospheric Fund’s 
(TAF) Retrofit Accelerator is a model 
that could be replicated in other 
jurisdictions.79 TAF provides expert 
services to deliver deep energy 
retrofits in the multi-family building 
sector in the Greater Toronto and 
Hamilton Area through collaboration 
with building owners, utilities, 
governments, residents and other 
stakeholders to maximize the health, 
social, environmental and economic 
outcomes of retrofits. An example 
is the retrofit of a townhouse 
complex at 66 Walpole Avenue in 
Toronto.80 TAF put in heat pumps 
and replaced the electric baseboard 
heaters. The retrofit resulted in a 
28-41% reduction in electricity usage. 
Moreover, before the retrofit, 70% of 
residents indicated that it was too 
hot in their units during the summer. 
After the retrofit, 97% of residents 
indicated that they were satisfied 
with the summer temperature of 
their units, as heat pumps also 
provide residents with access to 
cooling.
Case Study: Toronto Atmospheric Fund Retrofit Accelerator
We know how to build climate 
resilient housing. The challenge for 
policymakers is how to catalyze 
the sufficient investments to 
protect Canadians from the 
impact of extreme heat.”

HEAT-PROOFING COMMUNITY HOUSING: PRIORITIZING EXTREME HEAT ADAPTATION FOR VULNERABLE CANADIANS
Extreme heat is one of the direst climate change 
challenges facing Canada. This is especially true for 
individuals living in community housing in urban areas 
due to intersecting vulnerabilities and reduced adaptive 
capacity. Climate resilient community housing will 
prevent unnecessary death and suffering in the face of 
increasingly frequent and severe extreme heat events. 
It is imperative that all levels of government take on the 
challenge of heat-proofing community housing.

HEAT-PROOFING COMMUNITY HOUSING: PRIORITIZING EXTREME HEAT ADAPTATION FOR VULNERABLE CANADIANS
The recent focus by the federal government 
on climate change adaptation through the 
NAS is heartening. However, gaps in relation 
to extreme heat adaptation remain. The 
policy recommendations proposed here are 
designed to complement and fill the gaps 
in existing and proposed government policy 
regarding extreme heat, specifically in the 
context of community housing. Even with 
the focus on community housing, they can 
be applied in other contexts and will benefit 
Canadians as a whole.
