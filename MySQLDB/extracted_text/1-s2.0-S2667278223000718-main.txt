Background: The body of scientiﬁc literature on climate change and human health has exponentially grown
over the past two decades, outlining a diverse list of health risks, vulnerable populations, protocols, and pub-
lic policy frameworks. However, not all of these topics resonated equally among the health sciences commu-
nity. This bibliometric citation analysis sets out to explore the priorities and interests reﬂected in the top
cited articles on climate change and human health.
Methods: We searched the PubMed database for all publications containing the term "climate change" in
either title, abstract, or keywords, published after January 1st, 2009. The NCBI Entrez API was used to collect
citation counts for the retrieved articles. The search yielded 55,590 articles. The top 200 cited publications
were manually analyzed and classiﬁed according to topic and type of article.
Findings: : Out of the 200 top-cited articles containing “Climate change” in either the title, abstract, or key-
words, 40 articles engaged directly with human health or food security, receiving a total of 13,857 citations,
with a range of 233−1865 citations (mean = 407.5, median = 316). Only 11 of the 40 articles were original
studies. Infectious diseases were discussed in 24 of the 40 articles - 23 discuss vector-borne diseases. In com-
parison, only 11 refer to temperature extremes, 10 discuss nutritional insecurity and only 3 discuss migration
and climate refugees. 50.9 % of all citations were published in either “Science” or “The Lancet”.
Interpretation: While climate change and human health had captured the attention of public policymakers,
the consistent selection of resources and topics −favoring the Lancet commissions over environmental
health publications and the IPCC, citing infectious diseases more frequently than mental health, air pollution,
and extreme weather, and the overall relatively low number of citations −could indicate a low level of inter-
est amongst the broader health sciences community.

Introduction
Climate change is increasingly garnering interest across scientiﬁc
disciplines [1], spilling over from earth sciences and meteorology
publications to life sciences, medicine, social sciences, and more [2].
Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United
Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the IPCC) have
identiﬁed climate as a major threat to human health and stressed the
need for adaptation measures [3−5]. Accordingly, over the last
decade, a growing body of literature has been published on the
various direct and indirect effects of climate change on human health.
Research on climate change and human health often focuses on a sin-
gle manifestation of climate change and its correlation with morbid-
ity, mortality, disease vectors, and other health indices, producing a
versatile list of associated health threats and impacts [4].
Comprehensive reviews, such as the Lancet’s Annual Countdown
on Climate and Health [6−8], and the IPCC’s assessment reports [4,5]
take pains to list a wide variety of threats and impacts in an equal
manner. However, within the health research sphere, the promi-
nence and importance ascribed to different threats and impacts (as
assessed by citation quantity and quality) may vary.
Furthermore, the permeation of these threats into the wider med-
ical, public health, and epidemiological spheres is still largely

questioned. Studies assessing the views and perceptions of health
practitioners on climate change have shown that while respondents
were overwhelmingly aware of climate change as a threat, a majority
of respondents felt they lacked the information, training, or resources
to properly engage with the issue [9,10].
This bibliometric citation analysis sets out to outline and weigh
the topics discussed in 40 of the most cited articles on climate change
and human health published between 2009 and 2020 and assess
their relative prominence within the current health sciences dis-
course. Bibliometric analyses have been used as a form of meta-anal-
ysis, aggregating the use of articles and studies in research,
education, and clinical settings through citation count, downloads,
combined impact factors, and more. Analyzing the manner in which
people use published studies can help highlight disparities between
the knowledge cited and the knowledge used in day-to-day clinical
work [11], assess the rate and trends in research developments
[12,13], assess the scientiﬁc impact of different clinical approaches
[14,15], or assess the implication of studies in speciﬁc sub-ﬁelds on a
larger topic (for example, COVID-19) [16].
By performing a bibliometric citation analysis on the climate
change and human health literature and the prevalence of various cli-
mate risks and their contexts in top-cited articles within the health
sciences research community, we seek to understand the research
priorities, trends, and implied use in clinical and research settings. In
other words - what do we actually talk about when we talk about cli-
mate change and health?
Methods
Search strategy
We searched the PubMed database for the most cited publications
concerning climate change and human health. The database was que-
ried using the public application programming interface (API) of the
U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The open-
access PyMed Python package was used to query the PubMed API.
We decided to search for the term “climate change” rather than
the extreme weather events associated with climate change (i.e.,
ambient temperatures, heatwaves, particulate matter, ﬂoods, storms,
etc.). This was done since climate change is a somewhat politicized
term referring to a widely acknowledged emergency. Evoking the
term “Climate change” in the title, abstract, or keywords taps into the
crisis of climate change as an important, pivotal event, the discourse
around which is the subject of our analysis.
The search was performed on June 17th, 2022. We retrieved all
publications containing the term "climate change" in either title,
abstract, or keywords. We limited the entries to studies published
after January 1, 2009. The following data were retrieved for each pub-
lication: PubMed unique article ID (PMID), title, publishing journal,
abstract text, keywords (if any), and authors’ afﬁliations. The NCBI
Entrez API was used to collect citation counts for the retrieved
articles. The top 200 cited publications were manually labeled
according to their theme (Agriculture and Agronomy; Extreme
Weather; Biology, Ecology, and Biodiversity; Diseases; Air quality;
Sustainable development; Assorted health climate risks; Climate sci-
ence) and region of origin for all contributing authors’ afﬁliated insti-
tutions (Southern/Eastern Europe, Western Europe, Australia, North
America, Latin America, Middle East, South-East Asia, and Africa), and
were assigned an average Human development index (HDI) score as
a proxy for the authors’ country of origin level of development [17]. A
modiﬁed ordinal ranking was also assigned for development levels,
ranging from “Top” to “Medium” according to the average HDI score
(See Table S1 in the supplemental ﬁle).
The top 200 list was manually sorted according to engagement
with human health: direct, indirect, or none. Articles were included
in the direct risk if they mentioned human health in a meaningful
context (i.e., not a single reference, or as an item in a list of topics).
Articles were included in the indirect list if they engaged with topics
that have known impacts on human health (such as agronomy or
cyanobacteria) but did not explicitly mention human health in the
article itself.
The top 40 cited articles were ﬁltered for their connection to
human health and labeled according to health-related topics and cli-
mate hazards. Information on each article’s funding, the ﬁrst author’s
nationality (based on the location of the institutions from which they
obtained their bachelor’s degrees), and that country’s HDI and cli-
mate vulnerability (assessed through ND-GAIN scores [18]) were col-
lected and assigned manually.
ND-GAIN was used as a proxy for the country of origin’s vulnera-
bility to climate change [18].
Data retrieval, processing, and visualization were written in
Python (Ver. 3.6.5, 64 bits)
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics to provide insights
into the citation patterns of the academic literature. Means, medians,
and ranges were calculated for summarizing citation metrics across
various categories.
The relative citation ratio was employed to normalize each publi-
cation’s citation count. Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) values are an
NIH iCite tool [19] that measures the scientiﬁc inﬂuence of each
paper by ﬁeld and time-adjusting the citations it has received, and
benchmarking to the median for NIH publications.
The relationship between the year of publication and the citation
count was assessed using the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient.
In addition, average and median HDI scores were collected for
each theme in the 200 top-cited articles. The participation of authors
from different regions was aggregated in a frequency table and
grouped according to themes. The level of cross-regional cooperation
was also assessed by dividing articles into groups (single region, 2-
region, and multi-region), displayed in a frequency table according to
identiﬁed themes.
The relationship between themes and HDI rankings and interna-
tional collaboration in the 200 top-cited articles list was assessed
using a Chi-square test.
In the top 40 human health-related articles list, the association
between speciﬁc themes and ND-Gain, HDI ranking, and funding
types were assessed using a Chi-square test.
Results
The total number of articles found in the PubMed database for all
articles containing "climate change" was 55,599. The annual number
of publications has been increasing each year as can be seen in Fig. 1.
Fig. 2 displays the average relative citation score for climate change
publications by year.
Top 200 geographic and theme distribution
Of the 200 top-cited articles, 109 were concerned with plant and
animal biology, ecology, or biodiversity issues. 23 discussed agricul-
ture and agronomy, 19 concerned diseases and sustainable develop-
ment, 14 concerned climate science, and the others discussed
extreme weather (6), air quality (5), and various climate health risks
(5) (See Table 1).
The majority of articles originated from a single origin (90 out of
200) (See Fig. 3). Multi-region and 2-region collaborations had a
lower average HDI score compared to single-region articles, suggest-
ing most articles have originated from highly developed nations,
with less developed nations included mostly in collaborations (See
Fig. 3).

190 of the articles had an average HDI ranking of over 0.8, deﬁned
by the United Nations Development Program as “Very high develop-
ment level” (Mean = 0.899, Median = 0.921) [17].
The dominance of developed nations led the authors of this study
to create a new sub-category for average HDI score of over 0.9, titled
“Top”. 156 of the 200 top-cited studies had an average score of 0.9 or
more (See Table 2)
Countries with high and medium average HDI categories were
disproportionally represented in the agriculture and biology themes
and under-represented in all other themes (xð200;df ¼ 21Þ2 ¼ 39.08,
p = < 0.01).
In terms of regional distribution, authors from Western Europe
and North America have participated in 119 and 137 of the top 200
cited articles, respectively. Australia and Southeast Asia follow, with
contributions to 55 and 43 articles, respectively (See Table 3).
Out of the 200 most cited articles in Pubmed, only 37 engage
directly with human health, 3 more engage with food insecurity as
an explicit threat to human wellbeing (see Table 4), and 23 involve
indirect human health indices: crop diseases and pests, air pollution
metrics, algal blooms, etc. (see table 5).
Citation metrics
The 40 top-cited articles on climate change and human health
received a total of 15,897 citations, with a range of 233−1865 citations
(mean = 397.43, median = 360). The additional 21 top-cited articles
relating indirectly to climate change and human health had received a
total of 8706 citations, with a range of 297−1069 (mean = 414.6,
median = 361.5). The top-rated article received signiﬁcantly more cita-
tions (1865) than the other 39 articles (233−801) (see Fig. 4).
A weak correlation (r = -0.28) was found between the year of pub-
lication and the citation count, and therefore we did not adjust for
publication year in our analysis.

Type of article
29 out of 40 of the most cited articles on climate change and
human health were reviews and reports, with only 11 of the 40
articles being original studies. Reports and reviews have received
3.67 times the citations as original studies (see Table 6).
Topic distribution
The reviewed articles have engaged with one or more of the fol-
lowing 8 topics −ambient temperatures (heat or cold), extreme
weather events (ﬂoods, storms, or wildﬁres), infectious diseases (vec-
tor-borne, water-borne, diarrheal, food-borne), air quality, sustain-
able development and policy, migration and refugees, mental health,
and nutritional security.1
Of the top cited 61 articles (direct and indirect human health indi-
ces combined), 26 and 24 articles, respectively, have discussed food
insecurity and infectious diseases, followed by temperatures, policy,
and extreme weather events (mentioned in 11, 7, and 7 of the
articles, respectively). Each topic was discussed in an average of 9.9
articles (see Table 7).
Among the top 40 climate and human health articles, the leading
topic is infectious diseases, discussed in 24 of the 40 articles (Fig. 5).
Of these, 23 discuss vector-borne diseases −namely Malaria, Chikun-
gunya, Dengue, and West Nile Virus. In comparison, only 11 refer to
temperature extremes, 7 refer to extreme weather events (storms,
ﬂoods, and wildﬁres), 5 refer to air quality, 10 discuss nutritional
insecurity and only 3 discuss migration and climate refugees
(Mean = 8.5, see Table 8).

Geographic and funding distribution
As in the top 200 distribution, most authors in the 40 human
health-related articles originated from either North America (13)
or Western Europe (18), with 33 and 36 of the 40 authors origi-
nating from either top-developed nations (HDI > 0.9) or very
high developed nations (HDI > 0.8), respectively. 20 and 16
authors have originated from countries with either a high or very
high ND-GAIN index, indicating low climate vulnerability (See
Table 9).
A chi-square test of independence showed that there was a signif-
icant association between the Authors’ ND-Gain scores and the
articles’ primary topic,2 (xð40;df ¼ 18Þ2 ¼ 42.86, p = < 0.05). No sig-
niﬁcant association was found between the primary topic and the
authors’ HDI ranking.
25 of the 40 articles received funding from sources dedicated to
medical research, 15 from sources dedicated to climate research, and
5 from both. The authors of 5 articles did not disclose their funding.
Most of the articles received public funding, with 75 % of articles
funded, at least in part, by national or international agencies. 50 %

(20) of the articles relied solely on public funding, and 25 % of articles
relied only on funding from private foundations or commercial enter-
prises (see Fig. 6).
No signiﬁcant association was found between funding source or
type and the article’s primary topic (See Table 10).
Distribution of publications
13 of the 40 articles were published in either the Lancet (7, an
average of 466 citations per article) or Science (6, an average of 632
citations per article), with Environmental Health Perspectives follow-
ing (4, an average of 290 citations per article) (see table 11).
Discussion
Publications and sources
The health sciences community tends to cite articles published in
its own top-tier publications −namely The Lancet and Science. The
top citations, however, do not reﬂect the general publication land-
scape of most climate change and human health publications.
A bibliometric analysis conducted on all climate change and
human health articles found an average of 22.5 (Median = 6) citations
per article, with most of the articles published in “Environmental
Health Perspectives” - one of the leading journals in the ﬁeld of envi-
ronmental health [20]. However, among the top 40 articles, only 4 of
the most cited articles in the wider health research community were
published in Environmental Health Perspectives. Overall, only 9 of
the top cited articles appeared in publications dedicated to public
health or environmental health −most of them receiving the lowest
number of citations.
Among the top 200 most cited articles on climate, the IPCC’s
assessment reports were absent. Both assessment reports relevant to
our analysis’s time horizon −the 6th and 5th assessment reports
published in 2022 and 2014, respectively −included a dedicated
chapter on human health. The reports include a detailed and system-
atical assessment of the scientiﬁc evidence on the impact of climate

change on human health, similar to those featured in The Lancet’s
annual countdowns. The IPCC’s Assessment reports are considered
the gold standard in climate change research and policymaking and
are widely circulated among decision-makers. Within the health sci-
ences community, however, they are less widely cited. While it
stands to reason that the chapter on human health in the latest
Assessment report, cited overall only 105 times, is too recent to
aggregate citations, the same could not be said for the IPCC’s 5th
assessment report. Chapter 15 of the report, “Human Health:
Impacts, Adaptation, and Co-Beneﬁts”, received 1103 citations
overall −yet few of them (less than 233- the lowest citation num-
ber in the top 200) were cited by researchers in the health sciences

community. The Lancet Countdowns, on the other hand, were cited
extensively, while containing roughly similar conclusions and a
wide range of sub-topics. One possible explanation for this disparity
in reference patterns between the health sciences community and
the scientiﬁc and policy-making community writ large regarding
the Lancet countdown and the IPCC volume on human health is the
frequency of publication (annual vs. once every 6−7 years) and the
media channels through which they are promoted. While the IPCC
conclusions are widely covered by climate and political correspond-
ents, the Lancet countdown is discussed in health-related profes-
sional circles.
Number of citations
The
40
most
cited
articles
received
233−1865
citations
(mean = 397.43 median = 316.5), compared to top-cited articles in
ﬁelds such as obstetrics [21], gastroenterology and hepatology [22],
or childhood obesity [23], receiving a range of 1340−9204, 1049
−5500, and 365−10,789, accordingly (see Fig. 7). Articles purely dis-
cussing food security challenges in a changing climate had received a
signiﬁcantly higher number of citations, with the top cited article
receiving 1865 citations- more than double the second highest cited
article (801), and almost 6 times the median (316.5).
One could argue that the limited time horizon of our analysis
(2009−2022) may naturally result in fewer citations for the top-cited
articles. However, an analysis of climate change and human health
articles, conducted in 2020 and ranging between 1980−2019, shows
similar patterns and a range of 0−1481 [20]. Furthermore, the spike
in interest in climate change following international agreements and
deadly extreme weather episodes over the last decade would suggest
that articles published within that time frame will receive a greater
echoing within the health sciences community.
An analysis of mobile health (deﬁned by the WHO as medical and
public health practice supported by mobile devices, such as mobile
phones, patient monitoring devices, personal digital assistants
(PDAs), and other wireless devices” [24]), offers another interesting
point of comparison. The analysis reviewed articles published
between 2006−2016 [25] −years before the digital health boom fur-
thered by COVID-19 and the business and technology-driven advan-
ces in the ﬁeld. Even so, the citation range for all articles in the ﬁeld
was 0−449, with the top 10 cited articles receiving between 276
−449 citations. Thus, pre-COVID-19 mobile health was cited more
extensively than most articles on climate change and human health
in an era where climate change is declared as the greatest threat to
human health [3].
The research on climate change and human health is proliferating
[1,2,26], but the relatively low number of citations of articles on the
subject within the health sciences community suggests that climate
change and human health remains of relatively limited interest in
the medical and health sciences community.

Type of articles
29 out of the top 40 articles are either reviews (24), reports (4), or
editorials (1), (see Table 6). 9 of the top 40 dealt with more than one
or two health impacts, and are therefore less clinically or epidemio-
logically oriented, and aim at either policy making or a scoping of the
climate risk landscape. Citing general, wide reviews suggest that
these risks are not being cited in association with speciﬁc clinical spe-
cialties or epidemiological research.
For instance, consider the topic of premature births and heat-
waves. Despite an abundance of research on premature births and
pregnancy risks, and despite heatwaves being an established risk fac-
tor for premature labor, the low number of citations for studies such
as “High environmental temperature and preterm birth: a review of
the evidence [27]” (126 citations) or “Climate changes reproductive
and children’s health: a review of risks, exposures, and impacts
[28]”(37 citations), suggests the issue is rarely used to stress the
importance of a given study or alarmingly −that heat is not factored
in as a potential confounder in some studies.
Topics discussed
While the impacts of climate change on human health as a disci-
pline has a signiﬁcant natural overlap with environmental health,
most of the articles that received the highest number of citations
belong more to the ﬁeld of tropical medicine and epidemic modeling

were the primary topic of 19. By contrast, when combined, air qual-
ity, temperatures, and weather extremes were mentioned in 23 of
the articles, and were the primary topic of 9 (see Table 12)
The risks of ailments treatable by medicine and pharmaceuticals
appear to be cited more widely than those that engage in systematic
public health policy changes and infrastructure creations. Sustainable
development and policy were the primary topics of only 3 of the 40
articles and were mentioned as secondary topics in 4 of the review
articles. This selective focus on certain topics may limit the under-
standing of the broader impacts of climate change on human health
and of the measures necessary to mitigate them.
This selective focus could have a perpetuating effect. Bias against
novel research in funding has been shown in other areas of study,
where grant reviewers gave novel research proposals lower marks
[29,30]. More established areas of research, that have a more robust
body of knowledge and widespread expertise, are more likely to
receive funding - compared to issues relating to more marginalized
people or rarer conditions. This potential bias in funding could even-
tually may lead to fewer publications [31] and path dependency in
climate change and human health research, as had happened in tech-
nological ﬁelds [32].
Nutritional security stands out in both the sum of its top citations
and the number of articles engaging in the topic (see Table 12). As
the impacts of climate on food security have only recently started to
unfold, the topic has garnered more citations compared to acute
threats such as heatwaves. Unlike heatwaves, which are analyzed in
retrospect, are often linked to mortality and are studied in developed
nations, food insecurity is a largely prospective concern that will
impact developing nations ﬁrst and foremost. The high citation count
for food security (2863, M = 954) compared to ambient temperatures
(1944, M = 388.2) could suggest a greater level of awareness of cli-
mate vulnerabilities −in line with ﬁndings showing a rising interest
in vulnerability considerations and research [33,34].
Geographic distribution
Our data indicates that authors originating from more climate-
vulnerable countries such as India [35], Greece [36], or China [37] are
better represented in articles concerning environmental hazards to
human health, such as ambient temperatures and extreme weather
events.
Articles primarily concerning infectious diseases have most often
originated from a single highly developed region, or two highly
developed regions such as Western Europe or North America. Articles
on temperatures, on the other hand, originate from cross-regional
collaborations between more and less-developed regions. Reviews
concerning multiple topics and sustainable development articles
were often led by authors from highly developed nations, but their
average HDI score and high proportion of cross-regional collabora-
tion indicate the involvement of a range of researchers from various
backgrounds and nationalities (See Table 14) tend to receive lower
author HDI and ND-GAIN scores (see Table 13).
The prominence of developed nations in the top-cited articles list
may stem from the correlation between funding and amount of pub-
lications [31]. As developed nations have more government research
funds to distribute, it stands to reason that these nations’ bodies of
work will have some dominance in the list. What is more intriguing
is the regional topic distribution, with developed nations investing
heavily in articles on infectious diseases −the most frequently men-
tioned topic on the list. Paradoxically, available funding could be
encouraging a narrower focus on climate change and health research
due to the prominence of this single topic and the tendency to prefer
less novel topics that are considered more publishable [30,29].
Study limitations
This study has several limitations stemming from the nature of
bibliometric analyses and the manual way data was processed.
Firstly, as the body of knowledge on climate change and human
health continues to grow and evolve, so will its use by the medical
community. Since our list of 200 top-cited had been extracted there
have been likely shifts in the citation patterns and composition of the
list, which will require periodic follow-ups. These could enable

researchers to track the evolution of the ﬁeld over time and highlight
imbalances in research focal points.
Secondly, the search strategy used to extract data in this study
had been intentionally unsophisticated, aiming to detect uses of the
politicized term, “climate change”, in the medical literature. Future
studies may perform more inclusive or restrictive searches, or even
compare search strategies, as is commonplace in bibliometric analy-
ses.
Thirdly, due to the manual way the articles were ﬁltered and
labeled, and in which additional data was collected, errors in the
analysis are not unlikely. Better-funded studies, using more sophisti-
cated data extraction and validation methodologies, may yield differ-
ent results.
Fourthly, the 200 top-cited articles were sorted and grouped
according to explicit references to human health, in line with our
searching strategy that searched for explicit references to “climate
change”. Our decision to focus on explicit terminology was meant to
simplify and focus the analysis on the characterization of the impacts
of climate change on human health in health sciences discourse.
Other analyses may select different inclusion criteria or groupings
that serve different research questions and may reach other conclu-
sions.
Lastly, our broad search strategy eventually yielded a relatively
low number of relevant articles, engaging in a wide variety of topics.
More speciﬁc search strategies, focusing on speciﬁc climate hazards
or regions will likely yield interesting and instructive results that can
be used to direct future research and highlight gaps in professional
training.
Conclusion
This bibliometric citation analysis sets out to outline the topics
and references health science professionals most often draw from
the versatile pool of climate risks. In other words: what do we talk
about when we talk about climate?
The results suggest a focus on research originating from highly
developed nations and centering around the spread of infectious dis-
eases, rather than environmental risks such as ambient temperatures,
air pollution, and extreme weather. The high citation count is a proxy
for prominence in overall research, creating a potential path depen-
dency for speciﬁc climate change and human health topics. Path
dependency is a common phenomenon in technology development
and research [32] where the most established path (or ﬁeld) is stud-
ied rather than the most appropriate path (or ﬁeld). Coupled with
funding bias toward established research [30,29], the correlation
between funding and publishing [31], and a higher citation count, cli-
mate change and human health research is at risk of developing path
dependency toward infectious diseases.
Tracking this potential path dependency in climate and human
health research is important, as it could come at the expanse of envi-
ronmental health hazards that will affect vulnerable populations on a
day-to-day basis and may necessitate major reforms in healthcare
system structures as a result of climate change.
Furthermore, the overall relatively low number of citations, and
the dominance of review articles covering multiple topics, suggest
the conversation on the health threats posed by climate change is not
conducted often or with an applicable, clinical focus. Citing the rele-
vant literature more often and widely can help to promote a much-
needed change and connect medical practitioners and researchers to
the challenges posed by climate change.
