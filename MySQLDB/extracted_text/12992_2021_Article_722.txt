Abstract
Background: This paper has reviewed the international research on the terms “climate change” and “human
migration” from 1999 to 2019. To this end, a bibliometric and a cluster analysis by fractional accounting have been
carried out using two of the most important databases: Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus. The research found and
studied 140 documents from WoS Core Collection and 193 from Scopus.
Results: The results show a continual increase in the number of articles published and citations received during the
whole period studied. The U.S., U.K., Germany and China have been shown to be the most productive countries
and there is a predominance of North American organizations supporting and fostering research on these topics.
Conclusions: The main contribution of this article is the analysis of new tendencies. The trend shows a transition
from concepts such as vulnerability, climate change, land degradation, refugees and security to others such as
concepts such as international migration, climate justice, sustainability, human rights and disaster risk reduction.
Future research in this field should address the comparison of results from research focused on human beings to a
focus on other living beings.
Keywords: Climate change, Bibliometrics, Migration, Sustainability
Introduction
Throughout the history of the planet, climate has under-
gone major changes which can be clearly verified in the
geological record. However, since the Industrial Revolu-
tion, when fossil energy consumption increased expo-
nentially and, therefore, the emission of greenhouse
gases, this process of climate change has been more a
consequence
of
human
action
than
of
natural
phenomena.
For some scientists, such is the transformation and
magnitude of the changes induced in the environment
that they have formulated the idea that we live in a new
geological epoch, characterised by the power of humans
as a force of transformation on a global scale: the
Anthropocene [7, 15].
At present there is broad scientific consensus [14],
practically universal, that our current model of produc-
tion and energy consumption is responsible for the
planet-wide climatic alteration, unprecedented in the
history of mankind. While it is currently having a serious
impact on both the environment and the world econ-
omy, everything indicates that it will be exacerbated in
the future.
To this end, since its inception in 1988, the Intergov-
ernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been
informing about the causes and possible repercussions
of this phenomenon, as well as proposing response
strategies.
The IPCC’s fifth report, in which more than 830 scien-
tists from 85 countries participated, concluded that
“warming in the climate system is unequivocal and hu-
man influence is clear”. Some of the indisputable evi-
dence of this climate change, which the aforementioned
report includes, is the increase of 0.85 °C in the average

temperature of the Earth since the beginning of the
twentieth century, the increase of 0.2 m. of the average
sea level [27].
On the other hand, increasingly prolonged and severe
droughts worldwide as well as extreme weather events
such as devastating fires, torrential rains or hurricanes,
are becoming more frequent and intense [50].
The impact of this phenomenon is manifesting itself
virulently in some areas of the planet causing changes in
the way of life of millions of people. Climate Change is
destroying crops, killing herds or making traditional life-
styles unfeasible in entire regions of the planet.
Such is its impact, that there are studies that state that
Climate Change is currently considered to be a more im-
portant driver of migration than economic and political
factors in the countries of origin [34, 62].
Related to this, the latest report by the World Bank
Group [53] concludes that if urgent measures are not
taken in the fight against Climate Change and Develop-
ment, by 2050, the number of displaced persons as a re-
sult of this phenomenon could reach 140 million in
three of the most densely populated developing regions
in the world (South of the Sahara, South Asia and Latin
America). The people of these lands would be forced to
leave their lands as a result of water scarcity, poor har-
vests, rising sea levels and tsunamis.
On the other hand, recent studies have shown that Cli-
mate Change has been one of the contributing factors for
the unleashing of armed conflicts such as the recent one
in Syria [13, 52]. Climate change caused this country to
suffer a major drought during the period 2007 to 2010,
leading to a series of crop failures and the consequent dis-
placement of millions of people from rural areas to cities,
resulting in overcrowding, unemployment and major pol-
itical unrest that eventually led to civil war [1, 11].
However, the evolution of the concept of Climate
Change has undergone changes over time [49]. Together
with the deterministic conceptions that accept the reality
of climate change, discrepant and critical voices have
arisen that call into question its existence or even reject
the concept altogether (Table 1).
The above notwithstanding, the increase in evidence that
refutes the existence of the phenomenon proves that Cli-
mate Change, especially in developing countries, can amp-
lify existing vulnerabilities and instabilities in these regions
and cause a marked increase in the number of displaced
people. According to the forecasts made by the scientific
community, the influence of this phenomenon on migra-
tion can lead to risks to public safety and health [55, 57].
Migratory movements as a consequence of environ-
mental causes have been studied in the past. However, it
has only been in recent decades that the international
scientific and political community has taken a special
interest in identifying and assessing the link between
both variables, even to the extent that the International
Organization for Migration [43] has proposed a defin-
ition for people who are forced to migrate due to climate
related changesenvironmental consequences.
So called “environmental migrants” are people or
groups of people who, due to a sudden or progressive
change in the environment that adversely affects their
lives, are forced to leave their habitual homes, either
temporarily or permanently, and who move either within
their country or abroad [30].
The interest that this issue has raised in the scientific
community is such that in the last decade the number of
articles which link Climate Change to an increase in mi-
gratory movements that are a result of attempts to adapt
to the environment [8, 20, 23, 29, 35, 36, 38, 64]. Of note
are studies carried out in Africa [22, 25, 39, 42, 58], Asia
[12, 17, 40, 56, 59, 65], America [21, 37, 41, 54, 63] and,
to a lesser extent, Europe [16, 28].
For this reason, we believe that it is very useful for the
scientific community in this area of study to know the
evolution of the publications that relate these two con-
cepts, migrations and climate change, as well as the
main areas of knowledge in which they have been
developed.
Table 1 Definitions of climate change
Author
Definition
Todorov, A.V. (1986) [60]
The concept of climate change is both complex and controversial. There is no unanimous opinion
and agreement among climatologists on the definition of the term climate, not to mention climate
change, the trend or climatic fluctuation.
United Nations (Bodansky, 1993) [9]
A variation in the climate attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the
composition of the world’s atmosphere and that adds to the natural variability of the climate
observed in comparable periods of time.
Lorenz, E. (1995) [Lorenz EN: Climate is what
you expect. Unpublished]
Climate is the current distribution of a climate system over time that extends indefinitely into the
future, so there is no talk of the existence of climate change.
IPCC (Parry et al., 2007) [46]
A change in the state of climate that can be identified (for example, by statistical tests) by changes
in the average and / or the variability of its properties, and that persists for a prolonged period,
usually of decades or more.

The aim of this bibliometric study is to analyse the
evolution of the scientific literature related to these two
concepts (migration and climate change), not only to
find out the current state but also where research trends
in this field are heading to.
The knowledge generated by this study can be a very
useful tool for the study, design and implementation of
new research on the subject, as well as for the formula-
tion of policies aimed at reducing the vulnerability of
populations exposed to environmental risk factors that
can lead to migration.
Materials and methodology
The method used to analyze the concept of migration in
the context of climate change is a bibliometric analysis.
This is a scientific method widely accepted by leading
research institutions such as the National Science Foun-
dation or the European Commission [51], which uses
statistical and mathematical techniques to evaluate re-
search results [48] at various levels (by countries, au-
thors, magazines, research centers, among others) taking
as a reference the principle of the citation network [45].
In addition, the h-index is used to explain the perform-
ance or production of research work. This is defined as
the number of articles with a total number of citations
≥h [26]..
Articles, books, conference proceedings and other re-
search documents have been included in the initial
search, yielding a total of 439 documents in the WoS
database and 408 in Scopus. However, these results have
been filtered in the impact analysis to only include arti-
cles (Table 2). The reason for this is due to the fact that
these types of documents adhere to a strict review
process that ensures the quality of their content, particu-
larly with regards to the results and conclusions. Finally,
information related to migration and climate change has
also been filtered by encoding the material obtained and
analyzing it.
Using a fractional counting method, VOSviewer soft-
ware has been used to perform cluster analyzes with
which to build and visualize the bibliometric network
[61]. This method states that each action, such as co-
authoring or citing a population, has the same weighting
regardless of the number of authors, citations or refer-
ences of a publication [47]. The bibliometric analysis
followed the following steps (Fig. 1). It commenced by
defining the search criteria, the keywords and the study
period. At first, it was decided to use the terms “climate
change induced migrat*” OR “climate migrat*” OR “cli-
mate refugee*” OR “environmental migrat*” to analyze
the impact of climate change on the migratory move-
ments of people.
The study period coincides with the first article regis-
tered in each database until the year 2019 (Fig. 1). Once
this was clarified, Scopus and WoS were the databases
selected to perform the analysis, since they are the two
most relevant data sources due to the rigorous protocol
that they follow to ensure that the articles they include
present a high level of quality [44].
The published work that most closely resembles this
research is that of [33] entitled Environmental and cli-
mate migrations: an overview of scientific literature
using a bibliometric analysis, in which they apply the
bibliometric approach to the same issue. However, the
main contributions of this research, unlike the one men-
tioned above, are to be found in a broader study period
that includes the year 2019 as a whole, a document
search that includes the concept of climate change

of the WoS and Scopus databases.
Results
Number of publications per year
The first registered research on the impact of climate
change on migration is found at the end of the 1990s in
both the WoS and Scopus database with the work by
Fang
and
Liu
[18]
entitled
“Relationship
between
climatic-change and the nomadic southward migrations
in eastern Asia during historical times” in which the
basis for historical research on climate change-induced
migratory movements are set from the analysis of no-
madic migrations in South Mongolia and East Asia (See
Table 3).
Since those first publications, the number of articles
published has steadily and regularly increased since
2009, with WoS including a greater number of articles
than Scopus throughout much of the period (Fig. 2).
The maximum point is reached in 2015 for Scopus, co-
inciding with the rejection of the United States to the
Kyoto Protocol to combat climate change, and 2018 for
WoS. This is evidence that the impact of climate change
on migration is a matter of rigorous relevance in the sci-
entific community.
On the other hand, the evolution in the number of ci-
tations presents a more irregular trend to the one shown
in relation to the number of articles. As shown in Fig. 3,
these attain their highest level in 2010. However, the
most striking data is found in 2007 in Scopus: with only
3 articles registered, the total number of citations rises
to 400. This is due to Reuveny’s work entitled Climate
change-induced migration and violent conflict (371 cita-
tions) in which the conflicts that arise with the arrival of

climate migrants in new territories are addressed. In fact,
it is the most widely quoted article on Scopus. In con-
trast, the WoS database contains [19] research entitled
The first climate refugees? Contesting global narratives of
climate change in Tuvalu (177 citations) which ad-
dresses the concept of climate refugees.
Distribution by knowledge area
The distribution by knowledge area shows a concentra-
tion on issues related to environmental and social sci-
ences (See Table 4).
Distribution by institution
The institution with the largest number of articles
published, according to WoS, is the University of
Minnesota, followed by the University of London and
University of Colorado. Similarly, on Scopus the rank-
ing are led by the University of Minnesota and the
University of Wollongong along with the University
of Colorado (Table 5). The majority of the most in-
fluential institutions are in the United States, followed
by the United Kingdom, China and Australia.
The University of Minnesota is ranked 30th in the
world ranking of universities in 2014, due to its
outstanding economics program. The University of
Colorado, for its part, has had among its professors
noble awards in the field of physics and chemistry,
such as John L. Hall or Herbert Kroemer. The Uni-
versity of London is one of the oldest institutions in
the country, standing out in the fields of economics
and management, medicine, mathematics and law.
Finally, the University of Wollongong stands out in
Information and Communication Technologies, En-
gineering and Geography, among others.
Distribution by author
The distribution by authors shows that the largest
number of articles is published, in WoS, by both da-
tabases, is Mayer, while on Scopus there is a tie be-
tween Bettini, Hunter, Riosmena and Boas, but it is
the latter one who has the highest number in total ci-
tations. All authors began their research career in this
branch
of
knowledge
in
the
twenty-first
century
(Table 6). Mayer’s most cited article is titled ““Envir-
onmental migration” as advocacy: is it going to work?”
(17 citations), which addresses the governance of en-
vironmental migration. Boas, on the other hand, in
the article, “Preparing for a warmer world: Towards a
global governance system to protect climate refugees”
(194 citations), which addresses a global governance
project for the protection and voluntary resettlement
of climate refugees.
Distribution by journal
The distribution of articles by journal shows that Global
Environment Change, Population and environment and
Regional Enviornmental Change are the most influential
in both databases (Table 7). This coincides with the

thematic distribution presented above, in which the
knowledge areas of environmental science is the most
relevant in the field of migration and climate change.
Distribution by country and language
The distribution by countries shows that the United
States, United Kingdom, Australia and Germany are the
most relevant countries in both WoS and Scopus
(Table 8), followed by Canada and China. This coincides
with
the
results
obtained
in
the
distribution
by
institutions.
The distribution by language supports the results ob-
tained from the distribution by institutions and coun-
tries, that is, English, Chinese, German, French and
Spanish (Table 9) are the most used languages in articles
relating to the impact of climate change on migration.
Recent keyword trends
For the analysis of new trends a fractional counting
cluster of the keywords of the entire period has been
carried out, and includes keywords that have been
used in at least two or more articles. The different
configuration of the clusters of new trends can be
seen in Fig. 4.
The color scale indicates the most current keywords:
from a violet color that represents keywords from 2000
to a yellow color that represents keywords of papers
published after 2015. Specifically of note is the fact that
at the beginning of the period, the most utilized key-
words were vulnerability, climate change, land degrad-
ation, refugees and security. By the end of the study
period, concepts such as international migration, climate
justice, sustainability, human rights and disaster risk re-
duction appear to be more prevalent.
Discussion
In recent years, scientific interest in the causes and ef-
fects of the phenomenon of climate change has in-
creased [31], and related branches of research have
developed, as shown in Fig. 4. In relation to the migra-
tory effect caused by climate change, since 2016 there
has been an increase in the number of articles that use
the term climate justice, defined as the imperative need
to include the environmental dimension in all decision-
making (regardless of the corresponding discipline), with
a legal framework that allows action to be taken in the
event that this dimension is not taken into consideration
[6]. In the scientific literature, there are several works
that relate climate justice to climate change-induced mi-
gration, such as the research by Ajibade et al. [3], who
emphasise the importance of differentiating climate mi-
gration from managed retreat to enhance climate justice,

or the study by Ahmed [2] focused on identifying the re-
sponsibility of climate refugees.
As shown in Fig. 4, other strands in the last 5 years re-
late climate change-induced migration movements to
sustainability [4, 24], human rights [5, 10] and disaster
risk reduction [32].
Overall, recent trends show that the phenomenon of
climate change induced migrations is a warning of the
ruinous consequences of climate change consolidation
across the globe. It is therefore essential for all citizens
to make a commitment to the environment in order to
guarantee the sustainability of future generations.
Conclusions
In
this
work,
the
international
research
trends
followed by researchers in the context of human mi-
gration and climate change from the end of the twen-
tieth century until 2019 have been analyzed. For this,
a bibliometric analysis has been carried out with arti-
cles from the theWoS and Scopus databases, with a
final sample of 321 articles from WoS and 263 from
Scopus. The results indicate that the number of arti-
cles
published
per
year
has
uniformly
increased
throughout the period, particularly from 2010 until its
peak in 2018. This shows that international scandals
such as the rejection by the President of United
States of the existence of climate change and non-
compliance
with
the
Kyoto
Protocol
aroused
the
interest of the research community. This is confirmed
by the evolution in the number of citations which,
despite having a more irregular growth compared to
the number of articles published, also reaches its
highest points in 2007, 2010 and 2015. In light of the
above, it follows that research on human migration in
the context of climate change has been shown to be
a growing area of study in recent years in the WoS
database, while on Scopus, interest has declined since
2015.
Global Environment Change, Population and environ-
ment and Regional Enviornmental Change are the jour-
nals with the largest number of publications throughout
the period. The United States is the country with the lar-
gest number of published articles, followed by the
United Kingdom, Australia and Germany. This distribu-
tion by countries is reflected in the distribution by insti-
tutions, with the University of Colorado and Minnesota
(United
States),
the
Univerisity

Hunter, who publish articles on topics related to envir-
onmental sciences, social sciences and geography.
The keyword trend analysis shows a convergence in
terms of the concepts of climate change and human mi-
gration in recent years. Throughout the study period,
there is a transition from concepts such as vulnerability,
climate change, land degradation, refugees and security
to others such as concepts such as international migra-
tion, climate justice, sustainability, human rights and dis-
aster risk reduction. This shows that the scientific
community is more focused on the consequences of cli-
mate change not only on the state of health of the popu-
lation,
but
also
in
the
patterns
of
national
and
international migratory movements for the purpose of
seeking work and in the decision-making processes of
planning and organizing local territories.
On the limitations of this research it should be noted,
first, that the field of study has been restricted only to the
most influential academic databases (WOS and Scopus).
Second, only articles have been analyzed. Therefore, it
would be interesting to broaden the research to include
other databases such as Google Scholar and other types of
publications such as books or conference proceedings.
Due to the high impact that climate change has not
only on people’s lives, but also on global biodiversity as
a whole, it would be interesting to compare the results
of the current research on both aspects, identifying dif-
ferences and similarities that allow us to know if as
humans, we display the same behavior as other species
facing changes in the environment.
