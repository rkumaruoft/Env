Editorial
Time to treat the climate and nature crisis as one 
indivisible global health emergency‚Ä†
Over 200 health journals call on the United Nations, political 
leaders, and health professionals to recognise that climate 
change and biodiversity loss are one indivisible crisis and must 
be tackled together to preserve health and avoid catastrophe. 
This overall environmental crisis is now so severe as to be a 
global health emergency.
The world is currently responding to the climate crisis and the 
nature crisis as if they were separate challenges. This is a danger¬≠
ous mistake. The 28th Conference of the Parties (COP) on climate 
change is about to be held in Dubai while the 16th COP on biodi¬≠
versity is due to be held in Turkey in 2024. The research commu¬≠
nities that provide the evidence for the two COPs are 
unfortunately largely separate, but they were brought together 
for a workshop in 2020 when they concluded that: ‚ÄúOnly by con¬≠
sidering climate and biodiversity as parts of the same complex 
problem‚Ä¶can solutions be developed that avoid maladaptation 
and maximize the beneficial outcomes.‚Äù [1].
As the health world has recognised with the development of 
the concept of planetary health, the natural world is made up of 
one overall interdependent system. Damage to one subsystem 
can create feedback that damages another‚Äîfor example, 
drought, wildfires, floods and the other effects of rising global 
temperatures destroy plant life, and lead to soil erosion and so 
inhibit carbon storage, which means more global warming [2]. 
Climate change is set to overtake deforestation and other land- 
use change as the primary driver of nature loss [3].
Nature has a remarkable power to restore. For example, defor¬≠
ested land can revert to forest through natural regeneration, and 
marine phytoplankton, which act as natural carbon stores, turn 
over one billion tonnes of photosynthesising biomass every eight 
days [4]. Indigenous land and sea management has a particularly 
important role to play in regeneration and continuing care [5].
Restoring one subsystem can help another‚Äîfor example, 
replenishing soil could help remove greenhouse gases from the 
atmosphere on a vast scale [6]. But actions that may benefit one 
subsystem can harm another‚Äîfor example, planting forests with 
one type of tree can remove carbon dioxide from the air but 
can damage the biodiversity that is fundamental to healthy 
ecosystems [7].
The impacts on health
Human health is damaged directly by both the climate crisis, as 
the journals have described in previous editorials [8, 9], and by 
the nature crisis [10]. This indivisible planetary crisis will have 
major effects on health as a result of the disruption of social and 
economic systems‚Äîshortages of land, shelter, food, and water, 
exacerbating poverty, which in turn will lead to mass migration 
and conflict. Rising temperatures, extreme weather events, air 
pollution, and the spread of infectious diseases are some of the 
major health threats exacerbated by climate change [11]. 
‚ÄúWithout nature, we have nothing‚Äù, was UN Secretary-General 
Antonio Guterres‚Äôs blunt summary at the biodiversity COP in 
Montreal last year [12]. Even if we could keep global warming be¬≠
low an increase of 1.5C over pre-industrial levels, we could still 
cause catastrophic harm to health by destroying nature.
Access to clean water is fundamental to human health, and 
yet pollution has damaged water quality, causing a rise in water- 
borne diseases [13]. Contamination of water on land can also 
have far-reaching effects on distant ecosystems when that water 
runs off into the ocean [14]. Good nutrition is underpinned by di¬≠
versity in the variety of foods, but there has been a striking loss 
of genetic diversity in the food system. Globally, about a fifth of 
people rely on wild species for food and their livelihoods [15]. 
Declines in wildlife are a major challenge for these populations, 
particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Fish provide 
more than half of dietary protein in many African, South Asian 
and small island nations, but ocean acidification has reduced the 
quality and quantity of seafood [16].
Changes in land use have forced tens of thousands of species 
into closer contact, increasing the exchange of pathogens and 
the emergence of new diseases and pandemics [17]. People losing 
contact with the natural environment and the declining loss in 
biodiversity have both been linked to increases in noncommuni¬≠
cable, autoimmune, and inflammatory diseases and metabolic, 
allergic and neuropsychiatric disorders [10, 18]. For Indigenous 
people, caring for and connecting with nature is especially im¬≠
portant for their health [19]. Nature has also been an important 
source of medicines, and thus reduced diversity also constrains 
the discovery of new medicines.
Communities are healthier if they have access to high-quality 
green spaces that help filter air pollution, reduce air and ground 
temperatures, and provide opportunities for physical activity 
[20]. Connection with nature reduces stress, loneliness and de¬≠
pression while promoting social interaction [21]. These benefits 
are threatened by the continuing rise in urbanisation [22].
Finally, the health impacts of climate change and biodiversity 
loss will be experienced unequally between and within countries, 
with the most vulnerable communities often bearing the highest 
burden [10]. Linked to this, inequality is also arguably fuelling

these environmental crises. Environmental challenges and so¬≠
cial/health inequities are challenges that share drivers and there 
are potential co-benefits of addressing them [10].
A global health emergency
In December 2022 the biodiversity COP agreed on the effective 
conservation and management of at least 30 percent of the 
world‚Äôs land, coastal areas, and oceans by 2030 [23]. 
Industrialised countries agreed to mobilise $30 billion per year to 
support developing nations to do so [23]. These agreements echo 
promises made at climate COPs.
Yet many commitments made at COPs have not been met. 
This has allowed ecosystems to be pushed further to the brink, 
greatly increasing the risk of arriving at ‚Äòtipping points‚Äô, abrupt 
breakdowns in the functioning of nature [2, 24]. If these events 
were to occur, the impacts on health would be globally 
catastrophic.
This risk, combined with the severe impacts on health already 
occurring, means that the World Health Organization should de¬≠
clare the indivisible climate and nature crisis as a global health 
emergency. The three pre-conditions for WHO to declare a situa¬≠
tion to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern 
[25] are that it: 1) is serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected; 
2) carries implications for public health beyond the affected 
State‚Äôs national border; and 3) may require immediate interna¬≠
tional action. Climate change would appear to fulfil all of those 
conditions. While the accelerating climate change and loss of 
biodiversity are not sudden or unexpected, they are certainly se¬≠
rious and unusual. Hence we call for WHO to make this declara¬≠
tion before or at the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly in 
May 2024.
Tackling this emergency requires the COP processes to be 
harmonised. As a first step, the respective conventions must 
push for better integration of national climate plans with biodi¬≠
versity equivalents [3]. As the 2020 workshop that brought cli¬≠
mate and nature scientists together concluded, ‚ÄúCritical leverage 
points include exploring alternative visions of good quality of life, 
rethinking consumption and waste, shifting values related to the 
human-nature relationship, reducing inequalities, and promot¬≠
ing education and learning.‚Äù [1]. All of these would bene¬≠
fit health.
Health professionals must be powerful advocates for both re¬≠
storing biodiversity and tackling climate change for the good of 
health. Political leaders must recognise both the severe threats to 
health from the planetary crisis as well as the benefits 
that can flow to health from tackling the crisis [26]. But first, 
we must recognise this crisis for what it is: a global 
health emergency.
