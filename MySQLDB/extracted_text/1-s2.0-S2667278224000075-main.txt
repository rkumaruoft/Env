Climate change may widen pre-existing health disparities in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and
queer (LGBTQ+) populations. We argue that LGBTQ+ communities will have more exposure to climate change
related disasters, be more susceptible to the adverse impacts of climate change and will have fewer resources
to recover from climate disasters. Scholars, practitioners, policymakers, and climatologists need to carefully
consider the potential for disparate effects of climate change disasters on the health of LGBTQ+ people. Legis-
lative action protecting LGBTQ+ populations from discrimination, more LGBTQ+ inclusive data collection
efforts, and LGBTQ+ sensitivity trainings for disaster relief providers are needed now to ameliorate climate
change-related LGBTQ+ health disparities.

Introduction
Climate change poses a signiﬁcant threat to all humanity. How-
ever, climate-related harms will differentially impact the most
socially and economically vulnerable [1−4]. Like other marginalized
groups, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) peo-
ple will, on average, have more exposure to climate change-related
disasters, be more susceptible to the adverse impacts of climate
change-related disasters, and have fewer resources to recover from
climate harms. Although recent work has begun to identify the
increased vulnerability of LGBTQ+ populations in the context of a
warming planet [5], contemporary research and public policy efforts
fall short by failing to enact nondiscrimination policies, strengthen
LGBTQ-inclusive data practices, and train an emergency relief work-
force on the unique health needs of LGBTQ+ populations during cli-
mate-related disasters. It is imperative that the differential impacts
of climate-related disasters on LGBTQ+ populations are considered
within broader climate change adaptation actions to prevent the wid-
ening of LGBTQ+ health disparities [6].
LGBTQ+ people will experience greater exposure to the effects of climate
change
The greater likelihood of exposure to climate-related disasters for
LGBTQ+ people is driven by two primary factors: (1) the geographic
distribution of the LGBTQ+ populations both nationally and locally,
which skews toward more highly affected areas, and (2) structural
inequalities that may exacerbate the effects of climate change.
LGBTQ+ people and community enclaves are disproportionately
located in high-risk areas prone to ﬂooding, poor air quality, mos-
quito-borne diseases, and extreme heat. For instance, in coastal cities,
historic LGBTQ+ enclaves (so-called “gayborhoods”) like Christopher
Street in New York City are at high risk of severe ﬂooding during
storm surges according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Association (NOAA) [7]. Likewise, Boston’s South End neighborhood,
home to a large LGBTQ+ population, is at high risk of ﬂooding.
Although many queer people live outside LGBTQ+ enclaves, these
neighborhoods and LGBTQ-owned businesses are important commu-
nity focal points. Other groups, including lesbians and transgender
people, often live in areas that are less likely to be recognized as gay
neighborhoods but are still at high risk of loss. For instance, following
Hurricane Katrina, MidCity New Orleans, an area with an historically
high proportion of lesbians and queer people of color, experienced
more devastating losses compared to other neighborhoods [8].
LGBTQ+ people in the U.S. have also disproportionately settled in
western states and large LGBTQ+ friendly cities (e.g., San Francisco,
Seattle, Portland, and Los Angeles) with an elevated risk of wildﬁres,
an increasingly large source of outdoor air pollution in the United
States. Wildﬁre smoke is consistently associated with increased risk
of respiratory disease and may increase risk of cardiovascular disease
and mortality [9]. In the San Francisco Bay Area, where around
250,000 LGBTQ+ adults live [10], the average number of smoky days
in 2016−2020 was over 44 per year in most areas, an increase of
more than 200 % since 2009−2013 [11].

Like other marginalized groups in the U.S., LGBTQ+ people are
more likely to live and work in risk-prone areas due to social, eco-
nomic, and structural factors that limit their economic opportunities
[12]. National data from the U.S. Census Household Pulse Survey
recently found that gay, lesbian, and transgender people had much
higher rates of being displaced from their home in the previous 12
months due to a natural disaster than their heterosexual or cisgender
peers. Approximately 4 percent of gay or lesbian people reported
being forced to evacuate their home due to a natural disaster com-
pared with 1.2 percent of heterosexual people [13]. Moreover, LGBTQ
+ young adults aged 18−25 are also more than twice as likely to be
unhoused compared to non-LGBTQ+ young adults [14], leaving them
at even greater risk from climate related disasters, storms, and
extreme heat. Acknowledging these additional challenges to adapting
to disasters, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
listed for the ﬁrst time LGBTQ+ people among those “more likely
than others to be severely impacted by disasters and may require
additional or distinct support after a disaster occurs” [15].
LGBTQ+ people are more susceptible to the adverse impacts of climate
change
The disproportionate risks of exposure to climate change are com-
pounded by pre-existing health disparities among LGBTQ+ popula-
tions. Approximately 21 % of LGBTQ+ adults live with asthma and/or
emphysema compared with 14 % of heterosexual adults [16]. LGBTQ+
individuals have higher levels of cardiovascular disease risk, are diag-
nosed with cardiovascular disease at younger ages, and have a higher
incidence of cardiovascular disease, especially among transgender
populations [17]. On average, LGBTQ+ Americans also have poorer
mental health and signiﬁcantly higher rates of HIV and other immu-
nocompromised conditions that require consistent access to care and
lifesaving medication [18−20]. Furthermore, access to care, utiliza-
tion of care, and health insurance rates are much lower among
LGBTQ+ populations [21−23]. Baseline disparities will likely widen
with climate-related wildﬁres, extreme temperatures, and emerging
infectious diseases. The preexisting disparities may result in LGBTQ+
populations being more susceptible to poor air quality, more suscep-
tible to mental health impacts from climate disasters, and more likely
to develop comorbidities due to weakened immune systems.
LGBTQ+ Americans also experience higher rates of poverty, lower
wealth, and lower incomes than their non-LGBTQ+ counterparts [24].
Existing socioeconomic inequalities will increase susceptibility to cli-
mate-related disasters. For example, LGBTQ+ people’s ability to seek
medical care during and immediately after a severe weather event or
disaster may be hindered by existing socioeconomic disparities. Their
experiences and expectations of discrimination, harassment, and vio-
lence can make them more hesitant to seek medical attention or
emergency shelters during climate-related disasters. These vulner-
abilities were apparent among the LGBTQ+ victims of Hurricanes
Katrina and Maria, many of whom struggled to access HIV medica-
tions, were unable to evacuate, were permanently displaced, or died
due to interruptions in care resulting from the hurricane [25−27].
Even among LGBTQ+ people that do not have pre-existing health con-
ditions, socioeconomic inequalities can impact their ability to engage
in adaptive protective behaviors such as the ability to afford air con-
ditioning to deal with increasing temperature, and the ability to pur-
chase air puriﬁers to protect against worsening air quality.
Climate change can also create conditions that favor the emer-
gence of novel infectious diseases as it inﬂuences ecosystems, human
and wildlife behavior, and host-pathogen interactions [28]. Changes
in temperature, precipitation, and humidity can inﬂuence the preva-
lence and transmission of respiratory diseases like inﬂuenza, includ-
ing strains with pandemic potential [29]. Although all people are
generally biologically susceptible to inﬂuenza, LGBTQ+ people may
be more susceptible in a novel inﬂuenza pandemic. During the
COVID-19 pandemic, LGBTQ+ Americans were more likely to work in
jobs considered “essential,” increasing their risk of exposure to
COVID-19 infection [16]. Lower rates of health insurance coverage
among LGBTQ+ populations in the U.S. compounded their health and
economic risks during the COVID-19 pandemic [30]. Higher rates of
HIV infection among LGBTQ+ people also increase the underlying sus-
ceptibility to coinfections within the LGBTQ+ community.
LGBTQ+ people have fewer resources to respond and adapt to climate
related impacts
Climate change may require LGBTQ+ families and individuals to
cope and recover from disasters in new and unexpected ways, includ-
ing the use of emergency shelters and emergency assistance pro-
grams. Yet, emergency shelters are frequently ill-equipped to
support LGBTQ+ people and can be experienced as unwelcoming
[31]. Many social service and disaster relief programs in the U.S. (e.g.,
homeless shelters, food pantries, and ﬁnancial assistance charities)
are managed by faith-based organizations [32]. Prior research has
documented how some emergency shelters explicitly refuse to house
LGBTQ+ populations [33]. For instance, data from the U.S. Transgen-
der Survey found that 70 % of transgender people seeking shelter
have been turned away, were physically or sexually assaulted, or
faced some other form of mistreatment at an assistance shelter
because of their gender identity [34]. A 2015 study also found that
only 30 % of homeless shelters in Connecticut, Washington, Tennes-
see, and Virginia would be willing to accommodate transgender peo-
ple [5].
LGBTQ+ people may also need additional support in recovering
after climate change-related disasters. Socioeconomic disparities will
likely increase LGBTQ+ people’s reliance on support in the wake of
climate related disasters, however such support may not be accessi-
ble for LGBTQ+ populations. For example, Hurricane Katrina heavily
impacted African American LGBTQ+ people in New Orleans but,
according to reports, they experienced discrimination during the dis-
tribution of federal and community relief efforts [35]. At the time, the
U.S. Defense of Marriage Act had yet to be overturned, and the three
states hit hardest by Hurricane Katrina (Texas, Louisiana, and Missis-
sippi) banned the recognition of same-sex marriage. Thus, LGBTQ+
families experienced unique hurdles to certain kinds of family-based
support from FEMA which are critical for communities to recover in
the wake of disasters [36].
The lower socioeconomic status of LGBTQ+ populations may also
create barriers to relocating to parts of the country that are more cli-
mate resilient. Climate disasters may lead to the displacement of
LGBTQ+ people and their isolation away from LGBTQ+ enclaves. In
turn, LGBTQ+ health disparities may widen as social networks
decrease and exposures to structural discrimination increase. Recent
research demonstrated the role of community isolation and returning
to parental homes in explaining disparate impacts of the COVID-19
pandemic on the mental health of sexual minorities [37], and it is
possible that similar processes will exacerbate LGBTQ+ health dispar-
ities after climate disasters. Furthermore, the risks of climate change
and weather-related events may also lead to the displacement of
LGBTQ+ populations from coastal states with legal protections to cen-
tral parts of the U.S. where they are more likely to experience dis-
crimination, prejudice, and stigma, and encounter anti-LGBTQ+
legislation [38]. For transgender and gender expansive people, sev-
eral states now pose substantial threats to life, freedom, and well-
being [39]. Prior studies have documented the negative effects of dis-
crimination and anti-LGBTQ+ legislation on the health of LGBTQ+
populations [40]. The passage of anti-transgender rights legislation in
the U.S. during the 2019−2020 state legislative session was associ-
ated with increases in suicide- and depression-related internet
searches [41]. Thus, future internal U.S. migration may widen LGBTQ
+ health disparities, especially in mental health, and hamper LGBTQ+

people’s ability to cope or recover from the damages caused by cli-
mate change.
Global inequalities in climate change exposure will exacerbate LGBTQ+
health inequities and raise concerns regarding LGBTQ+ safety
Climate change is projected to have the greatest impact in Africa,
Southeast Asia, and the Western Paciﬁc . Since 1990, these areas have
experienced more than a 10 % increase in extreme heat vulnerability
alongside substantial increases in ﬂooding, crop loss, and storm-
related disasters [42]. Greater economic insecurity and poverty has
limited the extent to which people can recover from climate change
related disasters. In 2021 alone, 23.7 million people were displaced
due to disasters across 141 countries; more than 94 % of disaster dis-
placements were weather related. By the end of 2021, almost 6 mil-
lion people were living in displacement in 84 countries and
territories due to a disaster, with substantial concentrations in China,
India, the Philippines, Indonesia, Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Mozam-
bique [43].
As in the U.S., LGBTQ+ people in other countries are more likely to
be disproportionately impacted by climate harms due to stratiﬁcation
on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. In many coun-
tries, sexual and gender minorities remain the subject of violence,
discrimination, and exclusion [44−46]. Further, many countries not
only lack LGBTQ+ legal protections but also have openly anti-LGBTQ+
policies. 62 countries criminalize consensual same-sex sexual acts
and as many as 11 countries could impose the death penalty if con-
victed [47]. Among countries likely to experience the worst effects of
climate change on food insecurity −South Sudan, Madagascar, Paki-
stan, Somalia, Sudan, Chad, Niger, Burkina Faso, Honduras, El Salva-
dor, and Guatemala −same-sex activity is criminalized in ﬁve.
Despite a lack of criminalization, El Salvador, Honduras, and Guate-
mala are among the top 5 countries of origin for individuals present-
ing for asylum in the U.S. on the basis of LGBTQ+ status [48]. As a
result, LGBTQ+ people living in heavily impacted regions are most
vulnerable and subject to scapegoating, worsening health disparities,
and increased risk of poverty, housing insecurity, and mortality. Evi-
dence from the global COVID-19 pandemic strongly suggests that
LGBTQ+
people
will
be
disproportionately
targeted,
arrested,
detained, and displaced in times of global and national crises [49
−51]. Climate change is also likely to have profound economic effects
in many countries [52]. Prior research has linked the economic reces-
sion following the COVID-19 pandemic to increases in discriminatory
attitudes toward LGBTQ+ populations [53], suggesting that, as
climate-related impacts on the economy continue to be realized, dis-
criminatory attitudes toward LGBTQ+ and other minority populations
will likely increase.
Globally, climate change-related vulnerabilities are expected to
lead to increase cross-border asylum and displacement [54]. LGBTQ+
people that ﬂee their countries of origin already experience victimi-
zation, unsafe living conditions, statelessness, and violence through-
out the asylum process [55−58]. During transit from their country of
origin to the destination country, LGBTQ+ people are victims of vio-
lence and harassment and face barriers to accessing necessary health
care. On arrival, LGBTQ+ migrants are victims of harassment, vio-
lence, and discrimination [58]. In a survey of LGBTQ+ refugees in
Kenya, 93 % reported that they had been verbally insulted, 83 % had
been physically assaulted, and 88 % had been denied police assistance
[59]. Transgender and gender-diverse refugees, asylum seekers,
migrants, internally displaced, and stateless people are among those
facing the highest risk of physical and emotional mistreatment, beat-
ings, rape, torture, and murder, because their visible gender expres-
sion is often perceived as a direct challenge to prevailing social
norms in countries or regions of origin, transit, and destination
[57,60,61]. Navigating the asylum process can be difﬁcult for LGBTQ+
individuals due to fears of persecution or being outed in their country
of origin when requirements to prove their sexual orientation or gen-
der identity creates barriers for LGBTQ+ asylum seekers [62]. Such
issues have resulted in serious concerns from human rights groups
regarding the safety of LGBTQ+ displaced people [63,64].
Recommendations to ameliorate climate change-related LGBTQ+ health
disparities
Policymakers must act now to ensure that LGBTQ+ populations
are protected during climate change disasters. We identify seven key
actions that we recommend should be taken to reduce climate
change-related harms for LGBTQ+ populations.
First, adoption of legislation to protect LGBTQ+ people from dis-
crimination in employment, housing, education, and public accom-
modations at the national level is needed. This will ensure that
LGBTQ+ people who have to relocate following climate related disas-
ters will remain protected against local anti-LGBTQ+ legislation and
will be able to access national emergency programs. In many coun-
tries and regions, attitudes toward LGBTQ+ people have improved
[65], and more people now support non-discrimination protections,
equal marriage and adoption rights, and other supports for LGBTQ+
populations [66].
Second, policymakers and service providers should ensure that
LGBTQ+ populations are also welcomed, afﬁrmed, and protected
from discrimination in emergency shelters, food banks, emergency
management programs, and refugee and asylee resettlement pro-
grams. In doing so, national and local data collection efforts should
be inclusive and ascertain sexual orientation and gender identity
when possible. As the incidence and severity of climate related disas-
ters increases so will the likelihood of LGBTQ+ displacement; coun-
tries must be prepared to ensure the safety of LGBTQ+ migrants and
asylum seekers.
Third, LGBTQ+ people needing shelter in all contexts must have
access to HIV medications and transgender afﬁrming health services
(e.g., hormone replacement therapies) when needed. Social workers
and medical personnel must be trained and prepared to treat LGBTQ+
patients with dignity and respect.
Fourth, pandemic preparedness plans must speciﬁcally assess the
disproportionate risks related to new and emerging infectious dis-
eases among LGBTQ+ populations and lay the groundwork for rapid
identiﬁcation, contact tracing, treatment, and vaccine rollout in col-
laboration with effective community organizations and without
stigma. Relatedly, climate change measures, including health adapta-
tion plans, must consider LGBTQ+ populations as a vulnerable popu-
lation and ensure that such plans consider differential impacts of
climate-related disasters on LGBTQ+ populations.
Fifth, countries must streamline the asylum process for LGBTQ+
migrants. Requiring LGBTQ+ migrants to prove their sexual orienta-
tion or gender identity is a major obstacle for LGBTQ+ migrants.
Many LGBTQ+ migrants are denied asylum based on their inability to
“credibly” prove their identity.
Sixth, LGBTQ+ sensitivity training is needed for civil society
groups, outreach volunteers, and immigration and border ofﬁcials to
ensure the safety of LGBTQ+ migrants throughout the asylum and ref-
ugee process.
Seventh, it is imperative that LGBTQ+ data collection efforts are
expanded. Most surveillance systems do not measure LGBTQ+ identi-
ties, which limits the ability of practitioners, policymakers, and
researchers to identify and prioritize the differential impacts of cli-
mate change on LGBTQ+ people worldwide. Data on LGBTQ+ popula-
tions are rare in countries that are highly vulnerable to climate
related disasters (e.g., Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Western Paciﬁc)
and efforts to expand data collection efforts in these areas will be
important in identifying the differential effects of climate change
related disasters and tracking differential exposure. Surveys and
assessments of disaster vulnerability, preparedness, and response

must incorporate explicit measures for LGBTQ+ populations and com-
munities. Local and community-based information may be needed to
ensure that LGBTQ+ voices are represented in responses to climate
harms.
Conclusion
Public health practitioners, policymakers, researchers, and clima-
tologists need to carefully consider the potential for disparate effects
of climate change on the health of LGBTQ+ people. Like other margin-
alized populations, LGBTQ+ people will likely be more exposed to the
hazards of climate change, more susceptible to climate change
effects, and less able to adapt to or recover from climate change rela-
tive to non-LGBTQ+ populations. As such, climate change may widen
pre-existing LGBTQ+ health disparities. Legislative action protecting
LGBTQ+ populations from discrimination, more LGBTQ+ inclusive
data collection efforts, and international-national-local collaborations
with LGBTQ+ communities are needed to ameliorate climate change-
related LGBTQ+ health disparities. These measures are key to ensur-
ing that LGBTQ+ populations have every opportunity to recover from
climate-related disasters without additional harm.
