A note on the design 
The creation of the artwork, illustrations, 
and design was led by a team of Indigenous 
artists and designers who ensured that the 
overall design was grounded in the Land. They 
ensured the work did not focus on particular 
cultural references or stereotyped icons that 
could exclude any nation, group or person. The 
artwork depicts various subjects, from berries 
to birds and landscapes. The colours and lines 
of the work bring to life the intricate and 
diverse relationships between people and the 
Land, highlighting the importance of the future.
6 For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report
First Nations, Inuit and Métis have responded to the 
impacts of environmental and climate change before, are 
actively responding today, and will continue to do so in 
the future. Our communities have unique strengths to 
address the climate crisis, despite facing disproportionate 
impacts from climate change and challenges related to 
the ongoing legacy of colonization.
Key Messages
This report is structured around five key messages. While the interpretation of each message might 
vary slightly across our various homelands based on our unique backgrounds and histories, they 
were identified and developed collaboratively to find commonality across our experiences. These 
messages are central to conveying our knowledge and our calls to urgent action on climate change. 
They are supported by examples and case stories that highlight Indigenous-led initiatives in climate 
change adaptation.
Indigenous Peoples 
have unique strengths
for responding to 
environmental and 
climate changes
Climate change is 
one of many crises
that First Nations, 
Inuit and Métis face.
Climate change causes serious disruption not just to the 
environment and economy, but also to culture, language, 
knowledge transfer, ceremony, identity, health and well-
being. These impacts are interrelated and intersect with 
other crises that First Nations, Inuit and Métis face.
Indigenous Knowledge 
Systems and lived 
experiences are 
essential components 
of climate action
To effectively address the impacts of climate change, it’s 
crucial to include Indigenous observations, knowledge 
systems and diverse lived experiences, especially those 
of gender-diverse individuals, women and youth, in 
all aspects of climate change research, strategies and 
decision-making processes. First Nations, Inuit and Métis 
have unique and diverse indicators and methods for 
observing, monitoring and assessing change.
For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report 7
The food, water and 
energy nexus is central 
to First Nation, Inuit and 
Métis climate leadership  
Self-determination 
is critical to
Indigenous-led 
climate action   
Food sovereignty is at the heart of First Nation, Inuit 
and Métis cultures. The nexus of food, water and energy 
sovereignty is a key priority for First Nations, Inuit 
and Métis. In each context, reasserting authority and 
decision-making is enabling a redistribution of power 
towards First Nations, Inuit and Métis. The revitalization 
of meaningful Indigenous economies based on 
relationships with the Land, Water and Ice are central to 
this redistribution and to Indigenous-led climate action.
Self-determination and governance are key rights and 
aspirations for First Nations, Inuit and Métis in the face 
of climate change. We must recognize and address 
how the impacts of climate change affect our ability 
to determine our own futures, govern ourselves and 
adapt our governance structures to the impacts of 
climate change.
8 For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report
1.0	Preface
While Indigenous Peoples have been urgently 
and consistently voicing concerns to warn of 
the irreversible impacts of climate change for 
decades, our perspectives and expertise have 
often been constrained within non-Indigenous 
frameworks of climate change policy and 
research.
The For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience 
Report is the first, stand-alone report that 
discusses climate change impacts, experiences 
and approaches to climate change from 
the perspectives of First Nations, Inuit and 
Métis living in what is currently known as 
Canada. This report acknowledges the distinct 
Knowledge Systems and perspectives of 
Indigenous Peoples, and the importance of 
self-determination in understanding and 
addressing climate change. This knowledge and 
these perspectives are credible and valid on 
their own, without the need for integration into 
other processes and frameworks.
The key messages of the report are intended to 
be broad enough to reflect various homelands, 
based on the distinct backgrounds and 
histories of First Nations, Inuit and Métis. They 
draw from a set of shared principles rather than 
attempting to represent all Indigenous Peoples 
and regions across Canada. The report aims to 
offer a wide range of examples from existing 
research, community experiences, stories and 
case studies to foster inspiration and ongoing 
dialogues for the future. We have made 
every effort to reference specific Indigenous 
Peoples and their associated communities 
wherever possible. 
As we have heard from Elders and Indigenous 
leaders, it is crucial to read this report with 
a sense of urgency. The impacts of climate 
change are accelerating as we approach an 
ecological and relational tipping point (Whyte, 
2019). However, we can avert the most severe 
climate impacts if we take pause and listen to 
the wisdom of First Nations, Inuit and Métis. 
We urge policymakers, academics, and business 
leaders at all levels—local, territorial, national 
and international—to act now on the key 
messages and insights presented in this report.
We invite you to join us on this journey—urgent 
action on these messages is vital for our future.

2.0	Opening words
“
The Earth is alive and climate change is really nature releasing its forces to clean the Earth, to 
bring us back into balance. We shouldn’t look at climate change as a negative thing. It is because 
of how we have behaved as human beings that we have to feel the impact of what we have done 
to the Earth. Ultimately it will be Mother Earth that will correct us as humanity, because of the 
love she has for us.”
– Elder Dave Courchene-baa (Nii Gaani Aki Inini – Leading Earth Man), Anishinaabe
Knowledge Keeper (Turtle Lodge Central House of Knowledge, 2019, p. 13)
“
We’re finding in the Inuit world that the solutions to our problems, to addressing the trauma 
and the health and social issues, lie very close to home and within ourselves…. The world that is 
seeking a better and more sustainable way, the Indigenous belief that we are all connected, it’s 
the medicine the world seeks. If we can address our problems this way, we can contribute greatly 
to solutions…. It’s a time of great pause and a change of great perspectives. A new way of doing 
things is coming.”
– Siila Watt-Cloutier (quoted in Kelsey, 2022)
“
The teaching of the seventh generation and kinship are so interrelated, it is that we are all 
interconnected. And so, we are all future ancestors and we all share a common responsibility. 
So how are we going to be responsible future ancestors? … I envision Indigenous Nations leading 
the way in meaningful climate action and I see our young people taking charge and designing a 
future that restores balance.” 
– Mihskakwan James Harper
(Excerpt from SevenGen2022: The Power of Kinship, Indigenous Youth Energy Summit)
“
It’s essential for Métis youth to not only be heard, but [be] at the forefront of this issue…. I wish 
that in academia, more attention was brought to what it means to truly be on the Land and 
what it means to be Indigenous to the Land. And the connection between the two, I think, has 
really strengthened my understanding of climate change, and makes me want to fight for it 
even more.”

3.1 Our approach to writing 
this report
This is the first comprehensive report on 
climate change impacts, experiences and 
approaches written from the perspectives of 
First Nations, Inuit and Métis living in what is 
currently known as Canada. The objective of 
this report is to recognize, highlight and elevate 
Indigenous Knowledge, rights, expertise, issues, 
perspectives and experiences concerning 
climate change and its impacts within 
Canada. We aim for this report to be useful in 
research and policy domains as well as within 
communities themselves. It acknowledges the 
diversity of Indigenous Peoples in Canada in 
terms of culture, capacity, governance and 
geography, and marks a unique opportunity for 
the direct inclusion of Indigenous Knowledge 
and experiences into Canada’s National 
Knowledge Assessment process.1
Central to our approach is a focus on rights- 
and responsibilities-based approaches to uplift 
the work of First Nations, Inuit and Métis in 
driving climate action at local, regional, national 
and international levels. This approach has 
gained increasing recognition and support from 
the Government of Canada as it advances work 
on Indigenous climate leadership.
Our author team, comprising over twenty 
authors and reviewers, is diverse and includes 
Indigenous academics, leaders, students, 
women, men, harvesters and youth from 
across the country. We are affiliated with 
universities, national Indigenous organizations, 
community-led organizations and Indigenous 
non-governmental organizations (INGOs) and 
are all deeply committed to caring for and 
maintaining strong connections to our families 
and communities. All members of our author 
team and reviewers are Indigenous, with two 
exceptions: Shari Fox and Anne Kendrick, both 
of whom have several decades of experience 
working with Indigenous Peoples.
We initiated the development of this report 
with a face-to-face meeting of the author team 
on Anishinaabe Algonquin Aki (also known as 
Ottawa) in February 2020. This meeting was 
crucial for establishing personal connections 
and focused on the co-development of broad 
key principles (see Box 1) and key messages 
to guide our work. While we initially planned 
multiple in-person author meetings on the 
Land and in our communities throughout the 
report’s development, the global pandemic 
necessitated a shift to virtual collaboration
(see Section 3.5).
The authors co-developed sections of the 
report based on our unique experiences, 
expertise and professional training, consistently 
revisiting and reflecting on the key principles 
and values established early in the process 
(see Box 1). Additionally, we sought external 
input; for example, we conducted a virtual 
write-shop to strengthen specific text areas 
and to collectively develop the Moving Forward 
section, which addresses knowledge gaps and 
emerging issues (see Section 10.0).
To enhance the rigor of our approach, the 
report underwent peer review by First Nation, 
Inuit and Métis scholars. This diverse group of 
experts ensured the appropriate expression of 
Indigenous perspectives, identified strengths 
and weaknesses and contributed to better 
regional representation.
Collaboration was fundamental throughout the 
development of this report—the key messages, 
key principles and content were developed 
iteratively by the author team and refined over 
time. The broad and engaged approach used 
to develop this report reflects the collaborative 
spirit that exists and is needed to understand 
the impacts of climate change from First 
Nations, Inuit and Métis perspectives.

BOX 1: Key principles underlying this report
At the outset, the author team recognized the importance of establishing key principles to guide our work in 
a good way. We asked ourselves: What are the values that guide our thinking and writings about Indigenous 
Knowledge, expertise, wisdom, perspectives and experiences regarding climate change? What principles 
should guide the development and communication of our messages? Across our diverse Nations, languages 
and cultures as Indigenous Peoples, and informed by the teachings of our Elders and Knowledge Keepers, 
we identified the common principles in Table 1. These have been continually revisited to guide our work 
substantively and methodologically.
TABLE 1: KEY PRINCIPLES
Agency
First Nations, Inuit and Métis have agency within our societal systems and we must 
be able to exercise this agency as leaders and equal participants in mainstream systems. 
As rights- and title-holders, we play an integral role in research and climate policy 
decision‑making. We have always held and continue to hold critical knowledge and 
expertise necessary for observing, understanding, assessing and responding to climate 
change. We are leaders in research, monitoring and developing comprehensive approaches to address 
climate change, despite experiencing disproportionate impacts.
Diversity
We honour and seek all opportunities to clarify and celebrate the diversity of languages, 
histories, governance, gender and cultures among First Nations, Inuit and Métis living in what 
is currently known as Canada.
Hope and love
Aligned with Indigenous Knowledge and laws, we strive to instill messages of hope and love to 
honour the teachings that direct us to choose life and draw on our Ancestors’ strengths in support 
of life and future generations.
Indigenous Knowledge and lived experience
We recognize and honour the knowledge and lived experience of our Peoples, handed 
down over millennia, as equal to academic training. We seek every opportunity to elevate 
Indigenous expertise, wisdom and knowledge systems to a level equal to western science. 
This includes recognizing our Indigenous languages as carriers of our knowledges, and we 
seek every opportunity to honour, preserve, revitalize and promote Indigenous languages.
Indigenous-led approaches
We acknowledge that First Nations, Inuit and Métis are active drivers, leaders and innovators 
in approaches to addressing climate change.
For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report 13
Legacy of colonization and dispossession
The capacity of First Nations, Inuit and Métis to respond to urgent crises should be understood in 
the context of the ongoing impacts of colonialism, land dispossession, assimilation policies, various 
inequities, and chronic underfunding. We acknowledge that bold action is crucial to address justice 
and equity issues for First Nations, Inuit and Métis. It is also vital to provide the necessary tools 
and support to advance decolonization and decarbonization.
Natural Laws
We prioritize lessons from our Natural Laws, which teach us to rebalance our relationship 
with the Earth. Natural Law is a set of laws that originate directly from the Creator, and 
directly from the Land, rooted in our diverse languages, oral histories and ceremonies. These 
laws govern our interactions with the Land, Water and more-than-human relatives.
Relationships
We recognize that relationships are central to our systems and ways of life. While technocratic 
approaches are commonly used in addressing climate change, we understand that true change 
stems from realigning relationships and values. It is important that we realign our relationships 
with the Land, Water and Ice, with our more-than-human relations and each other. This realignment 
involves moving from values of accumulation, scarcity and competition to those of abundance, cooperation 
and reciprocity.
Rights-holders and Lands
First Nations, Inuit and Métis have rights and responsibilities within the context of our own systems 
(e.g., Indigenous laws, legal orders, legal traditions, customs, etc.). There are also complex constellations 
of rights expressed in mainstream systems, including provincial, territorial, federal and international 
laws. We acknowledge this plurality of laws to ensure that these systems are appropriately considered 
in all that we do. The rights of First Nations, Inuit and Métis over Lands are increasingly recognized, 
affirming our role as decision-makers in climate change.
Self-determination and governance
While diverse, Indigenous governance systems are founded on long-standing, place-based 
relationships with the Land, Water and Ice, as well as with human and more-than-human relations. 
We honour these relationships and recognize the interconnectedness between ourselves and 
the Land, Water and Ice as one entity. Self-determination is our ability to freely determine our 
political status and pursue our economic, social and cultural development.
Urgency 
We recognize that the impacts of climate change compound existing, interrelated crises, contributing 
to states of emergency that First Nations, Inuit and Métis face daily. These crises are wide-ranging, 
from failing physical infrastructure, such as clean drinking water and housing, to ongoing colonization, 
marginalization and racism. Urgent and significant action, with long-term considerations, is needed to 
address these crises.
Valuing Youth
We acknowledge the unique contributions and knowledge that Indigenous youth bring to addressing 
climate change. We have sought opportunities to meaningfully include them in the production of 
this report.
14 For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report
In developing this report, we encountered 
challenges, including the tensions in creating 
an “Indigenous report” that reflects diverse 
perspectives, experiences, and knowledge 
of Indigenous Peoples across Canada, and 
defining what “Indigenous” means. For this 
report, we define “Indigenous” as encompassing 
the three distinct groups in Canada: First 
Nations, Inuit and Métis. We acknowledge 
the distinct cultures within the “Indigenous” 
umbrella, the diversity between and within 
these groups, and that our experiences of 
climate change impacts and adaptation are 
inseparable from the wide and diverse set of 
cultures, histories, experiences and languages 
of First Nations, Inuit and Métis across the 
country. This also extends, as much as possible, 
to First Nations, Inuit and Métis living in urban 
areas, who make up more than half of all 
Indigenous Peoples in Canada.
Out of respect and a commitment to 
recognizing this diversity as central to our 
work, we must acknowledge our limitations in 
fully capturing the complexity of knowledge 
systems, and the climate change impacts and 
adaptation experiences of First Nations, Inuit 
and Métis across Canada. Instead, this report 
and its five key messages aim to provide 
a framework to guide the consideration 
and inclusion of Indigenous Peoples and 
Indigenous Knowledge Systems in climate-
related discussions. These discussions must 
continue directly with rights- and title-holders. 
We view this report as an initial and essential 
step for future Indigenous-led climate change 
assessments, as well as measures and policy 
changes at local, provincial, national and 
international levels that incorporate First 
Nations, Inuit and Métis, along with Indigenous 
Knowledge Systems, experiences and 
perspectives.
3.2 Citations, evidence and 
Indigenous methodologies
Citation is a practice of valuation that 
prioritizes certain forms of impact, relevance 
and importance (Ahmed, 2013). In this 
report, our author team strived to advance 
Indigenous ways of knowing within a practice 
often rooted in extractive and predominantly 
non-Indigenous ideologies. These ideologies 
prioritize knowledge production and, in 
academic contexts, peer-review for tenure 
and promotion (Todd, 2016; Lewis, 2012). 
More directly, citations and their associated 
politics can reproduce “…the popular myth that 
research is done by English-speaking, white, 
cis men” (Liboiron, 2020, p.97). Additionally, 
hierarchies reproduced within academia often 
favor human-generated and written knowledge, 
reflecting the entrenchment of settler colonial 
knowledge and practices (Burgess et al., 
2021; Younging, 2018; Simpson, 2017). As a 
result, the richness of oral and visual traditions 
and the intergenerational knowledge held 
within communities and with our more-than-
human relations are frequently overlooked 
(Kimmerer, 2013).
This report draws on and cites published and 
peer-reviewed literature but also includes 
quotations from Elders, case studies, references 
to videos, multimedia, online works and 
integrates art and personal stories. In doing 
so, we adopt a decolonial methodology that 
actively provides space for Indigenous Peoples 
and voices (Ferrazzi et al., 2019; Zavala, 2013; 
Smith, 2012). Our work is broadly situated 
within an Indigenous research paradigm to 
empower Indigenous Peoples’ research that is 
culturally relevant and accountable (Kovach, 
2021; Chiblow, 2020; Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami 
[ITK], 2019a, 2019b; Smith, 2012; S. Wilson, 
2008). This research paradigm broadly informs 
our understanding of “evidence.”
For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report 15
By drawing on and embodying Indigenous 
ontologies (the nature of being) and 
epistemologies (theories of knowledge), we 
underscore that relationships within and 
between humans and the natural world 
are based on principles of reciprocity, non-
exploitation and respectful coexistence 
(Coulthard, 2014). We prioritize the 5 “Rs” of 
Indigenous Land-, Ice- and Water-first research: 
relationships, respect, relevance, reciprocity 
and responsibility (Styres and Zinga, 2013). 
Overall, our author team aimed to deconstruct 
dominant assumptions underlying colonial 
systems of climate change solutions by 
centering Indigenous sovereignty in the design, 
implementation and writing of this report2 
(Neville and Coulthard, 2019).
3.3 Report context and significance
Given the history, context and the dangerous 
trajectory of current global climate inaction 
(Carr, 2022), it is “…not rational for Indigenous 
[P]eoples to rely on these global, national and
regional economic and political frameworks
for climate justice and a sustainable future”
(McGregor et al., 2020, p. 36). Therefore, the
For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report
stands as a unique, independent document
that acknowledges Indigenous Peoples,
our knowledge systems and our distinct
perspectives. This is crucial for several reasons.
2	
Resources on Indigenous ontologies, epistemologies and methodologies are readily available (e.g., 
Kovach, 2021; McGregor et al., 2018; Wilson, 2008).
3	
Indigenous Peoples continue to challenge state notions and policy debates in various historical and 
contemporary ways. For instance, Nunavut, a Canadian territory with a public government, often 
experiences federal top-down policy approaches due to its power structure. However, Inuit, forming the 
majority population in Nunavut, also exert significant bottom-up influence as rights- and title-holders. 
While the top-down policy approach applies universally to all citizens, the bottom-up approach is more 
targeted, addressing specific policy issues.
First, Indigenous Knowledge, perspectives and 
experiences with environmental crises and 
change are often overlooked in mainstream 
climate dialogues and assessments. This 
oversight leads to persistent failures 
in addressing the concurrent crises of 
colonization and dispossession (Zurba et 
al., 2022; McGregor, 2019; Watt-Cloutier, 
2015; Downing and Cuerrier, 2011). This 
neglect is frequently evident in government 
approaches to policy and analysis, which are 
entrenched within specific social and ecological 
frameworks (e.g., Indigenous Climate Action, 
2021a). The 2022 Working Group Report II 
on Impacts, Vulnerability and Adaptation 
of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC, 2022) was the first global 
climate change assessment to acknowledge 
colonialism (see also Section 3.4). Our report, in 
contrast, emphasizes Indigenous place-based 
approaches to addressing climate change and 
the frameworks of knowing, being and doing 
that inform them.3
Second, there has been only incremental 
progress in recognizing Indigenous Peoples’ 
knowledge systems as equally valid and in 
promoting equitable and open involvement 
of Indigenous Peoples in western science and 
policy dialogues (Expert Panel on Climate 
Change Adaptation and Resilience, 2018).
16 For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report
Third, when Indigenous Knowledge Systems 
have been considered in western science 
and policy debates, it has often been done 
primarily by non-Indigenous scholars, who 
in specific circumstances have marginalized, 
misinterpreted, or misappropriated systems of 
knowledge that are not their own.
Now is the time for Indigenous leadership 
and authorship—and by extension, the more 
appropriate inclusion of our knowledge systems 
in climate change assessments, research and 
policy discussions. It’s time to create our own 
space where our knowledge systems are not 
merely included but are given priority, actively 
embodied, and effectively communicated, as 
seen in initiatives like Climate Science 2050: 
Advancing Science and Knowledge on Climate 
Change (Climate Science 2050) (Government 
of Canada, 2020a).
This framing aligns with other key Indigenous 
approaches to climate change, such as the 
National Inuit Climate Change Strategy (ITK, 
2019a), Assembly of First Nations’ National 
Climate Strategy (Assembly of First Nations, 
2023), Métis Nation Climate Change and 
Health Vulnerability Assessment (JF Consulting, 
2020) and Inuvialuit Settlement Region 
Climate Change Strategy and Climate Change 
Action Map (Inuvialuit Regional Corporation, 
2022). Indigenous Climate Leadership was 
explicitly acknowledged in the Government 
of Canada’s strengthened climate plan, 
A Healthy Environment and A Healthy 
Economy (Government of Canada, 2020b), 
which recognizes the importance of self-
determination by and for Indigenous Peoples, 
and in Canada’s first National Adaptation 
Strategy (Government of Canada, 2023). This 
strategy upholds Indigenous rights as one of 
its guiding principles and includes a dedicated 
annex for Indigenous climate change strategies 
and action.
3.4	Recognizing the impact of 
colonialism
It cannot be overstated how the broader 
historical and ongoing inequities and injustices 
resulting from settler colonialism, along with 
imposed policies, governance and laws, 
compound the impacts of climate change for 
Indigenous Peoples (Funes, 2022; Huntington 
et al., 2019; Arsenault et al., 2018; Collins 
et al., 2017). It wasn’t until 2022, more than 
three decades after its establishment, that 
the IPCC acknowledged colonialism as a 
driver of climate change: “Vulnerability of 
ecosystems and people to climate change 
differs substantially among and within regions 
(very high confidence), driven by patterns of 
intersecting socio-economic development, 
unsustainable ocean and land use, inequity, 
marginalization, historical and ongoing patterns 
of inequity such as colonialism and governance 
(high confidence)” (IPCC, 2022, p. 12).
This context is crucial for understanding each 
key message in our report, particularly the one 
on the unique strengths of Indigenous Peoples 
to respond to environmental and climate 
change (see Section 5.0). Settler colonialism 
and its manifestations, such as extractivism, 
structural racism and discrimination, have led 
to the estrangement, exclusion, displacement 
and forcible removal of First Nations, Inuit 
and Métis from our traditional territories and, 
by extension, of our caretaking and decision-
making related to those territories. This has 
limited our ability to exercise authority in 
our lived environments and overlooked the 
concerns we have raised about ecosystem 
destruction since the arrival of Europeans in 
the Americas over five centuries ago. There 
are many elements and layers to this context 
that we are unable to address within the scope 
of this report. Climate change must be seen 
For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report 17
as “intimately connected to the ideologies, 
systems and practices of colonialism” and the 
dynamics of “intensified forms of patriarchy, 
western scientific imperialism and aggressive 
neo-liberalism that marginalize Indigenous 
Knowledge and practices as relevant only 
to the Indigenous Peoples who hold them” 
(Lewis et al., 2020, p. 898). Without analyzing 
historical and ongoing colonialism, we risk 
perpetuating approaches that continue to fail 
(McGregor, 2019; Cameron, 2012). Essentially, 
settler colonialism has undermined Indigenous 
Peoples’ right to live well. Most mainstream 
assessments of climate change and the 
natural environment overlook colonialism in 
their analyses (Cameron et al., 2022, 2019; 
Cameron, 2012).
Indigenous Peoples are reasserting authority 
over a range of issues, including governance 
and control of our education, health care, 
research, food systems, water and energy 
resources. This work is complex, and Canada’s 
constitutional authority divisions of power 
and jurisdiction over Indigenous Peoples 
affect First Nations, Inuit and Métis in 
different ways (see Box 2). A distinctions-
based approach, recognizing the specific 
rights, interests, priorities and concerns of 
First Nations, Inuit and Métis, while respecting 
our unique cultures, histories, rights, laws 
and governments, is increasingly used 
(Government of Canada, 2018; Government 
of British Columbia, n.d.). Indigenous women, 
in particular, have worked for generations 
to overcome the unique impacts of colonial 
patriarchal structures on their lives and 
communities, striving to restore their 
relationships with the natural world and 
participate in governance and political decision-
making, including climate action (Asselin and 
Basile, 2018).
The implementation of the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples (UNDRIP) and the multiple calls to 
action by Canada’s Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission focus on Indigenization and 
decolonization processes, with implications 
for climate change research and action. 
Decolonized climate change research and 
action are anchored in place-based knowledge 
systems, where Indigenous perspectives, 
knowledge and methodologies are rooted. 
It has been increasingly recognized that 
Indigenous Peoples’ governance, knowledge 
systems and legal orders are central to 
supporting and enabling adaptive capacity 
in the face of climate change (Deranger et 
al., 2022; Reed et al., 2021b; McGregor et 
al., 2020; Cameron et al., 2019; McGregor, 
2017). This report aims to offer a decolonizing 
lens to the current climate change dialogue in 
Canada by centering Indigenous Knowledge, 
perspectives and realities.
18 For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report
BOX 2: Overview of First Nations, Inuit and Métis rights and governance 
in Canada
The contemporary framework for Indigenous rights, governance and authority across the country is 
complex. In 1982, the Canadian Constitution was patriated, and included Aboriginal and treaty rights. 
These rights are also protected and recognized by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, 
which guarantees equal protection and benefit of the law to all individuals, including First Nations, 
Inuit and Métis. Section 35 of the Constitution ensures that “the existing aboriginal and treaty rights 
of the aboriginal peoples of Canada are hereby recognized and affirmed,” with subsection (2) defining 
“aboriginal peoples of Canada” as including “Indian” (i.e., First Nations), Inuit and Métis peoples of 
Canada. Nevertheless, each Indigenous group has a distinct history and governance arrangement.
First Nations
First Nation rights are the most diverse and there are more than 630 distinct First Nations in Canada 
and more than half of First Nations peoples live off reserve. The reserves are technically on Crown 
land and subject to the Indian Act—a colonial piece of legislation put in place in 1876. The Indian Act 
outlines the legal status of First Nations and their communities in Canada and has been amended 
several times to address issues of self-government and land rights. Through the Royal Proclamation 
of 1763, the Crown confirmed the existence of First Nations’ title over their lands and that title could 
only be ceded through treaty. Treaties between the Crown and First Nations, such as the treaties 
signed in the late 1700s and early 1800s, are recognized as legal agreements under the Canadian 
Constitution. These treaties can be separated into three categories, although many First Nations have 
not signed treaties with Canada: 
•	
Pre-confederation: Before Confederation in 1867, First Nations signed treaties with the Crown
(representing the British government) to “share” large portions of their ancestral territories in
exchange for certain guarantees and promises, such as the right to hunt and fish on the lands,
annuity payments and the provision of goods and services. Notable pre-Confederation treaties
include the Peace and Friendship Treaties (1760/1761), Treaty of Niagara (1764), the Treaty of
Fort Pitt (1870) and the Treaty of Medicine Lodge (1867).
•	
Numbered treaties: After Confederation, the Canadian government continued to negotiate
treaties with First Nations across the country to open up new territories for settlement and
resource extraction. Known as the “Numbered Treaties,” these cover a vast area of Canada and
were signed between 1871 and 1921. They include, for example, Treaty 1 (1871), Treaty 2 (1871),
Treaty 4 (1874), Treaty 6 (1876), Treaty 7 (1877) and Treaty 8 (1899).
•	
Modern treaties: In recent decades, the Canadian government has entered into negotiations with
First Nations to reach modern treaties that provide greater self-government and control over their
lands and resources. These treaties often include provisions for lands, resources, governance and
economic development, and are designed to address the ongoing issues of treaties that were not
fully implemented in the past. Some of the notable modern treaties include the James Bay and
Northern Quebec Agreement (1975), the Nisga’a Treaty (1998), and the Tsawwassen First Nation
Final Agreement (2009).
It is important to note that while these treaties and agreements provide some recognition of First 
Nations rights, First Nations continue to face ongoing challenges regarding the implementation and 
enforcement of their treaty rights.
For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report 19
Inuit
The majority of Inuit live in 51 communities spread across the Canadian Arctic, though one in four 
Inuit live outside of Inuit Nunangat (Inuit homelands) and half of those individuals live in urban 
centres, primarily Ottawa/Gatineau, Edmonton, and Montreal. Inuit governance includes land 
claim organizations and regional associations. These systems in the four regions that make up 
Inuit Nunangat—Nunavik (northern Québec), Nunatsiavut (northern Labrador), Nunavut and the 
Inuvialuit Settlement Region (the Northwest Territories)—are recognized and protected in land claim 
agreements, some of which have been in place for a long time (over three decades). These land claim 
agreements provide extensive surface, subsurface, onshore and offshore rights in the Arctic, making 
space for Inuit to participate in decision-making related to the management of lands and waters. 
Métis 
The Métis emerged as a distinct Indigenous Peoples and nation in the historic Northwest during 
the late 18th century. The historic Métis Nation Homeland encompasses the Prairie Provinces of 
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta and extends into contiguous parts of Ontario, British Columbia, 
the Northwest Territories, and the northern United States.  The legal recognition and protection 
of Métis rights and governance in Canada has been a complex and evolving issue. Historically, the 
Métis People, who are descendants of First Nations and European settlers, pushed for their unique 
recognition. For example, through the Manitoba Act, the Government of Canada promised to recognize 
Métis land rights in Manitoba and provide 1.4 million acres of land for Métis people. This commitment 
went unfulfilled and contributed to the displacement of Métis people from the Red River area.
There have been several court cases, such as R. v. Powley (2003), that have clarified the legal test for 
the recognition of Métis rights, and the Constitution Act, 1982 confirmed their rights as Indigenous 
Peoples in Canada. In terms of governance, Métis have historically had their own distinct governance 
structures, including the Métis National Council, which supports its four governing members: the 
Métis Nation of Alberta, the Métis Nation of Ontario, the Métis Nation British Columbia and the 
Métis Nation-Saskatchewan. The Manitoba Métis Federation serves as the government of the Red 
River Métis, also known as the Manitoba Métis, representing their claims, rights, and interests. The 
North Slave Métis Alliance is a non-profit society that represents the Aboriginal rights-bearing Métis 
People of the Northwest Territories, who primarily exercise their Aboriginal rights north and east of 
Great Slave Lake. There is only one legislated regime that recognizes Métis land and local governance: 
the Métis Settlement legislation in Alberta, which created eight Métis settlements. Recognition 
of these governance structures by the Canadian government has been limited, and Métis People 
continue to work towards greater self-determination and recognition of their rights and governance 
structures.
20 For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report
3.5	How to read this report
The For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience 
Report, like the rest of the National Knowledge 
Assessment, is based on existing work. Drawing 
on this foundation and further supported by 
words, stories, multimedia and case stories 
showcasing current and ongoing work in many 
communities, we aim for the For Our Future: 
Indigenous Resilience Report to be useful in 
research and policy domains as well as within 
communities themselves. We use specific case 
stories from the perspectives and experiences 
of First Nations, Inuit and Métis to provide 
concrete examples, following a consistent 
structure in each section. Each begins with a 
reiteration of the key message, followed by an 
accessible takeaway paragraph summarizing the 
essence of the message. This is followed by an 
introduction and several subsections exploring 
supportive evidence.
3.6	COVID-19 and three 
exceptional years
The profound impact of the global COVID-19 
pandemic on our communities cannot be 
overstated or overlooked in the context of this 
report (Richmond et al., 2021; ITK, 2020a; 
United Nations Department of Economic 
and Social Affairs, 2020). COVID-19 has 
overwhelmed First Nations, Inuit and Métis 
governments and communities who have 
struggled with active cases, hospitalizations 
and deaths. We extend our deepest respect 
to those who have worked tirelessly in our 
communities, and we offer our support and 
condolences to all who have been affected 
by the virus—we acknowledge your hardships 
and loss.
The unique experiences that First Nations, Inuit 
and Métis have faced and continue to face due 
to COVID-19, is exacerbated by colonialism 
and its structural impacts on our communities. 
These include forced removal from our 
Lands, Waters and territories; lack of access 
to clean water and sanitation; overcrowded 
and substandard housing; food and water 
insecurity; disruptions in essential community 
services; and chronic underfunding of medical 
services, facilities and transportation. These 
factors directly affect health (physical, mental, 
spiritual and emotional), impact the availability 
of time, and reduce the capacity to respond 
and engage with everyday work demands, 
outside activities and other ongoing critical 
issues such as climate change (Bowers et al., 
2021; Kenny, 2020). Despite these challenges, 
First Nation, Inuit and Métis governments have 
reasserted jurisdiction over the past three years 
by implementing borders, strict quarantines, 
testing rules for returning community members 
and mobilizing mutual-aid and care economies 
within urban centres.
Throughout the pandemic, we have witnessed 
a continued emphasis on and active facilitation 
of increased industrial and extractive activities 
that continue to impact the inherent, Treaty 
and constitutionally-protected rights of 
First Nations, Inuit and Métis. The concept 
of “building back better” and “re-opening 
the economy” may not adequately address 
the structural legacy of colonization on our 
infrastructure, governance and ways of life for 
First Nations, Inuit and Métis (Busby, 2021). 
The pandemic has underscored the need for 
distinctions-based data to understand and 
respond to the unique health and economic 
needs of Indigenous Peoples (Obed, 2020), 
with implications for addressing future crises 
and climate impacts.
For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report 21
In the context of developing this report, 
the combined impact of events during 
2020–2023—including the COVID-19 
pandemic, the increasing number of extreme 
climate events (especially the atmospheric 
river event in British Columbia and the 
wildfires in British Columbia, Yukon, Quebec 
and Alberta) and the “discovery” of unmarked 
graves at Indian Residential Schools across 
the country—were acutely felt by the author 
team and are reflected in the report’s key 
messages. Many on our team were affected 
by the stresses and upheavals in work, family 
life or health that necessarily took precedence 
over meetings and writing. Our authors, who 
are parents, grandparents, community leaders, 
artists, educators, caregivers, entrepreneurs 
and also fill many other roles, all of which were 
disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic 
and the exceptional events of the past few 
years, with those in northern, rural and remote 
communities being particularly affected.
Despite these challenges, we consider this 
report to be illustrative of a broad perspective 
on the unique impacts of climate change and 
adaptation approaches that First Nations, Inuit 
and Métis face in Canada. It is not, however, 
intended to be a comprehensive representation 
of all the climate leadership activities 
undertaken by First Nations, Inuit and Métis 
citizens, governments and organizations across 
the country. A thorough survey of this climate 
leadership must be done in full partnership 
with First Nations, Inuit and Métis.

4.0 Introduction
Indigenous Peoples have already experienced 
changes in the Lands, Waters and Ice, sounding 
the alarm about climate change for decades 
(Indigenous Climate Action, 2021a; ITK, 
2019a; Watt-Cloutier, 2015; Bolton et al., 
2011; Inuit Circumpolar Council Canada [ICC], 
2005; ITK, 2005). Drawing on knowledge and 
observations shared by Elders and Knowledge 
Keepers, and their reciprocal relationships 
with the natural world, Indigenous Peoples 
have been urgently and consistently voicing 
concerns about the irreversible impacts of 
climate change. For instance, the 2005 Inuit 
Petition to the Inter-American Commission on 
Human Rights to Oppose Climate Change Caused 
by the United States of America opened a global 
dialogue on the ties between the violation 
of human rights and impacts caused by 
climate inaction.
Specific impacts experienced by First Nations, 
Inuit and Métis are discussed throughout this 
report but generally include observed changes 
in wildlife and species migrations, shifting 
water levels, more variable weather patterns, 
increased intensity and frequency of forest 
fires, changing sea ice and freshwater ice 
conditions, impacts on health and well-being, 
effects on built infrastructure, and changes in 
vegetation, coastal processes, permafrost and 
more (see HCCC; NIR; RPR; Deranger et al., 
2022; Galway et al., 2022; Reed et al., 2021b; 
McGregor et al., 2020; Cunsolo Willox, 2012; 
Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, 2005; 
Krupnik and Jolly, 2002).
Western science is now beginning to recognize 
what Indigenous Peoples have long known, and 
Indigenous Peoples are not passive witnesses 
to climate change (ITK, 2019a). As highlighted 
in this report, Indigenous Peoples are leaders, 
advancing our own climate measures and 
strategies at various scales based on our 
knowledge systems and continue to urgently 
call for action to protect the Land, Water and 
Ice (Gobby, 2020; ITK, 2019a). Our collective 
knowledge and action send a clear message: 
we are in a rapidly accelerating global climate 
crisis, already causing irreversible biophysical 
changes.
The first report from the current National 
Knowledge Assessment cycle, Canada’s 
Changing Climate Report (2019), revealed that 
Canada had already warmed by 1.7 °C since 
1948 and is projected to continue warming at 
twice the global rate, with Northern Canada 
warming over three times the global rate (Bush 
and Lemmen, 2019). Subsequent Assessment 
reports (see NIR; RPR; HCCC) assess the 
range of climate impacts Canada is currently 
experiencing and projected to face in the 
future, as well as adaptation approaches. These 
reports indicate disproportionate impacts for 
First Nations, Inuit and Métis, given our unique 
climate risks due to our lives and livelihoods 
being tied reciprocally with the Land, Water 
and Ice. Our livelihoods, especially concerning 
food, water and energy insecurity, are at risk 
and are compounded by a colonial history 
that irrevocably impacts Indigenous political, 
cultural, social and environmental systems 
(Human Rights Watch, 2020; Chisholm Hatfield 
et al., 2018; Whyte, 2017b; Ford et al., 2012; 
Tsosie, 2007).
For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report 23
Climate change impacts are exacerbated by the 
ongoing legacy of colonialism (see Section 3.5 
and Section 5.2) and how this, combined with 
capitalism, has influenced where Indigenous 
Peoples live, our socio-economic conditions, 
and how we maintain our relationships with 
Mother Earth (Whyte 2017b; 2016). These 
impacts often lead to maladaptation, leaving 
Indigenous Peoples to bear disproportionate 
impacts from mainstream approaches to 
addressing climate change (Penney and 
Johnson-Castle, 2021).
24 For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report
5.0	Indigenous Peoples have unique strengths 
for responding to environmental and 
climate changes
First Nations, Inuit and Métis have 
responded to the impacts of environmental 
and climate change before, are actively 
responding today, and will continue to do 
so in the future. Our communities have 
unique strengths to address the climate 
crisis, despite facing disproportionate 
impacts from climate change and 
challenges related to the ongoing legacy 
of colonization.
We have consistently faced and adapted to 
change, including impacts from environmental 
and climatic changes. Today, we continue to 
respond and are increasingly taking leadership 
in climate research, policy and solutions. We 
recognize the need to move away from deficit-
based approaches that view our communities 
through lenses of vulnerability and risk, towards 
strengths-based approaches that recognize 
our knowledge, skills, actions and abilities. 
Our response to climate change is continuous. 
While much of the past work has been led by 
others, we are now seeing Indigenous women, 
youth, scientists, researchers, activists, leaders, 
Elders and advocates stepping into leading roles 
to address climate change, drawing on their 
knowledge, laws, language and culture. However, 
our efforts in climate action cannot be detached 
from our ongoing endeavours to address the 
ongoing legacy of colonization.
5.1 Introduction
“
Over history, we have not had it easy. With 
colonial pressures from the government and 
mining companies, the harm done through the 
[Indian] Residential School System, our forced 
removal from our traditional communities 
and Lands, along with many other influences 
that exist in our lives today, we have an uphill 
battle. But our Elders fought and died for 
our Land and we have a duty to continue to 
protect it. There is strength and resilience in 
our people and in our community when we 
come together. We have the wisdom. We are 
the original land stewards.”
– Excerpt from Ross River Dena Council
and The Arctic Institute of Community-
Based Research, 2019, p. 8.
Impacts from the climate crisis are inextricably 
linked to ongoing processes of colonialism, 
dispossession and rights violations, but these 
connections are often overlooked in climate-
related analyses such as research, policy and 
governance. Failing to apply this lens results 
in an incomplete understanding of the depth, 
scope and effects of the environmental 
and climate crisis on Indigenous Peoples 
(Deranger et al., 2022; Cameron, 2012). 
Over the past five decades, numerous public 
commissions and inquiries have documented 
For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report 25
the impacts faced by Indigenous Peoples due 
to colonization (e.g., Missing and Murdered 
Indigenous Women and Girls, 2019; Truth 
and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, 
2015; Qikiqtani Truth Commission, 2013; 
Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, 
1996; Berger, 1977). In several of these 
reports, the impacts have been described 
as genocidal (Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission of Canada, 2015; Missing and 
Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, 2019) 
and are inseparable from the lived realities of 
Indigenous Peoples as well as the impacts of 
climate change we face today. Historical and 
ongoing colonial laws, policies and practices 
have led to significant social, spiritual, cultural, 
political, economic and environmental changes.
Given this reality, Indigenous Peoples, including 
Indigenous Elders and Knowledge Keepers, 
have called for a re-evaluation of the framing 
of climate change towards one focused on how 
human values are at the root of the climate 
crisis: a world out of balance (Cameron et al., 
2021). These values (e.g., greed, consumerism) 
have driven a set of destructive human 
behaviours and activities that disrespect 
Natural Law and are at the root cause of the 
climate crisis (for more, refer to Figure 1 in 
Cameron et al., 2021). This has resulted in a 
system of knowledge that prioritizes advances 
in technology, markets and science at the 
expense of the natural balance of life. Dakota 
Knowledge Keeper, Katherine Whitecloud, 
describes this environmental crisis as a human 
crisis: “People don’t want to acknowledge 
the state of the Earth, where it’s at right now, 
because it’s a reflection of themselves. It’s a 
reflection of their homes, their personal space, 
where the spirit and the heart reside... And 
people don’t want to look at that” (Cameron 
et al., 2021, p. 43).
Addressing this imbalance requires reorienting 
the climate agenda towards meaningful 
approaches rooted in an understanding of and 
relationship with the Land, Water and Ice. Until 
recently, the influence of these perspectives 
on local, regional, national and international 
climate change responses was limited to the 
participation of Indigenous Peoples in non-
Indigenous climate initiatives. However, this is 
changing as Indigenous Peoples increasingly 
develop our own climate change strategies, 
drawing on our knowledge systems, laws, 
governance and histories. This report draws 
on these experiences to shift from a deficit 
framing to an Indigenous-led narrative focused 
on strengths-based approaches. This shift is 
summarized in a 2019 report by the Council 
of Canadian Academies: “Indigenous Peoples 
have demonstrated a capacity for adaptation, 
resilience, and survival in the face of pervasive 
social, cultural, and environmental changes 
throughout colonial history. The multiplicative 
effects of climate change, combined with the 
impacts of colonialism, power differentials in 
Canadian society, marginalization, and loss of 
[L]and, may however affect adaptation success”
(Council of Canadian Academies, 2019, p. xi).
26 For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report
5.2 Intersecting impacts: 
colonialism and climate change 
on Indigenous Peoples
Relatively new terms, such as “eco-grief” 
and “solastalgia” describe the loss, grief, and 
despair caused by unwanted environmental 
change, such as climate change (e.g., Cunsolo 
Willox and Ellis, 2018; Cunsolo Willox, 2012). 
However, these concepts and experiences 
are not new; they encapsulate the profound 
challenges, suffering, and trauma Indigenous 
Peoples have endured due to environmental 
loss and damage since the onset of colonization 
(Whyte, 2016). This includes the dispossession 
of First Nations Lands through the Indian 
reserve system. Other examples include the 
imposition of federal and international policies 
on Inuit, such as relocations to the High Arctic 
in the 1950s and the international movement 
preventing sealskin sales (Gombay, 2014; 
Tester and Kulchyski, 1994; Wenzel, 1991), as 
well as land scrip allocations for Métis families. 
In the late 1870s, the Canadian government 
issued documents (scrip allocations) to Métis 
people living in the West that were difficult to 
access and that entitled them to Lands often 
located hundreds of kilometers away from their 
homes and communities.
While not exhaustive, this combination of 
laws, policies and actions further impacts 
Indigenous Peoples’ adaptive capacity, 
limiting our governance, cultural and language 
practices, and restricting our movements, 
thereby affecting hunting, fishing and gathering 
practices (Menzies et al., 2022). The climate-
related changes occurring now represent 
cultural threats similar to those experienced 
during the start of European settlement 
in the Americas (Whyte, 2017a; 2016). 
Therefore, for Indigenous Peoples, who often 
disproportionately bear the brunt of climate 
change impacts, these changes are not new but 
rather seen as “déjà vu” (Whyte, 2016).
5.3	Indigenous Peoples are 
actively responding to 
environmental change
Until recently, the most common approach 
to addressing climate change impacts for 
the lives of Indigenous Peoples involved our 
participation in the development of local, 
regional, national and international responses 
(e.g., accords, plans, research programs, policies 
and strategies).
However, more recently, Indigenous Peoples 
have been asserting our own climate change 
strategies and developing approaches to 
address climate change based on our own 
knowledge systems, governance structures 
and histories. For example, the National Inuit 
Climate Change Strategy (ITK, 2019a) illustrates 
how Inuit are tackling climate change issues 
on their terms, from local to global scales, and 
creating effective adaptation initiatives. These 
initiatives include supporting harvesting and 
sharing economies tailored to the needs and 
priorities of their communities (ITK, 2019a). 
Another instance is the British Columbia First 
Nations Climate Strategy and Action Plan (British 
Columbia Assembly of First Nations, 2022), co-
developed and launched in 2021 by the British 
Columbia Assembly of First Nations, the Union 
of British Columbia Indian Chiefs and the First 
Nations Summit. At a national scale, the launch 
of the Indigenous Knowledges content on the 
Climate Atlas of Canada (see Case Story 1 and 
Figure 3) demonstrates an active Two‑Eyed 
Seeing approach. This approach honours 
the diverse wisdom of Elders, Knowledge 
Keepers, community leaders and other experts 
from coast to coast to coast through videos, 
articles and climate maps at local, regional and 
national scales. During the final stages of this 
report, the Assembly of First Nations released 
their National Climate Strategy, identifying 
seven priority areas with over 100 strategies 
and actions (see Figure 1; Assembly of First 
Nations, 2023).
For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report 27
Other examples of First Nations, Inuit and 
Métis-led initiatives responding to climate 
impacts often focus on engaging in land-based 
activities. These activities aim to decolonize 
climate change approaches and centre our 
own traditions and knowledge systems. This 
includes involving youth in multi-generational 
cultural and land camps to reconnect with 
the Land (e.g., McDonald, 2023; Lines et al., 
2019) and taking action to limit climate change 
impacts through land defense action (e.g., 
Pasternak, 2020). Examples of such initiatives 
are Indigenous resistance to carbon-intensive 
or environmentally unsustainable projects on 
Indigenous Lands. Community-based research 
and action-oriented initiatives continue to grow 
and highlight the strengths and advantages of 
Indigenous Knowledge and leadership. Inuit

hunters, for example, lead research in Nunavut 
communities by documenting and monitoring 
environmental changes, thereby enhancing 
knowledge and safety. The Smart Ice Program 
(see Figure 2) and Ittaq Heritage and Research 
Centre are notable examples. First Nations, 
such as the Anishinaabe have utilized seasonal 
mobility (Whyte et al., 2019), and coastal 
First Nations have employed clam gardens to 
maintain biodiversity (Holmes et al., 2022), 
along with many other strategies to center 
approaches to addressing climate change in our 
traditions and practices.

CASE STORY 1: Indigenous Climate Atlas: Digitally weaving Indigenous 
Knowledge, climate science and storytelling to support climate change 
adaptation and resilience
The Climate Atlas of Canada—the first national 
climate data portal—was launched in 2018 
in partnership with Environment and Climate 
Change Canada. The tool was designed by the 
Prairie Climate Centre using climate data from 
the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium that 
were interactively mapped with community-
based climate films developed over many years 
by Dr. Ian Mauro and collaborators.
While the Climate Atlas was acclaimed as 
groundbreaking for combining science and 
storytelling (see Figure 3), the development 
team recognized its lack of sufficient data 
and resources for Indigenous communities. 
The team immediately set out to reimagine 
this interactive climate map in partnership with 
the Assembly of First Nations (AFN), Métis 
National Council (MNC) and Inuit partners 
and communities.
Gitxsan author, artist and climate researcher 
Hetxw’ms Gyetxw (Brett D. Huson) led the 
development of Indigenous resources within 
the Climate Atlas. This included climate data 
for over 630 First Nation reserves, more than 
50 Inuit communities and climate projects 
across the Métis Homeland. A series of 
distinctions-based Indigenous documentaries 
were also developed with Elders, Knowledge 
Keepers and Indigenous organizations and 
communities.
In spring 2022, the Indigenous Climate 
Atlas (www.climateatlas.ca/indigenous) was 
launched through an online event. This event 
featured speakers such as AFN Yukon Regional 
Chief Kluane Adamek, MNC President Cassidy 
Caron and Inuit Nobel Prize Nominee Siila 
(Sheila) Watt-Cloutier. This tool establishes a 
new standard for how to bring climate science 
and Indigenous Knowledge together to support 
community adaptation and resilience in the 
face of climate change.

30 For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report
Local, regional, national and international 
bodies, governments and civil society are 
beginning to recognize that approaches like 
the Indigenous Climate Atlas are central to 
addressing the impacts of the climate crisis. 
For instance, both the IPCC’s 6th Assessment 
Report on Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability 
(IPCC, 2022) and Canada’s Climate Science 
2050 report (Government of Canada, 2020a) 
specifically recognize the importance of 
Indigenous Peoples’ involvement in climate 
change dialogues, decision making and 
research (see Box 3). Despite this recognition, 
there often continues to be a lack of support 
for Indigenous-led, self-determined climate 
research, planning and policy in Canada 
(Deranger et al., 2022; Latulippe and Klenk, 
2020; Huntington et al., 2019). The laudable 
development of an Indigenous Climate 
Leadership Agenda, funded through the 
Government of Canada Budget 2022, in 
partnership with First Nations, Inuit and Métis, 
began during the writing of this report, though 
the outcomes are not yet finalized. 
Without robust financial and technical support 
to access, shape and guide climate change 
policymaking and decision making (Chisholm 
Hatfield et al., 2018), Indigenous Peoples are 
often left to defend our Lands, Waters and 
communities through court battles and/or 
direct action (Gobby et al., 2021). For example, 
a report by the Indigenous Environment 
Network and Oil Change International (2021) 
noted that Indigenous resistance has stopped 
or delayed greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
equivalent to at least one-quarter of annual 
emissions produced in the U.S. and Canada.  
Other examples of direct action include the 
Land Defenders at Wet’suwet’en, 1492 Land 
Back Lane in Caledonia and the Nuluujaat Land 
Guardians in Nunavut. These movements focus 
not only on returning [L]and under Indigenous 
authority and jurisdiction but also embody the 
concept: “for the [L]and to be alive so that it 
can perpetuate itself, and perpetuate us as an 
extension of itself. That’s what we want back: 
our place in keeping [L]and alive and spiritually 
connected” (Longman et al., 2020). This 
concept is captured in the framing of “Land 
Back”, a concept that has been growing in 
prominence (Reed and Gobby, 2021; Longman 
et al., 2020; Pasternak et al., 2019).
First Nations, Inuit and Métis have raised 
concerns with the framing of climate change 
responses that focus exclusively on one 
question: “How do humans achieve a reduction 
in their emissions of greenhouse gases in the 
coming few decades?” (Chakrabarty, 2019). 
Instead, Indigenous Peoples have been calling 
for a climate agenda that recognizes meaningful 
approaches stem from understanding and 
addressing the foundational question of Land 
holistically (Behn and Baker, 2019). Deranger 
et  l. (2022) operationalize this call by stating, 
“...seeing the real inclusion of Indigenous 
Peoples and the respecting of our rights as 
not just a matter of justice and equity (though 
of course that is crucial), but also as a matter 
of designing solutions actually capable of 
addressing the climate crisis” (p. 19).
The artificial separation between humans and 
nature has contributed to the paradigm of 
“progress,” and the pursuit of economic growth 
has resulted in the failure of the last thirty 
years of climate policy (Stoddard et al., 2021). 
To understand Indigenous-led contemporary 
responses to the climate crisis, understanding 
this difference in worldviews is essential 
(Godwell and Nooh, 2022; Swiderska, 2021).
For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report 31
BOX 3: Indigenous-led science and research 
Indigenous-led science and research are 
increasingly being recognized. For instance, 
under the ArcticNet Program, the Inuit 
Qaujisarnirmut Pilirijjutit is the first and only 
Inuit-led, governed and directed research 
program, supported and directed by the 
four Inuit regions (the Inuvialuit Settlement 
Region, Nunavut, Nunavik and Nunatsiavut). 
The Government of Canada is also beginning 
to recognize the importance of Indigenous-
led science and research. The Climate Science 
2050 report (Government of Canada, 2020a) 
includes a dedicated section on Indigenous-
led climate change science and knowledge. 
This section highlights the extensive 
knowledge and experiences of Indigenous 
Peoples in observing and understanding the 
impacts of climate change and states that 
incorporating this knowledge into Western 
scientific understanding of climate change is 
crucial. The report identifies specific actions 
to advance the inclusion of Indigenous-led 
strategies (p. 11): 
•	 Elevating opportunities for Indigenous
leadership and participation in
community-based monitoring;
•	 Aligning resources with research
and climate change strategies and
priorities of First Nations, Métis, and
Inuit organizations, governments, and
communities, for example, the National
Inuit Climate Change Strategy (ITK,
2019a) and future plans as they are
developed;
•	 Co-developing projects in which
Indigenous Peoples are involved at all
stages of [research, development and
deployment] RD&D, that respond to
Indigenous priorities, and that respect a
distinctions-based approach;
•	 Seeking review and approval from the
appropriate Indigenous leadership
bodies prior to conducting research on
Indigenous Lands, Waters, and Ice; and
•	 Formalizing partnerships with research
agreements.
The Climate Science 2050 report concludes 
by recognizing that these contributions 
must lead decision making related to climate 
change science and knowledge. 
5.4	Indigenous Peoples are 
responding to the climate 
crisis with strengths-based 
approaches
Indigenous Peoples have often been portrayed 
as passive victims or harbingers of climate 
change impacts in domestic and international 
dialogues (Indigenous Climate Action, 2021a; 
Belfer et al., 2017; Bunce et al., 2016; 
Cameron, 2012). However, this portrayal often 
overlooks the ways Indigenous Peoples have 
been observing, adapting and living reciprocally 
with our Lands, Waters and Ice for millennia 
(McGregor et al., 2020; McGregor, 2019). 
Cultural, spiritual and social connections of 
our Peoples to the Land, Water and Ice may 
increase our exposure and sensitivity to climate 
change impacts, but they also provide unique 
sources of strength, knowledge, understanding 
and resilience (Deranger et al., 2022; 
Hernandez et al., 2022; Reed et al., 2022; 
Galway et al., 2021).
32 For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report
Canada’s approach to including Indigenous 
Peoples in climate change discussions has 
evolved over the past seven years, largely 
due to constructive relationships built with 
First Nations, Inuit and Métis organizations 
through senior-level bilateral tables created 
in the wake of the Pan-Canadian Framework, 
as well as through Indigenous advocacy (e.g., 
emergency declarations, the Indigenous 
Guardians Program, Indigenous Protected and 
Conserved Areas) (Reed et al., 2022; Gobby et 
al., 2021). This evolution has led to progressive 
commitments to an Indigenous climate 
leadership agenda. This agenda focuses on 
“...investing in the agency of Indigenous peoples 
and communities, supporting Indigenous-led 
and delivered solutions, equipping Indigenous 
peoples with equitable resources, and ensuring 
appropriate access to funding to implement 
self-determined climate action” (Government of 
Canada, 2020b, p. 69).
5.4.1	 Indigenous climate emergency 
declarations and “All My Relations”
First Nations, Inuit and Métis have been 
actively leading and engaging in a wide range 
of activities to address climate change. These 
activities include education, land-based 
learning and healing (e.g., Ljubicic et al., 2021; 
McClain, 2021; Morales et al., 2021; Ward 
et al., 2021; Donatuto et al., 2020; Métisse 
Redvers, 2020; Mearns, 2017), Indigenous 
clean energy development (e.g., L’Hommecourt 
et al., 2022; Paquet et al., 2021; Indigenous 
Clean Energy, 2020), development of 
Indigenous Knowledge and science strategies 
(e.g., Huntington et al., 2021a; Sawatzky et 
al., 2021; Assembly of First Nations, 2020; 
Ferguson and Weaselboy, 2020; ITK 2019a, 
2018; Jones et al., 2018), co-production of 
knowledge (e.g., Fox et al., 2020), adaptation 
planning and implementation (e.g., Galway et 
al., 2022) and political action and diplomacy, 
including treaty-based diplomacy (e.g., Callison, 
2021, 2014; Kronk Warner and Abate, 2013; 
Grossman, 2008). A growing number of 
Indigenous Peoples have also released climate 
emergency declarations, calling for rapid 
de‑carbonization to meet the targets of the 
Paris Agreement. For example, the declaration 
of the Vuntut Gwitch’in First Nation in Old 
Crow, Yukon, titled Yeendoo Diinehdoo Ji’heezrit 
Nits’oo Ts’o’ Nan He’ aa (After Our Time, How 
Will the World Be?), laid the foundation for 
First Nation Chiefs across Canada to declare a 
national climate emergency in 2019.
With support from the Vuntut Gwitch’in 
leadership, the First Nations-in-Assembly 
declared a First Nations Climate Emergency 
at the 2019 Assembly of First Nations, 
stating that “...climate change constitutes a 
state of emergency for our Lands, Waters, 
animals, and peoples” (Assembly of First 
Nations, 2019). The inclusion of more-than-
humans in this declaration is emblematic 
of the relational approach that Indigenous 
Peoples have developed over millennia, also 
known as an ethic of “responsibility-based 
thinking” (Sioui and McLeman, 2014), which 
is broadly captured by the concept of “All My 
Relations” (or “sustainable relations” according 
to Ferguson and Weaselboy, 2020). This 
concept informs how Indigenous Peoples 
experience and understand the impacts 
of and approaches for adapting to climate 
change. Galway et al. (2022), in collaboration 
with Fort William First Nation Knowledge 
Holders, describe five sub-themes of their 
experiences with climate change organized 
using the “All My Relations” concept: 1) lack

CASE STORY 2: SevenGen: Empowering Indigenous youth to shape a 
sustainable energy future
SevenGen is a council composed of First 
Nations, Inuit and Métis youth from Nations 
and communities across Canada. They work 
to create equitable and sustainable pathways 
for Indigenous youth to engage, learn and 
grow as influential energy leaders in Canada.5 
SevenGen envisions that kin for seven 
generations ahead shall enjoy empowering, 
culturally rich and prosperous livelihoods, 
where the stewardship of the Earth is 
honoured and protected. The organization is 
committed to empowering Indigenous youth 
with opportunities, resources and networks to 
build sustainable and equitable communities. 
These communities are designed by Indigenous 
youth for Indigenous youth. SevenGen creates 
opportunities for youth to contribute to a 
sustainable energy future.
SevenGen was founded in 2019 through the 
SevenGen Student Energy Summit, hosted 
in Treaty 7 territory. The summit brought 
together over 250 Indigenous youth from 
across Canada, sparking a movement to 
empower Indigenous communities to lead 
and live sustainably through the intersection 
of energy, food, water and the transition to 
a sustainable economy. A second summit in 
2022, hosted on Whitecap Dakota Nation, 
advanced these discussions by focusing on 
kinship. The SevenGen Council is maintained 
through summits and the addition of new 
programming, such as the ImaGENation: 
Indigenous Youth Mentorship Program. This 
program provides equitable opportunities for 
Indigenous youth aged 18–30 from across 
Canada to receive support in designing and 
implementing ten youth-led projects focused 
on energy, environment, food and water 
issues that impact biodiversity, climate change, 
Canadian and Indigenous economies, and the 
Land. SevenGen is committed to minimizing 
barriers for Indigenous youth to participate in 
the energy sector by increasing authentic and 
meaningful action within communities.

5.4.2	 Indigenous rights and 
responsibilities
Central to strengths-based approaches is 
the recognition of the distinct status, roles 
and rights of Indigenous Peoples, affirmed in 
significant national and international human 
rights instruments, notably section 35 of the 
Canadian Constitution Act. Other instruments, 
such as the United Nations Declaration on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (2007) and 
its subsequent adoption in provincial (British 
Columbia in 2019) and federal jurisdictions 
(Canada in 2021), affirm the rights of self-
determination for Indigenous Peoples (Article 3 
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights). 
The concept of rights also considers the 
responsibilities that Indigenous Peoples carry 
when interacting with the more-than-human 
world. These responsibilities, as underlined by 
the human values that inform them, are one 
of the many contributions that Indigenous 
Peoples bring to the rest of humanity (IPCC, 
2022; Cameron et al., 2021; Townsend et al., 
2021; Salmón, 2000). Such a perspective stems 
from an understanding that human beings 
must learn to live with the Land, Water and 
Ice (McGregor, 2014; McGregor et al., 2010; 
Cajete, 1999).
These rights—and those affirmed in Treaties, 
land claims, agreements and other constructive 
arrangements (see Box 1)—have enabled 
Indigenous Peoples to take our rightful 
leadership roles in environmental governance, 
thereby advancing co-management

For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report 35
BOX 4: Strengths of women, girls, Two Spirit, and gender-diverse 
people
Indigenous women, men, boys, girls 
and gender-diverse people experience 
unique vulnerabilities, resilience and lived 
experiences, including those related to 
climate change (National Collaborating 
Centre for Indigenous Health, 2022).
In Canada, studies examining climate 
change impacts on Indigenous Peoples 
have primarily focused on the knowledge 
and experiences of men, who tend to be 
the hunters and harvesters and are most 
directly and regularly in contact with the 
Land (Bunce et al., 2016; Dowsley et al., 
2010). However, there is a growing body of 
research documenting the unique impacts 
Indigenous women face when activities 
central to their identity and well-being 
are affected by climate change. A study in 
Nunavut showed that while Inuit women 
share many of the same broad observations 
of environmental changes as men, they also 
have specific observations and experiences 
unique to their gender roles, gendered work 
and roles in family and community (Dowsley 
et al., 2010). For instance, women have 
detailed knowledge of changes in seals due 
to their work with skin preparation and 
sewing.
Indigenous Peoples are also highlighting 
the unique and vital knowledge and 
contributions of diverse members of society, 
including Two Spirit and gender-diverse 
relatives (Lezard et al., 2021). This diversity 
of knowledge and experience strengthens 
our understanding of climate change, the 
interconnected environmental impacts and 
the unique adaptations needed in diverse 
social, family, wellness and cultural spheres 
(Zoledziowski, 2021; Delisle, 2020; Gournay, 
2020; Viscogliosi et al., 2020; Amor, 2018; 
Basile, 2017).
arrangements and other stewardship 
activities (Cadman et al., 2022; Qikiqtani Inuit 
Association, 2021; Peacock et al., 2020; Snook 
et al., 2018a; Armitage et al., 2011). As a result, 
many Indigenous territories retain high levels 
of biodiversity and intact, critical and globally 
significant ecosystems (Schuster et al., 2019). 
Examples such as Indigenous Protected and 
Conserved Areas (IPCAs) (see Case Story 5.4 
in NIR-5) and Indigenous Marine Protected 
Areas (Imappivut Nunatsiavut Marine Plan, 
2022) demonstrate how Indigenous Peoples 
are increasingly assuming leadership positions 
in governance and climate change action, as 
stewards of our traditional territories since 
time immemorial (McDonald, 2023; Reed et al., 
2021b). Indigenous “resurgence” paradigms—
where Indigenous Peoples are reclaiming our 
languages, ceremonies, teachings, governance 
and decision-making (Corntassel and Bryce, 
2012)—draw on the strengths of traditional 
land-based culture and knowledge with regard 
to Indigenous leadership in land governance 
and stewardship (Alfred et al., 2015; Coulthard, 
2014; Corntassel and Bryce, 2012; Simpson, 
2011; Alfred, 2009; Alfred and Corntassel, 
2005). Indigenous leadership in climate 
change policy, therefore, can ensure that 
the Indigenous right to self-determination is 
respected and upheld, allowing Indigenous 
Peoples to continue to carry out our cultural 
responsibilities to the Land for the benefit of all 
humanity (see Section 9.0; Powless, 2012).
36 For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report
6.0	Climate change is one of many crises 
that First Nations, Inuit and Métis face
Climate change causes serious disruption 
not just to the environment and economy, 
but also to culture, language, knowledge 
transfer, ceremony, identity, health and 
well-being. These impacts are interrelated 
and intersect with other crises that First 
Nations, Inuit and Métis face.
Our deep relationships with our Lands, Waters 
and Ice mean we experience the impacts 
of climate change differently. Many of our 
communities practice livelihoods that are closely 
tied to the Land, like hunting and harvesting, 
but we also depend on the Land for maintaining 
our identity, cultural practices and passing this 
knowledge on to future generations. These 
connections and relationships vary not only 
between but also within our communities 
(e.g., between and amidst North, South, rural, 
urban and genders).
When the Land, Water or Ice changes, we 
change. We feel it. There are physical impacts 
and hazards that we face, like the loss of harvests 
or water resources, changes in wild food sources 
and increased risks of falling through unsafe ice. 
But there are emotional and spiritual impacts 
as well, as we grieve the loss of connection to 
our Lands and Waters and the loss of our ability 
to practice our life ways. The physical, mental, 
emotional and spiritual impacts that we feel from 
climate change are connected.
When you live with the Land in relationship 
and reciprocity, you see and experience the 
interconnectedness of things. You feel things 
in an interconnected way. The ways that we 
have responded to climate change include 
interconnected approaches, and this must 
continue as we find solutions to current and 
future changes.
6.1 Introduction
“
Nuna (the Land; Inuktut) is so core to our 
being that we conceive ourselves to be part 
of the Nuna – we are part of the Nuna and 
the Nuna is part of us. We know that when 
Indigenous Peoples are disconnected from 
the Land and cultural practices, our mental, 
physical, emotional and spiritual health 
declines.”
– Lori Tagoona (Authors’ Scoping
Meeting, February 2020)
Climate change affects Indigenous Peoples 
and our ways of life that have been practiced 
for millennia (Council of Canadian Academies, 
2019; Watt-Cloutier, 2015; Nickels et al., 
2005). Indigenous Peoples often characterize 
the disruption from climate change in terms 
of our ability to practice, reclaim and revitalize 
our ways of knowing and being (Cameron et 
al., 2021), while also highlighting the already 
existing challenges of a complete disruption 
brought on by colonization (Whyte, 2018). 
For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report 37
Much of the existing research related to 
climate change focuses on the realm of the 
biophysical, including direct impacts on health 
through injury or death, indirect impacts 
through changes to environmental systems 
that impact food, water and ice quality and 
availability, and changes to human systems 
that affect social and emotional well-being 
(Naylor, 2022; Marshall et al., 2020; Worden 
et al., 2020; Lynn et al., 2013; Tam et al., 2013; 
Jacob et al., 2010; Laidler et al., 2009; Guyot 
et al., 2006). Less is known about how complex 
and interconnected environmental changes 
also affect cultural practices, mental health 
and well-being (see NIR–2; RPR‑6; Cunsolo 
Willox et al., 2015; Cunsolo Willox et al., 2012; 
Furberg et al., 2011; Berry et al., 2010). From 
the perspective of Indigenous Knowledge 
Systems, it is important to consider how 
emotional, physical, mental and spiritual health 
and well-being are interrelated and affected by 
environmental and climatic changes, as well as 
how such impacts are felt across gender, age 
and geography (Williams, 2018). Indigenous 
Peoples have been increasingly articulating the 
loss of this connection, largely due to climate 
and environmental change, through our own 
experiences, worldviews, sense of identity and 
in our languages (Lewis et al., 2021).
Despite these climate change impacts, many 
Indigenous Peoples remain strongly connected 
to the Land and continue land-based ways 
of life including in urban centres. The Land 
supports and maintains identity, socio-cultural 
and socio-spiritual systems, as well as physical, 
emotional, mental and spiritual health and 
well-being (Middleton et al., 2020; Petrasek 
MacDonald et al., 2015; Ford, 2012; Kral et al., 
2011; K. Wilson, 2003; Adelson, 2000).
6.2 Interconnected disruptions to 
environment, economy, culture, 
language, health and more
Indigenous worldviews hold keys to adaptation 
and resilience in the face of climate change. 
However, this also means that Indigenous 
Peoples experience climate change impacts 
in the context of our long-standing reliance 
and ongoing relationships with the natural 
environment, particularly the Waters upon 
which they have depended for millennia (see 
Case Story 3; Arsenault, 2021; N.J. Wilson, 
2019; Goldhar et al., 2014). For instance, Inuit 
have been observing and reporting changing 
sea ice conditions for decades (e.g., ITK, 
2019b; Fox Gearheard et al., 2013; Ford et al., 
2009; Laidler et al., 2008; Laidler and Ikummaq, 
2008; Laidler and Elee, 2008). The changing ice 
conditions (see Box 5) disrupt the environment, 
as sea ice change is interconnected with 
changes in climate, weather and ocean 
conditions (K. Wilson et al., 2021; N. Wilson 
et al., 2021). These changes affect local 
ecology by impacting wildlife habitat, feeding, 
denning and health (Menzies et al., 2022; Reid 
et al., 2022). As access, safety, travel ability, 
harvesting success and other interactions 
are impacted by changing ice conditions, the 
cultural practices and traditions centered 
around these activities and relationships are 
at risk (Simonee et al., 2021). Knowledge is a 
practice—there is a risk of losing Inuit culture, 
including knowledge and language, if using sea 
ice becomes restricted or lost (Robertson and 
Ljubicic, 2019).
38 For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report
CASE STORY 3: Intersections of climate change and traditions: the 
Northern Tutchone People of the Selkirk First Nation
Changing conditions such as warming ocean 
temperatures and inshore waters becoming 
salinized and less oxygenated are severely 
impacting species important to Indigenous 
Peoples. Marine fish and invertebrates are 
projected to decline by up to 64% by 2050 
(Weatherdon et al., 2016), posing serious 
implications for food security and health for 
Indigenous Peoples who rely on fish not only to 
eat but also to transfer culture and knowledge 
in our communities.
In the Yukon, a noticeable decline in salmon 
populations due to climate change poses a 
serious threat to the Northern Tutchone People 
of the Selkirk First Nation in passing down 
traditional knowledge and practices to young 
people (Selkirk First Nation and The Arctic 
Institute of Community Based Research, 2016). 
In response, the community led a research 
project, “Keeping Our Traditions”, to answer the 
question: “What do we do at fish camp when 
there are no fish?” The findings highlighted 
the importance of holding fish camps even in 
the absence of fish, emphasizing being with 
youth on the Land. The role of the Northern 
Tutchone People of Selkirk First Nation 
remains critical in conservation. The presence 
of youth on the Land was just as important 
during the time of salmon fishing to maintain 
cultural connections to the Land, to practice 
traditions like drying fish and sharing stories, 
and to continue hunting, fishing and gathering 
other traditional foods and medicinal sources. 
Maintaining traditional practices ensures 
pathways to mental, physical, emotional and 
spiritual well-being, and assists in adapting to a 
changing climate.
BOX 5: The meaning of Ice: people and sea ice in three arctic 
communities
Excerpt from The Meaning of Ice: People 
and Sea ice in Three Arctic Communities
(Fox Gearheard et al., 2013, p. 63):
“Sea ice is home in both a permanent and 
temporary sense. It is a permanent, integral 
part of who we are—we think about it, talk 
about it, dream about it and, as Jacopie 
Panipak said, we are homesick for it when we 
are away from it for too long. It also provides 
a temporary physical home sometimes, a 
place to set up our hunting, whaling and 
fishing camps over the seasons. In the past, 
before settlements, we could live on it during 
certain times of the year. It is the sea ice 
that in the past was the ultimate source 
of warmth—a word that Elders today use 
frequently when they reminisce about their 
lives growing up and living on the ice. They 
remember life in the igloo, set on the sea ice 
for its superior warmth over the land, and 
the warm glow of the qulliq/qulleq—the oil of 
this lamp from the animals hunted from the 
sea ice. Sea ice means warmth, and the light 
of home.”

6.3 Connections between climate 
change impacts, infrastructure 
and the multiple crises facing 
First Nations, Inuit and Métis
The impacts of climate change on First Nations, 
Inuit and Métis extend beyond the Land, 
Water and Ice. The effect on natural and built 
infrastructure, for instance, is a key concern 
across the country. The National Inuit Climate 
Change Strategy identified infrastructure as one 
of five key priorities, recognizing the need to 
close the infrastructure gap in Inuit Nunangat 
through new climate-resilient builds, retrofits to 
existing builds, as well as through adaptation, 
assessments, building practices and codes that 
are Inuit-led and incorporate Inuit knowledge 
(ITK, 2019a). Similarly, the Assembly of First 
Nations National Climate Strategy has identified 
closing the natural and built infrastructure gap 
as one of seven priority areas.
Infrastructure is increasingly vulnerable to 
climate change impacts, including temperature 
and precipitation changes, permafrost 
degradation and coastal erosion (see NIR-2; 
NIR-3; ITK, 2019a). In the Arctic, thawing 
permafrost can damage drinking water and 
wastewater infrastructure, leading to sewage 
contamination in groundwater, drinking water 
and other surface waters (see RPR-6; IPCC, 
2014, p. 726). Coastal erosion along all three 
of Canada’s coastlines poses another threat to 
infrastructure, including drinking water systems. 
For example, in December 2010, Lennox Island, 
PEI, home to the Lennox Island First Nation of 
the Mi’kmaw, experienced a severe storm that 
resulted in a 36-hour storm surge, temporarily 
closing the roadway to the community (see 
Case Story 1.8 in RPR-1; Coldwater Consulting 
Ltd., 2016, as cited in Lewis and Peters, 
2017) and threatening the sewage treatment 
plant and associated lagoons (Jardine, 2016, 
as cited in Lewis and Peters, 2017). The 
Tsleil‑Waututh Nation, located on Burrard Inlet, 
British Columbia, is experiencing the effects of 
sea-level rise, coastal flooding and shoreline 
erosion, impacting their Lands, infrastructure, 
ecosystems and historical sites of cultural 
value (see Case Story 2.5 in NIR-2; Kerr Wood 
Leidal Associates Ltd. (KWL) and Tsleil Waututh 
Nation, 2021). They have also partnered with 
the University of British Columbia’s Coastal 
Adaptation Lab under the Living with Water 
project to explore how Indigenous Knowledge 
can contribute to coastal adaptation measures 
(Owen, 2020).
The health concerns arising from impacts 
on infrastructure are serious and varied. For 
instance, storm sewer drainage systems often 
cannot keep up with the volume of storm 
rainfall runoff, causing sewer backups that 
flood basements and result in contaminants 
such as raw sewage into homes, introducing 
pathogens harmful to human health (see 
HCCC-2; Horton and McKenzie, 2009, as cited 
in Lewis and Peters, 2017). Run-off during 
heavy precipitation can also carry hydrocarbons 
(components of gas or petroleum), including 
PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 
from diesel fuel, gasoline or oil), and heavy 
metals (such as lead, cadmium and mercury) 
from roadways into groundwater systems, 
which is a significant concern near populated 
areas (Horton and McKenzie, 2009, as cited 
in Lewis and Peters, 2017). Salmonella and 
campylobacter are common waterborne 
bacterial pathogens that are known to be 
climate sensitive (IPCC, 2014). In fact, climate 
factors such as heavy precipitation have 
increased the risk of waterborne disease events 
caused by pathogens (ITK and ICC, 2021; 
ITK 2020b; Harper et al., 2020; Thomas, et 
al., 2007). Climate change severely impacts 
water resources and security through changes 
in precipitation patterns, increased frequency 
of extreme weather events and melting of 
40 For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report
permafrost, leading to changes in the timing 
and volume of river runoff that also affects 
water quality (see RPR-6). Addressing these 
issues requires a range of measures, including 
the development of more effective water 
management and governance systems, 
investments in drinking water and wastewater 
infrastructure, and increased collaboration 
between northern communities, governments 
and Indigenous Peoples in the North (see 
RPR‑6).
Drinking water infrastructure exemplifies 
the multiple and interrelated challenges that 
First Nations, Inuit and Métis face, which are 
amplified by climate change (ITK and ICC, 
2021; ITK, 2020b; Castleden and Skinner, 
2014). Drinking water systems in First 
Nations are often already in poor condition, 
heightening their risk of failure in the face 
of climate change. A national assessment of 
First Nations water and wastewater systems 
conducted in 2011 found that of the 807 
water systems serving 560 First Nations, 
314 (39%) were categorized as having high 
overall risk, 278 (34%) as having medium 
overall risk and only 215 (27%) as having low 
overall risk (Indigenous and Northern Affairs 
Canada, 2011, p. ii). In 2014, the United 
Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples reported that the drinking 
water situation in First Nation and Inuit 
communities was troubling, with “more than 
half of the water systems posing a medium or 
high health risk to their users” (Anaya, 2009, 
p. 8). In 2015, the Government of Canada
committed to ending all long-term drinking
water advisories in First Nations within five
years. By 2018, 40 advisories had been lifted,
but 26 new advisories and 36 short-term
advisories had been added (David Suzuki
Foundation, 2018). The Mohawks of the Bay
of Quinte, near Kingston, Ontario, for instance,
have faced drinking water advisories for over
a decade due to fecal, bacterial and algae 
contamination (Alhmidi, 2021). This community 
is home to approximately 2,250 residents, 
with an additional 8,000 registered community 
members living off-reserve (Indigenous and 
Northern Affairs Canada, 2019). Neskantaga 
First Nation in northern Ontario has also 
been under a boil water advisory since 1995, 
the longest in any First Nation in Canada. In 
2020, the First Nation evacuated community 
members to hotels in Thunder Bay, despite 
having a new water treatment plant built two 
years prior (Stefanovich, 2020).
Physical health impacts represent just one 
aspect of the multifaceted disruptions caused 
by climate change. There are also significant 
impacts on mental, emotional and spiritual 
health (see Case Story 4; NIR-3; RPR-6; 
HCCC‑4). Individuals living in conditions 
where they cannot provide access to healthy 
water, food and safe shelter or environment 
for their families are likely to experience 
immense stress and trauma. The on-reserve 
housing crisis facing First Nations is a clear 
example. Estimates produced by the First 
Nations Information Governance Centre, using 
data from the Assembly of First Nations’ First 
Nations On-Reserve Housing and Related 
Infrastructure Needs survey, show that there 
is a deficit of approximately 85,700 housing 
units to meet current demands. Additionally, 
34% of existing units need minor repairs and 
31% require major repairs (Assembly of First 
Nations, 2018). The situation facing Inuit is 
similar, where over half (51.7%) of Inuit in Inuit 
Nunangat live in crowded housing, compared 
to 8.5% of non-Indigenous Canadians (Crown-
Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs 
Canada, 2019). In First Nations, a combination 
of government underfunding, rapid population 
growth, restrictive policies and other factors 
has led to various health and social issues. 
These include respiratory illnesses, mental 
For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report 41
health problems and an increased risk of 
violence (Stout, 2018). Indigenous Peoples 
disproportionately suffer from these conditions, 
which are exacerbated by climate change. This 
report emphasizes the broader historical and 
ongoing inequities and injustices resulting from 
settler colonialism and imposed climate policies, 
governance and laws, further compounding 
the impacts of climate change on Indigenous 
Peoples (Mercer, 2022; Arsenault, 2018; 
Collins et al., 2017).
CASE STORY 4: Intersections of environmental displacement and health: 
Pictou Landing First Nation (PLFN)
From 1967 until January 2020, the 
Government of Nova Scotia permitted a local 
pulp and paper mill located near the Mi’kmaw 
community of Pictou Landing First Nation 
(PLFN) to pump 85 million litres of effluent per 
day into a wastewater treatment lagoon called 
the Boat Harbour Effluent Treatment Facility. 
This location was once a culturally significant 
tidal estuary, known to the community as A’se’k 
which provided food, medicine, berries, and 
recreation to the Mi’kmaw (Lewis et al., 2021; 
Pictou Landing Native Women’s Group et al., 
2016). A’se’k translates to ‘the other room’ in 
the Mi’kmaw language, reflective of the close 
connection PLFN residents had to the area 
(Lewis et al., 2021). 
Like many Indigenous communities facing 
similar challenges, PLFN worried about losing 
its connection to A’se’k, especially in terms of 
implications this would have for their language, 
cultural practices, spirituality and traditions, 
which are important to their overall health and 
well-being (Lewis et al., 2021). Drawing on 
the wisdom of the Knowledge Holders in the 
community and literature on land displacement 
and environmental dispossession from the 
perspective of Indigenous Peoples, Lewis et al. 
(2021) used concepts in the Mi’kmaw language, 
with English explanations, to guide thinking 
away from a western-centric analysis of how 
Indigenous Peoples are impacted. This method 
allowed for a more appropriate analysis, where 
Pictou Landing First Nation recognized the 
outcomes as relevant to their lived experiences. 
The researchers framed their approach as the 
Piktukowaq environmental health framework, 
using Mi’kmaw concepts to replace western 
constructs of worldview, epistemology, and 
ontology as conceptual tools. This method 
was particularly effective when western 
constructs are insufficient to bring the non-
Indigenous reader to an understanding of how 
the Piktukowaq were affected by their sudden 
separation from A’se’k (Lewis et al., 2021).
Studying interconnected phenomena like those 
at A’se’k in the context of land displacement 
and environmental dispossession enhances our 
understanding of how environmental change 
impacts the health of Indigenous Peoples.
42 For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report
7.0	Indigenous Knowledge Systems and 
lived experiences are essential components 
of climate action
To effectively address the impacts of 
climate change, it’s crucial to include 
Indigenous observations, knowledge 
systems and diverse lived experiences, 
especially those of gender-diverse 
individuals, women and youth, in all aspects 
of climate change research, strategies and 
decision-making processes. First Nations, 
Inuit and Métis have unique and diverse 
indicators and methods for observing, 
monitoring and assessing change.
For too long, there have been studies on First 
Nations, Inuit and Métis, our homelands and our 
knowledge, without our direct involvement in the 
research process. This is now changing, through 
our rising leadership in research and policy, 
concrete actions and fostering of meaningful 
partnerships. This report is an example of 
this ongoing transformation of research and 
knowledge production in our communities and on 
our Land, Water and Ice.
We are the original researchers of our homelands. 
We have always relied on our knowledge systems 
to understand the world around us. We refer to 
these as “systems” because they encompass more 
than just a set of observations or information—
they include all that we use to create, manage, 
apply and share our knowledge.
Our knowledge systems, transmitted through 
our languages and grounded in our protocols, 
encompass our worldviews and values. This is 
why our report (and our process for developing 
this report) started with recognizing shared key 
principles (see Box 1)—including hope, love, and 
respect for diversity, which guided our approach.
Moreover, our knowledge systems also embody 
highly detailed and technical methods, language, 
approaches and understandings. Our Elders, 
harvesters and other knowledge-holders are 
experts in observing, monitoring and assessing 
the world around us, including the changes in 
climate and environment.
7.1 Introduction
First Nations, Inuit and Métis have always 
relied on our own knowledge systems to 
understand the world around us. This includes 
our own reasons for inquiry, modes of inquiry, 
languages of inquiry, ways of knowing, ways of 
analyzing, and ways of sharing and mobilizing 
knowledge. The use of the term “systems,” 
rather than simply “knowledge”, acknowledges 
the educational, historical, governance and 
legal structures that exist in Indigenous 
societies, gives rise to knowledge, and ensures 
its functionality and continuity (McGregor, 
2021). Indigenous Knowledge is not merely a 
For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report 43
body of information, but rather encompasses 
all of the systems that generate, govern, 
manage, analyze, maintain, apply and transmit 
knowledge (Huntington, 2011; McGregor, 
2004).
Although there is much knowledge being 
generated about Indigenous Peoples and 
climate change, little is led by Indigenous 
Peoples, which prioritizes our own knowledge 
systems, languages, values and experiences. A 
global assessment of Indigenous engagement 
in climate research found that 87% of studies 
pertaining to Indigenous Peoples use an 
extractive model (David-Chavez and Gavin, 
2018). In Canada, First Nations, Inuit and Métis 
are actively pushing for changes in research 
governance processes, which is leading to 
emerging dialogues on self-determination 
in research—including the need for control 
over how research is carried out and ensuring 
that research partnerships reflect Indigenous 
priorities and build Indigenous research 
capacities (Perrin et al., 2021; Asselin and 
Basile, 2018; ITK, 2018). There is a great need 
to strengthen relationships and understanding 
between Indigenous and western science, and 
to find frameworks to meaningfully include 
Indigenous ways of knowing within decision-
making policy and processes (Yua et al., 2022). 
Now is the time to move beyond inclusion. 
Indigenous Peoples have our own methods, 
decision-making processes and systems, and 
we are experts within those systems. These 
systems should be respected, acknowledged, 
supported and implemented.
7.2 Indigenous observations, 
knowledge systems and lived 
experiences
A worldview is a belief system that shapes a 
person’s values, perceptions and actions. 
Although there are many ways to perceive or 
interpret the world and environment (Guba and 
Lincoln, 1994), colonial forces and associated 
power imbalances often prioritize certain 
worldviews and knowledge systems like 
Western or Eurocentric paradigms over others 
(Reid et al., 2021; McGrath, 2018). Indigenous 
Peoples have developed knowledge systems 
over millennia that understand how to live 
adaptively with the environment, leading to 
strong adaptive capacities throughout history 
(Kimmerer, 2018). Indigenous Knowledge 
Systems are place-based (Aikenhead and 
Michell, 2011) and defined as “cumulative 
bodies of knowledge, practice and belief 
evolving by adaptive processes and handed 
down through generations by cultural 
transmission, about the relationship of living 
beings including humans with one another and 
with their environment” (Berkes, 1999, p. 154). 
These systems are evolving over time in a living 
process that continues to this day (Yua et al., 
2022, p. 33). Reflecting memories and 
knowledges through living heritages, 
Indigenous Knowledge Systems develop 
through stories, lessons, practice and extensive 
histories, enabling well-organized abilities to 
adapt to seasonal and inter-annual 
environmental changes since time immemorial 
(see Case Story 5; Thompson et al., 2019; 
Chisholm Hatfield et al., 2018; Makondo and 
Thomas, 2018; Whyte, 2017b; Alessa et al., 
2016).
44 For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report
CASE STORY 5: Anishinaabe perspectives on climate change impacts 
and research
Indigenous Peoples in the Great Lakes region 
of Ontario have expressed concerns about the 
impacts of climate change on culture and ways 
of life (Chiblow, 2019; IPBES, 2019). Spurred 
by a desire to document and prioritize concerns 
related to climate change, a group of 37 
environmental professionals, Elders and youth 
(ages 19–30) from 12 Anishinabek Nation 
communities in the upper Great Lakes region 
attended a workshop in the Magnetawan 
First Nation in 2019 to share knowledge and 
insights and to identify important regional 
research directions for action (Menzies et 
al., 2022; Gallant et al., 2020). During the 
workshop, the discussion focused largely 
on 1) the greatest climate change concerns 
regarding the environment; 2) the greatest 
climate change concerns regarding community 
and way of life; and 3) the most important 
climate change research directions.
The main concerns expressed by workshop 
participants were changes to animal and plant 
life cycles and distributions, the water cycle, 
water quality, disease and parasite rates and 
occurrence as well as shifts in biodiversity. 
When discussions shifted to the greatest 
climate change concerns to community and 
way of life, many participants expressed 
that the impacts to the environment were 
also impacts to ways of life, as all things are 
connected. Participants were most concerned 
about the impacts of climate change to 
traditional and spiritual practices, but also 
indicated that the Land is becoming more 
unpredictable and difficult to read. The 
most important climate change research 
directions shared by participants were to 
develop research and policies that include 
both Indigenous and western knowledge 
and the need to prioritize more wholistic and 
ecosystem-based (as opposed to species-
specific) approaches, especially in relation to 
animal and plant inventories and long-term 
monitoring.
While Indigenous Knowledge Systems are 
diverse, Indigenous worldviews share many 
philosophical and spiritual underpinnings 
that guide relationships with the natural 
world and are centered in environmental 
sustainability (Simpson, 2000; Whyte, 2018). 
Indigenous Knowledge Systems consist of 
cultural frameworks of respect, reciprocity 
and responsibility (Pierotti and Wildcat, 2000; 
Kimmerer, 1998) and “original instructions” 
for caring for and relating to the Land (Cajete, 
2018). Indigenous philosophies recognize 
human dependence on the natural world, and 
Indigenous cultures are often characterized as 
“cultures of gratitude” (Kimmerer, 2018). These 
systems understand that our relationships 
with the natural world must be founded 
on reciprocity to All Our Relations, human 
or more-than-human (McGregor, 2018). A 
common understanding is that all beings, 
human and more-than-human, are interrelated, 
and respect for All Our Relations is based on 
a philosophy of co-existence (McGrath, 2018; 
Karetak et al., 2017; Aikenhead and Michell, 
2011; Bennett and Rowley, 2004).
For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report 45
The current global environmental crisis is 
predominantly caused by Western relationships 
with the natural world—a worldview that 
sees nature as a commodity to be dominated 
for human benefit (McGregor, 2018). Albert 
Einstein famously stated, “We can’t solve our 
problems with the same thinking we used 
when we created them.” Similarly, Kimmerer 
(2018, p. 47) notes that “[Western] science is a 
superb tool for answering true/false questions 
but does not have the capacity to address 
questions of right/wrong.” Many complex 
issues today lie at the intersection of nature 
and culture, and leaders, policymakers and 
scientists acknowledge that Western science 
alone is insufficient to address them.
7.3	Inclusion of Indigenous 
observations, knowledge 
systems and lived experiences 
in climate change research and 
decision making
Indigenous Knowledge Systems reflect 
worldviews and ways to interpret the 
world that are based on incredibly technical 
methodologies and understandings. Our 
knowledge systems include deep insights 
into complex systems such as plants and 
trees (Kimmerer, 2018), fisheries (Reid et al., 
2021), and sea ice (Dawson et al., 2020; Fox 
Gearheard et al., 2013; Krupnik et al., 2010; 
Laidler et al., 2008; Laidler and Ikummaq, 2008; 
Laidler and Elee, 2008). Our Peoples

have always observed the environment and 
monitored conditions using key indicators 
(Ban et al., 2020; Kourantidou et al., 2020; 
Ban et al., 2018). This includes the knowledge 
and experience to provide leadership and 
rich contributions to documenting and 
understanding climate change impacts through 
direct knowledge and insights pertaining to 
weather, environment, wildlife and habitats, 
adaptation planning and modelling and through 
insights and wisdom related to alternate 
pathways and approaches to sustainable living 
(see Case Story 4; Case Story 5; Lim, Ɂehdzo 
Got’ı̨nę Gots’ę Nákedı [Sahtú Renewable 
Resources Board] and The Pembina Institute, 
2014; Turner and Clifton 2009).678
Although western science can describe the 
natural world, it does not speak to how to 
live with it (McGregor, 2018). Due to unique 
and holistic relations with the environment 
and an understanding of localized seasonal, 
cyclical and interdependent timing of events 
such as migrations, hibernations and blooming 
vegetation, Indigenous Knowledge Systems 
can identify changes undetected by western 
science (Chisholm Hatfield et al., 2018; 
Whyte, 2017a) and can provide more in-
depth place-based understandings of changing 
environments over greater timescales than 
western scientific methods (Sawatzky et al., 
2021; Sawatzky et al., 2020; Huntington, 
2011; Gagnon and Berteaux, 2009).
46 For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report
Approaches that braid Indigenous and western 
ways of knowing in environmental research and 
management have well-recognized benefits 
(Johnson et al., 2020; Alexander et al., 2019; 
Bartlett et al., 2012). Complex environmental 
issues like climate change can benefit 
substantially from multiple ways of knowing 
(see Case Story 6; Cuerrier et al., 2022; 
Tomaselli et al., 2022; Kimmerer, 2018; Alessa 
et al., 2016; Cuerrier et al., 2015). A co-
produced or braided evidence-based approach 
supports complementarity of knowledge 
systems and values, while upholding the 
integrity of each system and without one being 
dominant over the other (Yua et al., 2022; Luby 
et al., 2021; Tengö et al., 2014). Etuaptmumk 
(Two-Eyed Seeing) is a concept described by 
Mi’kmaq Elder Albert Marshall as the process of 
bringing together multiple ways of knowing and 
a way of seeing from two eyes or lenses—an 
Indigenous eye or lens, encompassing 
Indigenous ways of knowing, and a western 
eye or lens, encompassing western ways of 
knowing (Bartlett et al., 2012). Indigenous 
Peoples worldwide have developed similar 
frameworks or practices of knowledge co-
existence, including “Two Row Wampum” or 
Kaswentha in Haudenosaunee; “Two Ways” or 
Ganma in Yolngu; “Double‐Canoe” or Waka‐
Taurua in Māori (Reid et al., 2021); co-
production of knowledge by the Inuit 
Circumpolar Council; and the qaggiq model of 
Inuktut knowledge renewal based on late Inuk 
Elder Mariano Aupilaarjuk’s philosophical 
thinking (McGrath, 2018; McGrath, 2002). 
Through Two-Eyed Seeing and other practices 
for braiding multiple ways of knowing that 
support an ethic of knowledge co-existence, 
co-production, inclusive environmental 
co‑research, monitoring, management and 
governance can be supported, and more 
holistic perspectives on socioeconomic, 
political and ecological changes are established 
(Harper et al., 2021; Reid et al., 2021; Dufour-
Beauséjour and Plante Lévesque, 2020; Henri 
et al., 2020; Reed et al., 2020; Popp et al., 
2019, 2020; Levac et al., 2018; Durkalec et al., 
2015; Harper et al., 2012; McGregor, 2004).

CASE STORY 6: “The Eyes and Ears for the Land and Water”—The Rising 
Tide of Indigenous Guardians Programs and Expansion of Indigenous 
Protected and Conserved Areas in Canada
9	
For more information, see the video Métis Nation of Ontario Water Guardians available at 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqS1GTWB388
The Indigenous-led conservation movement 
in Canada has been growing over the last 
40 years as Indigenous communities across 
the country are taking back our rightful 
places as land protectors and stewards. 
Across Canada, there are approximately 
90 Indigenous Guardian programs (Baker, 
2021), with early efforts dating back to 1981 
with the establishment of the Haida Gwaii 
Watchmen off the west coast of British 
Columbia (Indigenous Leadership Initiative 
[ILI] 2019). Indigenous Guardians perform 
a variety of duties including species and 
harvest monitoring, patrolling protected areas, 
providing cultural interpretation, educating land 
users about cultural values and proper land use, 
developing land use plans, monitoring resource 
development projects, responding to climate 
change impacts, restoring forests, streams and 
other landscapes, training youth, working with 
Crown forestry and fisheries representatives 
and identifying areas for conservation and 
sustainable economic development (Indigenous 
Guardians Toolkit, 2021; ILI, 2020a, 2020b, 
2020c; ILI, 2016). They are the “eyes and ears” 
on the Land (ILI, 2016).
Indigenous Guardians programs build capacity, 
strengthen nationhood and employ Indigenous 
Peoples (ILI, no date (b)). For example, the Innu 
Nation in Labrador employs 15 Indigenous 
Guardians who manage fisheries, caribou and 
forestry as well as monitor hydroelectric and 
mining operations. In addition to offering 
employment, the program has strengthened 
leadership and capacity within the Innu 
Nation to enable negotiations of the historic 
Tshash-Petapen (New Dawn) Agreement with 
the Crown, which establishes an Innu Land 
Claim and Self-Government Agreement-in-
Principle, settles past hydroelectric grievances 
with the Government of Newfoundland 
and Labrador and establishes an Impact and 
Benefits agreement for the Lower Churchill 
River Hydroelectric Generation Project (ILI, 
2016; Innu Nation, 2010; Government 
of Newfoundland and Labrador, 2008; 
Olthuis, n.d.). In Nunavut, the Nauttiqsuqtiit 
(Inuit Stewards) are the “eyes and ears” of 
the Tallurutiup Imanga National Marine 
Conservation Area, where they monitor their 
environment and harvest for their communities 
(Qikiqtani Inuit Association, 2021; 2020). In 
the Ainslie Wood Conservation Area, the Métis 
Nation of Ontario has created a Guardians 
program focused on water quality monitoring.9
In the Northwest Territories, the NiHat’Ni 
Guardians of the Łutsël K’e Dene First Nation, 
who monitor caribou, respond to climate 
change impacts and co-manage one of the 
largest protected areas in the country, Thaidene 
Nëné, which spans 26,376 square kilometres of 
boreal forest (ILI, 2020c). Thaidene Nëné is one 
of three Indigenous Protected and Conserved 
Areas established in Canada since 2018 (ILI, no 
date (a)).

7.4	Decolonizing climate change 
research and policy
Including Indigenous Knowledge in research, 
decision-making and actions must involve a 
decolonization process (see Case Story 7). A 
first step towards a decolonized process that 
supports Indigenous socioecological resilience 
to climate change is approaching policy change 
dialogue through an ethical space that equally 
values and accepts Indigenous Knowledge 
Systems and ways of knowing (Elliott et al., 
2022; Hernandez et al., 2022; Fox et al., 
2020; Pedersen et al., 2020; Huntington et 
al., 2019; Salomon et al., 2019; Elliott et al., 
2012; Ermine, 2007). Supporting reconciliation 
in Canada is imperative, and Canada’s Truth 
and Reconciliation Commission’s 94 Calls to 
Action (Truth and Reconciliation Commission of 
Canada, 2015) are beginning to be respected, 
implemented and prioritized by scientists 
(Wong et al., 2020). Approaches that balance 
and remedy existing power relations, uplift 
unique strengths and respect differences are 
critically needed (K.J. Wilson et al., 2020; 
Muller, 2012). We must recognize that our 
collective responsibility extends beyond 
collaboratively restoring the Land, Water and 
systems damaged by climate change to healing 
our relationships with the Land and Water 
through honouring covenants of respect, 
responsibility and reciprocity (Kimmerer, 2018). 
Together, our collective knowledge systems, 
values and ways of knowing can transform and 
restore our relationships with All Our Relations 
(see Section 5.4.1).

CASE STORY 7: Decolonizing climate policy: An Indigenous Climate 
Action project
Indigenous Climate Action, an Indigenous-
led organization, launched the Decolonizing 
Climate Policy research project in 2018. The 
project aimed to examine Canadian climate 
policy’s shortcomings and challenges while 
supporting and developing Indigenous-led 
climate policy.
In Phase 1 of the project, Indigenous Climate 
Action conducted an in-depth critique of the 
Government of Canada’s climate policy through 
the lens of Indigenous rights, knowledge and 
perspectives. The analysis focused on the 
two previous federal climate plans: the Pan-
Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and 
Climate Change (Government of Canada, 2016) 
and A Healthy Environment, A Healthy Economy 
(Government of Canada, 2020b). Released in 
2021, the critique revealed that Indigenous 
Peoples were structurally excluded from the 
process of developing these climate 
plans, violating the right to self-
determination and free, prior, and 
informed consent. Although 
the 2020 plan recognized 
the importance of self-
determination by and 
for Indigenous Peoples, 
the structural exclusion 
conflicts with the 
Government of Canada’s 
commitments to Nation-
to-Nation, Inuit-Crown, 
and government-to-
government relationships. 
Additionally, some actions promoted in these 
plans did not adequately address the realities 
faced by Indigenous Peoples and overlooked 
structural inequities perpetuated through 
colonial relations and oppressive structures 
in Canada.
In response to these findings, Indigenous 
Climate Action initiated Phase 2 to explore 
what Indigenous-led climate policy might 
entail and released a summary report in 
2022 (Indigenous Climate Action, 2022). This 
summary report employs the medicine wheel to 
identify four key areas of discussion, which will 
be elaborated upon in the full publication, once 
it is released (see Figure 5). During publication, 
Part 1 of the Phase 2 report was released 
(Indigenous Climate Action, 2023).

7.5 Indigenous indicators, methods 
and practices for observing, 
monitoring and assessing 
change
First Nations, Inuit and Métis have had our 
own methods for observing, monitoring and 
assessing environmental and climate change 
since time immemorial. Due to our close 
relationships with the Land, Water and Ice, 
knowledge keepers from these groups have 
a long history of adapting to seasonal and 
environmental variability through the use of 
indicators (Lede et al., 2021). However, the 
rapid pace and magnitude of recent climate 
changes are challenging our ability to utilize 
such indicators effectively in assessing 
environmental changes. Despite these 
challenges, several programs demonstrate 
the effectiveness of these methods, including 
the Haida Gwaii Watchman Program, the 
Askîy Initiative by the Métis Nation of 
Alberta (2020) and the Qikiqtani Inuit 
Association’s Community-based Monitoring 
Program (see Figure 6; ICHAP, 2021). These 
initiatives provide valuable information about 
environmental health and well-being, support 
the restoration of traditional governance 
systems and show how First Nations, Inuit and 
Métis engage in observational and relational 
research.
Community-based monitoring initiatives, 
where Indigenous Peoples and other relevant 
stakeholders participate in the management 
and governance of environmental or social 
phenomena, are one way Indigenous 
Knowledge Systems are integrated into 
mainstream environmental governance (Ndeloh 
Etiendem et al., 2020; Lam et al., 2019; 
Johnson et al., 2016; Danielsen et al., 2014; 
Danielsen et al., 2009). While there are both 
benefits and challenges to community-based 
monitoring (Hovel et al., 2020; Conrad and 
Hilchey, 2011; Danielsen et al., 2009), its 
popularity has significantly grown, especially 
among Indigenous Peoples (Ndeloh Etiendem 
et al., 2020; Kuokkanen, 2019) and in boreal 
and Arctic regions (Brunet et al., 2020; Heath 
and Arragutainaq, 2019; Whyte et al., 2016; 
Brunet et al., 2014a; Brunet et al., 2014b; 
Pulsifer et al., 2012).
Indigenous Guardian programs, also known 
as Rangers or Watchmen, is another example 
of community-based monitoring growing 
in popularity (see Case Story 8; Reed et al., 
2021a). Indigenous Peoples have increasingly 
turned to these programs to address specific 
community needs and concerns related to 
resource development (Whiteman and Mamen, 
2002) and climate change (Lam et al., 2019). 
Studies on Indigenous community-based

monitoring have characterized it as a tool for 
empowering communities (Danielsen et al., 
2009), building trust and credibility among 
actors (Fernandez-Gimenez et al., 2008), 
monitoring activities on Indigenous Lands and 
territories (Dehcho First Nations et al., 2016), 
and supporting cultural revitalization and 
intergenerational knowledge sharing (Peachey, 
2015). However, some scholars have raised 
concerns about Indigenous community-based 
monitoring, noting its potential to perpetuate 
the marginalization of Indigenous Peoples and 
our knowledge (Reed et al., 2020; Lane and 
Corbett, 2005), especially when Indigenous 
Peoples are not directly included in decision-
making processes (Conrad and Hilchey, 2011).
CASE STORY 8: Tracking change in the Mackenzie River Basin
The Mackenzie River basin, covering one-fifth 
of the country’s land area, is experiencing 
stress from climate change and is largely under 
researched by scientists and governments. First 
Nations, Inuit and Métis, who live and spend 
time on the Land throughout the basin, possess 
immense knowledge and experiences vital for 
understanding changes in the region.
A common indicator of change is water levels. 
During the decade from 2010 to 2019, 
Indigenous Peoples throughout the Mackenzie 
River Basin reported a prolonged period of 
decreased water levels and flows, accompanied 
by slower currents and eroding riverbanks. 
These changes may have been the result of 
warmer weather and reduced rainfall. This 
period was then followed by at least three 
years of high water and flooding throughout 
the basin. Such extreme variability in water 
levels, both high and low, complicates access to 
traditional fishing and hunting areas.
Water levels, among other indicators, are 
integral to Indigenous monitoring systems, 
which focus on watching, listening, learning 
and understanding change. These systems are 
deeply rooted in sociocultural practices like 
hunting, trapping, fishing, harvesting plants, and 
engaging in cultural and spiritual ceremonies. 
Indigenous approaches to monitoring yield 
unique observations and insights, arising from 
a profound relationship with the environment. 
As the late Dënesųłıné Elder Morris Lockhart 
of the Łutsël K’é Dene First Nation observed, 
“those who don’t care would not notice the 
changes.” People with a strong connection to 
the Land can often distinguish between natural 
ecological variability and changes that fall 
outside natural norms.
The initiative “Tracking change: The role of local 
and traditional knowledge in watershed 
governance”, a network of 30 Indigenous-led 
projects in the Mackenzie River Basin (Tracking 
Change, n.d.) is addressing this issue.

8.0 The food, water and energy nexus is 
central to First Nation, Inuit and Métis 
climate leadership
Food sovereignty is at the heart of First 
Nation, Inuit and Métis cultures. The nexus 
of food, water and energy sovereignty 
is a key priority for First Nations, Inuit 
and Métis. In each context, reasserting 
authority and decision-making is enabling 
a redistribution of power towards First 
Nations, Inuit and Métis. The revitalization 
of meaningful Indigenous economies based 
on relationships with the Land, Water and 
Ice are central to this redistribution and to 
Indigenous-led climate action.
Food is central to our ways of life. Our traditional 
foods have sustained us for millennia, not only 
through nourishment, but also by sustaining our 
culture, language, values and knowledge through 
the practices of harvesting, preparing and 
sharing food.
We have the right to food sovereignty and to 
access the foods we choose. Due to colonialism, 
our communities face food insecurity rates 
higher than other populations in our remote 
communities and in urban areas. We deserve 
equity and access to adequate, affordable and 
healthy foods.
Water and energy are key priorities for our 
communities. We need access to and protection 
of healthy water in both built and natural 
environments, for ourselves and for our more-
than-human relations. We need innovation, 
localization and security in energy sources, which 
benefit our communities and create meaningful 
economies.
The impacts of climate change bring new, 
compounding and serious challenges to our food, 
water and energy security. In response, we are 
reasserting our authority and decision-making to 
restore our systems of food, water and energy. 
Revitalizing our economies—grounded in our 
relationships with the Land, Water, Ice and all 
beings—is crucial to this process, as well as to 
broader efforts to transition to a low-carbon 
future.
8.1 Introduction
Despite developing highly complex food 
systems since time immemorial, colonization 
has significantly impacted the ability of First 
Nations, Inuit and Métis to access traditional 
foods (Willows et al., 2022; Robin et al., 2021; 
Lemke and Delormier, 2017; Kulchyski and 
Tester, 2007). Control of food, food sharing, 
harvesting, distribution and production by the 
federal government through various colonial, 
racist and detrimental laws and policies 
has oppressed Indigenous Peoples, leading 
to widespread food insecurity across First 
Nations, Inuit and Métis communities (First 
Nations Food Nutrition and Environment 
For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report 53
Study, 2021; Gombay, 2005). Considering 
these challenges, First Nations, Inuit and Métis 
are resisting these systems of oppression by 
exercising autonomy over our Lands, Waters 
and traditional foods, and advancing Indigenous 
food sovereignty (Snook, 2021; Settee and 
Shukla, 2020; ITK, 2019a; ICC, n.d.).
Food serves as a lens for understanding and 
addressing climate change-related issues 
in our communities (Caughey et al., 2022). 
Climate change significantly impacts Indigenous 
food systems and food security, for example, 
through changing weather conditions and 
increasing costs associated with harvesting 
and accessing food, as well as affecting water 
systems (Lewis and Peters, 2017).
The nexus of food, water and energy 
sovereignty is a key priority for First Nations, 
Inuit and Métis (Huntington et al., 2021b). 
In each context, reasserting authority and 
decision-making powers has enabled a 
redistribution of power towards First Nations, 
Inuit and Métis governments and citizens. 
This movement towards self-determination 
and sovereignty is central to addressing the 
structural legacy of colonization by re-localizing 
control over food, water and energy systems 
(Elliott et al., 2022; Huntington et al, 2021b).
While climate change significantly impacts 
both Indigenous and non-Indigenous economic 
systems, Indigenous Peoples’ perspectives 
on the economy offer valuable insights. 
Shifting organizing principles from scarcity to 
abundance opens the possibility of reframing 
global discussions on “just transitions” from 
a narrative of “winners and losers” to one 
of cooperation and reciprocity, grounded 
in a responsibility to care for the Land in its 
entirety.
8.2 Food sovereignty, security, 
safety and management
First Nations, Inuit and Métis have developed 
highly complex food systems since time 
immemorial. Sophisticated, sustainable and 
regenerative food production was evident 
from coast to coast to coast, supporting our 
existence “...for millennia on healthy diets of 
locally produced and gathered foods, which 
closely linked local communities with their 
diverse environments” (Beck, 2017, p. 1). In the 
Human Rights Watch report on food insecurity 
in First Nations (2020), Gitanyow Hereditary 
Chief Malii described how his grandfather 
referred to the animals and plants in their 
traditional diet as “dinner table” in his language. 
He recalled, “[My grandfather] described 
the moose, berries and fish like that. He also 
referred to it as [a] bank.” Indigenous Peoples 
characterize a holistic and relational approach 
to food as “...rooted in land and water-based 
practices for food and lifeways that mark 
interdependent relations between humans, and 
between human and natural ecologies” (Pictou, 
2018, p. 14).
These food ecosystems drastically changed 
with European contact (Pictou, 2017). Control 
of food sharing, harvesting, distribution 
and production were wielded as weapons, 
reinforcing colonial doctrines of violence, 
assimilation and dispossession (Nightingale and 
Richmond, 2022; Richmond et al., 2021). For 
instance, Daschuk (2014) describes how famine 
was deliberately used as a policy weapon 
by the Canadian government during Prairie 
expansion to coerce “uncooperative Indians” 
onto reserves and remove them from Lands 
coveted by white settlers. Other impacts have 
manifested in many ways, such as high rates 
of water- and food-borne disease (Thivierge 
et al., 2016; Harper et al., 2015a; Harper 
et al., 2015b; Goldfarb et al., 2013), lack of 
54 For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report
affordable and accessible healthy food sources 
(Beaumier et al., 2015; Council of Canadian 
Academics, 2014), contamination of Land and 
Water (Traditional Ecological Knowledge Elders 
Group, n.d.) and a decline in the percentage of 
food harvested from traditional sources due to 
decreased access to Land, loss of harvesting 
skills, increasing costs, restrictions on hunting 
and increased access to store-bought foods 
(National Collaboration Centre for Aboriginal 
Health, 2013). The Traditional Ecological 
Knowledge Elders Group expressed concerns 
about the herbicide glyphosate, stating, 
“We are dependent socially, economically, 
spiritually and culturally on the health of the 
forest, including the wildlife, plants, water and 
soil. In many areas, we cannot trust that the 
medicines and foods we harvest are clean 
and uncontaminated. The aerial spraying of 
glyphosate violates our treaty rights to the 
water and to hunt, fish, and gather berries and 
plant medicines in our traditional territories” 
(Traditional Ecological Knowledge Elders 
Group, n.d.).
Data shows that 48% of First Nations 
households have difficulty putting enough food 
on the table (Chan et al., 2021) and Inuit are 
the most food insecure Indigenous Peoples in 
the developed world (ITK, 2019a; Rosol et al., 
2011). For Métis, there is a lack of research 
on climate-related food insecurity impacts, but 
concerns have been raised about a shortened 
goose hunt, changes in the movement and 
location of fish and their habitat, changes 
to the health, behaviour and distribution of 
caribou and moose, changes in the availability 
and quality of certain types of berries and 
the impacts of warmer weather on food 
preservation methods (Métis Nation British 
Columbia, 2022; North Slave Métis Alliance 
community members et al., 2017; Guyot et al., 
2006). From this perspective, the revitalization 
of Indigenous food systems is central to the 
climate crisis and “...an important part of our 
recovery from the impacts of colonization” 
(Simpson, 2011, p. 131).
Climate change has significant and growing 
impacts on Indigenous food systems and food 
availability. The unpredictability of weather and 
environmental conditions related to climate 
change and the increasing costs of harvesting 
(e.g., extra food, gas, supplies, multiple trips) 
threaten the ability of First Nations, Inuit and 
Métis to travel on the Land, Water and Ice 
to access traditional foods (King and Furgal, 
2014). Furthermore, later freeze-up and earlier 
thaw due to warming temperatures shorten 
the winter road season, requiring alternate 
means of getting food to remote communities 
and adding to the already high costs of 
imported foods in northern and remote 
areas. Livelihoods that depend on harvesting 
fish, plants and wildlife are anticipated to be 
impacted by climate change (see Case Story 9; 
ICC Alaska, 2020; Jantarasami et al., 2018; 
Parlee et al., 2014; Dittmer, 2013); as are 
those in agriculture (Settee, 2020; Shinbrot et 
al., 2019; Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, 2013), 
transportation (Hori et al., 2018a; 2018b) and 
tourism and recreation (ICC, 2008).
Combined, these factors have led to decreased 
consumption of healthy and culturally preferred 
local foods and increased reliance on retail food 
(Dodd et al., 2018a, 2018b; Medeiros et al., 
2017; Berner et al., 2016; Loring and Gerlach, 
2015). This exacerbates already high rates of 
chronic diseases prevalent among First Nations, 
Inuit and Métis, including obesity, diabetes and 
cardiovascular diseases (Kolahdooz et al., 2015; 
Reading, 2015). First Nations, Inuit and Métis 
are responding to this reality by exercising 
autonomy over our Lands and traditional foods, 
a crucial process in addressing socioeconomic 
marginalization and health disparities 
(Coté, 2016).

CASE STORY 9: Reflections on weather, Inuit food systems and our 
way of life
By Ray Ruben, harvester, Mayor of Paulatuk 
in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region, Inuvialuit 
Game Council Representative and a 
contributing author to the For Our Future: 
Indigenous Resilience Report.
The weather has always been a topic of 
discussion when hunters meet. Today, weather 
is still a major factor in our daily and seasonal 
lifestyle. Over time, weather patterns have 
shifted and changed. A couple of decades 
back, we knew the river systems would freeze 
in early October. Now, the rivers freeze up in 
late October/early November. We once had 
winter hunting on the sea ice open in October, 
now the hunting season opens in December. 
It is now a very rare occasion to see icebergs 
and multi-year ice. We have had to adapt to 
the changing ice conditions to travel to and 
from our harvesting camp sites (see Figure 7). 
Our migrating animals and birds have also 
been impacted by the later freeze up and 
earlier thaw. Although they still migrate to the 
same areas to feed and rear their young, their 
migration routes and timing have changed. 
Conditions of the terrain and rivers, as well 
as the weather, are factors in their annual 
migrations.
The knowledge once passed down by our 
Elders, verbally and through storytelling in 
regard to weather and seasonal changes, 
does not reflect what is happening today. The 
weather has become more unpredictable, and 
in some seasons, more severe. The strength 
of the winter winds when they come have 
increased in velocity. We have broken 50‑year 
rainfall records and are observing more than 
usual coastal and inland erosion. The changes 
have impacted the ability of the Elders 
and harvesters to pass on the knowledge 
to younger people and families. Without 
the knowledge and teaching to become 
experienced travelers of the Land, it affects 
our ability and willingness to go out to live and 
harvest for our families. More young families 
are now focused on earning a wage to support 
their families. In some cases, both parents are 
forced to find work as food costs rise and they 
have less harvested food from the Land. The 
need to supplement country food for single 
families and the elderly who are unable to 
harvest for themselves has resulted in seasonal 
harvesting programs in limited numbers.
The seasonal harvesting of all our needs 
requires large freezer storage spaces. When the 
geese migrate through, we harvest and store 
enough for the next year so a typical family 
of four might need to harvest and store 50 to 
80 geese for the year. We also fish during the 
spring, summer and fall for the coming winter 
and again require freezer space to store the 
catch. So, for every species and food source we 
harvest, we need proper storage space. In the 
days before climate change and the resulting 
changes on the Land and Waters around us, we 
were able to keep our food year-round stored 
in icehouses. These icehouses were simply 
caves dug down into the permafrost, fashioned 
with storage rooms large enough for the needs 
of the community and insulated and sealed 
with proper hatches. Today, because of the 
changes in the climate, it is nearly impossible 
to construct an icehouse, maintain it and keep 
it frozen. The government ceased funding 
for community walk-in freezers, as funding 
became less accessible and depleted. Yet there 
continues to be a need for large freezer storage 
space for those communities that maintain a 
traditional lifestyle of seasonal harvesting and 
food gathering for. It has been shown that 
when there is no safe storage space available, 
harvest activities to bring in the needed food 
supply are affected.
56 For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report
Across Canada, there have been other 
innovative examples of asserting Indigenous 
food sovereignty including school and 
community gardens, greenhouses, traditional 
food education programs, market garden and 
food cooperatives, country food harvesting 
and sharing programs, wild food banks and 
fish-buying clubs (Robin, 2019; Kamal et 
al., 2015; Martens, 2015; Thompson et al., 
2012; Thompson et al., 2011). Others rely 
on strong traditional food sharing networks 
to address any climate-induced vulnerability. 
For example, in 2017 in the Skeena River 
watershed, salmon returns were at an all-time 
low, which required visiting the neighbouring 
Nisga’a territory to access healthier fish 
stocks (Human Rights Watch, 2020). In urban 
centres, providing Indigenous Peoples with the 
ability to learn about traditional practices and 
knowledge systems around food has been a 
proven mechanism to strengthen Indigenous 
food sovereignty (Ray et al., 2019). In an Inuit 
context, Sudlovenick (2019) worked with 
hunters from Iqaluit to discuss whether or not 
nattiit (ringed seals) were safe to eat, based 
on the presence of five pathogens—Brucella 
canis, B. abortus, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, 
Leptospira interrogans, and T. gondii— 
demonstrating how Indigenous Knowledge 
Systems can inform adaptation measures.
Lynn et al. (2013) recognized the importance of 
tapping into Indigenous Knowledge Systems to 
address these climate change-related impacts. 
While Government of Canada legislation 
historically inhibited many First Nations from 
participating in agriculture (Tang, 2003), today 
there are several examples of successful 
agricultural initiatives undertaken by First 
Nations, including the the Muskoday First 
Nation in Saskatchewan, which has operated 
a successful organic agriculture co-operative 
for over a decade (Martens, 2016) and the 
Blood Tribe Agricultural Producers in southern 
Alberta (Kulshreshtha et al., 2011) and. The 
Métis Nation of British Columbia launched a 
Home Garden Project Pilot in 2021 to support 
Métis citizens in purchasing their own garden 
supplies. The program was so successful that 
it was expanded in 2023 to provide over 300 
households with resources to access nutritious 
food and reconnect to their food system (Métis 
Nation British Columbia, n.d.).

8.3	Indigenous leadership at the 
nexus of water and energy 
sovereignty
The nexus of water and energy sovereignty 
is a key priority for First Nations, Inuit and 
Métis. In each context, reasserting authority 
and decision-making powers is enabling a 
redistribution of power. This move to self-
determination and sovereignty is central to 
addressing the structural legacy of colonization. 
Here, we will focus on water and energy given 
the above discussion.
8.3.1	 Energy
First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities are 
increasingly taking a leadership role in clean 
energy initiatives, currently leading a total 
of 204 projects greater than 1 MW across 
Canada (see Box 6; Indigenous Clean Energy, 
2022a; Hoicka et al., 2021). Since 2017, the 
number of medium and large Indigenous clean 
energy projects (over 1 MW, powers over 150 
homes) has grown by 29.6%. Energy sources 
for these projects include hydroelectricity 
(56.5%), wind (22.9%), solar (11.8%), bioenergy 
(7.1%) and hybrid sources (1.7%) (Indigenous 
Clean Energy, 2022a). Broadly, there is clear 
recognition that clean energy can uphold 
the stewardship and relational principles of 
Indigenous worldviews (Jaffar, 2015); support 
the reclamation of land and environmental 
rights (Lowan-Trudeau, 2017); contribute 
to local economic development and self-
sufficiency (Lipp and Bale 2018; Rezaei and 
Dowlatabadi, 2016); and uphold efforts for 
autonomy and self-determination (Stefanelli 
et al., 2019). Several studies and reports 
have examined Indigenous involvement in 
renewable energy initiatives across Canada and 
the response of Indigenous communities to 
preferential policies such as feed-in-tariff laws 
or grid-connection for off-grid communities 
(Indigenous Clean Energy, 2022a; Hoicka 
et al., 2021; Stefanelli et al., 2019). Key to 
this is addressing challenges with electricity 
governance, regulations and policies, often 
within the jurisdiction of provincial and 
territorial governments and part of the role of 
public and private utilities (Indigenous Clean 
Energy, 2022a).
There is an ongoing discussion about the 
benefits of legacy “green” energy projects. 
In particular, hydroelectric development has 
been a lightning rod for Indigenous resistance 
due to potentially enormous landscape and 
waterscape changes, as well as the long-term 
impacts of GHG emissions and methylmercury 
releases (Tsuji et al., 2021). Large projects, 
both historical (such as the Bennett Dam and 
system of dams in Cree and Inuit territory) 
and contemporary projects (such as Project C 
and Muskrat Falls), have generated significant 
responses from Indigenous Peoples, leading 
to protests and concessions (Luby, 2020). 
These projects can have significant negative 
impacts on the ability of Indigenous Peoples 
to engage in hunting, harvesting and gathering 
practices, as well as on sacred sites and cultural 
landmarks. For example, the James Bay Cree 
and Northern Quebec Agreement, one of 
the first modern land claims in Canada, was 
motivated by Quebec’s interest in hydroelectric 
development (Nungak, 2017). The consultation 
and consent process for these projects can 
often be inadequate, with First Nations, 
Inuit and Métis concerns and interests not 
being sufficiently addressed. Similar concerns 
exist about the waste from nuclear power. 
In Ontario, for instance, First Nations and 
Métis governments have raised significant 
concerns over the transportation and storage 
of nuclear waste, including in the proposed 
deep geological reservoir. Small modular 
reactors, however, have received some interest 
from First Nations, (e.g., CBC News, 2021; 
Qaujigiartiit Health Research Centre, 2019), for 
their potential for modular energy generation.
58 For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report
BOX 6: Indigenous sustainable energy projects
Indigenous Peoples are involved in the 
development of increasingly diversified 
and Indigenous-led clean energy projects 
in every region of Canada (Indigenous 
Clean Energy, 2022b; Lynch, 2017). 
Estimates suggest that First Nations, 
Inuit and Métis are now involved in over 
200 medium-to-large scale renewable 
energy projects, 1,700 to 2,100 micro or 
small-scale renewable energy systems, 72 
bioenergy projects and 19 transmission 
projects, bringing $295M in net annual 
returns and 2,870 person years of annual 
employment to Indigenous communities 
(Indigenous Clean Energy, 2022a; 2020).
Indigenous governments, corporations and 
other Indigenous entities are advocating 
for specific actions from federal, provincial 
and territorial governments that recognize 
Indigenous self-determination in clean 
energy strategies and are driven by 
economic reconciliation principles 
fostering policy efforts to achieve 
socioeconomic parity and Indigenous 
energy autonomy (National Indigenous 
Economic Development Board, 2022; 
Steffanelli et al., 2019). This includes 
decolonizing provincial, territorial and 
municipal energy systems, including 
public utilities (i.e., electricity and natural 
gas delivered to buildings), to enable 
Indigenous clean energy projects to 
contribute to these systems and generate 
returns (Lovekin et al., 2022).
The majority of the almost 300 
communities across Canada classified as 
off-grid and diesel-reliant are Indigenous. 
As a result, these communities are not 
only unable to benefit from an economy 
of scale on a very expensive fuel source 
but are also exposed to health risks from 
polluting emissions. Nunavut depends 
solely on diesel generators, many of 
which are outdated (Waterlutions Media 
and Wong, 2020). Funding from the 
Government of Canada—including Natural 
Resource Canada’s Clean Energy for 
Rural and Remote Communities program, 
Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern 
Affairs Canada’s Northern REACHE 
initiative and Indigenous Services 
Canada’s Strategic Partnerships Initiative, 
among others—has directed resources to 
support a transition off diesel by 2035.
The interconnections and challenges in 
energy generation also directly impact 
Indigenous Peoples’ ability to access 
food and water. First Nations, Inuit and 
Métis governments and organizations 
are working to ensure that federal, 
provincial and territorial governments 
align their obligations with respect to the 
implementation of the UNDRIP with the 
creation of Indigenous power authorities 
and utilities, where local Indigenous 
energy leadership promotes self-
sufficiency and supports Canada’s clean 
energy transition (Lovekin et al., 2022).
For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report 59
8.3.2	 Water 
First Nations, Inuit and Métis have been 
asserting authority over water governance, 
research and management (see Box 7; Craft 
and King, 2021; Irvine et al., 2020). For 
instance, the Government of Northwest 
Territories’ Northern Voices, Northern Waters 
Strategy (2018) explicitly includes provisions 
for recognizing Indigenous rights and considers 
Indigenous Knowledge as equivalent to 
western science (Global Water Futures, 2020; 
Sandford et al., 2011). In Mittimatalik (Pond 
Inlet), Nunavut, youth and supporting partners 
use traditional knowledge from community 
Elders in tandem with western scientific 
methods, such as water sampling, to study 
the increasing frequency of gastrointestinal 
illnesses in the community (ITK, 2019b). 
However, bridging knowledge systems can be 
challenging in practice (Mantyka-Pringle et al., 
2017). For example, the Mackenzie River Basin 
Board has a mandate to include Indigenous 
Peoples and integrate Indigenous Knowledge 
but struggles to adequately represent the 
diverse interests and knowledge of the 
many unique Indigenous communities in the 
Mackenzie River Basin’s work (see Case Story 8; 
Morris and de Loë, 2016).
60 For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report
BOX 7: Indigenous water governance
Indigenous Peoples across Canada and 
internationally have issued a variety of 
declarations expressing our alarm at the 
degradation of water systems, describing 
Water as a fundamental gift of the Creator 
and affirming our role and responsibility 
to care for Water for current and future 
generations. The United Nations Human 
Rights Council’s Special Rapporteur on the 
human rights to safe drinking water and 
sanitation recognizes the 2003 Indigenous 
Peoples Kyoto Water Declaration and 
advocates for an ecosystem approach and 
the consideration of Water as a common 
good in line with Indigenous Peoples’ 
integrated view of Water and aquatic 
ecosystems (United Nations Human Rights 
Council, 2022). In Indigenous cultures across 
Canada, women and their role as life-givers 
are linked to their roles as water stewards 
and in spiritual ceremonies to protect water 
bodies from pollution and maintain the 
ability of watersheds to absorb and retain 
water (National Collaborating Centre for 
Indigenous Health, 2022; Chiblow, 2019).
The right of Indigenous Peoples to 
self-determination includes effective 
participation in the management of large 
aquatic ecosystems. Climate change, 
together with unsustainable natural resource 
extraction practices, is having a negative 
impact on Indigenous Peoples’ access to 
safe drinking water and making Indigenous 
communities vulnerable to drought and 
flooding (Chakraborty, 2021). In northern 
Canada, climate change has influenced the 
hydrological cycle to such an extent that 
communities have reduced freshwater 
availability (ITK, 2021a; Waterlutions Media 
and Wong, 2020; Goldhar et al., 2014).
Far too many First Nations, Inuit and 
Métis communities continue to lack 
access to clean drinking water and water 
infrastructure. A number of Government of 
Canada commitments to ending drinking 
water advisories in Indigenous communities 
have failed to reach their targets for more 
than three decades (Swampy and Black, 
2021). In the face of these challenges, 
First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities 
across Canada are actively pursuing work to 
safeguard the watersheds in our homelands 
through new Indigenous Protected and 
Conserved Areas and water governance 
initiatives (Latulippe and McGregor, 
2022; Arsenault et al., 2018). Examples 
include the establishment of the Ashnola 
sməlqmíx Protected and Conserved Area by 
the Smalqmix of the Sukwnaqin-x (Lower 
Similkameen Indian Band, 2022), the 
Indigenous Watersheds Initiative in British 
Columbia and various initiatives of the 
National Indigenous Guardians Network, 
which reflect the inherent jurisdiction and 
responsibility of Indigenous Peoples to 
protect and manage our territories and 
watersheds according to Indigenous laws 
and customs. One example of this is the 
Anishinaabe Nibi Declaration (Craft and King, 
2021), which voices the relationship with 
Nibi (Water) and jurisdictional responsibility 
that all Anishinaabe citizens have within the 
Treaty #3 territory, in accordance with the 
Manito Aki Inakonigaawin (Mother Earth law).

8.4	Climate change impacts on 
Indigenous economic systems 
and regenerating meaningful 
economies
“
…We have a very real stake in the 
international community and our voices 
need to be heard, that this is not just an 
inconvenience to your bottom-line, to 
economies. This is a climate crisis.”
– Chief Dana Tizya-Tramm, Vuntut
Gwitchin First Nation
8.4.1	 Climate change impacts on 
Indigenous economic systems
In the above sections, we have described 
climate change as a cumulative impact 
related to the history and ongoing legacy 
of colonialism. In the Canadian context, 
this is directly linked to the imposition of 
an economic system on First Nations, Inuit 
and Métis that is predicated on our forceful 
removal, dispossession and criminalization. 
Further, Canada’s colonial practices have 
prevented First Nations, Inuit and Métis 
from participating in the Canadian economy 
(Yellowhead Institute, 2021), while at the same 
time trying to assimilate Indigenous Peoples 
into liberal capitalist citizens (Pasternak, 
2020). This context is essential to understand 
the impacts of a rapidly changing climate on 
Indigenous economic systems, which are based 
on relationships that protect the well-being of 
people, culture and knowledge systems (Kelly 
and Woods, 2021).
By contrast, the continued commitment to 
resource development on First Nations, Inuit 
and Métis Lands and Waters—as evident in the 
2022 Government of Canada’s Critical Minerals 
Strategy—alters “...the ability of Indigenous 
people to live with the Land in miyo wiche-towin 
(good relationships) or be able to have miyo 
pimatsowin (a good or healthy life / livelihood), 
through hunting, fishing or harvesting” (Jobin, 
2020, p. 109). This model of development is 
based on extracting the maximum amount 
possible while mitigating the “unacceptable” 
risks (Curran et al., 2020). Under this model, 
First Nations, Inuit and Métis governments and 
citizens are forced to fit or integrate economic 
systems into non-Indigenous systems. This 
is actively challenged by Indigenous Peoples 
(Hilton, 2021; Kelly, 2017; Kuokkanen, 2011), 
offering coherent and feasible alternatives 
to the mainstream economic system (see 
Section 8.4.3).
Progress on participation within the mainstream 
economy has improved for First Nations, Inuit 
and Métis citizens and governments in the last 
decade, including through Impact and Benefit 
Agreements, resource sharing and progressive 
procurement policies. However, we struggle 
with the authority to control decision-making, 
including leasing, permitting and licensing 
on our Lands and Waters, without constant 
obstruction (Pasternak, 2020). At the core of 
these challenges is the foundational question 
of who has the authority to make economic 
decisions (e.g., with respect to resource 
development, highway construction or other 
infrastructure-related decisions) on Land and 
Waters. Kelly (2017) highlights this clearly:
“[t]he challenge ahead for Indigenous People[s] 
contesting the foundations of capitalism lies 
in questioning who benefits from economic 
success, and who pays the cost of exploited 
land and resources” (p. 107). Decisions 
underlying the transition to a low-carbon 
future, including decarbonization decisions, 
cannot proceed without clearly considering the 
simultaneous goal of decolonization.
62 For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report
8.4.2	 Indigenous participation in shaping 
a low-carbon future
First Nations, Inuit and Métis participate in the 
global economy and the transition to a low-
carbon future in myriad ways. In highlighting 
this diversity, our intent is not to create 
divisions between Indigenous Peoples who are 
for or against development, or to the extreme, 
those who have “sold out” or “remained true” 
to their Indigenous values (Atleo, 2021). First 
Nations, Inuit and Métis can be both grounded 
in our culture and participate in the modern 
economy. Rather, our exploration seeks to 
highlight the complexity that First Nations, 
Inuit and Métis citizens, governments and 
communities need to navigate in the face 
of settler colonialism, neoliberal capitalism, 
environmental decision-making and the 
ongoing struggles for Indigenous self-
determination. The Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission (2015) summarizes this well: 
“sustainable reconciliation involves realizing the 
economic potential of Indigenous [Peoples] in 
a fair, just and equitable manner that respects 
their right to self-determination” (p. 207). 
Therefore, addressing climate change and its 
connection to the low-carbon transition is, at 
its foundation, about self-determination.
The Toward Net Zero by 2050 Conference 
Findings and Report prepared by the First 
Nations Major Projects Coalition (2022) 
explored opportunities for Indigenous Peoples 
within the net-zero energy transition. By 
providing examples of critical minerals, clean 
power generation, carbon capture, utilization 
and storage, and sustainable finance, they 
introduced a new vision in which Indigenous 
nations own or are presented with the 
opportunity to own or enter equity ownership 
in net zero energy and climate-resilient 
infrastructure projects. There are First Nations, 
Inuit and Métis governments that continue 
to seek equity-partnerships in resource 
development, including both conventional oil 
and gas development (such as liquid nitrified 
gas) and the infrastructure supporting its 
transmission (such as pipelines). In these 
contexts, there are also questions on whether 
equity-partnerships, without addressing the 
underlying decision-making frameworks in 
federal, provincial or territorial systems, are 
sufficient to truly advance decolonization and 
support the self-determination of First Nations, 
Inuit and Métis governments.
There are many other examples of First 
Nations, Inuit and Métis working to disrupt the 
mainstream economic system in both formal 
and informal ways. Indigenous Peoples have 
turned to the courts through strategic litigation 
to reinstate our jurisdiction and authority over 
resource development, such as the Delgamuukw 
case (The Canadian Encyclopedia, 2019). When 
these efforts do not materialize, First Nations, 
Inuit and Métis may resort to other forms of 
resistance. Indigenous Climate Action (2022; 
2021a; 2021b) released several documents as 
part of its Decolonizing Climate Policy work 
that calls out market-based mechanisms—such 
as carbon offsets and techno-innovations like 
geo-engineering—that perpetuate the colonial 
and capitalist systems driving the climate crisis. 
In whatever way First Nations, Inuit and Métis 
citizens and governments participate in climate 
action and the net-zero transition, they uphold 
our right to self-determination.

8.4.3	 Indigenous-led regeneration of 
meaningful economies
Potawatomi scholar Robin Wall Kimmerer 
speaks to the origin of the western economic 
system as one of scarcity, accumulation and 
competition (Kimmerer, 2013). Through 
describing her relationship with the Bozakmin 
(serviceberry in Potawatomi), she presents 
an alternative approach to economic 
organization—a gift economy that “arise[s] 
from the abundance of gifts from the Earth, 
which are owned by no one and therefore 
shared.” Carol Anne Hilton (2021), in her book 
Indigenomics, describes this difference: “While 
the Western mainstream economy is geared 
toward monetary transactions as a source of 
exchange, the Indigenous economy is based 
on relationship. Indigenous economies are the 
original sharing economy, the original green 
economy, regenerative economy, collaborative 
economy, circular economy, impact economy, 
and the original gift economy. The Indigenous 
economy is the original social economy” (p. 91).
This foundation of relationships and the 
extension of justice to all beings is a key 
element of Indigenous economies (Trosper, 
2022). Coulthard (2013) challenges us to avoid 
thinking that these are products of the past. 
Instead, through the application of Indigenous 
governance principles to non-traditional 
economic activities, we can support thriving 
Indigenous economies. Cash Back, a special 
report by the Yellowhead Institute (2021), 
summarizes this well:
“The multiplicity of Indigenous 
economies is not a future prospect: it 
is already here. It is in the community-
regulated fisheries and the dismantled 
dams that usher home fish kin. They 
exist in community freezers of wild 
meat, at feasts that fill bellies and hearts 
with connection and care. They can be 
seen in the governance protocols of 
sugar bush camps and salmon harvests. 
They live in lipstick lines, airlines, and 
moccasin making micro-enterprises. They 
are the multi-billion-dollar rental housing 
developments, tobacco trade, and 
lumber shops. They are in defund police 
movements, harm reduction initiatives, 
friendship centre childcares. At their 
core, what makes them Indigenous 
economies is that they do not exploit 
that which they depend upon to live, 
including people. And they protect a 
world that is not prepared to value 
people’s time, homelands, and harvests 
solely in cash” (p. 8).
Indigenous Peoples face challenges in the 
expressions of our economies both from a 
rapidly changing climate and from the structural 
and ongoing legacy of colonization. Making 
space for thriving Indigenous economies—and 
our basis in an ethic of relationality, reciprocity 
and responsibility—can offer important insights 
for efforts to advance both decolonization 
and decarbonization, while opening space for 
Indigenous-led climate action.
64 For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report
9.0 Self-determination is critical to 
Indigenous‑led climate action
Self-determination and governance are key 
rights and aspirations for First Nations, Inuit 
and Métis in the face of climate change. 
We must recognize and address how the 
impacts of climate change affect our ability to 
determine our own futures, govern ourselves 
and adapt our governance structures to the 
impacts of climate change.
We possess the right to self-determination, to 
govern ourselves and exercise rights for the 
well-being of our lives, the Land, Water and Ice, 
as well as for future generations and all life. In 
the context of climate change, past approaches 
to research, scientific inquiry, assessments, 
program design and delivery, funding and policy 
development have not been led by us.
This is changing. We are taking leadership 
and innovating in climate research, policy and 
actions that reflect our respective realities and 
experiences. These processes are generating 
knowledge and actions that inform responses 
to the climate change impacts our communities 
face. Within diverse Indigenous societies, women, 
youth and gender-diverse individuals are also 
assuming leadership roles and defining climate 
action.
As the climate changes, our ability to govern 
ourselves is affected, as relationships to the 
natural world are disrupted. As we move into 
the future, we must adapt our governance 
structures to maintain and transform decision-
making processes for the benefit of all. It is 
critical that our governments maintain authority 
and jurisdiction over our Lands, Waters, Ice and 
territories, and maintain our ability to exercise 
our rights and responsibilities.
9.1 Introduction
Indigenous self-determination is critical for 
effective adaptation and to actively address the 
compounding impacts of climate change as well 
as historical and ongoing forms of colonialism. 
Supporting Indigenous self-determination, 
recognizing Indigenous Peoples’ rights and 
supporting Indigenous knowledge-based 
adaptation are critical to reducing climate 
change risks and achieving success with climate 
action (Bird, 2021; Dawson et al., 2020; Gunn, 
2020; Townsend et al., 2020).
Until recently, the most common response 
to addressing climate change impacts in the 
lives of Indigenous Peoples has included 
participation in developing local, regional, 
national and international climate change 
responses (e.g., accords, plans, policies and 
strategies). Currently, First Nations, Inuit and 
Métis are creating our own laws, climate 
strategies and initiatives that draw on our 
knowledge, governance, laws and legal systems 
(see Case Story 10; Case Story 11; Case 
Story 12). Youth are articulating their responses 
and identifying pathways for a self-determined 
future (Yukon First Nations Climate Action 
Fellowship, 2023; Lim with Ɂehdzo Got’ı̨nę 
Gots’ę Nákedı [Sahtú Renewable Resources 
Board] and The Pembina Institute, 2014).
For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report 65
Despite the barriers to Indigenous leadership 
in current climate change approaches, learning 
from Indigenous-led frameworks can support 
Indigenous climate governance. This includes 
recognizing that climate policy must prioritize 
the Land and emphasize rebalance with the 
Land, operate on a nation-to-nation basis, 
recognize the right to self-determination, 
prioritize and generate Indigenous Knowledge 
and governance, and advance integrated and 
interdependent climate actions.
CASE STORY 10: Indigenous law in action: The Listuguj Mi’gmaq Fishery
In 1993, the Listuguj Mi’gmaq First Nation 
Government reclaimed the management of 
the salmon fishery in the Restigouche River, 
where it flows between the provinces of New 
Brunswick and Quebec. These are Waters 
that the Listuguj Mi’gmaq people had fished 
for many generations. They did so by passing 
their own law, without seeking permission 
from provincial and federal governments. This 
was a Listuguj Mi’gmaq law, an assertion and 
manifestation of the nation’s right to fish and 
govern its people, Lands and Waters in its own 
ways. Since its adoption, the Listuguj Mi’gmaq 
First Nation Government Law on Fisheries and 
Fishing has been the effective law governing 
salmon fishing on the Restigouche River, 
displacing provincial and federal authority.
The law reflects that the lives of the salmon 
and the lives of the Mi’gmaq are intertwined 
and is also one of affirmation: to use, manage 
and occupy the Land and the Water in 
accordance with Mi’gmaq values, philosophies 
and ways-of-being (Mettalic and Chamberlain, 
2006, as cited in Ladner and Tait, 2017). As 
Fred Metallic writes, “in Mi’gmaq, I say ‘the 
salmon is my brother.’ If the salmon is my 
brother, then he’s no different than my uncle, 
my cousin, my aunt’s husband who has passed 
away. And all these people are buried here, 
all these people who shared their experience 
and understanding of salmon fishing; they 
shared their experiences and knowledge of 
this territory. They taught my father everything 
that he knows about salmon fishing… and he 
taught me… we continue to give back to people 
through the salmon so that we can continue 
to acknowledge and strengthen that we are 
connected” (p. x).
The law provides for co-management 
agreements with adjacent governments, in 
the interests of conservation and effective 
management of the resource. It also establishes 
means of monitoring the condition of the 
resource, setting harvest limits and carrying 
out other management activities. The 
creation of the Mi’gmaq fisheries law was a 
groundbreaking step in reclaiming governance 
as a Mi’gmaq right and practice. The law is 
about the fishery, but its significance extends 
far beyond the management of the river 
and the salmon, as important as those are. It 
restores to the government of the Listuguj First 
Nation its status as a lawmaking body. The 
nation has since expanded their lawmaking as 
it relates to fisheries, enacting in 2019 their 
Law on the Lobster Fishery and Lobster Fishing 
(Cornell et al., 2010).

CASE STORY 11: The connection between climate action and the 
protection of Métis rights
10	 For more information, see the video Métis National Council Wildfire Workshop available at 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe45DiYvgd4
Describing the significance of the 2022 
participation of the Métis Nation at the 27th 
Conference of the Parties of the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (COP 27), President Cassidy Caron of 
the Métis National Council (MNC) shared the 
following thoughts (Métis Nation of Alberta, 
2022):
“Here in Canada, we need to be having 
conversations with the folks that are at the 
decision-making tables to make sure that 
the Métis-specific Lands, that we have an 
inherent right to use and protect and be in 
relationship with, are going to be protected. 
We might not have those Lands within our 
own grasp right now, but we will be working 
towards that in the future so that we can 
raise our families on these Lands. And right 
now, what we need to do is make sure that 
those Lands will be protected so that we can 
have those Lands, that our families will be on 
those Lands, and growing up connected to 
the Lands that our ancestors grew up on…. 
As Métis people we are in a really unique 
position of being able to combine our deeply 
held connection to the Land with our really 
distinct history of adaptation and resiliency. 
Those are all things that we need to draw 
on…those strengths, as we move forward in 
trying to tackle the climate crisis.”
The Métis People rely on the Land for 
continued vitality of their physical, spiritual, 
socioeconomic and political life. Métis have 
found innovative ways to live in their particular 
environments, despite diminished access 
and displacement from Land and Waters 
(MNC’s National Environment Committee [JF 
Consulting, 2020]). This resilience to change, 
built over generations, will allow the Métis to 
play an important role in adaptation efforts 
and environmental sustainability as the climate 
changes. The MNC’s National Métis Climate 
Change and Health Vulnerability Assessment 
identified the following climate change impacts 
as major risks to all Governing Members 
including increased frequency and severity of 
forest fires, flooding, extreme heat and drought, 
vector-borne diseases and invasive species. 
The assessment also identified regionally-
specific risks for each Governing Member (JF 
Consulting, 2020). However, despite these 
risks, the Métis Nation is taking proactive 
action to protect its citizens and advance 
Métis Climate Leadership through a number of 
programs and research, like the MNC’s work 
around Métis connections to wildland fire (see 
Case Story 13).10
In 2024, the Métis National Council, in 
partnership with its Governing Members, will 
be releasing its National Climate Strategy, 
which will define the roadmap to move forward 
on our self-defined climate change priorities.
For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report 67
CASE STORY 12: Research by Inuit for Inuit
Inuit-academic research relationships in 
Inuit Nunangat have a fraught history (e.g., 
Gearheard and Shirley, 2009), and Inuit 
have worked for decades to shift the power 
imbalances that characterize research 
institutions (ITK, 2018). Inuit have made key 
contributions to research throughout Inuit 
Nunangat for generations but historically have 
rarely if ever been acknowledged for their work 
and even then only as unidentified assistants 
(Bell, 2019).
Two decades ago, Inuit communities came 
together to carry out the first research study to 
document Inuit observations of climate change 
and its impacts on Inuit lives across Inuit 
Nunangat. Unikkaqatigiit: Putting the Human 
Face on Climate Change (Nickels et al., 2005) 
was released in 2005. Within days, the Inuit 
Circumpolar Council Canada launched one 
of the first legal petitions seeking relief from 
human rights violations caused by the United 
States government’s lack of action to combat 
GHG emissions (ICC, 2005). While the petition 
was denied a hearing at the time, it played 
a key role in initiating a normalized global 
dialogue about the human rights implications of 
climate change that continues to this day.
The National Inuit Strategy on Research 
(2018) is the first road map for achieving the 
Canadian Inuit vision for self-determination in 
research, and its implementation plan defines 
Inuit expectations for research partnerships in 
Inuit Nunangat (ITK, 2018). At an international 
level, the Inuit Circumpolar Council has 
outlined a series of Inuit-driven protocols for 
the equitable and ethical engagement of Inuit 
in research (ICC, 2022). The first Inuit-led, 
governed and directed research program, Inuit 
Qaujisarnirmut Pilirijjutit, was established in 
2021. Along with the Canada-Inuit Nunangat-
United Kingdom Arctic Research Programme, 
it is at the forefront of Inuit-led and co-
developed research programs. The forthcoming 
Inuit Nunangat research policy will clarify Inuit 
expectations for Inuit involvement in setting 
Canada’s Arctic research agenda in the future.
Inuit research methodologies are now 
fostered in a number of Canadian Inuit 
policies and strategies, including the National 
Inuit Climate Change Strategy (ITK, 2019a) 
and the Inuit Nunangat Food Security Strategy 
(ITK, 2021), and through the work of Inuit 
co-management institutions such as the 
Fisheries Joint Management Committee and 
the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board 
(Snook et al., 2018b). Internationally, the 
Inuit-led Pikialasorsuaq (North Water Polynya) 
Commission brought Inuit from Nunavut and 
Greenland together to determine Inuit research 
and management priorities for a key marine 
area vulnerable to climate change in the High 
Arctic (Canada, 2019).
A growing number of Inuit and non-Inuit 
researchers now engage in meaningful and 
collaborative research partnerships in Inuit 
Nunangat, tied to aspirational work to renew 
Inuit knowledge systems linked to Inuit-driven 
policy needs, and guided by Inuit knowledge 
experts and Elders (e.g., Cuerrier et al., 
2022; Harper et al., 2021; Ittaq Heritage and 
Research Centre, 2021; Loseto et al., 2020; 
Pedersen et al., 2020; Sawatzky et al., 2020; 
K.J. Wilson et al., 2020; Carter et al., 2019; 
Huntington et al., 2019; Qaujigiartiit Health 
Research Centre, 2019; Jones et al., 2018; 
McGrath, 2018; Cuerrier et al., 2015).
68 For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report
CASE STORY 13: Indigenous-led stewardship and research: Yunesit’in 
First Nation fire stewardship
To be resilient in the face of increasing wildfire 
risk due to climate change, Yunesit’in First 
Nation, located 90 km west of Williams Lake, 
BC, is revitalizing their fire practices. In the 
winter of 2017, in collaboration with Gathering 
Voices Society, the community developed 
a pilot program to revitalize Yunesit’in fire 
stewardship. This pilot project allowed 
Yunesit’in fire practices to be used on the Land 
for the first time in at least two generations. It 
began in 2019, with 15 hectares burned and 
six community members trained to interpret 
landscapes, seasons and local ecological 
indications to determine where and when 
to burn. By 2021, the program expanded to 
include more than 150 hectares burned.
The fire stewardship program involves 
landscape planning for applying low-intensity 
“cool” burns to areas with high fuel loads. The 
fuels typically include dried grasses and shrubs 
as well as woody debris from trees that have 
died from insect infestation, disease, drought 
or previous wildfire. The volume of fuels in 
these forests and grasslands is significant and 
acknowledged as unhealthy by community 
members for several reasons: the buildup of 
debris is a wildfire risk; the forest is difficult to 
access for community members; and wildlife 
like deer and moose have trouble navigating 
through this debris. Community members 
have identified that a key role for people is 
to “clean the landscape” with fire, opening up 
grasslands for wildlife, making forests easier to 
access and promoting new growth for animals 
to feed. The fire stewardship program is also 
studying the effects of cultural burning on fire 
behaviour, forest health, berries, ungulates and 
carbon emissions. This research will help to 
further the understanding of the role of fire as 
a stewardship tool.
The program fulfills three general goals 
identified by the community: 1) it strengthens 
cultural connection and well-being through 
revitalizing and sharing Indigenous Knowledge 
around fire; 2) it helps restore the health of 
the Land through Indigenous fire stewardship, 
which can result in fewer wildfires, the 
protection of biodiversity and the maintenance 
of culturally important sites; and 3) fire 
stewardship is a way to respect traditional 
laws, reflecting responsibilities to the Land and 
future generations.
Fire stewardship is viewed by the community 
as a pathway to revitalizing teachings and Land 
stewardship practices and restoring the health 
of the Land. The ambition for the program 
is to build public awareness of Indigenous 
fire stewardship and then to catalyze these 
programs across British Columbia and Canada.

9.2 Indigenous governance, 
self‑determination, law and 
legal systems
Indigenous Peoples have long histories of 
governance systems to manage our Lands, 
resources and relations with other beings 
(Whyte, 2017a). As a result of this place-based 
knowledge, many communities possess a well-
developed capacity to adapt to environmental 
and climatic change (Whitney et al., 2020). 
Governance systems (see Table 2) vary among 
nations and communities, yet they are generally 
structured by webs of mutual responsibilities 
that are shared across humans, the Land and 
more-than-human beings (Whyte, 2016). 
In the environmental sphere, governance 
includes systems that range from customs to 
processes and coordinate the achievement 
of environmental outcomes, such as clean air 
and water and resource development (Whyte, 
2016). These processes can be categorized 
as monitoring climate change, mitigating and 
adapting to impacts and ensuring climate 
resilience (Wale, 2022; Lindenmayer and 
Likens, 2010).
There are other examples of Indigenous 
governance (see Table 2) that address broader 
environmental issues rather than specific 
climate-related targets. Their structures 
range from top-down plans to collaborative 
partnerships and Indigenous-led climate actions.

70 For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report
As climate change transforms the landscapes 
around Indigenous communities, it also affects 
Indigenous Peoples’ legal traditions and our 
ability to transmit them. Central to this reality 
is the understanding that Indigenous laws and 
legal systems are intertwined with the Land, 
Water and Ice and practices that occur there, 
such as hunting, fishing, cooking and medicinal 
practices. Asch et al. (2018), drawing on 
teachings from Elder Basil Johnston, describes 
this as akinoomaagewin, meaning that “... we 
learn how to live well by giving our attention to 
the Earth and taking direction from her” (p. 51). 
Luschiim, a Cowichan Elder, explains how the 
Land is inextricably tied to the transmission of 
law or the manner in which snuw’uyulh (law) is 
taught, refined and studied in the Coast Salish 
legal tradition: “The land opens the door for 
our snuw’uyulh. It gives us the opportunity 
to learn. For me and my family, being out 
on the land, it opens the door to share our 
snuw’uyulh. Looking back, so many plus years 
ago, that’s what it did for myself. When my 
great grandfather Luschiim would come to visit, 
after sitting down with us for a while, he would 
always take us for walks (me and my sister) and 
that’s where he shared the snuw’uyulh. At that 
particular time, I didn’t know why he was doing 
that. But as I think about it now, in relation to 
my experiences with my own grandchildren, it 
becomes clear. You see, I can sit here, like we’re 
doing, in the house and talk about these things, 
but there are always some things you can miss. 
But when I’m out there in the mountains, or 
on the salt water, it opens my eyes to what I 
should be sharing. What I should be sharing 
with them right now” (Morales et al., 2016, 
p.  115).
For instance, climate change impacts on the 
sockeye salmon stocks in the Coast Salish 
world is one such example. If Indigenous 
Peoples no longer have access to sockeye 
salmon, then they not only lose a source of 
dietary support but also lose the intangible 
teachings (laws and legal practices) associated 
with that resource. They lose the ability to 
transmit the teachings of sharing, reciprocity, 
responsibility and stewardship, as it relates to 
the sockeye. Other examples linking Land to 
laws and other teachings exist as well, such 
as fishing sites regarded as sacred portals to 
access Stó:lō ancestors (see Case Story 5.1 
in RPR-5; Kelly, 2017); the role maple syrup 
holds as a central place in Algonquin worldview 
(Corbiere, 2011); the Lakota, Nakota and 
Dakota creation story connected to the buffalo 
and the buffalo hunt (Macdougall and St-Onge, 
2013; Deloria, 2006) and, in an Inuit context, 
a lens of balance and Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit 
(Rahm et al., 2017).
Indigenous author, theologian and historian 
Vine Deloria Jr. confirmed the special 
relationship between Indigenous Peoples 
and our territorial spaces when he stated 
that “Indigenous Peoples often give greater 
prominence to the place and environment that 
we occupy than we do to time in the western 
sense of the word” (Deloria Jr., 1973). So, our 
continuing connection to the Land and fulfilling 
our role within that ongoing relationship is 
centered on our specific environment and the 
relationships it maintains. As one can see, the 
practice of law is greatly affected when climate 
change alters the landscapes and related 
natural resources, which Indigenous Peoples 
rely on.
9.3	Impacts of climate change on 
Indigenous governance
Whyte (2016) introduced the concept of 
“colonial déjà vu” to characterize how climate 
injustice is embedded within a cyclical and 
larger history of anthropogenic change driven 
by colonialism, industrialism and capitalism. 
This cyclical and structural legacy has also 
manifested in the supremacy of one knowledge 
For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report 71
system and its description of the climate 
“problem,” blocking discussions on the root 
causes of the biodiversity and climate crisis 
(Stoddard et al., 2021). Furthermore, this has 
manifested in the design and implementation 
of current environmental governance 
frameworks. For example, Mackey (2016) 
describes how some foundational concepts 
of ownership, separation and improvement 
that underlie western scientific thought—and 
by consequence, environmental governance—
differ from Indigenous ways of knowing. 
When management or governance regimes 
are built upon these ideologies, the inherent 
rights of Indigenous Peoples are dominated, 
overshadowed and marginalized (Walsey and 
Brewer, 2018). Unfortunately, when Indigenous 
Peoples do participate, it has been limited 
due to power imbalances and differences in 
worldviews (e.g., western science emphasizes 
facts, whereas Indigenous Knowledge Systems 
emphasize relationships) (Littlechild, 2014). In 
this regard, Whyte (2019) discusses how these 
differences, including how climate “solutions” 
disregard the essential role of relationships, 
including those with our more-than-human 
kin, push society past both an ecological and 
relational tipping point.
Until recently, the most common response 
to addressing climate change impacts in the 
lives of Indigenous Peoples has included 
participation in climate approaches led by 
others. This has proven to be unsatisfactory 
(Indigenous Climate Action, 2021a; Reed 
et al., 2021b). There are few formal and 
public examples of Indigenous assertions 
of Indigenous climate governance and self-
determination. The National Inuit Climate 
Change Strategy (ITK, 2019a) offers one such 
example. This strategy demonstrates how 
Indigenous Peoples are working towards 
addressing climate change issues from the local 
to global scales on our own terms and to create 
effective adaptation initiatives that speak to the 
needs and priorities of our communities (ITK, 
2019a). A more regional example is the British 
Columbia First Nations Climate Strategy and 
Action Plan (British Columbia Assembly of First 
Nations, 2022), created with British Columbia 
First Nations and informed by Indigenous 
Knowledge, principles and worldviews. The 
objective of the Strategy is to: “Identify 
strategies and actions to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions, to strengthen Indigenous 
climate leadership in British Columbia, to 
reduce vulnerability to impacts and to build 
capacity, understanding and resilience in First 
Nations. The Strategy is intended to help guide 
climate responses while also communicating 
to governments and partners of priority 
areas. This will, in turn, remind governments 
and partners that successful climate action 
is possible only when co-created with First 
Nations in ways that protect and strengthen 
Title, Rights and jurisdiction, and when 
Indigenous Knowledge and unique connections 
to territories are respectfully acknowledged 
and thoroughly incorporated in all aspects of 
climate planning and action” (British Columbia 
Assembly of First Nations, 2022).
In support of Indigenous climate governance, 
First Nations, Inuit and Métis are developing 
our own culturally relevant climate toolkits 
and delivering training to youth, community 
activators and leaders (see the work of the 
Centre for Indigenous Environmental Resources 
and the Arctic Institute of Community-Based 
Research, for example). A noteworthy example 
by the Métis Nation British Columbia (MNBC) 
is a virtual climate preparedness workshop 
series called Strengthening Our Resilience to 
Climate Change (MNBC, 2021). The purpose 
of the series was to share multi-generational 
knowledge, skills and experience to support 
good decision-making in a changing climate 
(refer to graphic on page 5 of MNBC, 2021).
72 For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report
The Native Women’s Association of Canada 
(NWAC) developed the Environmental 
Conservation and Climate Change Office 
(ECCCO) toolkit known as Impact of Climate 
Change on Indigenous Women, Girls, Gender-
Diverse and Two-Spirit People (NWAC and 
ECCCO, 2022). The purpose of the toolkit is 
to generate gender-diverse climate knowledge 
in support of decision-making. A key example 
of grassroots climate self-determination is 
the launch of Indigenous Climate Action’s 
Indigenous Climate Leadership Program and 
associated toolkit. These are intended to 
develop climate actions that are community 
derived and led (Indigenous Climate Action, 
2021c). Finally, the First Nations Health 
Authority (FNHA) leads and administers a 
community-driven funding program focused 
on climate change—the FNHA’s Indigenous 
Climate Health Action Program (ICHAP) 
supports First Nations leadership in reducing 
climate change impacts on health. Projects 
through this program can support climate 
health in general or on developing a strategy or 
action plan to reduce climate change impacts 
on community health” (First Nations Health 
Authority, n.d.).
9.4 Adaptive Indigenous 
governance in the face of a 
changing climate
9.4.1	 Indigenous-led opportunities and 
meaningful recognition
When Indigenous Peoples are in control of 
climate change policy and programming, as 
opposed to being managed by an external 
entity, the outcomes are drastically different 
(Thompson et al., 2020). Success of 
Indigenous-controlled climate actions, however, 
comes with the qualifier of needing sufficient 
funding and resources. Without adequate 
government support and investment, free 
of paternalistic conditions, even the most 
effective and prospective Indigenous-led 
climate actions will face challenges.
Examples of Indigenous-led climate actions 
include independent renewable resource 
development (Stefanelli et al., 2019), disaster 
recovery programming (Yellow Old Woman-
Munro et al., 2021), and the codification and 
enforcement of Indigenous laws, such as Grand 
Council Treaty 3’s Great Resource Law and the 
Manito Aki Inakonigaawin, which ensure the 
duty to respect and protect Lands that may be 
affected from over-usage, degradation and un-
ethical processes. The Tsleil-Waututh Nation 
in British Columbia conducted their own 
environmental assessment of Kinder Morgan’s 
proposed expansion of the Trans Mountain 
Pipeline using its Stewardship Policy as the 
assessment framework. The Policy is based on 
Tsleil-Waututh and Coast Salish legal principles 
and provides a site- and species-specific list of 
stewardship obligations (Curran and Napoleon, 
2020). Additionally, the Siksika Nation in 
Alberta’s flood recovery system is centred 
on the legal principle of Ispommita, which 
connects community members and creates a 
shared belonging in response to the impacts of 
catastrophes related to climate change (Yellow 
Old Woman-Munro et al., 2021).
A necessary precursor to success in these 
types of programs is the meaningful 
recognition of Indigenous nationhood and self-
determination (N. Wilson et al., 2018). Settlers 
must do their part to respect Indigenous 
Land relationships, honour legal obligations, 
restore governance, and institute action to 
ensure a respectful relationship (Irlbacher-
Fox and MacNeill, 2020). The delegation of 
For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report 73
responsibilities to Indigenous Peoples, such as 
transferring customary maritime rights areas 
to Indigenous Peoples (Fischer et al., 2022), 
is requisite for the meaningful recognition of 
Indigenous rights and nationhood. The optimal 
outcome is sustainable self-determination, 
in which Nations have the capacity to 
manage resources and the Land according 
to traditional governance (Cameron et al., 
2019). These Indigenous-led climate programs 
can then set standards for state entities in 
managing resources and the Land (Curran and 
Napoleon, 2020). Moreover, they begin to curb 
government control in favour of Indigenous 
environmental governance (Curran and 
Napoleon, 2020).
In terms of research, Indigenous-designed 
frameworks draw on traditional law and 
ensure more control and autonomy over data 
collection within communities (Reid et al., 
2021). Indigenous Peoples and communities 
are involved in research on climate change 
and on projects and initiatives focused on 
renewable energy (CBC News, 2022; Hoicka et 
al., 2021; Mercer et al., 2020a; 2020b; 2020c; 
Stefanelli et al., 2019; McDiarmid, 2017), 
improving food security (Johnston and Spring, 
2021; Desmarais, 2019; Lee et al., 2019; 
Delormier et al., 2017), monitoring impacts 
of climate change (N. Wilson et al., 2018), 
building on traditional knowledge to combat 
and adapt to the climate crisis (Thompson et 
al., 2019; Pearce et al., 2015; Reid et al., 2014), 
and engaging with youth, women, Elders, and 
the community to build on climate knowledge 
and action (Whitney et al., 2020; Arruda and 
Krutkowski, 2017; MacDonald et al., 2015; 
Allen et al., 2014; Big-Canoe and Richmond, 
2014; Dowsley et al., 2010).
9.4.2	 Collaboration, pluralistic approaches 
and partnerships
Collaborative approaches to the climate 
crisis that incorporate Indigenous and 
western knowledge systems are beneficial 
structures to facilitate Indigenous climate 
governance (Ermine, 2005). The benefits of 
these approaches include empowering self-
determination (Cameron et al., 2019), reversing 
dependency on governments (Cameron et al., 
2019), the development of shared priorities 
such as the need for holistic and integrative 
approaches and the complementary differences 
between the two knowledge systems 
(Thompson et al., 2020).
Examples of collaborative policy models include 
nation-to-nation resource sharing agreements, 
co-management of Lands and ocean resources, 
pluralistic legal frameworks and Indigenous 
environmental guardianship programs (see Case 
Story 14). The Gwaii Haanas Marine Agreement 
(‘Marine Agreement’) of 2010 expands shared 
responsibilities for cooperative planning, 
operation and management of Canada’s first 
national marine conservation reserve (Curran 
and Napoleon, 2020). The Marine Agreement 
explicitly names the Haida as a full partner and 
notes that the relationship will fail if one party 
unilaterally exercises jurisdiction (Curran and 
Napoleon, 2020). Bypassing state authorities, 
Indigenous Peoples have also entered impact 
and benefit agreements with industrial 
developers to prevent and reduce the negative 
effects of industrial projects and address 
the distribution of benefits to communities 
(Bowie, 2013).
There are several caveats raised in the 
scholarship when it comes to collaborative 
approaches and co-management. First, legal 
74 For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report
pluralism and collaboration may perpetuate 
“legal centrism,” in which Indigenous legal 
systems and knowledge are overshadowed by 
dominant legal systems (Richardson, 2008). 
Second, there remain cautions as to whether 
Indigenous Knowledge Systems and western 
science may be successfully framed as equal 
within a shared structure (see Case Story 14). 
As stated by Fischer et al. (2022), the two may 
be diametrically opposed: “we feel deeply that 
Indigenous and Traditional Peoples’ knowledge 
is for connecting and living, while western 
science is for conquering and controlling” 
(Fischer et al., 2022, p. 292).
CASE STORY 14: Enhancing the reintroduction of plains bison in Banff 
National Park through cultural monitoring and traditional knowledge
While collaborative approaches are gaining 
traction, there is still a need to ensure 
Indigenous Knowledge and practices are given 
equal consideration. First Nations, Inuit and 
Métis are working to have their expertise 
and traditional knowledge recognized and 
meaningfully implemented in co-management 
settings.
In 2017, Parks Canada released 16 bison in 
the northeast section of Banff National Park. 
This herd has since grown to over 60 animals 
roaming throughout the reintroduction area. 
Although Parks Canada has been monitoring 
the ecological impacts of this reintroduction, 
there has been little to no cultural monitoring 
data collected. In response, the Stoney 
Nakoda Nations prepared their own report, 
which emphasizes the importance of their 
traditional and cultural knowledge and 
provided recommendations for how they can 
be meaningfully included in the management 
of the buffalo. The report notes that western 
science, legislation, and policy continue to play 
the leading role in park management.
The report recommendations include several 
ways that Parks Canada and the Stoney 
Nakoda can work more closely together to 
ensure the continued success of the bison 
reintroduction program. Stoney Nakoda 
Elders and field technicians emphasized the 
importance of ceremony for project success 
at all stages of the Bison Cultural Project and 
the need for continued cultural monitoring. 
Cultural monitoring can be used to better 
understand bison herd dynamics, predator-prey 
relationships with wolves and grizzly bears, and 
to better describe the renewed connection to 
the Land by the Stoney Nakoda Nations. The 
report stresses that projects such as this are 
an integral part of Truth and Reconciliation 
and demonstrate how Traditional Ecological 
Knowledge can be woven with western science 
to define a more holistic approach to park 
management.
Meaningfully including Stoney Nakoda people 
and knowledge in the bison reintroduction in 
Banff National Park is a way to not only ensure 
the successful reintroduction of bison to the 
landscape but also to ensure the reconnection 
of the Stoney Nakoda peoples to their ancestral 
and sacred territories.

9.4.3	 International collaboration, 
knowledge-sharing and solidarity 
Globalization has the positive effect of 
facilitating communication and sharing 
of strategies and solutions among global 
Indigenous Peoples (Fischer et al., 2022). 
Knowledge-sharing and solidarity on the 
international stage bridge diverse knowledge 
systems and challenge historical tactics of 
division inherent to colonization (Cameron 
et al., 2019). On the international stage, 
Indigenous Peoples have pushed for the 
inclusion of their knowledge, rights, and 
governance in conventions and initiatives such 
as the United Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the United 
Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, 
the IPCC, and the International Union for 
the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). In the 
UNFCCC, Indigenous Peoples secured the 
inclusion of rights-based language in the 
preamble to the Paris Agreement and five other 
references to Indigenous Peoples, including 
the recognition of their knowledge (Art. 7, 
para. 5). The emergence of references to 
Indigenous Peoples within the UNFCCC has 
been tracked by the International Indigenous 
Peoples Forum on Climate Change and the 
Centre for International Environmental Law 
(UNFCCC, 2021), showing a clear positive 
increase in references to Indigenous Peoples 
and Indigenous Knowledge.
A key outcome of this work can be found 
in the Local Communities and Indigenous 
Peoples Platform, which, after several years of 
negotiation, created the Facilitative Working 
Group (FWG)—the first constituted body 
under the UNFCCC with equal representation 
between Indigenous Peoples and States. 
The term “local communities” has raised 
serious concern among Indigenous Peoples, 
leading to a slow erosion of rights afforded to 
Indigenous Peoples in international documents, 
such as the United Nations Declaration on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Inuit 
Circumpolar Council Canada has released a 
position paper in this regard, arguing that “...the 
practice of lumping Inuit and other Indigenous 
peoples together with ‘local communities’ 
is part of an alarming trend in the behavior 
of States to diminish the standards in the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights 
of Indigenous Peoples, including actions to 
devalue Indigenous peoples’ status, rights, 
and role” (ICC, 2020). Similar positions have 
been taken by the Assembly of First Nations 
and the United Nations Permanent Forum on 
Indigenous Issues.
In the context of the IPCC, a 2023 article 
(Carmona et al., 2023) assesses how its 
Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) recognizes 
and promotes Indigenous Peoples’ role and 
knowledge systems in climate governance. 
The article used a content analysis of the 
Working Groups I, II, and III reports, as well 
as the Synthesis Report, to show a growing 
number of references to Indigenous Peoples 
and their knowledge systems compared 
to previous assessment reports. Despite 
this growth, they also found that the IPCC 
continues to reproduce a reductionist approach 
to Indigenous Peoples’ knowledge and rights, 
which risks promoting harmful stereotypes 
that increase inequity. As the IPCC prepares 
for the Seventh Assessment Report (AR7), 
Indigenous Peoples are preparing to increase 
their involvement to ensure further progress.
Progress was also made with the Kunming-
Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, 
adopted in December 2022, where Indigenous 
Peoples’ rights were explicitly recognized, 
including in relation to the new 30 by 30 Target 
(which calls for at least 30% of terrestrial, 
inland water, and coastal and marine areas 
to be effectively conserved and managed by 
2023).
76 For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report
10.0	Moving forward
This report is the first of its kind, written from 
the perspective of First Nations, Inuit and 
Métis scholars and practitioners. The report’s 
key messages offer an important starting point 
for more dialogue and action. However, they 
do not do full justice to the incredible amount 
of work being led by First Nations, Inuit and 
Métis. As we developed the report, the author 
team repeatedly identified the importance 
of making space for future work on key 
areas of research, exploration and discussion 
led by rights- and title-holders from within 
Indigenous communities. Future Indigenous-
led climate-related work will require support 
and investment in our research, development, 
new technologies, novel approaches and 
entrepreneurship. This could include the 
following:	
■Stronger consideration of gender,
especially the knowledge, perspectives 
and experiences of Indigenous women, 
non-binary and 2SLGBTQQIA+ in climate 
research, assessments and actions, including 
projects led by Indigenous governments.	
■Support for First Nations, Inuit and Métis
governments and organizations to lead
their own climate change assessments
and strategies in order to develop their
own evidence-base for making climate-
informed decisions. This includes respect for
Indigenous data sovereignty in line with their
respective policies and protocols.	
■A commitment to uplift Indigenous
worldviews that respect all our relations in
all aspects of climate-related research. This
includes additional work on collaborative
relationships that embrace multiple
worldviews and prioritize “All My Relations.”	
■Indigenous-led analysis on emerging
concepts and discussions within climate
discourse, such as net-zero, nature-based
approaches and carbon offsets, in order
to position First Nations, Inuit and Métis
governments and organizations as leaders,
as well as to avoid the misinterpretation of
Indigenous Knowledge Systems.	
■Indigenous-led research on the development
and exploration of new funding models that
are available directly to First Nations, Inuit
and Métis at all levels to develop and lead
Indigenous-led research.	
■First Nations, Inuit and Métis developed
theories around the necessity of access to
healthy Land, Waters and Ice, especially for
youth. We must articulate the ways that
this is essential for fundamental health and
wellness.	
■Exploration of the required steps to
decolonize climate research, assessments
and actions to open space for First Nations,
Inuit and Métis to advance our own climate
governance and policy.	
■Additional research on the intersections
between Indigenous law, governance and
climate change.
For Our Future: Indigenous Resilience Report 77	
■Research on links between Indigenous
languages and climate change, with the
intention to strengthen connections
between Indigenous stewardship and
caretaking, biodiversity and Indigenous
Knowledge and language retention.	
■Support ongoing, sustainable and equitable
funding for land-based training programs
at local and regional scales, recognizing
hunters and harvesters (and training those
for the future) as key to increasing food
security, transmitting traditional knowledge,
monitoring and assessing the environment,
and increasing community health and well-
being.	
■Indigenous-led research on the connections
between climate change, health and wellness
at local, regional, national and international
levels, including critical review of concepts
such as planetary health and One-Health
(recognizing the connection between
the health of people, animals and the
environment).	
■Case stories on effective partnerships
between First Nations, Inuit and Métis
governments and organizations with allied
organizations (e.g., academics, environmental
non-governmental organizations, governance
and other stakeholders) to advance
Indigenous-led climate actions.
