Abstract
Climate change is causing increases in temperature, changes in precipitation and extreme weather 
events, sea-level rise, and other environmental impacts. It is also causing or contributing to heat-
related disorders, respiratory and allergic disorders, infectious diseases, malnutrition due to food 
insecurity, and mental health disorders. In addition, increasing evidence indicates that climate 
change is causally associated with collective violence, generally in combination with other causal 
factors. Increased temperatures and extremes of precipitation with their associated consequences, 
including resultant scarcity of cropland and other key environmental resources, are major 
pathways by which climate change leads to collective violence. Public health professionals can 
help prevent collective violence due to climate change (a) by supporting mitigation measures to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, (b) by promoting adaptation measures to address the 
consequences of climate change and to improve community resilience, and (c) by addressing 
underlying risk factors for collective violence, such as poverty and socioeconomic disparities.

INTRODUCTION
Climate change—or, perhaps more accurately, global climate disruption—is profoundly 
affecting life on earth in many interrelated ways. The health and environmental risks posed 
by climate change are interlinked with conditions of poverty and socioeconomic inequalities, 
with population growth and migration, with emerging diseases and hazardous chemicals, 
and with ecosystem damage and biodiversity loss. This article focuses on the increasing

body of evidence concerning the relationships between aspects of climate change and 
collective violence. It also explores what public health professionals can do to expand the 
knowledge base concerning these relationships and what can be done to prevent collective 
violence caused, or contributed to, by climate change.
CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE
Global climate change results in major environmental and health consequences.
Environmental Consequences
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has assessed the likelihood that 
various environmental phenomena have occurred as a result of climate change and the 
likelihood that humans have contributed to these observed changes (Table 1). The IPCC has 
projected that warmer and/or more frequent hot days and nights over most land areas are 
likely in the early part of this century and will be virtually certain in the late part of this 
century (Table 2) (29). Using computer models based on varying climate scenarios, the 
IPCC has projected ranges of likely global mean temperature increase by 2081–2100 (as 
compared with 1986–2005) that vary from 0.3–1.7°C to 2.6–4.8°C (30).
The IPCC has projected that heavy precipitation events (a) will likely increase in frequency, 
intensity, and/or amount of heavy precipitation over many land areas in the early part of this 
century and (b) will likely increase over most of the midlatitude land masses and wet 
tropical regions in the late part of this century (Table 2) (29). Heavy precipitation events are 
often accompanied by coastal storm surges and flooding. The IPCC has stated that it is 
“virtually certain” that increases in intense tropical cyclone activity have occurred in the 
North Atlantic since 1970 and “more likely than not” will also occur in the western North 
Pacific in the late part of this century (29) (Table 2). (Hurricanes, cyclones, and typhoons are 
different names for the same weather phenomenon occurring in different places.)
The magnitude and severity of the environmental consequences of climate change need to be 
considered in the context of human activity, such as poor land-use policies that can 
exacerbate the environmental consequences of both natural and human-made disasters. For 
example, human destruction of the natural wetlands buffer zone contributed to the 
consequences of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005, and large-scale deforestation 
contributed to major mudslides during Hurricane Mitch in Honduras in 1998.
Health Consequences
Adverse health consequences associated with climate change can be categorized as (a) direct 
health effects, including heat-related disorders, respiratory and allergic disorders, infectious 
diseases, and injuries from extreme weather events; (b) indirect health effects from food 
insecurity, forced migration, and collective violence; and (c) mental health disorders 
affecting individuals, communities, and entire nations (34).
Direct health effects.—Heat-related consequences include heat-related disorders, such as 
heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and dehydration, as well as complications of chronic diseases, 
such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, and diabetes

mellitus. Each year in the United States there are, on average, more than 600 deaths that are 
clinically reported as associated with excessive exposure to natural heat, although the actual 
number may be much greater because deaths from heat-related disorders are often not 
reported unless a heat wave is occurring (10). Groups that are at high risk for morbidity or 
mortality during heat waves include older people who live alone, people who reside in 
public housing and/or without air conditioning, and outdoor workers.
As a result of climate change, respiratory and allergic disorders will increase, owing 
primarily to higher concentrations of ozone (largely due to vehicular exhaust and warm 
ambient temperatures), smoke from wildfires, increased production of pollen and longer 
pollen seasons, and increased exposure to mold (as a result of residential water damage from 
flooding). In addition, infectious diseases resulting from climate change include vector-
borne disease (as a result of wider distribution of disease-carrying vectors and longer 
transmission seasons), waterborne disease (largely due to sewage contamination of water 
supplies as a result of floods and to scarcity of water during severe droughts, leading to the 
use of unsafe water sources), and foodborne disease (because higher temperatures increase 
growth and persistence of pathogens and because of food contamination from contaminated 
water).
Indirect health effects.—Indirect health consequences resulting from climate change will 
affect primarily people in middle-income and low-income countries. Impacts include (a) 
malnutrition due to food shortages and resultant higher food prices, which will likely occur 
as a result of increasing temperatures and precipitation extremes, leading to droughts and 
floods; (b) health consequences due to forced migration because individuals and entire 
communities will likely be displaced, within their own countries or to other countries, owing 
to cropland damage, sea-level rise, and food and water shortages; and (c) collective violence, 
as described below, partially due to political, economic, and social instability arising from 
food insecurity, forced displacement, and other crises (37).
The global consequences of climate change, as described above, are generally consistent 
with the scientific assessment by the US Global Change Research Program concerning the 
impacts of climate change on human health in the United States (13). The executive 
summary of its 2016 report states,
Climate change is a significant threat to the health of the American people. The 
impacts of human-induced climate change are increasing nationwide. Rising 
greenhouse gas concentrations result in increases in temperature, changes in 
precipitation, increases in the frequency and intensity of some extreme weather 
events, and rising sea levels. These climate change impacts endanger our health by 
affecting our food and water sources, the air we breathe, the weather we 
experience, and our interactions with the built and natural environments. As the 
climate continues to change, the risks to human health continue to grow. (13, p. 2)
Impact of Climate Change on Human Rights and Social Justice
Climate change has profound consequences for human rights and social justice (35). Large 
inequalities exist among countries in regard to their levels of greenhouse gas (GHG)

emissions as well as the magnitude and severity of adverse consequences due to climate 
change. Countries that contribute the least to GHG emissions will likely continue to 
experience the greatest consequences due to climate change (21, 54, 71). The greatest impact 
of climate change will occur in poor countries.
If carbon dioxide concentrations and rapid climate change continue on a business-as-usual 
path, the economies of poor countries will likely be seriously impaired; the mean annual 
growth rate of these countries will likely decrease from 3.2% to 2.6% by 2100 (44). Poor 
countries will probably suffer economically from climate change much more than rich 
countries for the following reasons: (a) They are more often exposed to very high 
temperatures; (b) they heavily rely on agriculture, extraction of natural resources, and other 
industrial sectors that are vulnerable to extreme weather variability; and (c) various 
approaches to risk management, ranging from air conditioning to insurance, are less 
available in poor countries than in rich countries (44).
A variety of socioeconomic, demographic, health-related, geographic, and other risk factors 
make populations and subgroups within populations more vulnerable to the health 
consequences of climate change. These risk factors include poverty, female gender, minority 
status, young or old age, and various diseases and disabilities. In addition, health 
consequences resulting from climate change will likely continue to be concentrated in low-
income populations residing at low latitudes, where major climate-sensitive disorders, such 
as malaria, diarrheal disease, and malnutrition, are highly prevalent and where vulnerability 
to these disorders is the greatest (41).
Measures designed to mitigate climate change and its adverse effects can have unintended 
consequences that adversely affect social justice and environmental justice. For example, US 
agricultural policy that has supported biofuel production to promote sustainable energy and 
energy independence has contributed to the volatility of grain-crop prices, has impacted 
commodity prices of food grains (such as by linking corn to ethanol prices), and has been 
linked to food price shocks, which have aggravated food insecurity, especially for poor 
people (63).
In addition, workers in many occupations are at an increased risk for the health 
consequences of climate change. Those at risk include (a) outdoor workers who perform 
tasks in extreme heat; (b) other workers who are exposed to extremes of temperature or 
precipitation; (c) workers exposed to air pollutants, infectious agents, wildfires, and/or 
extreme weather events; and (d) workers in specific industries, such as utilities, 
transportation, health care, emergency response, environmental remediation, construction 
and demolition, landscaping, agriculture, forestry, and wildlife management (56).
OVERVIEW OF COLLECTIVE VIOLENCE GLOBALLY
Violence has been defined as “the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or 
actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community that either results in 
or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment or 
deprivation” (70). Violence includes self-inflicted violence, interpersonal violence, and

collective violence. Collective violence, which includes armed conflict, state-sponsored 
violence (such as torture and genocide), and organized violent crime (such as gang warfare), 
has been defined as “the instrumental use of violence by people who identify themselves as 
members of a group…against another group or set of individuals, in order to achieve 
political, economic or social objectives” (32, p. 215). Collective violence causes much 
morbidity and mortality directly (such as by gunfire and explosive devices) and indirectly by 
(a) damage to the health-supporting infrastructure of society (supplies of safe food and 
water, medical care and public health services, transportation, communication, and power 
generation and supply); (b) forced displacement of individuals and communities (creating 
both refugees and internally displaced persons); (c) damage to the physical environment; (d) 
diversion of human and financial resources; and (e) additional violence (36, 61). Although 
the definition of collective violence applies globally, collective violence and its 
consequences are manifested differently in different regions and different countries. For 
example, from 2004 to 2013, state-based conflict occurred mainly in Africa and “Asia and 
Oceania,” and nonstate conflict occurred mainly in Africa (62). As another example, of the 
21.3 million refugees worldwide, 41% have come from just 3 war-torn countries: Syria (4.9 
million), Afghanistan (2.7 million), and Somalia (1.1 million); and just 6 countries host 7.6 
million refugees: Turkey (2.5 million), Pakistan (1.6 million), Lebanon (1.1 million), Iran 
(979,400), Ethiopia (736,100), and Jordan (664,100) (68).
REVIEW OF RESEARCH ON THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN CLIMATE 
CHANGE AND COLLECTIVE VIOLENCE
Historical Studies
In three studies based on data stretching back 1,000 years, Zhang and colleagues 
demonstrated the following concerning the relationship between climate change and 
violence. First, in the preindustrial era in the northern hemisphere, climate change was the 
major underlying cause of armed conflict and other major humanitarian crises. The authors 
demonstrated that decreasing temperatures led sequentially to lower agricultural production, 
price inflation, war, famine, and population decline. They also demonstrated that 
contemporaneous social mechanisms failed to prevent these crises (73). Second, in Europe 
between 1560 and 1660, lower temperatures were the underlying cause of agroecological, 
socioeconomic, and demographic catastrophes (74). Finally, the frequency of warfare over 
the past 1,000 years in Eastern China was significantly associated with temperature 
oscillations, especially in periods of lower temperatures, when there was lower agricultural 
production (75).
In a study in Europe on the association of both temperature and precipitation with violent 
conflict during the past 1,000 years, Tol & Wagner (66) concluded that when temperatures 
were lower, conflict was more intense. [Notably, they demonstrated that this association was 
weaker during the industrial era (since 1750).] They concluded that their results do not 
provide “a clear-cut picture” (p. 77). They predicted that global warming would not likely 
lead to increased violent conflict in temperate climates (66).

Studies in the Modern Era
Influence of temperature on violence.—Studying conflict in the tropics from 1950 to 
2004, Hsiang and colleagues demonstrated that the likelihood of new civil conflicts 
increased from 3% to 6% during years of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), when 
much of the land area in the continental tropics becomes considerably warmer and drier, as 
compared with La Niña years. They also found that, in more temperate latitudes, the impact 
of ENSO was usually less extreme. They concluded that, since 1950, ENSO may “have had 
a role” in the development of 21% of civil conflicts (28, p. 438).
Studying conflict in sub-Saharan Africa between 1981 and 2002, Burke and colleagues 
found a significant association between warmer temperature and civil war. On the basis of 
their findings, they projected an approximately 54% increase in armed conflict in Africa by 
2030, with an additional 393,000 battle-related deaths, assuming wars in the future are as 
deadly as recent wars (8). In critiquing this study, Buhaug (7) asserted that, during the 
previous 30 years, while temperature increased in most of Africa, the incidence of civil war 
decreased and the estimated annual number of conflict fatalities for the average civil war in 
sub-Saharan Africa decreased, from approximately 6,100 to 1,600. He also argued that the 
association claimed by Burke and colleagues disappeared completely when their initial 
analysis was broadened to include a more recent time period (7). In response to criticisms by 
Buhaug and others, Burke and colleagues (9) revised the model they used for their study and 
developed further results, which confirmed that variations in the occurrence of large wars in 
the 1980s and 1990s in sub-Saharan Africa could be explained, in part, by temperature 
change. Burke and colleagues acknowledged that their results do not hold for the 2003–2008 
period; they believe that international peacekeeping, economic development, and better 
domestic governance may have mitigated these effects (9).
Studying violence in East Africa between 1990 and 2009, O’Loughlin and colleagues (51) 
found that substantially warmer than normal temperatures significantly increased the risk of 
violence. However, when they compared these data with political, economic, and physical 
geographic predictors, they concluded that warmer temperatures were a relatively modest 
predictor of violence. They also found major variations in the association between climate 
and conflict among the countries studied and across time periods (51).
Studying conflict in Somalia between 1997 and 2009, Maystadt and colleagues (40) 
demonstrated that drought led to decreases in the price of livestock, which fueled conflict. 
On the basis of their findings, they projected that if by 2100 the average temperature in 
eastern Africa increased by ~3.2°C (5.8°F) (the median IPCC scenario for this region by 
2100), then cattle prices would decrease about 4% and violent conflict would increase by 
~58%. They concluded that climate change will worsen security challenges in Somalia and 
require effective measures to strengthen resilience to drought and conflict, especially in 
pastoralist communities (40).
O’Loughlin and colleagues (50) performed research on temperature and precipitation 
variability and the impact of these variables on the probability of violence from 1980 to 
2012 in sub-Saharan Africa. They found that temperature was significantly associated with 
violence, but there were inconsistencies in the association between temperature extremes

and occurrence of conflict. In addition, they found that location and time of violence were 
less influenced by temperature and precipitation variability than they were by economic, 
political, and geographic factors (50).
Bollfrass & Shaver (5), conducting an analysis based on a subnational-level data set, 
demonstrated that temperature is significantly associated with the occurrence of conflict in 
both agricultural and nonagricultural sample provinces throughout the world. They 
determined that a rise in mean annual temperature of 11.1°C (20°F) is associated with an 
approximately 2% rise in the probability of deadly conflict. They also found that decreased 
farm output due to increased temperature is not likely to explain the entire rise in substate 
violence (5).
Hot temperatures have been associated with forms of violence other than collective violence. 
For example, Nitschke and colleagues (49) found that, during heat waves, there was a 13% 
significant increase in assault-related injuries among people 15–64 years of age. Li and 
colleagues (39) found an association of borderline significance with intentional self-harm 
(suicide and attempted suicide), with a threshold at 27.2°C (81°F). Page and colleagues (53) 
found that, for each 1°C increase in mean temperature above a threshold of 18°C (64.4°F), 
there was a 3.8% significant increase in suicide.
Despite evidence of a temperature threshold for suicide or attempted suicide specific to these 
two studies, we believe that it is unlikely that a universal temperature threshold will be found 
for collective violence, given that collective violence is generally caused by multiple factors 
that vary among episodes of collective violence.
Influence of rainfall on violence.—Some research has demonstrated that a significant 
decrease in rainfall, associated with drought, leads to increased conflict. Levy and others 
(38) discovered that, when there was a significant decrease in rainfall, the probability of 
high-intensity internal war beginning in the next year was significantly increased. However, 
they did not find a significant association between deviations in rainfall and low-intensity 
internal war. In sub-Saharan Africa between 1990 and 2008, Fjelde & von Uexkull (16) 
found that major deviations in rainfall as compared with historic norms were associated with 
an increased probability of communal conflict. They also found that the impact of decreased 
rainfall on the probability of communal conflict is increased in areas where members of 
ethnic and political groups who have been politically excluded reside. In Africa between 
1997 and 2011, Harari & La Ferrara (22) found that, during the growing seasons of main 
crops, adverse climate shocks were associated with a substantial and persistent impact on the 
incidence of conflict at the subnational level, especially violence against civilians. They 
projected that, under “a midrange emissions scenario,” severe climate shocks in growing 
seasons would more than double during the next two decades, resulting in a 7% increase in 
the incidence of conflict (p. 34). Finally, Opiyo and colleagues (52), who studied violent 
conflicts in drought-prone pastoral areas in Kenya, found that while violent conflicts are 
caused by a complex interaction of political, economic, and sociocultural factors, frequent 
droughts aggravated competition for scarce natural resources and led to the development of 
violent conflicts in the study areas.

Drought due, in part, to climate change has been associated with sudden increases in food 
prices (food price shocks), which have resulted in violence in the form of food riots (see 
sidebar, Climate Change Contributes to Food Price Shocks and Their Violent 
Consequences). Drought resulting, in part, from climate change also contributed to causing 
the civil war in Syria (see sidebar, Climate Change Contributed to the Civil War in Syria).
Climate change is widely accepted as being a risk multiplier. In this context, decreases in 
rainfall due to climate change will worsen existing shortages of freshwater, most particularly 
in countries in the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia, where in many locations 
severe water shortages and droughts already exist. In general, water shortages have been 
shown to increase conflict. For example, Gleick (20), who has accumulated data on 
interstate and intrastate conflicts over water for several decades, found that these conflicts 
have been increasing substantially; there were 38 water-related conflicts throughout the 
world between 1960 and 1989 (on average, 1.3 per year) and 83 such conflicts between 1990 
and 2007 (on average, 4.6 per year).
However, some research has failed to find an association between decreased rainfall (and/or 
drought) and the development of conflict. In Afghanistan between 1960 and 2004, Theisen 
and colleagues (65) failed to find any association between drought and civil war; they 
concluded that the primary causes of intrastate conflict were political in nature. Adano and 
colleagues (1), after studying violent conflicts in pastoral areas in Kenya, concluded that 
climate change is not a primary causative factor of conflict there. In the Sahel in West 
Africa, Benjaminsen and colleagues (3) found that factors that were not directly related to 
resource scarcity and the environment, such as corruption within government, were the most 
likely explanations for violent conflict there. Lastly, after reviewing data concerning climate 
and civil war in Africa, Buhaug (6) concluded that variability of climate poorly predicts 
armed conflict and that, in Africa, civil war is attributable mainly to poor national economies 
and the exclusion of ethnic and political groups. He acknowledged, however, that much 
research is based on national data that may mask subnational data on rainfall and conflict.
Although many studies have found that decreased rainfall, with associated drought, is 
associated with violence, some studies have demonstrated that increased rainfall can also be 
associated with violence. Globally between 1979 and 2006, Salehyan & Hendrix (57) found 
that an abundance of water was associated with political violence. They asserted that 
political violence occurs more often when basic needs of populations are met and when “the 
tactical environment is more conducive to attacks—conditions that hold when water is more 
abundant.” In 47 countries in sub-Saharan Africa between 1991 and 2007, these same 
authors demonstrated that rainfall was associated with insurgency and civil war. They also 
found that extreme deviations in rainfall (especially abundant rainfall) were strongly 
associated with violence. More broadly, they found a strong association between 
environmental shocks and unrest (23). Finally, in Kenya between 1989 and 2004, Theisen 
(64) found that wetter years were associated with large-scale violence. He stated that this 
finding was most likely due to large-scale violence not being feasible in periods when there 
is extreme scarcity, reasoning that reconciliation, cooperation, and peace are goals in 
pastoralist communities in the presence of drought. In addition, he also found that election 
years were associated with violence and that major intergroup violence between groups is

influenced primarily by “calculation and political gain” as opposed to competition over 
scarce land and water resources (64, p. 81).
Meta-Analyses
Two meta-analyses, each based on numerous studies, provide robust evidence of a causal 
association between climate change and collective violence.
Hsiang and colleagues (27) performed a meta-analysis based on 60 longitudinal studies, 30 
of which focused on intergroup conflict, 15 of which focused on interpersonal conflict, and 
15 of which focused on institutional breakdown and population collapse. Of the 30 studies 
on intergroup conflict, 7 were global, 11 focused on part or all of sub-Saharan Africa, 3 on 
Europe, 3 on China, and 6 on other geographic locations. Of these 30 studies, 23 used years 
as time units, 4 used decades, 2 used months, and 1 used centuries. The authors concluded 
that deviations from mild temperatures and normal precipitation significantly increased 
conflict risk, most notably in poorer populations. On the basis of their findings, they 
estimated that each standard deviation of greater rainfall or warmer temperatures increased 
intergroup conflict by 14% and, in some geographic locations, by more than 50%. They 
projected that, with increasing temperatures, there would likely be substantial increases in 
conflict (27). Some observers criticized this meta-analysis, stating that it suffers from 
selection bias and conflates weather with climate (4). (Weather is defined1 as “the state of 
the air and atmosphere at a particular time and place…with respect to heat or cold, wetness 
or dryness, calm or storm, clearness or cloudiness.” In contrast, climate is defined2 as “the 
weather conditions prevailing in an area in general over a long period.” Climate scientists 
frequently use a period of 30 years to distinguish between climate and weather.)
In another meta-analysis, Hsiang & Burke (26) examined 50 quantitative research studies 
regarding the association between climate variables and both violent conflict and 
sociopolitical instability. They included quantitative research studies that employed the most 
robust experimental or quasi-experimental designs, limiting their focus to investigations that 
met “modern standards for measuring causal effects” (p. 43). On the basis of their criteria 
for including studies in this meta-analysis, they believed that independent climate variables 
were not likely correlated with other variables that were not observed that might have 
influenced the conflict variable. They found “strong linkages between climate anomalies and 
conflict and social instability” (p. 52). Specifically, they demonstrated that in most studies, 
when temperature is high and precipitation is extremely high or extremely low, both conflict 
and sociopolitical instability increase. However, they also found that, when average 
temperature is temperate, anomalously low temperature may decrease social stability. They 
concluded that “climate’s influence on security persists in both historical and modern 
periods, is generalizable to populations around the globe, arises from climatic events that are 
both rapid and gradual, and influences numerous types of conflict that range across all 
spatial scales” (26, p. 52).

Influence of Sea-Level Rise on Violence
By 2100, sea level is likely to rise 0.5 to 1.4 m (~20–55 inches) above the 1990 level (55). A 
recent study suggests that sea-level rise by 2100 could be as much as 1.83 m (6 feet), given 
that Antarctica could contribute more than 1 m (3.3 feet) of sea-level rise by then (14). 
People living in coastal areas, where ~20% of people worldwide live, and those residing in 
small-island nations will suffer the greatest impact of sea-level rise. Some island nations 
may totally disappear and some coastal areas may become uninhabitable, which may force 
many people to become internally displaced within their own countries or refugees in 
neighboring countries or elsewhere. In addition to displacing people from their homes and 
communities, sea-level rise will damage cropland, create saltwater incursion into river deltas 
and groundwater aquifers, and cause shortages of food and freshwater. As a result, there will 
likely be major political, economic, and social disruptions, sometimes associated with 
violence, as people compete for control of land and other resources.
Millions of climate refugees will be forced to flee their homes and communities because of 
the consequences of climate change. In 2009, the head of UNHCR: The UN Refugee 
Agency stated that in 2008 more than 20 million people had been forcibly displaced—in 
most cases, temporarily—due to factors related to climate change, mostly due to storms and 
floods (17). An estimated 50–250 million people may be forced to leave their homes and 
communities by 2050. An estimated 162 million people are now at risk of being forcibly 
displaced because of sea-level rise: in China, 73 million; in Bangladesh, 26 million; in India, 
20 million; in Egypt, 12 million; and in low-lying small-island nations, 31 million. In 
addition, at least 50 million people could be at high risk of displacement because of drought 
and other consequences of climate change (46, 47, 69). Whereas migration due to short-term 
severe climate events is generally temporary and usually occurs over short distances within 
countries, migration due to drought, sea-level rise, and other long-term impacts of climate 
change is very likely to be permanent; these migrants are not likely to return to their homes 
and communities (2, 42).
Summary and Implications of Research Findings
The weight of research evidence demonstrates that climate change, especially as manifest by 
increases in temperature and extremes of precipitation, is often causally associated with 
collective violence. This research has been performed by many different investigators in 
many geographic locations over varying periods of time.
Although climate change is often found to be causally associated with collective violence, it 
is only one of several major causative factors. Other major causes of collective violence 
include socioeconomic and political instability, disputes over political power and land 
ownership, poverty and socioeconomic disparities, high unemployment, authoritarian 
governments, violation of human rights and other manifestations of social injustice, and 
ethnic hatred (36).
Community resilience can serve to buffer the consequences of climate change by enabling a 
community to accommodate or adjust to these consequences or recover from them. 
Community resilience includes (a) the functionality of the built environment after an event

(physical resilience); (b) the physical and psychological health of people (individual 
resilience); and (c) the governance structure, networks of trust and communication, 
flexibility, and redundancy of the community (organizational resilience) (18, 45). Evidence 
from the aftermath of natural disasters suggests that social cohesion in a community before a 
disaster (a component of community resilience) may help to prevent or minimize some 
postdisaster consequences, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (24).
Owing to multiple interconnected and cross-sectoral pathways, the cumulative impact of 
climate change is much greater than the sum of its impacts on health, agriculture, air quality, 
water supply, housing, and other societal sectors. In addition, because climate change is a 
risk multiplier, it increases the risk of collective violence due to already-existing causative 
factors. Therefore, the role of climate change in causing or contributing to collective 
violence is greatest in places that are already at high risk of collective violence. For example, 
within low-income countries, climate change often exacerbates socioeconomic disparities, 
making the poor poorer and those who are vulnerable more vulnerable. This effect is best 
illustrated in low-income countries where many people support themselves and their families 
with subsistence agriculture. As climate change damages cropland and adversely affects 
livestock production (owing to increased temperatures, droughts, floods, and sea-level rise), 
farmers suffer from reduced access to food, lost income, and food-price shocks, and they 
often migrate to urban areas, thereby creating social and political instability and increasing 
the risk of violence (see sidebar, Climate Change Contributed to the Civil War in Syria).
Although the consequences of climate change and the onset of collective violence cannot be 
predicted with precision, we believe that in many instances the probability of collective 
violence induced by climate change can be determined. We believe that a probability index 
could be developed and used to predict collective violence induced by climate change and 
thereby to implement interventions to minimize the impact of climate change and prevent 
the onset of collective violence.
Because climate change contributes to the development of collective violence, it represents a 
security threat to the United States and other nations—a threat that has long been recognized 
by the US military. For example, in 2007, several former leading American military officers 
termed climate change a “threat multiplier for instability” (11, 12). The severity and 
widespread nature of this threat heighten the urgency of mitigating climate change and 
implementing effective adaptation measures to address climate change. In addition, the 
causative association between climate change and collective violence focuses additional 
attention on the critically important need to understand and reduce the underlying causes of 
collective violence.
Future Research Needs and Challenges
Much further research needs to be done (a) to clarify and understand the causative 
association between climate change and collective violence, including the pathways or 
mechanisms by which various components of climate change cause violence to occur (26), 
and (b) to assess the effectiveness of various approaches to prevent climate change from 
causing violence. Research needs to be done to better understand the complex interaction of 
factors that turn disputes into violent conflicts and to better identify opportunities and create

more effective mechanisms to settle conflicts by nonviolent means. Research challenges 
include gathering data on local climate conditions on sufficiently large populations so that 
valid conclusions can be drawn and performing studies with sufficiently long timeframes.
Analytical frameworks can help us to understand various interactive environmental factors 
associated with climate change that can contribute to collective violence. Scheffran and 
colleagues have developed such a framework (Figure 1) (58, 59).
More research needs to be done on the role of scarcity of key environmental resources in 
causing violence. Homer-Dixon (25) has demonstrated that the scarcity of these 
environmental resources, primarily cropland but also forests, river water, and fish, can lead 
to severe social stresses that create urban unrest, clashes among cultural and ethnic groups, 
and insurgency campaigns.
For example, using biomass fuel for household cooking contributes to scarcity of key 
environmental resources—a major issue in Ethiopia, where biomass fuels account for 92% 
of the national energy supply (60). Use of wood for fuel results in substantial deforestation 
and higher prices for wood, which leads farmers to use animal dung as a biomass fuel for 
household cooking. This practice reduces the availability of dung for use as a fertilizer, 
which exacerbates deficiencies in soil nutrients (43). Improving access to renewable energy 
from microgrids (small off-grid electricity sources for cooking, illumination, and powering 
of water pumps, flour grinders, and other devices that are operated by electric motors 
powered by renewable energy) can reduce reliance on biomass fuels, retard deforestation, 
improve soil conditions, and increase family incomes.
More research can help determine and demonstrate the cobenefits of using renewable energy 
in rural areas of low-income countries. These cobenefits could include enhanced lighting for 
childhood education, more time for women who are otherwise tasked with collecting 
firewood, improved cold storage for food and medicine, increased electric power for 
irrigation, decreased indoor air pollution from cooking, and reduced risk of collective 
violence.
HOW PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS CAN HELP PREVENT 
COLLECTIVE VIOLENCE DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE
Public health professionals and their organizations have important roles to play in preventing 
health consequences due to collective violence. These actions include (a) documenting the 
health consequences of armed conflict and other forms of collective violence; (b) raising 
awareness about, and communicating the details and implications of, these health 
consequences to professional and nongovernmental organizations, government policy 
makers, and the general public; (c) developing and advocating for prevention and 
intervention measures, public policies, and other approaches to reduce collective violence 
and related health consequences; (d) working to reduce poverty, income inequality, ethnic 
hatred, and other underlying causes of collective violence; and (e) helping to resolve 
conflicts and disputes by nonviolent means (36). These are all important activities in which 
public health workers need to play active roles. However, because the focus of this article is

on collective violence caused by climate change, the remainder of this section focuses on the 
important roles that public health professionals and their organizations can play in (a) 
mitigating and adapting to climate change and (b) assessing and reducing the risk of 
collective violence.
Roles of public health professionals and their organizations include
1.
Primary prevention (mitigation). This form of prevention supports the reduction 
of emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other GHGs and other activities to 
reduce climate change, such as preventing deforestation and promoting the 
growth of new forests;
2.
Secondary prevention (adaptation). This form of prevention supports measures to 
prevent or reduce the health consequences of climate change, such as (a) 
designing and implementing surveillance systems to detect infectious diseases, 
(b) promoting plans for preparedness and emergency response to reduce the 
impact of a heat wave or an extreme weather event, and (c) promoting 
collaboration among community groups, organizations, and others to plan and 
implement these measures and to improve social cohesion and enhance other 
aspects of community resilience; and
3.
Tertiary prevention. This form of prevention helps people recover after disasters 
related to climate change, such as droughts and floods (18, 19).
Additional important public health activities to address climate change include (a) raising 
awareness, educating, and encouraging ongoing communication for other health 
professionals, policy makers, and the general public; (b) performing and supporting research 
on the health impacts of climate change and on approaches to protecting public health; (c) 
investigating disease outbreaks that may be related to climate change, such as outbreaks of 
vector-borne disease; (d) assessing the vulnerability and the resilience of communities in the 
face of climate change; (e) evaluating mitigation, adaptation, and other measures; and (f) 
promoting increases in the resources and capacities of state and local health departments to 
address climate change.
We agree with Frumkin and others (18, 19) who have recommended that the public health 
response to climate change should be (a) grounded in a generally strong public health 
system; (b) based on risk characterization and assessment; (c) emphasizing all-hazards 
preparedness; (d) emphasizing resilience of the built environment, individual people 
(physically and psychologically), and organizations; (e) built on the potential of cobenefits, 
such as active transport and shifting away from meat-intensive diets to diets higher in grains, 
fruits, and vegetables; (f) based on strong, cross-sectoral partnerships; and (g) focused on 
institutional learning.
In addition, as Frumkin and others (18) have noted, it is essential in addressing climate 
change that mitigation, adaptation, and other measures advance equity and fairness (climate 
justice), strive to reduce socioeconomic disparities within countries, and protect human 
rights.

Finally, it is critically important that public health professionals and their organizations hold 
their governments accountable for the commitments that they made at the Conference of 
Parties (COP21) in Paris in December 2015 to reduce GHG emissions and that high-income 
countries provide low-income countries with the necessary resources to effectively address 
climate change.

CLIMATE CHANGE CONTRIBUTES TO FOOD PRICE SHOCKS AND THEIR 
VIOLENT CONSEQUENCES
Volatility in commodity prices and sudden unpredictable price spikes (sharp increases) 
seriously threaten food security. Poor people living in urban areas are especially 
vulnerable to food price shocks because they purchase most of their food (as opposed to 
growing it). While poor farmers in rural areas may ultimately benefit financially from 
incremental increases in crop prices, they often do not benefit initially from unexpected 
dramatic price changes (15). In low-income countries, the poorest households may spend 
as much as 80% of their income on food, in contrast to 6% in the average U.S. household 
(72); therefore, price shocks have a considerable impact on households in low-income 
countries.
Spikes in commodity prices, together with political instability as well as desperation and 
distrust among the population, result in deaths and nonfatal injuries. Food riots also 
adversely impact social and political stability, further exacerbating food insecurity. The 
events of the Arab Spring, starting in late 2010, were consistent with this scenario (33).

CLIMATE CHANGE CONTRIBUTED TO THE CIVIL WAR IN SYRIA
Climate change is likely to have contributed to the development of the civil war in Syria, 
which began in 2011 and has since caused an estimated 400,000 deaths, forced more than 
9 million Syrians to flee their homes, and created a major humanitarian crisis. From 2006 
through 2009, a severe drought transformed approximately 60% of the land area into 
desert. Studies estimate that approximately 80% of cattle died. Hundreds of thousands of 
farmers and their family members—perhaps as many as 1.5 million people—abandoned 
their farms and moved to cities, which were already burdened with more than 1 million 
Iraqi refugees. By the end of 2010, Syria’s urban population was 13.8 million, 50% more 
than it had been in 2002. Most of the farmers were unable to find employment and felt 
that they were being mistreated by the government of Bashar al-Assad (48, 67).
Kelley and colleagues (31) demonstrated that the extreme severity of the drought in Syria 
was part of a long-term drying trend, which was consistent with models of increases in 
GHGs (human-induced climate change). They concluded that the drought contributed to 
political unrest in this country, which has had poor governance and unsustainable 
agricultural and environmental policies. They projected continued intensification of heat 
and drought for the Eastern Mediterranean region (31).

increases over most land areas
Medium confidence on a global scale. Likely in 
large parts of Europe, Asia, and Australia
Likely
Heavy precipitation events: increase in frequency, 
intensity, and/or amount of heavy precipitation
Likely more land areas with increases than 
decreases
Medium confidence
Increases in intensity and/or duration of drought
Low confidence on a global scale. Likely changes 
in some regions
Low confidence
Increases in intense tropical cyclone activity
Low confidence in long-term (centennial) changes. 
Virtually certain in North Atlantic since 1970
Low confidence
