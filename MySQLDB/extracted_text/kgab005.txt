ABSTRACT
Extreme heat events impact people and ecosystems across the globe, and they are becoming more frequent and intense in a
warming climate. Responses to heat span sectors and geographic boundaries. Prior research has documented technologies
or options that can be deployed to manage extreme heat and examples of how individuals, communities, governments and
other stakeholder groups are adapting to heat. However, a comprehensive understanding of the current state of imple-
mented heat adaptations—where, why, how and to what extent they are occurring—has not been established. Here, we
combine data from the Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative with a heat-speciﬁc systematic review to analyze the global ex-
tent and diversity of documented heat adaptation actions (n ¼ 301 peer-reviewed articles). Data from 98 countries suggest
that documented heat adaptations fundamentally differ by geographic region and national income. In high-income, devel-
oped countries, heat is overwhelmingly treated as a health issue, particularly in urban areas. However, in low- and middle-
income, developing countries, heat adaptations focus on agricultural and livelihood-based impacts, primarily considering
heat as a compound hazard with drought and other hydrological hazards. 63% of the heat-adaptation articles feature indi-
viduals or communities autonomously adapting, highlighting how responses to date have largely consisted of coping strate-
gies. The current global status of responses to intensifying extreme heat, largely autonomous and incremental yet wide-
spread, establishes a foundation for informed decision-making as heat impacts around the world continue to increase.
Key words: climate change; extreme heat; adaptation; climate justice.
INTRODUCTION
Extreme heat jeopardizes the well-being of people and ecosys-
tems globally. Individuals, communities, and governments are
adapting to extreme heat, but the extent and types of these
adaptations vary widely, along with the actors promoting and
implementing measures [1, 2]. Additionally, there is limited in-
formation about monitoring, evaluation and learning in these
adaptation efforts [3, 4]. Whereas climate change impacts are
increasingly detected and attributed to human-induced climate
change, the global status of climate change adaptation is much
less understood [5, 6]. This article provides a systematic review
of how heat adaptation responses are unfolding globally as
reported in the scientific literature, building from the Global
Adaptation Mapping Initiative (GAMI).
Anthropogenic climate change is increasing the frequency
and intensity of extreme heat events in many regions [7].
Defining an extreme heat event is highly context dependent
and can be a technical and contested exercise, but under any
definition,
the
frequency
of
these
events
is
growing
[8].
Attribution studies have demonstrated significant increases in
the likelihood of recent heat waves due to climate change [5],
for instance, in Europe [9], Asia [10] and Russia [11]. Under 1.5C
global mean temperature increase above preindustrial levels,
around 13.8% of the global population will experience severe
heat waves twice a decade (e.g. heat waves similar to the 2007
Balkans
or
2015
Central
European
heat
waves)
[12,
13].
Considering heat and humidity in a 4C warming scenario, a
heat wave with a magnitude greater than the 2010 Russian heat
wave—an event that killed over 50 000 people—would have over
a 10% annual chance of occurring in Central Europe, India and
many regions in Africa and a greater than 50% annual chance of
occurring in the Eastern United States, Northern Latin America
and China [14]. Other studies have highlighted the Middle East,
North America and South Asia as regions of concern for heat
exposure approaching extreme heat survivability and adaptabil-
ity thresholds under high magnitude climate change [15–17]. In
addition to the dangers of chronic extreme heat in the Earth’s
hottest regions, projected increases in the magnitude and vari-
ability of acute heat in cooler places also pose substantial risks
[18, 19]. The severity of a heat wave relative to the mean local
and seasonal climate is a key driver of impact [18, 20]. The urban
heat island effect further exacerbates exposure [21–23]. Hence,
under global warming, extreme heat is a major, multifaceted
global threat.
The impacts from extreme heat across the world are multi-
fold. Heat threatens physical and mental health [20, 24–27], agri-
cultural yields and land-based livelihoods [28, 29], outdoor
workers and their health and productivity [30, 31], transporta-
tion infrastructure [32], energy supply [33, 34], biodiversity and
ecosystems [35] and human security [36, 37]. These impacts can
exacerbate the consequences of other climate-related hazards,
such as drought or wildfires, or stressors not related to climate,
such as air pollution or civil unrest [38–40]. Extreme heat alone
or in combination with other hazards can trigger cascading
impacts affecting multiple systems, sectors or regions and chal-
lenge effective management of the risks. For example, in India,
concurrent heat waves and droughts in 2002 and 2009 nega-
tively impacted agriculture, health and economic sectors and
caused terrestrial water storage losses and electricity shortages
[41, 42]. Similarly, in 2013, a heat wave in Buenos Aires over-
whelmed the electrical grid, leaving 800 000 people without
power, which triggered protests around the city [43]. More re-
cently, the 2020 heat wave in Siberia thawed the tundra, causing
an unprecedented summer fire in the Russian Arctic [44].
Differences in exposure and vulnerability cause some com-
munities to be more affected by extreme heat than others.
Heat-relevant trends that increase exposure or exacerbate sen-
sitivity include urbanization, aging populations and population

growth [45–47]. Exposure and vulnerability [4] to extreme heat
are temporally and spatially variable, and the two often influ-
ence each other. For example, redlining—a historic practice of
disinvestment in Black and brown communities in the USA—is
associated with greater heat exposure [48]. Measuring vulnerabil-
ity to heat is convoluted as aspects that may make some com-
munities more vulnerable to extreme heat impacts may be
irrelevant to others. For example, the drivers of vulnerability in
urban communities, such as lack of tree canopy coverage or si-
multaneous air pollution, are not necessarily the same in rural
communities [49]. Critically, those with less capacity to adapt to
extreme temperatures, such as people living in informal settle-
ments, daily wage earners, the elderly, people who are socially
isolated, and people living with mental health issues or chronic
disease, are also often most at risk due to nonclimatic drivers
[50–56]. Active promotion and focus on equity and justice in cli-
mate adaptation have emerged in the literature as a response to
these disparities. Adaptations that incorporate distributive, pro-
cedural and recognition justice can address the root causes of in-
equity [57,58]. Likewise, the extent to which local knowledge
and/or Indigenous knowledge figure into adaptation is a critical
feature of equitable adaptation [59, 60]. Beyond perpetuating past
harms, failure to meaningfully include local knowledge or
Indigenous knowledge can prevent the adoption and persistence
of strategies and overlooks existing on the ground capacity.
There is no single strategy that can be uniformly applied across
all communities. A plethora of research exists on various adapta-
tion responses deployed at local scales, but an integrative under-
standing of what measures have actually been implemented to
manage heat extremes is lacking. This study addresses this knowl-
edge gap by systematically assessing global adaptation responses
to extreme heat or heat in combination with other hazards across
sectors. It complements recent studies that reviewed urban heat
modeling [61], planning for heat [21] and the urban heat-health
nexus [22]. In addition to considering what measures are being
implemented, we explore why and how these adaptive responses
are occurring, as documented in the scientific literature. Through a
systematic review building from the GAMI dataset, we explore the
following questions: (i) What impacts most commonly lead to ad-
aptation to extreme heat? (ii) What are the roles of different actors
in adaptation to extreme heat across scales of implementation?
(iii) What types of responses are deployed? and (iv) How are equity,
local knowledge and Indigenous knowledge incorporated into heat
adaptation responses?
METHODS
Developing the implemented heat adaptation dataset
This work combined data collected from the GAMI project with
a systematic review of the literature using heat-specific adapta-
tion searches. GAMI screened peer-reviewed literature pub-
lished from 2013–19 to identify studies that documented human
responses
to
climate
change.
After
48 316
articles
were
screened, 1682 articles were coded based on 65 questions re-
lated to response type, depth, scope and speed; actors; hazards
and vulnerability; evidence of risk reduction; limits to adapta-
tion; and equity. The methods used to create this database are
detailed in the protocols for each stage [62–64]. GAMI follows
the ‘RepOrting standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses’
guidelines [65].
Here, we first filtered the original GAMI dataset to identify
articles describing implemented responses to extreme heat
under climate change. We included only articles with ‘increased
frequency and intensity of extreme heat’ coded in the hazards
category, which returned 475 articles (Fig. 1). Because some of
these
articles
described
responses
to
mean
temperature
increases, rather than extreme heat, we filtered for the extreme
heat relevant articles by searching for the phrases ‘heat’, ‘hot
day’, ‘hot night’, ‘extreme temperature’, ‘temperature extreme’,
‘extreme minimum’, ‘extreme maximum’ and ‘high tempera-
ture’ in the hazards, responses, implementation, reduced risk,
exposure and risk quotes sections of the GAMI database and
then manually confirming the relevance of each article to ex-
treme heat adaptation. A total of 202 articles on implemented
adaptation to extreme heat or to heat as a compound hazard
were thereby extracted from the GAMI database.
We then systematically searched for heat-specific adapta-
tions in the literature to identify articles that may have been
overlooked in the machine-learning algorithms applied to
screen the literature by GAMI. Following the GAMI screening
protocol, we included studies that documented or analyzed
implemented climate change adaptation in our analysis. We ex-
cluded articles that did not include human-assisted responses,
that focused on greenhouse gas emissions mitigation, that did
not focus on climate change responses, or that were purely con-
ceptual, theoretical, or simulated and model-based. Unlike
GAMI, we considered activities such as implemented coordina-
tion between government agencies or the creation and adminis-
tration
of
adaptation
policies
or
plans
as
implemented
adaptations. Further, we included papers that featured adapta-
tions to extreme heat occurring either in isolation or simulta-
neously with other hazards such as drought.
Our search, therefore, used additional heat and adaptation-
relevant key phrases. Using Harzing’s Publish or Perish software
[66], which prioritizes most relevant articles, we screened 1000
articles from Web of Science, 500 articles from Google Scholar
and 200 articles from Scopus (the allowed software maximum)
using the search string (‘extreme heat’ OR ‘heat extreme’ OR ‘ur-
ban heat’ OR ‘heat wave’ OR ‘heatwave’ OR ‘heat health’ OR
‘heat-health’ OR ‘hot day’ OR ‘hot night’ OR ‘heat day’) AND (ad-
aptation OR preparedness OR ‘action plan’ OR management OR
‘hazard mitigation’ OR resilience). The term ‘heat’ by itself was
Figure 1: Systematically reviewed articles on implemented extreme-heat adap-
tation. In total, 301 articles from the GAMI database and additional literature
searches met our inclusion criteria for implemented climate change adaptation
speciﬁc to extreme heat. Numbers in the parentheses represent the articles at
each stage in the process.

not included because it returned many articles irrelevant to cli-
mate change. All articles published after 2013 were included. Of
the 1700 articles screened, 99 met the inclusion criteria and
were not already in the GAMI dataset. Hence, our final sample
size rose to n ¼ 301 articles.
Analyzing heat adaptations
The primary goal of this work was to investigate where, why
and how adaptation to extreme heat is unfolding globally. All
articles were coded accordingly. The included GAMI data and
the additional articles were analyzed to answer questions about
impacts addressed, types of responses, actors and inclusion of
Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge across geographic
regions, as defined by the United Nations [67]. We also consid-
ered country groupings by World Bank national income level
[68]. A map of country income levels applied is available in
Supplementary Fig. S1.
We employed five analyses to address this study’s main
aim. First, the number of articles for each region was mapped.
Second, we sought to understand the specific heat impacts
addressed by the adaptations documented in the articles. We
grouped these impacts into five overarching categories: health
and well-being, economic and human security, agriculture and
subsistence livelihoods, infrastructure and the built environ-
ment, and socio-cultural impacts. For each of these categories,
we also documented all the specific heat impacts addressed
through observed adaptations (Supplementary Figs S2 and S3).
Both primary and secondary impacts were relevant to docu-
mented adaptations. Primary impacts occur in direct response
to heat exposure, such as crop failure or decreased productivity.
Secondary impacts occur in response to the primary impact,
such as loss of income. Third, the hundreds of adaptations to
extreme heat were summarized and grouped as infrastructural
or technological, institutional, behavioral or cultural, or ecosys-
tem-based adaptations [69]. These categories were chosen over
alternatives, such as response vs. preparation and design vs.
risk management solutions [21], to match common practices in
the climate adaptation literature. Complete detail on the cate-
gorization of adaptation strategies is available in our dataset in
Supplementary Table S1. Fourth, we analyzed how different
actors are involved in extreme heat adaptation. Four actor
groups were included: individuals or communities; government;
academics, nonprofits and civil society; and private sector, tech-
nical professionals and industry. We reviewed each GAMI code
and newly identified article to document how and where adap-
tations were being implemented and by whom. We include
analysis of the actors and response types by country in
Supplementary Fig. S4. Finally, given that equity and justice
concerns are central to adaptation, we examined how equity
considerations are incorporated into adaptation responses.
Specifically,
we
considered
how
local
knowledge
and/or
Indigenous knowledge was incorporated; the integration of eq-
uity; timing of stakeholder interactions in and throughout adap-
tation; agency of local and Indigenous people; recognition and
role of local and Indigenous people; and how information was
gathered
from
or
with
these
groups
across
the
articles.
Selection of these categories was informed by recent work on
co-produced research and Indigenous knowledge in adaptation
[59, 78–80]. All observations for this part of the analysis were
purely descriptive and do not represent any normative claims
from the authors about how participation and knowledge from
local or Indigenous groups should be included. Here, the term
local communities refers to non-Indigenous Peoples.
RESULTS
By analyzing 301 peer-reviewed articles, this study documents
where, why and how people are adapting to the impacts of ex-
treme heat or heat in combination with other hazards across
the globe. First, we determine countries and regions in which
implemented extreme heat adaptation has been documented.
Next, we analyze the diverse heat impacts to which people are
responding, the types of adaptations implemented and the
actors involved. Finally, we document how local or Indigenous
knowledge and/or involvement are incorporated into the heat
adaptations. Through this analysis, we assess the global status
of implemented extreme heat adaptations.
Extreme heat adaptation by region
Global regions are unequally represented in the heat adaptation
literature. Some countries are disproportionately represented in
existing literature while others are not documented at all (Fig.
2a). Ninety-eight countries are included in at least one article in
our dataset. Australia and the USA are the most studied coun-
tries; they are discussed in 49 (16%) and 48 (16%) articles, respec-
tively. India (8%), the UK (8%), Germany (7%), China (7%),
Canada (6%), France (6%), Ghana (5%), Nigeria (4%), Bangladesh
(4%) Italy (4%) and Spain (4%) are all included in more than 10
articles. Very few articles involve analysis of extreme heat adap-
tation in Latin America and the Caribbean. Bolivia is most men-
tioned for the region; however, it is only included in 4 (1%)
articles. Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Western Asia have
the fewest articles; countries in these regions are covered in 14
(5%) articles, 10 of which are review studies that cover multiple
countries across the globe. The exclusion of articles in lan-
guages other than English may explain the lack of articles about
implemented heat adaptations in Russia, despite its severe 2010
heat wave.
Heat impacts relevant to adaptation
A variety of impacts from extreme heat emerge as relevant to
implemented adaptation responses. Impacts are grouped into
five categories: health and well-being, economic and human se-
curity, agriculture and subsistence livelihoods, infrastructure
and the built environment, and sociocultural impacts (Fig. 2b
and c). The articles discuss both primary and secondary impacts
of extreme heat. Some impacts appear frequently in relation-
ship to implemented responses, whereas others come up in a
few articles (Supplementary Figs S2 and S3). The agriculture and
subsistence livelihood category substantially overlaps the eco-
nomic and human security category. These heat impacts are
commonly discussed together: 88% of articles that include agri-
cultural and subsistence livelihood impacts also discuss eco-
nomic and security impacts, and 77% of articles that include
economic and security impacts also discuss agricultural and
subsistence livelihood impacts. Health and well-being heat
impacts are most common in the adaptation-response litera-
ture (59% of articles). Health and well-being heat impacts com-
monly co-occur with socio-cultural impacts and impacts to
infrastructure and the built environment. In total, 79% of
articles that discuss socio-cultural impacts also include health
and well-being impacts, and 79% of articles that discuss impacts
to infrastructure and the built environmental also include
health and well-being impacts.
Heat impacts are prioritized differently across regions and
income levels. Heat-adaptation articles about low- and middle-
income

agricultural and economic issue (Fig. 2c). This finding holds for
Africa, Eastern Asia, Southern Asia and South-eastern Asia (Fig.
2b). Agriculture-focused articles primarily consider heat in the
context of the hydrological system, especially with drought.
Consideration of heat as a compound hazard is much less com-
mon in the other impact categories. Articles in high-income
countries consider the health and well-being; infrastructure
and built environment; and socio-cultural impact categories
(Fig. 2c).
Types of implemented heat adaptation
A range of adaptation options is observed in response to differ-
ent heat or compound heat impacts. Outside of Northern
America, Europe and Eastern Asia and in low- and middle-in-
come countries, behavioral or cultural responses are the most
common (Fig. 3a and b). Infrastructural or technological (28%),
behavioral or cultural (26%), and institutional (43%) responses
are observed in similar proportions in Southern, Northern and
Western Europe. In Northern America, institutional responses
are the most common (55%). Across all regions, ecosystem-
based responses account for fewer than 15% of adaptations.
Each response type is rich with a variety of adaptation options
(Table 1) and activities (Supplementary Table S1). For example,
‘using weather or climate information’ captures the use of
scientific forecasts and the use of local skills or Indigenous
knowledge to anticipate the weather. Agricultural and subsis-
tence-focused responses are particularly diverse, with many
kinds of options discussed across the articles.
Actors involved in heat adaptation
Overall, adaptation to heat, including as a compound hazard, is
primarily implemented by individuals and communities. Two
hundred and twenty-three (74%) articles discuss communities
or individuals involved in adaptation—nearly half (48%) of
which do not consider any other actor group (Table 2). Focus on
different kinds of actors is most prevalent in Northern America
where all groups are above 12% (Fig. 3a). There, adaptation by
individuals or communities, with or without other actors, is the

focus in 30% of the articles. Similarly, actors are most evenly
proportioned in high-income countries, where all groups are
above 9% (Fig. 3b). In low- and middle-income countries, at least
half of the articles discuss communities or individuals adapting.
Across contexts, the most common actor/implementation com-
bination is individuals autonomously adapting (63% of articles).
Individuals or communities are also involved in adaptation
from engagement with the creation of plans, to leading commu-
nity-level responses, to leveraging social networks for collective
and personal good.
Other actors (government; academics, nonprofits and civil
society; and the private sector, technical professionals and in-
dustry) are involved in adaptation to extreme heat to varying
degrees. Overall, government is the second most observed ac-
tor group, occurring in 161 articles (53%; Table 2). Government
includes local to national-level involvement. Over a third of
the articles in the Americas, Europe, Western Asia and Oceania
involve government in adaptation (Fig. 3a). Heat adaptations in
high-income (40%) countries have similar government involve-
ment as upper-middle- (38%) and low- (36%) income countries.
However, despite similar proportions of articles discussing
government for each income level, proportions of institutional
adaptation differ substantially. High-income countries have a
greater proportion (44%) of institutional adaptations than low-
(24%), lower-middle- (18%) and upper-middle- (25%) income
countries (Fig. 3b). High-income countries are also the only in-
come-level group that includes the private sector, technical
professionals and industry greater than 10% of the time. Low-
income countries include this actor group in only 2% of
articles. Actor/implementation combinations occur at varying
frequency (Table 2). Government and the private sector, tech-
nical
professionals
and
industry
are
primarily
observed
planning, coordinating and educating about risk (Table 2, Row
1). Adaptations for hard infrastructure, such as greening the
urban environment, or soft infrastructure, such as developing
rosters of at-risk groups for the health sector, are somewhat
common.
Indigenous communities and local communities
Indigenous and local communities are reported to be involved
in initiatives led by government or other external stakeholders
to different degrees. Overwhelmingly the most common way
that Indigenous people and knowledge are discussed in the
articles is in adapting autonomously using traditional knowl-
edge, animal breeds, crop varieties, practices, rituals, etc. There
are a handful of examples of Indigenous or local communities
involved in planned adaptation or research on adaptations. We
document how these communities are included in knowledge
incorporation, integration of equity, the timing of interactions,
the agency of local and Indigenous people, and the tools used
for gathering information (Table 3). Some forms of engagement
such as targeting resources to vulnerable communities or en-
gaging communities in decision-making processes are some-
what common. However, most observations are rare, occurring
in only a couple of articles and many only once. Most studies
use mixed methods approaches, such as interview or focus
group data alongside quantitative data, to assess community or
individual perceptions of heat impacts and adaptations. This is
primarily the research method used to study autonomous adap-
tations. Few studies include Indigenous people and local people
in research teams from conception of adaptation responses or
partner with citizen scientists. We find that Indigenous knowl-
edge and local knowledge are primarily used to fill gaps in
Table 1: Examples of extreme heat responses: behavioral or cultural, institutional, infrastructural or technological, and ecosystem-based
adaptations
Type
Examples in the literature
Behavioral or Cultural
‘The most common spontaneous adaptation behaviors were “drinking more water”, “opening windows”,
and “resting in the shade”. The less commonly reported behaviors were “using a sunshade or sunhat”,
“bathing frequently” and “going to a public place with air conditioning.”’ China [70]
‘[A]daptation measures [include] . . . changing from farming to non-farming activities when it is difﬁcult
to work on the farm due to intense heat.’ Nigeria [71]
Institutional
The Heat Health Prevention Plan ‘includes weather forecasts by the State Meteorology Agency, which
establishes thresholds to activate different actions of the plan . . . [A]ctions include dissemination of
preventive information to the general population and speciﬁc high-risk groups and activation of a
general hotline and emergency services.’ Spain [72]
Responses from most to least common included ‘communication about heat risks and outreach or edu-
cation to the public[,] . . . collaboration with other organizations, opening cooling centers, or activating
existing heat plans[,] . . . assisting with relocation during electrical outages, providing ﬁnancial assis-
tance, providing transportation, or hiring new staff in response to the heat.’ United States [73]
Infrastructural or Technological
Actions included ‘installation of air-conditioning, the installation of solar panels to offset electricity
costs during periods of high air-conditioning use, insulation, and passive cooling structural
design. . .As the increasing frequency and severity of heatwaves was their primary climate change-re-
lated concern, the household had built the “cool retreat” which continues to be effective in the event
of a blackout.’ Australia [74]
‘Respondents dug deep ponds inside the shrimp ﬁelds so that shrimps could take refuge from heat
stress during summer season.’ Bangladesh [75]
Ecosystem-based
‘A cocoa agroforestry farmer said that farmers have increasingly planted fruit trees in agricultural plots
to create shade to work in.’ Bolivia [76]
‘Households either planted or retained trees around their homes and farms to provide shade. This
helped to combat intense sunshine and associated extremely high temperatures that were expected

DISCUSSION
Across the world individuals, communities, government and
nongovernmental actors are adapting to extreme heat. We sys-
tematically review 301 peer-reviewed articles about adaptations
to heat and heat in combination with other hazards, building
foundational understanding of the global status of implemented
responses to climate change.
The framing of extreme heat varies substantially by region
and national income levels. Health and well-being, infrastruc-
tural and built environment, and socio-cultural heat impacts
are primarily recognized in high-income, developed countries
(Fig. 2b and c). This finding parallels a recent review that found
similar geographic biases in the urban heat-health literature
[22]. However, in low- and middle-income countries, agricul-
tural and subsistence livelihood, as well as economic and hu-
man security, impacts are most common. Focus on these
impacts is especially prominent for articles about African coun-
tries. These trends are surprising given that much previous
work has linked health and well-being as well as agriculture
impacts to increased heat exposure across country income lev-
els [81–84]. One study suggests balanced consideration of live-
stock impacts and adaptation across developing and developed
countries, but this review spanned many kinds of hazards, not
just heat [85]. Some previous research, however, supports our
finding, showing that farmers in high-income countries have
low-risk perception of climate change and therefore are likely
not actively adapting to it [86]. One alternative explanation
could be that in high-income, developed countries articles
about agriculture, and particularly crop adaptation, focus on the
hydrological impacts without the intersection of heat. There
could also be a disconnect between researchers studying
impacts of heat and those studying heat adaptation in low- and
middle-income, developing countries. Finally, in high-income,
developed countries, the urban heat island effect may receive
more attention.
Adaptation actors and types of responses also vary across
the world. As for heat impact, the types of heat adaptation and
actors involved are associated with a country’s region and in-
come level. Heat adaptations in high-income countries are
evenly spread across different types of responses and actors.
Figure 3: Adaptation response type and implementing actors differ by region and country income level. (a and b) plot documented heat response types (top bar) and
implementing actors (bottom bar). Numbers at the end of each bar signify the total number of articles for that region (a) or country income level (b). Percentages of

Previous work reviewing heat planning supports this result [21].
In low- and middle-income countries, by contrast, adaptations
are primarily behavioral or cultural adaptations implemented
by communities and/or individuals. Across all 301 articles, indi-
viduals autonomously adapting using behavioral or cultural
responses are the most common form of extreme heat response
(Table 2). This is especially true in low- and middle-income, de-
veloping countries (Fig. 3b). People, crops and livestock have an
optimum climate niche [47] and upper tolerances to heat and hu-
midity exposure. Many regions could approach the human upper
limit for survivability under a changing climate [15–17], raising
questions about potential limits to autonomous, behavioral
adaptations in some locations under increasing climate change.
For health impacts, a simple response is greater adoption and
use of air conditioning, shown to be extremely effective in reduc-
ing detrimental impacts [87]. However, relying on air condition-
ing also has well-documented barriers and drawbacks such as its
cost, reliance on electricity and exacerbation of climate change
[88]. The potential for risk reduction from technological, infra-
structural, agricultural and subsistence adaptation to heat at sur-
vivability thresholds also has uncertainties. Shifting locations of
industries, agriculture and human settlements may be other
responses increasingly deployed [89–91].
Adaptation to extreme heat presents a significant opportu-
nity to address historic injustices. Inequities in impacts—distri-
butional consequences—are the fourth most common heat
impact, reinforcing extreme heat as a hazard with justice impli-
cations (Supplementary Figs S2 and S3). We also find that local
communities and Indigenous communities are involved to dif-
ferent degrees in planned adaptations (Table 3). Previous work
has provided recommendations for or documented examples of
co-produced adaptation, which can support procedural justice
in the adaption process [92]. However, our results suggest that
globally there has been minimal implementation of these tech-
niques to respond to extreme heat. Examples of distributive and
recognition justice were more common; many studies discuss

targeting resources to or identifying vulnerable collectives.
Although our results highlight examples of substantial involve-
ment of local communities and Indigenous communities in
planned heat adaptations, these were not the norm. We
expected more incorporation of equity given its prevalence in
climate adaptation literature, particularly for urban areas [5, 57, 93].
This suggests a need to prioritize equity and justice in heat
adaptation.
Although we strived to be as consistent and comprehensive
as possible in systematically reviewing the global status of heat
adaptation, there are several limitations to this study. First, this
work is a product of GAMI and therefore subject to its screening
and coding [62–64]. Second, as emphasized, there are many
ways to define extreme heat, and the delineation between heat
and mean temperature increases is not always consistent
across articles. A GAMI article is included in our dataset if it was
coded for extreme heat in the designated hazard question, in-
cluded one of the heat-related keywords and was not obviously
about general temperature increases. Third, following GAMI’s
inclusion and exclusion criteria, we have studied peer-reviewed
literature. GAMI included articles in all languages, but our sup-
plemental systematic review only considered documents writ-
ten in English. This may have led us to overlook articles in
certain regions or about Indigenous groups. Information about
Indigenous groups and their actions may further be limited in
our dataset due to data sovereignty and protection of traditional
knowledge. Grey literature may also capture how some actors
are adapting to heat better than peer-reviewed literature.
Finally, an analysis of the efficacy or adequacy of adaptation
was not included in this study. An effective strategy is multifac-
eted, including the ease of implementation, timing and duration
of benefits, and reduction of harm or impact [6, 94]. Properly
assessing these factors for individual adaptation options was
outside of the capacity of our dataset.
Adaptation to extreme heat is happening globally in re-
sponse to different impacts and at different scales of implemen-
tation. We document the status of heat adaptation in 301
articles and across 98 countries. Overall, treatment of extreme
heat is fundamentally different across regions and country in-
come levels. This result raises additional questions about future
approaches to heat mitigation measures given the changing na-
ture of extreme heat across low and high latitude countries in a
warming world. Strategies applied in already heat burdened
regions can inform and inspire future adaptation options in
other parts of the world. Adaptation is primarily occurring
through individuals or communities autonomously responding
and coping. Climate change and urbanization will continue to
increase the likelihood and severity of extreme heat events,
magnifying the need for planned adaptation. Beyond imple-
mented adaptations, there is abundant analysis of adaptation
technologies or strategies that could potentially reduce heat ex-
posure, but these responses only matter if they are used.
Although there is a lot of work ahead, the diversity and scope of
adaptation to heat across the world are an encouraging sign.
