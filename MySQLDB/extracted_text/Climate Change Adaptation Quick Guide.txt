The weather in northern Ontario is changing. Human-caused greenhouse gas emissions 
are pushing the Earth’s climate toward a warmer world at a faster rate than ever before, 
with temperatures in the north rising at twice the rate of other regions. These changes, 
coupled with the close ties First Nation communities have with the land, make the need 
to prepare and adapt to the impacts of climate change increasingly important. 
As part of a co-lead Building Regional Adaptation Capacity and Expertise (BRACE) 
project, Up North on Climate, along with partners from the Tribal Councils of 
Keewaytinook Okimakanak, Matawa, Mushkegowuk, Nokiiwin and Shibogama, as well 
as Grand Council Treaty #3, have co-developed resources that can be used by First 
Nations moving towards climate resilience. 
The Climate Change Adaptation Quick Guide is a series of illustrations that present 
climate change impacts and possible adaptation options relevant to northern Ontario 
First Nation communities.  
Climate change impacts are already being noticed and felt by people in communities 
throughout the north. Some of those impacts, as well as impacts that are expected as 
climate continues to change, are summarized in the “Climate Change Impacts” 
illustration (pictured to the right).  
To illustrate climate change adaptation actions, impacts are divided into 8 themes:

INTRODUCTION 
Each of the 8 illustrations set adaptation options in a fictional First 
Nation community in a northern Ontario landscape and includes: 
 
 
 
 
 
The Quick Guide does not aim to present every possible adaptation 
option for dealing with climate change impacts. Instead, the purpose 
is to help start conversations about climate change adaptation 
options in First Nation communities. Whether the illustrations are 
used as posters, handouts, or slides in a presentation, the aim of the 
Climate Change Adaptation Quick Guide is to spark ideas and get the 
ball rolling on discussions around adapting to climate change and 
creating climate resilient communities.

Share about water conservation
•  Inform the community of drought or low 
water conditions and encourage water 
conservation when needed.
•  Raise awareness about water conservation 
and how it can be done in the community (fix 
leaky taps/toilets, collect rainwater for 
gardens, etc.).
Assess drinking water systems
•  Low water levels can put drinking water 
quality at risk.
•  Monitor drinking water sources for 
problems related to low water like algae 
growth, higher contaminate levels, issues 
with intake pipes, dry wells, etc.
•  Determine if your drinking water system 
will work well in drought and low water 
conditions with a vulnerability assessment.
•  Have a plan to supply emergency drinking 
water if needed.
Water Treatment Plant
Monitor/protect important habitat
•  Monitor and/or put measures in place to 
protect important habitats that can be 
impacted by dry conditions and low water. 
•  This could include wetlands, wild rice beds, 
fish spawning grounds, fish migration routes, 
shoreline areas, etc.
Monitor/protect important 
plants & animals
•  Monitor and/or put measures in place to 
protect important plant or animal species that 
could be impacted by drought and dry periods.
Drought impact assessment
•  Find out what areas of the community might 
be impacted by drought conditions and how 
community members might be affected.
•  Changing drinking water quality, dusty roads 
leading to breathing problems, lack of water 
for gardens or harvested foods, are all 
examples of drought impacts.
•  Have a community plan to lessen the impact 
of drought on people and the community.
DROUGHT & DRY PERIODS - ADAPTATION OPTIONS
www.upnorthonclimate.ca
Monitor for drought conditions
•   Monitor for drought conditions in your area 
and have a plan in place for dealing with drought 
conditions (called a drought response plan).
•   Drought monitoring can be done with 
programs like Canadian Drought Monitor.
•   Communities may want to create their own 
drought monitoring program.
Monitor water levels
•  Set up a program to monitor water levels 
or use existing programs like the Low Water 
Conditions Map from Ontario’s Surface 
Water Monitoring Centre.
•  In some cases, low water could impact 
hydro-electric power generation. If this 
applies in your area, you may want to plan 
for power outages.
*Adaptations vary in scale (small to large), focus (individual to community) & cost (low to high).  Find what works for you and your community.
•  Low water levels can make travel by boat 
more difficult. Consider changes like:
Travel & low water
• finding new water routes
• creating a portage around low water areas
• using motors made for shallow water
• carrying lighter loads in boats
• traveling over land instead
•  Be mindful of hazards like: newly exposed 
rocks (sometimes called ‘reefs’) or logs, 
soft/muddy shorelines, etc.
Control dust on roads
•  Hot, dry weather can cause excessive dust 
on gravel roads, leading to breathing issues 
for some in the community.
•  To limit dust on community roads: limit 
traffic, encourage lower speeds, change road 
building materials, water roads or apply 
eco-friendly dust suppression products.

ECOSYSTEMS - ADAPTATION OPTIONS
Start a monitoring program
•  Monitoring can help track changes happening 
in traditional areas and guide future actions.
•  What a community monitors will depend on 
its needs/goals and could include:
- Presence of new or invasive species
- Timing of events like spawning or flowering
- Migration times and patterns
- Number and health of culturally significant 
plants & animals
Keep ecosystems healthy
•  Healthy land and water help support all 
species and may be better able to cope with 
the impacts of climate change like drought, 
wildfire, flooding, and invasive species. Healthy 
peatlands and forests also store carbon which 
can help limit further climate change.
Assist plant migration
•   Programs where humans help plants move to 
new areas in response to climate change is called 
‘assisted migration’.
•   This includes helping important plants 
continue to grow (through seed collection, local 
transplants, etc.).
•   Bringing in new plants could lead to ecosystem 
disruptions. Weigh risks carefully.
Protect permafrost
•  Permafrost loss can change the landscape 
and affect plants and animals (palsa collapse, 
thaw slumps, shoreline erosion, etc.). 
•  Protect permafrost by limiting 
disturbances and properly constructing 
roads and buildings.
•  Limiting global warming by reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions is the best way to 
protect permafrost.
Protect important areas/plants/animals
•   Protect important habitat or culturally 
significant places from destruction or damage.
•   Protect important animals, plants, and 
medicines by looking after the habitat they 
need and prevent overharvesting. 
Prevent invasive species
•  Climate change could make it possible for 
invasive species to live in new places.
•  Prevention is key. Encourage actions like:
•  Monitor for new species and have a control 
plan for ones that could be damaging.
www.upnorthonclimate.ca
*Adaptations vary in scale (small to large), focus (individual to community) & cost (low to high).  Find what works for you and your community.
Restore damaged habitat
•  Help bring damaged habitats back to their 
natural state by: replanting native vegetation, 
removing invasive species, cleaning up trash 
and pollution, etc.
•  Restoring habitat supports biodiversity and 
could provide other benefits like natural flood 
control and carbon storage.
- Cleaning boats and fishing gear
- Using local firewood
- Avoiding invasive plants in gardens
Traditional Knowledge
•   Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) 
contains valuable information about the land 
and water and can guide decisions about 
protection. Intergenerational sharing of TEK is 
key to continued land and water protection.
Keep forests and rivers connected
•  Climate change will mean some plants and 
animals will have to move to new places to 
survive. Keeping forests continuous or connected 
and not blocking the paths of rivers can help 
species that need to move to new areas.
Adjust harvesting
•  Change harvesting time and location to 
match when/where animals and plants are 
now available. Consider harvesting species 
new to the area, like deer and bass.

Climate change adaptations for northern First Nation communities & individuals
Avoid building on flood plains
•  A flood plain is an area of low-lying ground 
next to a lake or river. These areas are more 
likely to have flooding issues.
•  Traditional knowledge about past floods 
and high water levels can give valuable 
information about which areas may be at 
risk of flooding.
Flood monitoring & forecasting
Drain water away from buildings
•   Keep water from entering homes and 
buildings with:
- eavestroughs, drain pipes, weeping tile
- trenches to direct water away
- sloping the ground away from foundations
Community drainage
•  A good community drainage system 
(ditches, culverts, water storage areas, etc.) 
can help prevent flooding from heavy rain or 
during spring melt.
•  Regular maintenance (clearing blockages, 
replacing damaged culverts, etc.) can help keep 
drainage systems working well.
Help river ice melt
•  In areas where ice jams are common, 
weakening the ice to melt it faster can help 
prevent a jam or make it less severe.
Manage snow
•  Pile snow in a places where melt water 
can drain away safely from buildings and 
other infrastructure.
Wetlands & natural space
•   Wetlands and natural forest spaces can 
help absorb water from rain and spring melt 
and provide natural flood protection.
FLOODING - ADAPTATION OPTIONS
Emergency planning
•  Emergency planning can help keep people safe.
•  Community emergency plans could include: 
evacuation plans, refuge centres, plans to 
protect infrastructure, etc.
•  Households can prepare by: having emergency 
supplies, knowing what to pack for evacuations, 
knowing the community emergency plan, etc.
Water control structures
•  Structures like dams, dikes and berms are 
sometimes used for flood control in areas 
where floods have happened before.
•  Structures like ice booms are sometimes 
used to prevent ice jams from forming.
Community planning
•  Consider flooding in community planning, like 
when deciding where to build homes/buildings, 
where/how roads should be constructed, 
plans for drainage, etc.
www.upnorthonclimate.ca
•   Consider the slope of the land and how 
water will drain when choosing where to 
build homes/buildings.
•  Monitor your area for conditions that could 
lead to flooding. This could be things like:
- heavy rains
- rapid snow 
melt
- high water in 
lakes/river
- ice jams
•  Some flood watch and warning programs 
already exist (like Ontario’s Flood Watch and 
Warning Program) or communities may want 
to create their own.
•  Flood forecasting models (made specifically 
for a community or area) look at what 
conditions have led to flooding in the past to 
try to predict what conditions will likely 
cause flooding in the future.

FOOD SECURITY - ADAPTATION OPTIONS
Community-based monitoring
•  Monitoring activities can help us 
understand what’s happening with plants and 
animals in our area.
•  What a community chooses to monitor will 
depend on its needs and goals.
•  The information gathered from monitoring 
can help guide future actions and decisions.
•  Things to monitor could include:
- population counts (how many?)
- fish spawning times & locations
- migration times & patterns
- animal health & diseases
- locations where important plants grow
- when plants are ready for harvest
- water levels & temperature
Community food storage
•  Warmer fall weather can make it harder 
to keep harvested meat cool. 
•  Community coolers can provide a cool 
space for community members to hang 
and butcher their game. Community 
freezers can be used for long-term 
storage of food by members.
•  Encourage traditional food storage 
methods, like smoking/salting meat, fish 
houses or storing food underground (if 
climate conditions still allow).
Assisted migration
•   Programs where humans help species move 
to new areas in response to climate change is 
called ‘assisted migration’.
•   For food security this may mean planting 
berries or other plants that will grow well in 
future climate, or helping important plants in 
the area continue to grow. 
•   Moving plants and animals can lead to 
invasive species and disruptions of 
ecosystems. Weigh all risks carefully before 
using assisted migration.
Food sharing
•  Sharing harvested foods within the 
community can help ensure that everyone 
has access to healthy traditional foods. 
Adjust how you harvest
•  Change when and where you harvest to 
match when/where animals and plants are 
now available.
•  Change how/when you travel and wait 
until weather conditions are safe.
•  Harvest species that are new to the area 
and shift away from harvesting vulnerable 
populations.
Protect/restore habitat
•   Protect the habitat that is important to 
harvested plants and animals and/or restore 
habitat areas that have been damaged. 
•   Important habitat areas might include:
- migration routes
- staging & nesting 
areas
- calving grounds
- spawning grounds
- cold water refuges
- wild rice stands
Community food production
•  Growing food in the community can help 
more people have access to healthy foods. 
Examples of local or community food 
production include:
- household 
gardens
- community 
gardens
- forest gardens
- greenhouses
- raising animals
- indoor growing 
methods
- other methods 
of culturally 
appropriate 
food production

HEALTH - ADAPTATION OPTIONS
Monitor & prevent bites 
from ticks and mosquitoes 
•  Climate change will allow species to live in 
areas where they couldn’t live before, like 
blacklegged ticks that can carry Lyme disease 
or mosquitoes that can carry West Nile virus.
•  Monitoring activities, like tick dragging and 
mosquito traps, can help alert communities 
to new species in their area.
•  Help prevent infection by preventing bites. 
Take actions like Covering skin, Using ‘bug 
spray’ and Checking for ticks after being 
outdoors.
Monitor air quality
•  Air quality could be affected by wildfire 
smoke or increases in pollen/allergens.
•  Monitor air quality in the community with 
existing programs (like firesmoke.ca) or with   
a community air-monitoring station.
Monitor for hot weather
•  Create a monitoring program for heat 
events. Warn community members of hot 
weather days and share steps for avoiding 
heat illness.
30°C
Cultural activities
•  Cultural activities support community 
health and well-being.
•  Consider weather and the changing climate 
when planning traditional or outdoor 
activities; provide shade, water and shelter 
to participants.
Recognize & prevent 
mold growth in homes
•   Mold can grow when there is extra 
moisture in your home from condensation, 
leaking pipes, flooded basements, etc.
•   Share information about recognizing, 
preventing, and dealing with mold in 
community homes.
Protection from sun & heat
•  Avoid sunburns and heat illness by:
- finding shade 
- covering skin with clothing or sunscreen
- wearing hats & sunglasses
- limiting activity in the hottest part of 
the day
Refuge centres
•  Refuge centres provide safe spaces for 
people during emergencies or extreme events.
•  Cooling centres for hot weather, clean air 
spaces for poor air quality, and evacuation 
centres or emergency housing for people who 
have to leave their homes, are types of 
refuge centres.
Community plan for weather events
•   Communities can make a plan/plans for 
events like heat, storms, flood, wildfire, etc.
•   Consider things like community alerts, 
refuge centres, emergency supplies, planning 
for power outages, evacuation plans, etc.
•   Identify vulnerable groups in the 
community (children, Elders, those with 
health issues, etc.) and include their needs.
www.upnorthonclimate.ca
Health support
•  Make sure that health professionals serving 
the community know the health risks of 
climate change.
•  Information about climate change and health 
should be shared with the community. 
•  Advocate for health services for climate 
change challenges (mental health support, 
medications for asthma, respiratory 
conditions, Lyme disease prevention, etc.).

Plan for power outages
•  A community plan for power outages could 
include: an emergency centre (warming in 
winter, cooling in summer), support for 
community members, community alerts, etc.
•  Having a source of emergency power will be 
an important part of community planning.
•  Households can prepare by: having 
emergency supplies, knowing how to keep 
refrigerated foods from spoiling, knowing how 
to keep pipes from freezing, etc.
Building roads
•  Shape roads to help water drain off (water 
on roads can create potholes & washouts).
•  Include ditches and culverts and keep them 
maintained.
•  Limit erosion on roadside slopes by keeping 
the grade gentle and letting plants grow. 
Vulnerability assessment
•  Climate change will bring many challenges to 
energy infrastructure, community roads, 
water systems, homes and buildings. A 
vulnerability assessment can help identify how 
these parts of the community are at risk.
• Make a plan to get vulnerable infrastructure 
ready for climate change. 
Produce renewable energy
•  Communities can use renewable sources, 
like wind, solar or micro hydro, to produce 
energy.
•  Renewable energy can reduce dependence 
on diesel generators or the provincial grid.
•  Renewable energy Can also provide backup 
power if the larger electrical grid goes down.
Community Centre
Build or retrofit for 
climate change
•  Keep climate change (extreme heat, severe 
storms, flooding, etc.) in mind when planning 
new projects or repairing/upgrading existing 
homes, buildings and services.
•  Improve community homes with things like 
insulation, drainage, sump pumps, energy 
efficient windows, etc.
•  Structural changes or improvements might 
also be needed.
Snow load
•  Snow load is the weight of snow and ice 
on the roof of a home or building.
•  Know the warning signs of snow load 
problems for homes/buildings.
•  Measure snow amounts and have a plan 
for snow removal.
Monitor drinking water quality
•   Monitor drinking water sources for 
potential climate change impacts (lower 
water levels, water quality changes, 
problems with intake pipes, etc.).
•   Have a community plan if tap water is 
not safe to drink.
Drinking & Wastewater 
Systems
INFRASTRUCTURE - ADAPTATION OPTIONS

Good community drainage
•  Good drainage can help keep water from 
settling on roads and keep it out of 
basements and crawlspaces.
•  Drainage systems should have:
- an appropriate slope
- water holding areas (like wetlands)
- culverts that are the right size and 
not damaged
- clear ditches
Monitor wastewater lagoons
•  Climate change could bring challenges like 
more heavy rain events. Monitor lagoons for 
signs of problems, like leakage, that can 
contaminate surrounding land.

Climate change adaptations for northern First Nation communities & individuals
Keep routes clear
•  Making sure trails and routes stay 
accessible may mean putting more time and 
effort into keeping trails clear (removing 
fallen trees, keeping brush down, etc.).
Monitor ice conditions
•  Monitor ice conditions in the area and share 
that information with the community.
•  Ice thickness can be measured with an axe 
or auger, or with ice-monitoring sensors like 
ground penetrating radar, like the ones used 
in the SmartICE program.
New or different routes
•  Taking a different route or creating a new 
trail might be needed if low water levels, thin 
ice, or changes to the land make traditional 
routes unsafe or obstructed.
Bridge crossing
•   Climate change is making the ice-on season 
shorter and affecting the thickness and 
quality of ice.
•   Permanent bridge crossings over water 
on popular routes and trails could make 
crossing ice safer and extend the length of 
time people can travel.
TRAVEL ON LAND, WATER & ICE - ADAPTATION OPTIONS
Change equipment
•  People in the north are already changing the 
way they travel on land, water & ice by doing 
things like:
- using ATVs instead of snowmobiles
- using boats and motors for shallow water
- taking lighter loads in boats
- using lighter equipment on thinner ice
Ice rescue
•  Ice self-rescue is knowing how to get 
yourself out of the water. Partner-rescue is 
knowing how to help someone else out of the 
water. 
•  Consider arranging ice rescue training in 
the community.
•  Having safety equipment  (floater suits, ice 
picks, throw ropes, etc.) and knowing how to 
use it can make a difference.
•  Communities may want to consider making 
safety equipment available for people to use.
Plan trip & prepare
•  Trip planning and carrying emergency 
supplies can help keep people safe in the face 
of changing and unpredictable weather.
•  Actions can include:
•  Supplies can include:
- checking the weather forecast
- sharing your travel plans with 
someone you trust
- food and water
- first aid kit
- extra medication
- satellite phone or SPOT device

Permanent bridge crossings
•  Bridges over river and creek crossings can 
make winter roads less dependent on ice 
conditions allowing roads to open sooner and 
stay open longer.
•  This option is likely to be expensive.
Winter road flooding
•  It may be possible to change or improve road 
flooding methods to get better results.
•  Newer water pumps, more water pumps, or 
other types of equipment could be helpful. Seek 
funding if equipment could be updated or 
improved.
•  Ice-penetrating radar machines (like used in 
SmartIce) could be helpful for determining safe 
ice thickness for flooding and travel.
All-season road feasibility
•  As the winter road season gets shorter, 
Tribal Councils, regions, etc. might explore the 
option of an all-season road.
•  Communities may want to support an all- 
season road feasibility study for their region.
•  Planning and building an all-season road is 
a long, multi-million dollar process that will 
require engineers/consultants, impact 
assessments, a coordinated plan, etc.
Reduce need for fuel tankers
•   Fuel for diesel generators is a big part of 
the goods shipped over winter roads.
•   Energy from renewable sources, like wind 
or solar projects, reduce the need for diesel 
in communities.
•   Wataynikaneyap Power is also connecting 
some remote communities to the provincial 
electricity grid.
Share information
•  Climate change is making winter road 
conditions less predictable.
•  Share daily winter road information in the 
community. Many communities and community 
members already do this using social media.
•  Conditions can vary over different sections 
of winter roads. Information about road 
conditions over long distances, like the entire 
route from major centres in the south to 
communities in the north, could be very useful.
www.upnorthonclimate.ca
Better equipment
•  Equipment upgrades could allow some 
road construction to start earlier. Graders, 
for example, could allow land sections to be 
built quickly without needing to wait for 
plentiful snow to create a smooth road bed. 
•  Seek funding for new equipment.
Realign the route
•  Winter road builders, guided by local 
knowledge or their own experiences, may be 
able to make small-scale changes to the 
winter road routes like: avoiding steep 
slopes, limiting south-facing exposures, 
finding better creek-crossing locations, etc.
•  Large-scale changes to the route involving 
big stretches of road (and likely more than 
one community) would be a big project 
involving consultants, engineers, 
government, etc. 
*Adaptations vary in scale (small to large), focus (individual to community) & cost (low to high).  Find what works for you and your community.
WINTER ROAD TRAVEL - ADAPTATION OPTIONS
Reduce need for shipped goods
•  It may be possible to harvest some goods, 
like logs or food, from the land. 
•  Consider foods that can be grown in your 
community with gardens, greenhouses, etc.
•  Traditional ways of building may better 
incorporate materials from the land and 
strengthen cultural connection.
Gather information
•  Gathering information about the winter 
road (road condition, road usage, 
opening/closing dates, etc.) can be important 
for future decisions.

WILDFIRE - ADAPTATION OPTIONS
Monitor for smoke & air quality
•  Knowing when smoke is predicted to reach 
your community (smoke forecasting) can 
allow time to put health actions in place.
•  Track wildfire smoke with online tools like 
FireSmoke Canada or Canada’s Wildfire Smoke 
Prediction System (FireWork).
•  Identify those in the community most 
vulnerable to poor air quality (Elders, those 
with asthma, etc.).
•  When air quality is poor or predicted to 
become poor, communities can: inform 
community members, set up clean air spaces, 
evacuate vulnerable people, etc.
Monitor wildfire risk
•  Hot, dry conditions can make it easier for 
fires to start and spread.
•  Communities can monitor the fire hazard 
risk in their area with online tools like 
Ontario’s Forest Fire Info Map or the Canadian 
Wildland Fire Information System, or create 
their own program.
Manage trees & plants
•   Managing trees and plants can help keep 
wildfires out of your community. This could 
include: fireguards, thinning trees, encourag-
ing growth of deciduous trees, clearing dead 
material and  controlled burning.
Emergency planning
•  Emergency planning can help keep people safe in 
the event of a wildfire.
•  Community emergency plans could include: 
evacuation plans, the roles and responsibilities   
of community members, plans to protect 
infrastructure, etc.
•  Households can prepare for emergencies by: 
having emergency supplies, knowing what to pack 
for evacuation, knowing the community 
emergency plan, etc.
•  Communities can also inventory any fire 
equipment they have and keep it in working order.
Community Centre
FireSmart community
•  FireSmart Canada offers programs and 
information to help households and 
communities be better prepared for wildfire.
•  Managing trees and plants, priority zones 
around homes and communities, fire-resistant 
materials, community fireguards, and more, 
are all part of FireSmart.
Fire-resistant materials
•  Some materials are more fire resistant than 
others. Use more fire-resistant materials when 
building new homes or updating existing ones.
Community alerts
•  Share information about fire hazard risk, 
smoke and air quality with the community. 
Social media, community websites, local 
television and radio, and posted notices can 
all be good ways to do this.
•  Communities may want to have a special 
alert or warning alarm to tell residents when 
there is a wildfire emergency.
Prevent human-caused fires
•  Raise awareness of human-caused fires 
and how they can be prevented on the land 
and in the community. 
www.upnorthonclimate.ca
Monitor water quality
•  Wildfires can impact water when ash, 
sediment, or other debris is washed into lakes 
and rivers.
•  When fires happen near or upstream of a 
community, drinking water could be affected.
•  Monitor lakes/rivers that supply drinking 
water after wildfire events and have a plan if 
water is not safe to drink.
