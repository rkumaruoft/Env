Climate change represents a signiﬁcant global health crisis, characterized by a complex interplay of environ-
mental shifts and interconnected phenomena. These alterations have given rise to a multitude of health
implications, notably impacting ocular health. Our comprehensive review delineates a spectrum of eye con-
ditions associated with climate change-related variables. Extremes in temperature and weather events have
been observed to affect the ocular surface, resulting in an increased incidence of conjunctivitis, keratitis, dry
eye disease, and pterygium. Furthermore, climate change is linked to a rising occurrence of cataracts, glau-
coma, periocular tumors, and infections. Prolonged food insecurity, stemming from droughts, has been asso-
ciated with nutritional optic neuropathies and consequent vision loss. Elevated temperatures have also been
correlated with a heightened risk of retinal detachments necessitating urgent surgical intervention to
enhance prognostic outcomes.
This review also outlines the inﬂuence of climate-warming pollutants on a diverse array of eye conditions,
manifesting as ocular surface infections, degenerative changes like pterygium, cataracts, refractive errors
(myopia), blepharitis, meibomian gland infections, glaucoma, and vascular retinal occlusions.
Mitigating the effects of climate change is an urgent global imperative necessitating collaborative efforts,
encompassing research and education, to devise sustainable solutions that safeguard human health and
well-being. This review seeks to delineate the current extent of available research, identify gaps in the exist-
ing literature, and chart the course for future studies in this intriguing association.

1. Introduction
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) deﬁnes ‘climate change’ as the "direct or indirect human
activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere in addi-
tion to natural climate variability observed over comparable time
periods" [1]. A recent report published by the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggests a signiﬁcant risk in climate
change hazards, including heat-related morbidity and mortality,
emerging water- and vector-borne diseases, ﬂood risks in low-lying
regions, and loss of biodiversity in land, freshwater, and ecosystems
leading to nutrition deprivation [2]. Numerous health consequences
have been identiﬁed, encompassing threats to eye health. The risks of
blindness and emerging of ocular conditions impact the most vulner-
able countries with a lack of access to healthcare and governmental
funding due to global and gender disparities [3−5]. In Sub-Saharan
Africa where trachoma infection is most prevalent, incidence is likely
to increase with extreme heat and low precipitation [6−9]. Countries
that are most affected by heatwaves are at risk of microbial keratitis,
in particular fungal infections [10−12]. Major ﬂooding can also result
in mold contamination and ocular infections among the immuno-
compromised [13]. The incidence of night blindness and ocular

surface diseases is expected to rise parallel to food insecurity and
nutritional deprivation as a result of drought [14,15]. Atmospheric
ozone depletion leads to increasing levels of ultraviolet radiation
(UVR) causing photodamage to plant and animals, which subse-
quently increases the risk of cataracts, pterygium and periocular skin
cancers especially in countries in close proximity to the equator [16
−20]. Between November and December 2020, the Antarctic region
experienced abnormally elevated levels of UVR in the range of 280
−315 nm, coinciding with the period of historically low total ozone
columns [20]. A recent global review by Alryalat and colleagues
reveals the negative impacts of air particulates such as particulate
matter (PM)2.5, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and
sulphur dioxide (SO2) on ocular health in relation to the ocular sur-
face, control of ocular inﬂammation and glaucoma [21]. Climate
change and air pollutants are intricately connected. Certain air pollu-
tants, such as CO, NO, NO2, SO2, and CH4, can indeed contribute to cli-
mate change. Additionally, changes in temperature and precipitation
can exacerbate ground-level ozone and particulate matter, including
windblown dust from droughts or smoke, thereby giving rise to a
harmful feedback loop in the context of climate change [22]. As the
eye is uniquely susceptible to climatological changes, emergent liter-
ature is increasingly showing the inﬂuence of climate change on ocu-
lar health. This review aims to identify the scope of studies available
to answer speciﬁc research questions, identify gaps in the current lit-
erature, and help map directions for future studies on this impactful
association.
2. Methods
2.1. Research questions identiﬁed
(1) What is the impact of climate change and climate change hazards
on ocular health?
(2) How do speciﬁc pollutants (that contribute to climate change)
affect ocular health?
(3) What is the effect of nutritional deprivation (as a result of biodi-
versity loss and climate change) on ocular health?
2.2. Search strategy and selection criteria
To answer these research questions, our team developed a search
strategy using a combination of subject headings and keywords for
bibliographic
databases
including
MEDLINE,
Embase,
PubMed,
CINAHL, Cochrane library, and PsycINFO as shown in Table 1. The
search was conducted in March 2023 and ﬁnalized in July 2023. We
included studies published from 2008 onwards (recent ﬁfteen years),
studies written in English, human subject research, and original
articles (such as randomized controlled trials, non-randomized con-
trolled trials, cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, case-control
studies, qualitative research, prevalence studies, case-series, case
reports,
experimental
research
and
descriptive
surveys).
We
excluded reviews, conference abstracts, editorials, commentaries, let-
ters to editors, and those that had no relation to climate change and
ocular health. Nutrition-related papers that did not have speciﬁed
wording related to climate change (such as change in temperature,
UVR or humidity), or associated hazards (such as droughts, storms,
hurricanes, heatwaves, wildﬁres) were also excluded. Our study was
not registered with PROSPERO or similar review databases. We also
explored gray literature using a direct internet search on Google
Scholar (where each author is allocated a particular topic based on
anatomical variables) and PubMed search for relevant articles before
importing them onto the Covidence systematic review software
(Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia. Available at www.
covidence.org), where duplicates were excluded prior to article
screening.
2.3. Data extraction
Our team ﬁrst created and trialed the data extraction template
(Supplementary File 1) on Covidence systematic review software
before carrying out full data extraction. The extracted items included
the country in which the study was conducted, study aim, study
design, study source, funding source, conﬂicts of interest, population
description including sample size, and primary and secondary out-
come measures. In the data extraction template, we also categorized
the study into: 1) climate change variables (extreme weather and
temperature changes, emerging infectious diseases, pollutants that
cause climate change, nutritional deﬁciencies related to climate
change, and systemic condition manifesting ocularly) and 2) anatom-
ical variables (ocular surface, glaucoma, retina, uveitis, ocular adnexa
and ocular trauma) to allow ease of data reporting and analysis.
3. Results
A total of 9647 records were identiﬁed from the initial database
research with 216 additional records from other sources. After
excluding duplicates and articles without full-text, 6384 records
were subsequently assessed for eligibility. We further excluded stud-
ies irrelevant to the topic, those not related to climate change, those
with no ocular association, papers focused on pollutants that do not

have a direct impact on climate change, non-original articles, animal
studies, studies published before 2009, and non-English papers. None
of the gray literature studies were included. After the exclusion pro-
cess, a total of 130 articles were found eligible for inclusion. Fig. 1
presents the search results and screening process.
Out of the 130 original research articles included, the majority (44
papers) were cross-sectional studies, followed by 36 cohort studies,
10 case-control studies, 6 case-crossover studies, 5 case series stud-
ies, 5 mixed methods studies, 4 time series studies, 3 retrospective
observational studies, 3 ecological studies, 3 experimental studies, 3
descriptive surveys, 2 randomized control trials (RCTs), 2 case
reports, 2 prevalence studies, and 2 clinical predictive studies.
The majority of the included articles were published by East Asian
countries, with China (n = 36), Taiwan (n = 17), and South Korea
(n = 16) being the primary contributors. The distribution of research
papers by country is depicted in Fig. 2. Interestingly, a signiﬁcant por-
tion of the published papers in China and Taiwan focused on pollu-
tants that cause climate change. Speciﬁcally, out of the 36 papers
published in China, 24 were related to climate warming pollutants
whereas 10 out of 17 papers in Taiwan were focused on climate
warming pollutants.
Fig. 3 demonstrates an upward trend in papers exploring the rela-
tionship between climate change and ocular health over the years.
There is a notable increase, especially from the year 2019 onwards.

However, since the literature search was conducted in March 2023,
only three papers eligible from the year 2023 were included in the
study.
We also looked at the number of articles published by comparing
their economies based on GDP (gross domestic product) per capita as
illustrated in Fig. 4. It is evident that higher-income countries (HICs)
are contributing more original research articles on this association.
This discrepancy may be attributed to the availability of better
research opportunities and funding sources for conducting studies in
these countries, as well as to governments that have recognized the
need to design more mitigation strategies. Perhaps higher income
countries are also more equipped with subspecialty ophthalmology
clinics making these conditions more evident in clinical practice.
The included studies were categorized into two groups: climate
change variables (Fig. 5) and anatomical variables (Fig. 6). Regarding
climate change variables, out of the 130 articles included, 71 were
focused on pollutants that contribute to climate change. Additionally,
there were 54 articles examining the effects of extreme weather and
temperature changes (such as high or low temperatures, humidity,
ﬂoods, hurricanes, and ultraviolet radiation), four articles addressing
emerging infectious diseases, and only one article related to nutri-
tional deﬁciencies.
Examining the anatomical variables depicted in Fig. 6, we found
that 55 % of all articles were centered around the cornea, conjunctiva,
and ocular surface. These areas are the external exposed part of the
eye, making them particularly vulnerable to climate change varia-
bles.
Within our research team, we have ophthalmologists with diverse
academic
backgrounds
and
various
subspecialties
of
interest.

Therefore, for the purpose of data analysis and reporting, we subdi-
vided each category based on their respective specialty of interest, as
follows (Table 2). A summary of the associated ocular conditions
described is shown in Table 3:
Findings:
3.1. Cornea, conjunctiva and ocular surface
3.1.1. Pollutants
A total of 56 included studies examined the impact of airborne pol-
lutants on the ocular surface [24,26−28,30−33,35,37−41,44−54,56
−61,63,64,66−68,70−74,76−79,81,82,84,85,88−93,153]. Major pollu-
tants, including ozone (O3), ﬁne particulates with a diameter of less
than 2.5 or 10 microns, respectively (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide
(NO2), nitric oxide (NO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO),
and methane (CH4), were investigated. 30 (53.6 %) articles were relat-
ing conjunctivitis [24,26−28,30−33,35,37−41,44−54,56−61,63,64,66

The majority of studies have shown that airborne pollutants,
including O3, PM, NO2, SO2, and CO, could increase the risk of con-
junctivitis. In a 9-year Singapore study of 261,959 episodes of acute
conjunctivitis, Aik et al. [26] demonstrated that every 10 mg/m3
increase in PM2.5 and PM10 was associated with a 3.8 % and 2.9 %
cumulative increase in risk of conjunctivitis, respectively, during the
same and subsequent weeks. Similarly, other studies have reported a

proportional increase of conjunctivitis-related hospital visits with PM
exposure (1−3 % increase with every 10 mg/m3 increment in PM,
including PM1, PM2.5 and PM10) [89,93].Nevertheless, the association
between PM exposure and increased incidence of conjunctivitis was
not universally observed [56,59].
Airborne pollutants such as NO2, CO and CH4 have also been
shown to cause or exacerbate DED. A recent large-scale population-
based study of 177,307 participants revealed that CO, NO and CH4
exposures were associated with an increased risk of primary
Sjogren’s syndrome, which might be linked to the underlying
chronic inﬂammatory pathways such as interleukin-6 signalling
pathway [68]. Air pollutants have also shown to negatively impact on
ocular surface health, tear ﬁlm quality (including hyperosmolarity
and
secretion),
and
vision-related
quality
of
life
[24,31,33,52,58,60,70,74,88,153]. Two studies have suggested the
association between pterygium and PM2.5/PM10, though the effect of
O3, NO2 and SO2 on pterygium was equivocal [50,64]. While one
study observed an increased risk of keratitis (non-speciﬁed) with
PM10 exposure, [64] another study demonstrated a paradoxical pro-
tective effect of O3, PM10, PM10, NO2, and CO against microsporidial
keratoconjunctivitis, a type of parasitic ocular infection [46].
3.1.2. The effects of extremes of temperature and weather events
Several studies have revealed a positive association between DED,
tear
break-up
time
(TBUT)
and
increasing
temperature
[23,27,32,44,47,92]. Temperature’s impact on conjunctivitis cases has
also been observed, with temperature increments showing a positive
association with the number of conjunctivitis cases, including acute
hemorrhagic conjunctivitis [41,59,78]. Additionally, long-term expo-
sure to higher mean temperatures [47,56,67] and a dry climate
[47,67] has been linked to an increased prevalence or incidence of
allergic eye disease.
Lower humidity was associated with increasing DED cases
[39,44,56,69,104] while higher humidity was found to be associated
with an increased risk of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis and micro-
sporidia keratoconjunctivitis [47,91].
There is a notable rise in the occurrence of conjunctivitis and
other ocular surface infections during the rainy or monsoon season,
especially in regions with increased rainfall and ﬂoods [27,47]. India
exhibits a distinct temporal trend, where parasitic infections like
microsporidia keratoconjunctivitis peak during the monsoon season,
and an increase in rainfall is linked to a higher prevalence of such
cases [20]. In Pakistan, a case series highlights a strong correlation
between the emergence of microsporidia keratitis in patients and
their exposure to pooled water bodies after the monsoon season and
ﬂoods [69]. Additionally, a case series from Northeast Thailand
reports an outbreak of Pythium keratitis during the rainy season [87].
Moreover, ﬂoods have been associated with pink eye and conjuncti-
vitis in two cross-sectional studies [25,34] and hemorrhagic conjunc-
tivitis in one study [65].
The Asian dust storm is a meteorological phenomenon that occurs
when powerful winds lift substantial amounts of ﬁne dust and sand
particles from deserts and dry regions in East Asia. While Asian dust
storms are not directly caused by climate change, evidence suggests
that climate change might inﬂuence these storms, potentially exacer-
bating their frequency and intensity [154]. Researchers have investi-
gated the impact of Asian dust storms on the ocular surface in three
studies [42,62,75]. They found a notable increase in children’s con-
junctivitis with worsened allergic eye symptoms.
We have analyzed six studies that investigate the impact of sun-
light
and
ultraviolet
exposure
on
the
ocular
surface
[27,43,55,63,80,91]. Among these studies, three revealed a notable
positive correlation between sun or ultraviolet light exposure and
the occurrence of pterygium [43,55,63]. Additionally, we found one
cross-sectional prevalence survey that showed a higher self-reported
rate of dry eye disease (DED) after exposure to sunlight [27]. Higher
ambient ultraviolet exposure also appears to alter the biomechanical
properties of the cornea, causing lower corneal resistance [80].
3.2. Lens/Cataract
We included two cohort studies that associated potent climate
warming pollutants with the development of cataracts. A prospective
cohort study
found a statistically
signiﬁcant likelihood of
an
increased risk (5 %) of participants in United Kingdom (UK) Biobank
requiring cataract surgery when exposed to greater levels of PM2.5,
NO2 and (nitrogen oxides) NOX. [94] A similar study done in South
Korea also identiﬁed an increased risk of cataract development in
Korean adults aged 50 and older exposed to PM10, NO2 and SO2 [97].
Four articles [95,96,98,99] examined the effects of increasing tem-
perature and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) on the development of cata-
racts. An interesting cell culture experimental study published in
Japan revealed an increased secretion of Ab1−40 (amyloid b) in cata-
racts at 37.5 °C compared to 35.0 °C, suggesting high-temperature as
an important risk factor for cataract development.
3.3. Refractive error and visual impairment
Seven papers [101−107] included in this review explored the
association of climate change with refractive error and visual
impairment. Among these, ﬁve papers were associated with pollu-
tants, while the remaining two focused on the effects of increasing
heat and UVR.
One study involving 340,313 children without visual impairment
found a signiﬁcant 1.70 times risk of childhood visual impairment
with SO2 exposure and a 1.22 times risk of visual impairment with
CO exposure [101]. Another cross-sectional study conducted in Spain
with a cohort of 2727 school children aged 7−10 years old discovered
an increased likelihood of myopia with air pollution exposure at
school and home. The researchers propose that oxidative stress and

lack of dopamine release from retinal cells, which regulate axial
growth of the eye, could be a potential contributing factor [103]. Sim-
ilarly, PM2.5 and NOx have also been found to be associated with the
increased risk of myopia in children [106]. Additionally, Lin and col-
leagues identiﬁed that exposures to PM2.5 and O3 were signiﬁcant
risk factors for presbyopia among older adults. They also noted that
simultaneous exposure to high levels of these two pollutants could
amplify their individual effects [104].
Regarding UVR, a population-based cross-sectional study of 1218
children aged 7−9 in South Korea showed an inverse association
between myopia prevalence (deﬁned as spherical equivalent refrac-
tion < 1.5 D) and solar radiation as well as sunshine duration [102].
Similarly, the Western Australian Raine Cohort Study, which included
1344 subjects aged 19−22, found a negative link between outdoor
activity and myopia [105]. Both studies found beneﬁcial effects of
outdoor activities in slowing myopia progression.
3.4. Glaucoma
3.4.1. Pollutants
Seven studies [108−114] explored the relationship between air
pollutants and glaucoma. In a large UK Biobank study involving
64,117 participants, higher exposure to ambient PM2.5 was associated
with increased odds of self-reported glaucoma and a thinner ganglion
cell-inner plexiform layer [108]. Exposure to PM2.5 was linked to
increased risk of NTG (normotensive glaucoma) compared to primary
open-angle glaucoma (POAG) in another case-control study in Tai-
wan [112]. Increased odds of outpatient visits for acute glaucoma fol-
lowing exposure to air pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and CO
were also found [113]. Additionally, a large cohort study in South
Korea reported increases in 1 mg/m3 of PM10 to be associated with
increased hazard ratios for childhood glaucoma with greater effect of
cumulative long-term exposure [114].
Most studies reported that pollutant-induced oxidative stress,
neuroinﬂammation, and hypercoagulability causing retinal ganglion
cell death were the cause of increased glaucoma risk rather than IOP
rise [108,110,112−114]. Other studies reported trabecular meshwork
cell damage and subsequent IOP rise following particulate matter-
induced mechanical and oxidative stress as the proposed mechanism
of glaucoma development [109,113].
3.4.2. The effects of extremes of temperature and weather events
The Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study Group observed signiﬁ-
cantly higher visual ﬁeld sensitivity in winter than in summer. This
effect on sensitivity was greater in regions with extreme seasonal
variations in climate. They also found an intra-ocular pressure vari-
ability to be 0.27mmhg with IOP peaking in winter months. These cli-
mate-induced effects on visual ﬁeld measurements and IOP could
signiﬁcantly impact glaucoma management and detection [115].
In a recent large cross-sectional study from the REG-China popu-
lation, researchers also found an increased prevalence of glaucoma,
primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) and POAG in participants
with greater exposure to heatwaves and cold spells during a 10-year
period. [116] A cohort study investigating the relationship between
acute angle closure attacks and monsoons observed a signiﬁcant pos-
itive correlation between acute angle closure cases and the mean
number of rainy days, amount of rain, cloud cover, and 24 h mean
humidity. These factors may induce pupillary block in susceptible
patients [117].
Interestingly, a large cross-sectional study from the KNHANES
(Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) observed
a marginal increase in the frequency of pseudoexfoliation syndrome
among participants exposed to sun ≥5 h/day (p = 0.064) [118].
3.5. Lids and ocular adnexa
3.5.1. Pollutants
A study showed association of PM2.5 with diseases of the eye and
adnexa, indicating a 2.83 % increase in hospitalizations for these con-
ditions [119]. The acute clinical signs of posterior blepharitis, includ-
ing eyelid debris and increased meibomian gland (MG) secretion,
were found to be correlated with combustion-derived pollutants
from vehicular emissions, such as PM10, NO2, and CO [120]. Partici-
pants residing in an oil production zone exhibited more frequent and
severe signs of MG dysfunction, including eyelid neovascularization,
MG plugging, MG secretion, and MG loss. Lower temperature, higher
O3, and elevated SO2 levels were believed to contribute to the block-
age of meibomian gland oriﬁces [121].
3.5.2. The effects of extremes of temperature and weather events
In a study concerning climate change hazards, Inokuma et al.
documented a remarkable occurrence of two consecutive cases of
cutaneous sporotrichosis infection affecting the eyelid in Hokkaido,
Japan. The researchers linked this unusual incidence to the rising
global temperatures [122]. A case series documented an unusual
surge in rhino-orbital mucormycosis cases (4 cases in 1 month) dur-
ing the month following extensive ﬂooding due to record-breaking
rainfall in the Denver-Boulder metropolitan area [124]. In a molecular
analysis on periocular carcinoma specimens, TERT promoter muta-
tions occurred more frequently in periocular basal cell carcinomas
(82 %) and squamous cell carcinomas (52 %) indicating the signiﬁ-
cance of UV radiation exposure in the development of these tumors
[125].
3.6. Ocular trauma
In a study by French et al., higher odds of both traumatic and non-
traumatic ocular hospitalizations were associated with social deter-
minants of health, such as air pollution and severe housing problems
[126].
3.7. Non-glaucomatous optic neuropathies
Extreme weather events in developing nations have been docu-
mented to result in food insecurity, leading to nutritional diseases
like night blindness [127]. In a cross-sectional study conducted in
Somalia, 105 cases of epidemic optic neuropathy were examined,
and over half of these cases were found to be associated with weight
loss. Furthermore, among women of breastfeeding age (31 individu-
als), more than 50 % reported the onset of optic neuropathy coincid-
ing with lactation initiation, suggesting that nutritional deﬁciency
may be the underlying cause of optic neuropathy in these cases
[128].
3.8. Retina and uveitis
3.8.1. Pollutants
We included several articles which studied the effects of climate
warming pollutants with the development of vascular retinal dis-
eases. Authors have found that the risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR)
increases with increase in ambient air pollutants [133−135]. Occur-
rence of central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) increases in patients
with hypertension and ages above 65 years immediately following
elevated SO2 levels, however there is no relation with other air pollu-
tants, including PM2.5, PM10, and O3 [136]. Retinal vein occlusion
(RVO) has been seen to be associated with long-term exposure to air-
borne hydrocarbons, including volatile organic compounds [137].
Suspended particulate matter and air pollution can affect the

immune system and lead to increase in cases of uveitis [146,147].
Retinal thickness analyses from tissue samples from the UK Biobank
showed that participants exposed to higher atmospheric PM2.5 and
NOx had altered retinal structure [139]. Moreover, such participants
may also have increased rates of overt age-related macular degenera-
tion (AMD) [138].
3.8.2. The effects of extremes of temperature and weather events
One study found that patients who are exposed to dust storms
under the age of 50 are at higher risk of developing dry AMD [140].
Five articles [129−132,145] studied the effects of atmospheric tem-
perature on retinal diseases, of which four found a positive associa-
tion between ambient temperature and rhegmatogenous retinal
detachment (RRD) rates. This potential increase in RRD rates has
been postulated to occur due to changes in chorioretinal adhesion
and liquefaction of the vitreous. Similarly, the risk of tractional retinal
detachment (TRD) was also found to be positively correlated with
high ambient temperature [132].
Rising temperatures and climatic variability of temperature may
also be associated with increased risk of uveitis, as seen in two stud-
ies [143,144]. With every degree (Celsius) of temperature change,
there may be a rise of two uveitis cases per 1000 persons, with the
highest increase in cases of non-infectious uveitis. Increased rainfall
has been associated with reactivation of toxoplasma retinitis, espe-
cially during the second and fourth quarters of the year, notably dur-
ing the El Nino phenomenon [145].
4. Discussion
Climate change continues to be the single biggest health threat
confronting humanity [155]. According to the World Health Organi-
zation (WHO), climate change and related hazards are expected to
cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year by 2030,
with associated health damage costs reaching USD 2−4 billion annu-
ally [156]. While middle to high-income countries are among the
highest greenhouse gas emitters per capita [157], the most vulnera-
ble groups to the climate crisis are those who contribute the least to
its cause. This includes individuals in low-income countries, disad-
vantaged populations, vulnerable communities in middle- and high-
income countries, and those who lack the means to protect them-
selves from its adverse effects [156−158].
In this review, a substantial amount of literature has been discov-
ered in relation to eye disease and condition, shedding light on the
impact of climate change, climate-related hazards (such as ﬂoods and
storms), and climate warming pollutants on eye health. While the
majority of the literature concentrates on the cornea, conjunctiva,
and the ocular surface, it also points to the involvement of other parts
of the eye as described in the respective sections above. Evidence
supports the link between these impacts and several ocular condi-
tions, encompassing glaucoma, non-glaucomatous optic neuropa-
thies, periocular tumors, retinal vascular conditions, refractive errors
and even ocular inﬂammation. Maintaining homeostasis is essential
for ensuring the eye functions at its best, and any external factor,
such as climate change, can inﬂuence its performance. It’s well-estab-
lished that changes in the eye can often serve as an early indicator
before systemic signs and symptoms of disease become apparent.
Chronic medical and vascular conditions frequently manifest them-
selves through ocular symptoms [159]. It is therefore vital for future
research to look at the impact of climate change and every aspect of
eye health and study the pathophysiology of each condition such as
aqueous production and risk of glaucoma, microvascular diseases
and risk of retinal vascular occlusions, ocular immunity and host
defenses and the risk of ocular infections, rates of vitreous liquefac-
tion in warmer climates and the risks of retinal detachments. It
would also be interesting for future research to include climatic vari-
ables on the use of intraocular gas tamponade and the outcomes of
retinal detachment surgeries or even corneal endothelial transplant
surgeries.
Geographically, there is an evident disparity in the publication of
literature on this topic, with high-income countries accounting for
50 % of the publications, while low-income countries contribute only
9 % (Fig. 4). This imbalance could be attributed to limited access to
medical and academic literature, lack of mentorship and research
leadership, inadequate ﬁnancial and material resources, competing
work demands, and the high publication costs associated with presti-
gious global health journals [160].
We note that 71/130 (55 %) of the articles included were related to
climate warming pollutants. While greenhouse gases (e.g., CH4) [161]
trap heat in the atmosphere, particulate matter (e.g., PM2.5 and PM10)
contributes to climate change in various ways. Speciﬁcally, it can
inﬂuence cloud formation, leading to taller clouds, increased rainfall,
lightning, and thunderstorms [162]. Light-coloured particles like sul-
phates and nitrates reﬂect sunlight away from the Earth, thereby
cooling it, whereas dark particles like black carbon absorb heat,
which accelerates the melting of Arctic ice [163].
Through this scoping review, we observe that China, Taiwan, and
South Korea (Fig. 2) are the primary contributors of literature on this
topic. Notably, these countries have exceeded the WHO’s recom-
mended levels for PM2.5 pollutant concentration, as reported in the
World Air Quality report [164]. It appears that researchers from these
countries may be witnessing the real-time impact of climate change,
which motivates them to conduct research to establish associations.
Interestingly, there are limited articles on this topic from countries
that have exceeded safe pollution levels by tenfold, such as Chad,
Iraq, Pakistan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Kuwait, and India [164]. Global
collaborations in research studies examining the impacts of climate
change on ocular health, and health in general, in these countries
could provide further insights into this association [165].
In our scoping review, we identiﬁed articles that demonstrate a
protective inﬂuence of outdoor activities in slowing the progression
of myopia. A review by Lingham and colleagues showed that spend-
ing time outdoors can prevent myopia through various mechanisms,
with higher illuminance being the most supported theory. Impor-
tantly, UVR exposure is not crucial for myopia prevention, therefore
outdoor activities should be coupled with the use of sunglasses and
skin protection to avoid the harmful effects of UVR. [166]
Despite encountering a substantial number of articles address-
ing nutritional deﬁciencies and their connection to ocular pathol-
ogies in high-risk countries, most of these articles were not
included in our study. The reason for their exclusion was the
absence of any mention of climate change or climate change-
related hazards, such as drought, as these were the speciﬁc crite-
ria for inclusion in our research.
5. Limitations
Limitations of the research include English language bias, result-
ing in the exclusion of relevant studies, particularly in developing
countries where climate change impacts may be signiﬁcant. Ocular
diseases related to droughts and ﬂoods may be underrepresented in
the study. Future research should consider including multilingual
search strategies or collaborating with researchers who can under-
stand and translate published articles in other languages leading to
an unbiased representation of the available sources of evidence.
The exclusion of certain study types such as reviews, editorials,
conference abstracts and commentaries may result in the omission of
valuable insights and interpretations of existing research. To improve
the study and mitigate these limitations and biases, future research
in this area should consider conducting a more comprehensive
search, including gray literature and unpublished studies, to reduce
publication bias. In the near future, there may be potential for the use
of artiﬁcial intelligence, such as ChatGPT and other Large Language

Models (LLMs), to efﬁciently conduct research, including literature-
related tasks. However, it’s important to note that the ﬁeld is still in
its early stages and necessitates signiﬁcant development, exploration,
and validation for these applications [167,168].
6. Conclusion
This review clearly demonstrates that there are multiple effects of
climate change on ocular health. While there is an upward trend in
publications exploring this association, disparities remain, with
higher-income countries contributing a greater number of papers. To
gain further insights into the unseen effects of climate change on ocu-
lar health, global collaborations between high-income and low-
income countries are essential. Moreover, it is crucial to focus on
other climate change variables, particularly extreme weather events,
shifts in ambient temperature, and nutrition deﬁciencies related to
drought. While the ocular surface appears to be signiﬁcantly affected
by climate change, understanding the impacts on other parts of the
human eye is vital, considering the eye’s association with multiple
systemic conditions. Addressing the climate crisis necessitates a col-
laborative approach involving clinicians, academic researchers, public
health ofﬁcials, and policymakers. By working together, they can
effectively recognize and minimize the consequences of climate
change on ocular health and overall well-being in the long run.
