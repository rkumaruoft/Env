Abstract
This study aims to explore social bots' role in online climate change discussions. By analyzing 491,279 climate-change-related tweets, we
found that social bots were actively engaged in climate change discussions on Twitter and contributed up to 1.5.4% of related contents. Bots
promote the saliency of energy, climate actions and climate strikes on public agenda. 83.1% of tweets posted by social bots support climate
change activism, and 16.9% support climate change skepticism. However, social bot skeptics are more strategical than social bot activists in
terms of launching conversations with opposing-minded humans, and avoiding ampliﬁcation of opposing voices. They are also more successful
in inciting opposing-minded humans' initiative conversation and like-minded humans' ampliﬁcation. Based on the above ﬁndings, we suggest
cultivating individuals’ media literacy in terms of distinguishing malicious social bots as a potential solution to deal with social bot skeptics
disguised as humans, as well as making use of benign social bots for science popularization.
Keywords: Climate change; Social media; Social bots; Climate skeptics
1. Introduction
Although scientists have achieved consensus on human-
caused global climate change (Anderegg et al., 2010), dual-
istic climate debates indicated intense disagreements between
climate change activists and skeptics (Hobson and Niemeyer,
2013). Climate activists recognize the fact of climate change
and believe that it is necessary to mitigate climate change as it
triggers a series of serious biological and social sequences.
While driven by demographics, environmental factors and
political beliefs, climate skeptics tend to show uncertainty
about
climate
change
facts
and
humans’
contributions
(Whitmarsh, 2011).
Social media have become a new battleground for climate
change discussions (Boussalis and Coan, 2016), where several
climate denial discourses are prevalent (Jacques and Knox,
2016). Multiple forces are actively engaged in online climate
debates for the purpose of shaping public understanding of
climate science (Sharman and Howarth, 2017). Climate sci-
entists publicly raise their voices in climate debates as active
communicators, information interpreters, and opinion makers
(Newman, 2016; Walter et al., 2018, 2019). Whereas delib-
erate and organized efforts of climate skepticism strategically
undermine climate science by building echo chambers and
pretending as credible scientiﬁc resources (Bloomﬁeld and
Tillery, 2019).
With the development of artiﬁcial intelligence technology,
established studies have found social bots are used to inﬂuence
online public opinion (Subrahmanian et al., 2016; Varol et al.,
2017; Wojcik, 2018). Social bots are accounts controlled,
entirely or in part, by software (Ferrara et al., 2016), which are

always created in batches and programmed to publish exces-
sive amounts of contents continuously (Howard et al., 2016).
They may disguise as humans by automatically sending
friendship requests, sharing and liking contents (Boshmaf
et al., 2011; Echeverria et al., 2017). Social bots can suc-
cessfully distort public discussions by manufacturing fake
support (Howard and Kollanyi, 2016) or inﬂating misinfor-
mation on social media (Shao et al., 2018).
Social bots' participation in climate change discussions have
been noted in previous studies. In the 2016 U.S. presidential
election, the volume of climate change tweets far surpassed that
of other scientiﬁc topics in the dataset of Russian Internet
Research Agency (Strudwicke and Grant, 2020). Social bots
were disproportionately used for supporting President Donald
Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in 2017
(Marlow et al., 2020). However, as social bots' prosperity in
politics have been widely recognized in political communica-
tion studies (Ferrara, 2017; Howard and Kollanyi, 2016; Shao
et al., 2018), it's hard to decide their participation in politic-
related climate change events is a result of interest in politic
topics or climate topics. Social bots' participation in regular
climate change discussions have not been explored. Whether
and how social bots have been used to shape public under-
standing of climate issues remains unknown.
Earlier studies have explored social bots’ participation in
many other scientiﬁc topics. Social bots are found to sow the
seeds of anti-vaccine sentiment in vaccination debates (Yuan
et al., 2019), propagate e-cigarettes as helpful cessation de-
vices (Broniatowski et al., 2018), amplify human sentiments in
Covid-19 pandemic (Shi et al., 2020b), as well as suggest the
medical use of cannabis (Allem et al., 2020). The tweeting
frequency of social bots overwhelms that of average users
(Yuan et al., 2019). One of their another strategies is to
amplify the voices of both sides to manufacture misleading
equivalency and undermine public consensus on scientiﬁc
facts (Broniatowski et al., 2018). But the discussion above
does not indicate that the existence of social bots is purely
malicious. Some social bots are designed to help science
popularization. For instance, some scientists have developed
benign social bots for individualized anti-tobacco health
intervention (Deb et al., 2018), which is proved effective in
raising public health awareness.
Social bots' participations in climate change discussion
have been ignored. As more and more studies use social media
data as sensors to capture public opinions towards climate
change (Ghermandi and Sinclair, 2019), it remains to be
examined to what extent social media contents can represent
real human opinions. Besides, although climate scientists have
noted deliberate and organized efforts were made to manipu-
late public attitudes towards climate change (Bloomﬁeld and
Tillery, 2019), social bots were hardly addressed as a novel
kind of manipulation strategy in AI era. The neglect of social
bots' role in climate change debates may lead to potential risks
in terms of climate communication researches and practice.
We tried to bridge the above research gap from the following
aspects, which may help understand social bots' inﬂuence on
public climate change discussions. Firstly, we measured the
extent to which social bots are engaged in online climate
change discussions and analyze their intentions. Secondly, we
conduct content analysis to ﬁgure out social bots’ sub-topic
preference and attitudes (skeptics or activists) in climate
change discussions. Thirdly, we characterized the inﬁltration
strategy of social bots by measuring their interaction behav-
iors. Although the current Twitter mechanism makes it difﬁ-
cult for us to know the behind-the-scenes manipulators of
social bots, characterizing social bots' behavioral logic can
make their intentions clearer and assist climate communicators
to formulate more efﬁcient communication strategies. To be
speciﬁc, the following questions are addressed.
RQ1a: How much of different kinds of contents (original
tweets, retweets, quotes, replies) is published by social bots in
climate change discussions on Twitter?
RQ1b: What are the major motivations of social bots ac-
cording to their self-disclosed user proﬁles?
RQ2a: What sub-topics do social bots prefer in climate
change discussions?
RQ2b: What's the standpoint of social bots? To be speciﬁc,
how many of them are climate change activists and sceptics,
respectively?
RQ3a: How do social bots with different standpoints
(activism and scepticism) interact (retweet, quote, reply and
mentions) with humans?
RQ3b: How do humans with different standpoints (activism
and scepticism) interact (retweet, quote, reply and mentions)
with social bots?
Compared with earlier studies, this study shows two
distinct characteristics. To be ﬁrst, we focus on regular climate
change discussions rather than major political related climate
change events on Twitter, allowing us to explore how social
bots shape public understanding in daily discourse, which was
ubiquitous but overlooked in previous studies. Moreover, this
study provides a systemic examination of social bots' behavior,
which includes both contents analysis and interaction analysis.
Our ﬁndings may not only reveal social bots’ strategy of
skewing public opinions, but also give hints about how to
make use of benign social bots and deal with anti-science
social bots to improve public awareness of climate change.
2. Data and methods
2.1. Data collection
Twitter users usually anchor their tweets to speciﬁc topics
with hashtags, providing other users with beacons to follow this
topic and take part in public discussions (Small, 2011).
Following previous studies (Holmberg and Hellsten, 2015;
Pearce et al., 2019; Williams et al., 2015), we chose #clima-
techange, #globalwarming, and #agw (short for anthropogenic
global warming) to identify English-language tweets concern-
ing global climate change with Twitter Standard Search API.
We mainly consider two principles when setting the data
collection period. Firstly, different from previous studies
which focused on social bots' engagement in political-related
climate change discussions, this study aimed at investigating
914
CHEN C.-F. et al. / Advances in Climate Change Research 12 (2021) 913e923
social bots' role in regular climate change discussions. No
major domestic political events (such as the United States’
withdrawal from Paris Agreement) or international political
events (such as COP) are expected to take place during the
data collection period. Secondly, as Twitter regularly detects
and suspends social bot accounts, we did not set the study
period too long to avoid the probable bias. When the above
two conditions are met, we follow (Williams et al., 2015) to
use convenience sampling and chose 7 January 2020 as the
start date and 27 January 2020 as end date.
2.2. Social bot detection
Following previous studies (Badawy et al., 2018; Badawy
et al., 2019; Ferrara, 2017; Luceri et al., 2019b; Shao et al.,
2018), we used the Botometer (formerly BotOrNot), a pro-
gram developed by Indiana University to estimate the chances
that an account is a bot. Based on machine learning algo-
rithms, Botometer returns a bot-likelihood score (bot score)
for the targeted account. The bot score is calculated based on
network, user, friend, temporal, content, and sentiment fea-
tures of accounts (Davis et al., 2016). The closer the bot score
is to 1, the higher the probability that the account is a robot;
the closer the bot score is to 0, there is a higher probability that
the account belongs to humans. Although some study suggests
that an account can be suspected as a bot if its bot score ex-
ceeds 0.3 (Luceri et al., 2019b), we followed most of previous
studies (Badawy et al., 2018, 2019; Ferrara, 2017; Shao et al.,
2018) and labeled accounts with bot score greater than 0.5 as
social bots and bot score less than 0.5 as humans. Botometer
may fail to give bot score of accounts due to various reasons,
such as authorization problems, account suspensions, and lack
of tweets for analysis. The identities of these above accounts
were documented as ‘unknown’. Unknown users accounted
2.23% of all users and contributed to 2.39% of all the tweets.
These accounts were excluded from further analysis.
We collected 491,279 tweets, among which 446,166 tweets
contain #climatechange, 32,619 contain #globalwarming and
867 contain #agw. We randomly sampled 100 tweets in our
dataset and ﬁnd 97% of them are related to climate change,
suggesting that our dataset is suitable for analysis of climate
change discussions. One noticeable feature of our data was
that the ongoing Australia bushﬁre since July 2019 attracted
lots of attention during the period of data collection, and was
mentioned in 20% of the sampled tweets as a probable climate
emergency.
3. Results
3.1. Basic statistics
3.1.1. Social bots’ contributions to climate discussions on
Twitter
These 491,279 tweets collected can be classiﬁed into
84,336 original tweets, 366,080 retweets, 18,125 quotes, and
23,518 replies (the quotes and the replies intersect). 31,227
social bots, 201,546 humans, and 5267 unknown users
contributed to these tweets, among which social bots pub-
lished a total of 15.4% of the tweets (see Table 1). 20.5% of
the original tweets are attributed to social bots. Comparatively,
social bots are not actively engaged in retweeting (14.9%),
quoting (9.4%) and replying (9.8%). Although the volume of
retweets overwhelms that of original tweets for both social
bots and humans, compared with humans, social bots show
stronger preference for original tweets rather than retweets.
Fig. 1a shows bot score distribution of tweets containing
any of the three hashtags. Generally speaking, #global-
warming are the most contributed by social bots (21.4%) and
hashtag #climatechange are the least (15.6%) contributed.
Previous studies noted that, although global warming and
climate change are always used interchangeably, they have
slightly different connotations (Shi et al., 2020b). Global
warming emphasizes more on the temperature rise on the
Earth surface and its human causes (Whitmarsh, 2009).
Compared with climate change, global warming is more likely
to be associated with hoax frames and preferred by those who
question climate change facts (Jang and Hart, 2015), because
it's easy for skeptics to ﬁnd cues like snowstorms and
extremely cold weather to challenge temperature rise facts
(Schuldt and Roh, 2014). Social bots' preference of #global-
warming may indicate that social bots intentionally target at
scientiﬁc uncertainties. Social bots' preference of #global-
warming may indicate that social bots intentionally target at
scientiﬁc uncertainties. Fig. 1b displays the proportion of
humans and social bots in all users, 100 the most active au-
thors (high frequency of publishing tweets) and 100 the most
inﬂuential (high frequency for getting retweeted) authors,
respectively. Compared with the general population, active
users consist of higher proportion of social bots, but the
composition of most inﬂuential users does not show apparent
differences. Notably, in our dataset, tweets posted by social
bots were retweeted 735.5 times on average, and tweets posted
by humans were retweeted 1131.0 times on average, indicating
although social bots have equivalent chances as humans to be
ranked in the top 100 most retweeted users, they are overall
less capable of triggering retweet.
3.1.2. Social bots’ self-disclosed intentions
Twitter allows users to customize a ‘self-introduction’
within 160 characters for identity disclosure. Text, emoticons,
symbols, hyperlinks, and hashtags can all be used in the de-
scriptions. Customizing social media proﬁle is a process of
users' online identity construction and expression (Ahn, 2011),

and thus previous studies regard self-disclosed proﬁles on
social media as users' self-identity awareness (Tufekci, 2008).
We took self-introductions for computational linguistic anal-
ysis. It cannot be guaranteed that the statements in the proﬁle
reﬂects the real intent of the account, but these results are
proper tools to observe users' self-disclosed intentions. n-gram
analysis (n ¼ 2) is used to extract the contiguous sequence of
words in user proﬁles. This study uses two methods to obtain
high-frequency word sequences in social bots' and humans'
proﬁles. With the ﬁrst method, each user's weight is the same,
that is, each user's description is calculated only once, and this
result is recorded as the ‘unweighted’ result. With the second
method, we weighted user proﬁles with the number of tweets
the user posted in our dataset, where users who post more
tweets are higher weighted. Results acquired with the second
method is recorded as the ‘weighted’ result. Unweighted and
weighted results are shown in Table 2, and non-English words
have been excluded.
Several top patterns in unweighted social bots' proﬁles
showed apparent support for the U.S. President Donald Trump
by frequently mentioning maga (short for Make America
Great Again, Trump's motto in 2016) and kag (short for Keep
America Great, Trump's new motto in 2020). Additionally,
some social bots took reciprocal strategy by promising to
‘follow back’ users who follow them in their proﬁles, which is
in accordance with earlier ﬁndings (Ferrara, 2017). Compar-
atively, for top patterns in weighted social bots' proﬁles, the
support for Trump was not that apparent. Phrases about en-
ergy, environment, and weather are ranked high, indicating
users with these descriptions posted massive amounts of
tweets. Words starting with ‘http’ (referring to hyperlinks) are
salient in weighted results of social bots, suggesting active
social bots' efforts of persuading users to visit certain hyper-
links. Interestingly, some suspected social bots use family-
related words such as married, husband, father in their pro-
ﬁles, suggesting they may publish contents in disguise of
humans.
Unweighted results help to understand what kind of ac-
count has an advantage in number, whereas weighted results
can reveal what kind of account has an advantage in tweeting
volume. The difference in the unweighted and weighted
proﬁles of bots revealed that a large number of social bots
showed pro-Trump standpoints in proﬁles, but social bots who
declared to have particular interest in energy, environment,
and weather are more productive in climate change related
discussions. This result showed that many users discussing
climate change topics might be political social bots, who
probably hold similar standpoints with Trump. However, these
political bots have no advantage in terms of tweeting volume
when compared to climate social bots with speciﬁc interest in
energy and environment issues. The role of these social bots in
daily climate discussions might be under-estimated in previous
studies about social bots in politics-related climate discus-
sions. Humans’ typical proﬁles have different characteristics
and show more about concern for human rights, animals, and
social values.
3.2. Content analysis
3.2.1. Social bots’ topic preference
Hashtags are widely used to anchor the topic of tweets on
Twitter (Small, 2011). By counting the hashtags adopted by
users, we investigated whether social bots tried to amplify
speciﬁc sub-topics. Table 3 shows the top 20 hashtags used by
social bots and humans, respectively. Following (Arlt et al.,
2019), we calculated the relative popularity of hashtag h
among social bots and humans as follows.
Ph relative ¼logð Fh bot
Fmax bot

Fh human
Fmax human
Þ
ð1Þ
Firstly, we grouped the tweets into social bot dataset
(n ¼ 75, 649) and human dataset (n ¼ 403, 902) according to
the identity of authors. Fh bot is the frequency of hashtag h in
social bot dataset. Fmax bot is the frequency of the most popular
hashtag in social bot dataset.
Fh

Fmax
bot refers to hashtag h's
relative frequency in social bot dataset. Similarly,

refers to hashtag h's relative frequency in human dataset. The
ratio of above two values refer to the hashtag's relative
popularity in two datasets. Log-transformation of the ratio can
make the results distributed on both sides of the Y-axis. Re-
sults greater than 0 indicated that the hashtags were more
frequently represented by humans, and results smaller than
Fig. 1. Bot score distribution for tweets containing #climatechange, #globalwarming, and #agw (a), and (b) bot and human composition of all users, 100 most
inﬂuential users, and 100 most active users.
916
CHEN C.-F. et al. / Advances in Climate Change Research 12 (2021) 913e923
0 indicated that hashtags were more likely to appear in social
bots' discourse. The top 20 hashtags in either of the two
datasets were selected for visualization in Fig. 2.
As shown in Fig. 2, hashtags about energy, such as
#renewableenergy, #energy were more salient in social bots’
discourse. Social bots were also found to popularize hashtags
about climate actions (#actonclimate and #climateaction) and
climate strikes (#climatestrike and #gretathunberg). They also
tend to use hashtags arguing the urgency of climate issues, such
as #climatecrisis, #climateemergency and #climatechangeisreal.
Although Australia bushﬁre's associations with anthropo-
genic climate change remains examinations (van Oldenborgh
et al., 2020), hashtags about wild life and Australia bushﬁres
were more salient in the human dataset. Humans were also
more likely to talk about #disney, #rupertmurdoch, and
#20thcenturyfox, which are used for criticizing climate skep-
ticism standpoints of Rupert Murdoch. Humans' timely
response to climate change emergency may be a feature to
distinguish social bots and humans.
3.2.2. Social bots: climate change activists or skeptics?
Cimate activists and climate skeptics have long been two
opposing sides in climate debates (Bloomﬁeld and Tillery,
2019). In this part, we examined to what extent these two
standpoints are supported by social bots and humans.
Following previous studies (Guo et al., 2020; Schmid-Petri
et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2019), we used Support Vector
Machine (SVM; Joachims, 1998), a well-established super-
vised machine learning algorithm to classify the standpoints
of tweets. We regarded tweets questioning climate change
facts as climate change skepticism, and tweets recognizing
the fact of climate change or appealing for climate actions as
climate change activism (Williams et al., 2015). Two human
coders were trained to manually distinguish these two
standpoints. We used Cohen's kappa to recalculate the inter-
coder reliability, which refers to the agreement between
two raters when they decide the category of items. The value
range of this Cohen's kappa is between 1 and 1. In our case,
Cohen's kappa is 0.65, which means the inter-coder reliability
is rather strong. Then we used 2800 skepticism tweets and
2800 activism tweets labelled manually by two coders as
training dataset of SVM model. Another 197 randomly
selected tweets were used for model validation. The accuracy
rate of our SVM model turned out to be 88.8%, a ﬁne per-
formance compared with that of earlier studies (Guo et al.,
2020; Schmid-Petri et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2019), which
means it's a qualiﬁed text classiﬁer and can be used for the
following large scale text processing. The rest of the tweets in
our dataset were used as test dataset and their climate change
attitudes are calculated by the well-trained SVM model.
SVM results showed that, for tweets posted by social bots,
83.1% were classiﬁed as climate activisms, and 16.9% were
classiﬁed as skepticism. As for tweets posted by humans,
81.8% were identiﬁed as climate activism, and 18.2% were
skepticism.
Following previous studies (Guo et al., 2020; Williams
et al., 2015), we further inferred the stances of users based
on the standpoints of their tweets. For each account, we

calculated how much of its tweets support climate change
activism. For example, if 8 out of 10 tweets posted by a certain
account support climate change activism, the activism tweet
proportion is 0.8. The distribution of activism tweet proportion
for bots and humans is shown in Fig. 3. For most users, they
show persistent climate change attitude, either activism or
skepticism, amongst their tweets, which also conﬁrms the
accuracy of SVM standpoint classiﬁcation. Whereas a small
amount of users’ activism tweet proportions is around 0.5,
suggesting hesitation or neutral standpoints. In further anal-
ysis, users whose activism tweet proportion is no less than 0.6
were documented as a climate change activist, and users with
activism tweet proportion no greater than 0.4 were labeled as
climate change skeptics. The standpoints of the rest of users
were regarded as unclear and excluded from further analysis.
Finally, 69.9% of social bots were identiﬁed as climate change
activists, 14.4% were skeptics, and the rest did not have clear
standpoints. 68.4% of humans were identiﬁed as activists, and
13.6% were identiﬁed as skeptics. Climate change activists
dominated both humans and social bots.

3.3. Interaction analysis
Following the previous studies (Luceri et al., 2019a; Stella
et al., 2018), we examined how social bots and humans with
different standpoints interacted with each other. There were
mainly four kinds of interaction networks on Twitter1 1)
Retweet network, which describes the ﬂow of information
through the retweet function on Twitter. In this network, if
there is an edge from node A to node B, it indicates that user A
interact with user B by retweeting. 2) Quote network, which is
similar to retweet network but it allows users to add supple-
ments or comments to the original tweet. The edge from node
A to node B indicates that user A interact with user B by
spreading the message and adding some new contents at the
same time. 3) Reply network, which is used to describe the
relationship of users in conversations. The edge from node A
to node B indicates that user A replied to user B. 4) Mention
network, which is used to describe the situations one user
mentions another user with @. The edge from node A to node
B indicates that user A mentioned B for purposes like drawing
attention. The above four networks are all directed networks.
Based on the four interaction networks mentioned above,
we conducted chi-square analysis of interaction types and
botehuman interactions (in Table 4), interaction types and
humanebot interactions (in Table 5).
As seen in Table 4, although mentions and retweets are
dominant types for botehuman interactions, their proportions
vary according to the standpoints of both sides.
Comparing interaction compositions between like-minded
entities and opposing minded entities, we found quotes and
replies are more preferred in the latter situation. For instance,
for the interactions between social bot skeptics and human
skeptics, the proportion of reply is 0.005, which is signiﬁ-
cantly lower than that (0.070) between social bot skeptics and
human activists. This ﬁnding may indicate social bots’
attempts to start conversations with opposing-minded people.
In contrast, social bot skeptics strategically conduct less pro-
portion of retweets when interacting with counterpart humans
(0.184) than with like-minded humans (0.377), indicating they
are comparatively reluctant to spread opposing voices.
Another note is that social bot activists and social bot
skeptics have slight differences in terms of their strategies
towards humans with different opinions. Social bot skeptics
show disproportionate higher interest (0.733) than social bot
activists (0.574) in mentioning humans, which tells us that
mentions may serve as a provocative strategy for social bot
skeptics to manufacture debates or increase exposure. More-
over, in this situation, the proportion of replies is signiﬁcantly
higher (0.07 vs. 0.018) and retweets is smaller (0.184 vs.
0.396) for social bot skeptics, referring to higher probability of
conversations
and
smaller
probability
of
ampliﬁcations
respectively. These ﬁndings suggest that social bot skeptics are
more strategical than social bot activists when encountering
with opposing opinions.
According to Table 5, some humans interact with social
bots, conﬁrming social bots' capability of triggering humans'
active interactions. It is worthy of noticing that, humans' ac-
tivists mention and reply to opposing-minded social bots
proactively, but they are unwilling to retweet from these social
bots. The above ﬁndings suggest that although social bots
cannot effectively attract opposing-minded humans to retweet,
they are deceptive enough that humans tend to start conver-
sations, where debates probably take place. Moreover, both
social bot activists and social bot skeptics trigger higher pro-
portion of retweet from like-minded humans (0.464 and 0.381)
than from opposing-minded humans (0.390 and 0.286), sug-
gesting humans’ relative preference to tweeting rises when
faced with like-minded social bots.
Besides, we examined how many of the humans were once
affected by bots in the interaction networks (Table 6). We ﬁrst
calculated the total number of human users in each network,
and then obtained the number of human users who were
successors of bots in graphs. By dividing the number of suc-
cessors by the total number of human users in the network, we
obtained the proportion of human users directly affected by the
social bots in each kind of interaction. Humans in retweet and
mention network were more likely to be successors of social
bots. Speciﬁcally speaking, 18.7% of the users in the retweet
network had retweeted from social bots, indicating that social
bots promote certain information and contribute to a fake
climate of opinions. Few humans once quoted or replied to
social bots, suggesting social bots are not successful in trig-
gering conversations.
4. Discussion
By analyzing 491,279 climate change related tweets posted
between 7 January 2020 and 27 January 2020, we found that
social bots were actively engaged in climate change discus-
sions on Twitter and contributed up to 15.4% of contents. Bots
promote the saliency of energy, climate actions and climate
strikes on public agenda. 83.1% of tweets posted by social

bots support climate change activism, and 16.9% support
climate change skepticism. However, social bot skeptics are
more strategical than social bot activists in terms of launching
conversations with opposing-minded humans, and avoiding
ampliﬁcation of opposing voices. Social bot skeptics can also
successfully trigger debates from opposing-minded humans
and ampliﬁcation of like-minded humans.
For future researches using social media climate change
discussions as a substitute of polls, our results suggest that
contents published by social bots should be identiﬁed and
analyzed speciﬁcally. Suspected social bots were responsible
for up to 15.4% of contents in climate change discussions on
Twitter, suggesting part of our online information environment
of climate change discussions is fake. Comparatively, social
bots' contribution to climate debates is less than to political
events. For example, social bots were found to be responsible
for 31% of low-credibility contents in 2016 U.S. Presidential
Election (Shao et al., 2018). In the Catalan referendum and the
2016 U.S. Presidential Election, social bots contributed to
23.6% and 19% of posts respectively on Twitter (Bessi and
Ferrara, 2016; Stella et al., 2018). While the comparatively
small percentage of social bots’ contribution drawn from our
study does not necessarily mean that their inﬂuence is subtle in
climate change debates. Previous studies have noted that a
small number of social bots (5%e10% of the population) were
sufﬁcient to trigger the spiral of silence and potentially
reshape public recognition (Cheng et al., 2020).
Climate change activism and skepticism are not equally
promoted by social bots. Although most of the previous
studies pay attention to social bots' malicious role in distorting
public recognition of facts (Allem et al., 2020; Broniatowski
et al., 2018; Strudwicke and Grant, 2020), we noted the ma-
jority of social bots take the same standpoints as scientists in
the climate activists/skeptics-dichotomy debates. They actu-
ally helped promote the science of climate change and actions
to mitigate climate change effects. Our ﬁndings show that
social bots can change information environment by amplifying
discussions about energy, climate actions and climate strikes.
Social bots are less likely to talk about up-to-date climate
emergencies, such as Australia bushﬁres, indicating that social
bots were less sensitive to ongoing topics. It is beyond the
scope of this study to identify the behind-the-scene people

who use social bots to disseminate climate change related
contents. However, social bots' standpoints indicate that they
might be used for science popularization by climate scientists
or by organizations that will beneﬁt from climate mitigation
policies. Although social bots contributed more to climate
activism than to skepticism, it's important to stress that, social
bots' promotion of climate change skepticism cannot be
ignored. Considering scientiﬁc uncertainty is the focus of
climate change debates (Whitmarsh, 2011), social bots may
potentially increase public's hesitation and decrease their
willingness of action by amplifying anti-science voices.
As a politicalized scientiﬁc topic, climate change discus-
sions on social media were always tied to controversial po-
litical topics and government policy. Based on the analysis of
social bots' proﬁle, we conclude that both political social bots
and climate social bots are engaged in climate discussion on
Twitter. We found that pro-Trump standpoints were the most
evident characteristics of social bots' proﬁle, suggesting po-
litical bots’ intention of inﬁltration in climate change topics.
This ﬁnding conﬁrms recent research saying that tweets posted
by Russian Internet Research Agency are 8.6 times more
likely to be related to climate change than that of normal users
(Strudwicke and Grant, 2020). Whereas when taking tweeting
frequency into consideration, social bots interested in energy,
environment, and weather contribute more to climate discus-
sions than bots supporting Trump. We concluded that although
political social bots have an advantage in the number of ac-
counts, social bots with speciﬁc interest in climate contribute
more to online climate change discussions. Our ﬁndings
indicate that social bots targeted at speciﬁc scientiﬁc ﬁelds
prospered, but their impact might have been overlooked in
earlier social bot studies where political social bots attracted
most academic attention.
Previous studies noted social bots heavily fostered same
opinion in debates (Yuan et al., 2019). We agreed that social
bots actually serve as content providers for social media echo
chamber, where similar voices are more likely to be ampliﬁed
through humanebot interactions, whereas our study found that
the situation was much complex for social bots in climate
change discussions. Social bot skeptics strategically try to
avoid spreading humans' opposing voices, but have conver-
sations with them actively. In climate change discussion, being
opinion interactors with counter-part humans help social bot
skeptics exert inﬂuence on public consensus in the information
ecosystem where climate skepticism does not predominate.
The interactions conducted by humans also conﬁrmed social
bots’ success in triggering debates and ampliﬁcation of their
standpoints. As polarizing echo chambers and open forums
have been proved to co-exist in online climate discussions
(Williams et al., 2015), our results suggest that social bot
skeptics may potentially reinforce similar standpoints by
fostering the polarizing echo chamber and converse opposing
standpoints by introducing conversations.
The ﬁndings about social bots' interaction patterns provide
climate communicators with some hints about promoting
public consensus on climate change. Firstly, as social bot
sceptics always intentionally incite debates with human, it's
important for individuals to see through the disguise of social
bots to ﬁnd qualiﬁed communicator on social media. Ac-
cording to the present study, social bots show several different
features from human, in terms of tweeting frequency, user
proﬁle and interaction pattern, which may help human
distinguish suspected social bots. Our ﬁnding may help to
improve individuals' media literacy of distinguishing social
bots and humans. Secondly, social bots can potentially be used
by climate communicators for the purpose of science popu-
larization. Social bots' ability of publishing large amounts of
post in a short period of time can increase individuals' expo-
sure to speciﬁc information. In particular, by highlighting
keywords such as energy and climate emergencies, they help
improve the saliency of climate change on the public agenda.
Moreover, compared with social bot skeptics, social bot ac-
tivists still have room for improvement in terms of commu-
nication strategy, such as launching more conversations with
opposing-minded humans and amplifying similar voices.
As social media have revolutionized the platforms for
climate discussions (Newman, 2016) and collective actions
(Segerberg and Bennett, 2011), social bots' activity on social
media may improve or suppress public awareness of climate
change. We chose a three-week time window and quantitively
measured social bots' contribution of publishing climate
change related tweets; analyzed social bots' standpoints
(activism vs. skepticism) and sub-topic preference; and eval-
uated social bots' inﬁltration in social networks by observing
their retweet, quote, reply and mention behavior. Our research
moves forward the understanding of social bots’ engagement
in regular public climate change discussions and provides
hints for coping strategies.
5. Conclusion
Our ﬁndings outlined social bots' role in online climate
discussions. For future
climate
change
researchers,
the
assumption that climate change discussions on social media
equals online users' opinion is challenged. It's necessary to pay
special attention to contents posted by social bots when
investigating public climate opinion with social media data.
For climate change communicators, social bots, as a force to
be reckoned in future communication practice, should be dealt
with differentiated solutions based on their purposes. We
suggested cultivating individuals' media literacy in terms of
distinguishing malicious social bots as a potential solution to
deal with social bot skeptics disguised as humans. We also
suggested optimizing benign social bots' interaction strategy
for the purpose of climate-related science popularization.
Although this study characterized social bots' invasion of
climate change discussion on social media by observing the
behavioral pattern, standpoint, and interaction network of so-
cial bots, this research has some limitations. The extent to
which social bots' behavior can psychologically converse,
activate or reinforce humans' climate stances remain to be
examined. Several internal or external factors, such as users’
demographic characteristics, features of social networks, and
social-political context of the topics, may interfere with the
921
CHEN C.-F. et al. / Advances in Climate Change Research 12 (2021) 913e923
inﬂuence of social bots. For example, Russian trolls have been
found failed to change polarized opinion in short time (Bail
et al., 2020). Furthermore, as it has been proved feasible to
design social bots for online social experiments (Ledford,
2020), researchers can build a simulated information envi-
ronment for social bot studies. More experiments are expected
to examine the causal relationships between social bots and
the opinion formation of humans. Although these questions
are beyond the scope of the current study, we think they are
worthy of more academic attention in future studies.
