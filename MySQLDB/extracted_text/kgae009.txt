Abstract 
Identifying when a given threshold has been breached in the global temperature record has become of crucial importance since the 
Paris Agreement. However there is no formally agreed methodology for this. In this work we show why local smoothing methodolo­
gies like the moving average and other climate modeling based approaches are fundamentally ill-suited for this specific purpose, 
and propose a better one, that we call the minmax average. It has strong links with the isotonic regression, is conceptually simple 
and is arguably closer to the intuitive meaning of “breaching the threshold” in the climate discourse, all favorable features for accept­
ability. When applied to the global mean surface temperature anomaly (GMSTA) record from Berkeley Earth, we obtain the following 
conclusions. First, the rate of increase has been þ0.25C per decade since 1995. Second, based on this new estimate alone, we 
should plausibly expect the GMSTA to reach 1.49C in 2023 and not go below that on average in the medium-term future. When tak­
ing into account the record temperatures of the second half of 2023, not having breached the 1.5C threshold already in July 2023 is 
only possible with record long and/or deep La Ni~na in the following years.

Identifying if and when the thresholds of 
1.5C or 2C are breached is key for policy
The temperature on Earth is very variable in space and time, but 
it is now widely recognized that it is gradually and on average in­
creasing and that this constitutes a major challenge to the hu­
man civilization. Compared to the pre-industrial period, the 
global mean surface temperature (GMST) is now well above 1C 
higher, and this already has major negative impacts on human 
societies through more frequent and severe extreme weather 
events, glacier loss and stress for many plants, among others. 
Substantially even higher temperatures could have catastrophic 
long-term consequences for billion of humans and other species, 
through generalized crop failures, multiple-meters sea level rise, 
lack of access to fresh water, and large-scale migration [1–4].
Fortunately this danger has been recognized by the leaders of 
our societies, and it is now part of an international treaty, the 
2015 Paris Agreement, that humanity will take necessary action 
to keep GSMT increase well below 2C compared to pre- 
industrial levels, with the aim of keeping it below 1.5C. Because 
the cause of the warming of the climate is mostly man-made, hu­
man societies are usually evolving slowly, and the rate of in­
crease during the last decades has been at least of 0.5C per 
30 years, this is a formidable task [5]. Nonetheless, agreeing on 
these objectives was a huge step for policy reasons: approaching 
these limits, in particular when faster than anticipated, or 
altogether breaching them, is a clear signal that more needs to 
be done.
Maybe surprisingly given the stakes, there is no formally 
agreed methodology to determine when a certain threshold is 
reached. There are at least three difficulties of very different na­
ture here. The first one is to determine the baseline with which 
to compare the current GMST. It must be sufficiently early to 
pre-date the large-scale usage of fossil fuels, while also 
guaranteeing the good quality of the available temperature 
measurements. The IPCC has resolved this tradeoff by using as 
the baseline the average temperature in the period 1850–1900 [6]. 
On the one hand, some authors have argued the baseline should 
be earlier, because there has been a non-negligible temperature 
increase between 1750 and 1850 [7]. On the other hand, there is 
still an active debate about the actual temperature in 1850–1900 
as the most widely used datasets differ by up to 0.2C for that pe­
riod [8]. These questions are not the main topic of this work, and 
we have chosen to use the Berkeley Earth Data series with the 
IPCC baseline of 1850–1900. Other choices would yield similar 
conclusions, simply offset by a constant value (e.g. the so-called 
structural uncertainty), because there is good agreement about 
the global temperature in the modern era [8].
The two other difficulties are both related to the fact that the 
global temperature of Earth as a function of time is not mono­
tone: it is going up and down. For example, it is widely recognized 
that the global temperature anomaly went above 1C for several

months in the period 1997–1999, but this was followed by consis­
tently lower temperature in 2000 and 2001, and that is why it is 
widely accepted that the 1C threshold was actually reached 
many years later. Conversely, it does not make sense to wait for 
the temperature anomaly to never be under 1.5C for 20 years to 
consider the threshold breached. Once consistently above, a tem­
porary dip below 1.5C would not be a sign that humanity is do­
ing well. Clearly, some averaging or smoothing over time is 
necessary. But how exactly? Answering this question is the main 
topic of the present work.
A third difficulty is that whether a given threshold is attained 
today clearly depends on what will happen in the next, future, 
years. For example, in its latest report AR6, the IPCC made a spe­
cific choice: to use a 20-years moving average centered around 
the year of interest [6]. This implies that, in principle, one can 
only know the quantity of interest with a 10-years delay, and 
that is catastrophically late for policy, which is precisely the 
intended use of this indicator. Clearly, a similar difficulty will ex­
ist for any sensible averaging method. Betts et al. recently dis­
cussed this issue and meaningfully propose to use simulated 
data for future years, in order to be able to estimate whether a 
given threshold is reached without delay [9]. Using simulated 
data will introduce additional uncertainty in the estimate, but 
this is much better than nothing, and that uncertainty itself can 
usually be estimated to inform policy.
Therefore, we will in general assume here that a sufficiently 
long time series Ti is available, giving the temperature (or tem­
perature anomaly) for each time period i in an interval of integers 
ranging from M to N. Such time periods might be days, months or 
years, and could span the past and/or the future. This data can 
originate from measurement or simulation. Our goal in this note 
is to develop a sound methodology to determine in which period i 
in the series a given threshold L is reached. Only when applying 
our methodology to very recent climate data will we discuss how 
to deal, if possible, with the uncertainty regarding the future.
The rest of this note is organized as follows. In the next (sec­
ond) section, we discuss why current proposals are not suitable 
for determining when a threshold is attained in a time series. In 
the third section we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of us­
ing the isotonic regression instead. The fourth section describes 
our new minmax average approach, closely linked to the isotonic 
regression. In the fifth section we apply our methodology to syn­
thetic data, the temperature anomaly past record, and the deter­
mination of the minmax average in 2023. We finally discuss 
potential issues with our proposed methodology in the sixth sec­
tion before concluding. For notational convenience, in the rest of 
this paper, we will denote the average temperature within an in­
terval of time periods ½i;j by Ti;j ¼

k¼i Tk
j−iþ1 . Also, we are mostly in­
terested in applying our methodology to the GMSTA record, but it 
could in principle be applied to any time series.
Issues with currently proposed methods
Local smoothing
As already mentioned, there is a default methodology that has 
been used by the IPCC in AR6: a 20-years moving average cen­
tered at the period of interest (note that a longer, 30-years aver­
aging period, is used by the WMO and IPCC in Assessment 
Reports up to AR5, but that has little impact for the discussion 
here). As clearly illustrated in Fig. 1, this satisfies the goal of aver­
aging ups and downs with short cycles, and the resulting 
smoother curve is indeed making the trend of the time series 
clearly visible to the untrained eye. The answer to what we will 
call here the threshold question “When is a certain threshold L 
reached in the time series T?”, one simply then needs to identify 
the first period where this value L is attained in the 20-years mov­
ing average.
Betts et al. give another argument in favour of this simple 
method [9]. As they put it: “Any definition must be consistent 
with how 1.5C is already defined by the IPCC; that is, using 20- 
year averages attached to a midpoint.” Although we agree that 
ensuring methodological stability over time is important for cred­
ibility, this cannot be an absolute scientific principle. If we can 
show that this method suffers from basic and obvious flaws, this 
would also be bad for credibility. The better option might very 
well then be to change the methodology to maximize credibility, 
all things considered. At a minimum, having multiple methodol­
ogies at hand with identified weaknesses is more helpful than a 
single flawed one.
And indeed, there exist specific cases where this centered 
moving-average approach will give results that do not make 
sense. The simplest such case is when the temperature time se­
ries follows a step increase from one level to another higher one, 
as illustrated in Fig. 2, example I. Note first that such a one-off in­
crease is not a purely hypothetical scenario. For example the 
very rapid desulphurization of marine fuels is expected to quali­
tatively have such an impact [10]. Using the moving average ap­
proach, one would conclude that the 1C threshold is reached in 
2019. But this is clearly wrong: it suffices to read on the original, 
non-smoothed, temperature time series that it reaches 1C in 
2009, 10 years before. Conversely, using the moving-average ap­
proach, one would conclude that the 0.6C threshold is attained 
in 2002. But again, this statement does not make sense, since 
this temperature level is never reached before 2009. Also it is 
quite clear that more sophisticated but similar local smoothing 
methodologies, like LOESS, will suffer from the same ba­
sic problem [11].
In general, the 20-years moving-average approach will only 
leave linear time series unchanged, and all other type of func­
tions/series will be modified. But this discussion shows that no 
smoothing at all should be applied as long as the time series is 
monotonously increasing. Or equivalently, a reasonable averag­
ing methodology, when applied to any monotone series/function, 
should naturally (i.e. without treating it as a special case) leave it 
unchanged. Only ups and downs should be smoothed out.
Model-based approaches
A strategy that has been advocated is to leverage detection and 
attribution studies to remove from the temperature signal some

natural, high-frequency cyclic or noisy components to obtain a 
human-induced temperature anomaly time series, which yields 
an index that is much smoother and monotone, as the real-time 
Global Warming Index [12–16]. This could be used as a smoothing 
strategy to answer the threshold question. Diffenbaugh et al. also 
use climate models combined with machine learning to remove 
cyclic components from the temperature record [17].
These approaches are insightful, but suffer from similar prob­
lems as the moving average, as illustrated by the fictive situation 
depicted in Fig. 2, Example II, where the global temperature is the 
result of the addition of two components: the first one gradually 
and monotonously increasing, and the second one cyclic with 
mean zero. In that case these approaches would filter out the 
second component and extract the first one. Based on this, we 
would for example conclude that the 1C mark has been reached 
in 2003 in the example. But that would, with reason, lack credibil­
ity, as it is clear for everyone that never before 2006 was this tem­
perature observed.
An implicit assumption in the reasoning above is that it is the 
actual temperature anomaly that is the object of the Paris 
Agreement, and not a (model-based) index stripped from its nat­
ural, cyclic or transient components. This interpretation is sup­
ported by the text itself, Article 2.1.a: “Holding the increase in the 
global average temperature to well below 2C above pre- 
industrial levels [ … ]”. In addition, the ultimate aim of the agree­
ment is to preserve the well-being of human societies, insofar as 
it is influenced by global temperature. The causes of the evolu­
tion of the temperature are irrelevant in that matter. If the ori­
gins of GHG (or more generally, of global temperature change) 
were substantially natural, the unmitigated impacts for human­
ity would be the same, only the possible actions and responses 
would be (vastly) different. Identifying the causes of climate 
change is certainly key to simulate and forecast the future, and 
to analyze, study and propose what actions could or should be 
taken, but it is much harder to see why that is relevant when try­
ing specifically to answer the threshold question. Anyway, it is 
quite clear that a conceptually sound methodology that does not 
implicitly or explicitly attribute global warming to specific 
causes, and sticks as close as possible to the raw data, would be 
useful as a complement to attribution methodologies.
A first attempt at a better proposal: the 
monotone or isotonic regression
The discussions from the previous section naturally lead to pro­
pose the usage of a classical statistical approach known as mono­
tone or isotonic regression. This method has characteristics of 
both parametric and non-parametric approaches. In the spirit of 
parametric methods, it asks to find the least-square approxima­
tion to the data points, but the structure imposed is non- 
parametric. More precisely, the isotonic regression is by defini­
tion the least-square approximation that is monotonously in­
creasing (or decreasing, but that choice is made ex ante) [18–20]. 
In our setting, this is the optimal solution to the following optimi­
zation problem in a vector of variables x defined over the same 
set as our data T: 
min
x

(2) 
This convex optimization problem can be solved very efficiently, 
in OðnÞ computing time [21]. This approach is used nowadays in 
various application fields, for example in pharmacology, biology 
or machine learning, when the relationship is known ex ante to 
be increasing for structural reasons, but could potentially be sub­
stantially non-linear or non-convex [22–26]. Our context is differ­
ent, because there is no direct causality between time and 
temperature anomaly from which we could infer monotonicity. 
Rather, as we already discussed above, the threshold question 
might not have a clear answer for some threshold L exactly be­
cause and when the data series is not monotone. In that case, it 
seems reasonable to use the isotonic regression instead, i.e. to 
compute the closest function or time series for which the ques­
tion has a clear and natural answer.
As illustrated in Fig. 3 where we apply the isotonic regression 
to the GMSTA record, it is well known that the optimal solution 
x to problem (1)–(2) will always implicitly decompose the time 
interval ½M;N into subintervals [j2½1;J½mj;nj satisfying the follow­
ing properties [21]:
a) Interval decomposition: m1 ¼ M, NJ¼N and mj ¼ nj−1 þ1 
for j ¼ 2;...;J. 
b) The optimal solution is constant within an interval: 
x
i ¼ x
iþ1, except if i¼nj for some j. 
c) The values across intervals are strictly increasing: 
x
mj <x
mj þ1 for j ¼ 1;...;J−1 
d) Within an interval j, the optimal value x is the mean of the 
data T in that interval: xmj ¼ Tmj;nj. 
e) Within an interval, the data T is decreasing, in the following 
sense: for any j, p such that p 2 ½mj;nj −1; Tmj;p ≥Tpþ1;nj.

An intuitive interpretation of (e) is that within each interval, 
the temperature is globally decreasing, but since we constrain 
the approximation x to be non-decreasing, the best possible is to 
keep the approximation x constant.
Let us now compare the isotonic regression and the 20-years 
moving average. One clear advantage of the former is that, on 
the condition that the moving average is monotonously increas­
ing, as in the period 1972–2023, the isotonic regression is closer to 
the data, or equivalently, the least-square error is smaller. This is 
by construction, since both approximations are monotone and 
thus feasible solutions to problem (1)–(2), and the isotonic regres­
sion is the optimal one. That implies that the isotonic regression 
is actually tracking the data more closely, it reflects the original 
data better. In particular, this means that if there is a jump or a 
rapid increase in the isotonic regression, this corresponds to a 
rapid increase in the data as well. This is for example obvious in 
1977, where the 1-year averages were nearly never reaching 0.45 
before (and were much lower on average), while this is exactly 
the opposite after 1977. There is a sudden increase in the raw 
data around 1977, and that is not reflected in the 20-years mov­
ing average. Conversely, if the data is increasing fairly gradually, 
the isotonic regression would do so as well, as is the case in the 
period 1918–1937 for example.
Another nice consequence of being able to track rapid 
increases is that the isotonic regression does not “anticipate” the 
data. For example, the 20 years moving average markedly 
increases in the period 1967–1977, but this has much less to do 
with the temperature anomaly in that period, and more with the 
rapid increase post 1977.
However, the isotonic regression has the drawback of not be­
ing able to track both increases and decreases in the data, even if 
these are obvious 30 þ years subtrends, as in 1873–1911. This is 
by construction, as the method requires to choose a priori 
whether the regression will decrease or increase.
This reasoning could suggest several adaptations to the iso­
tonic regression approach to be able to overcome this drawback. 
For example, one could define a two-stage approach where first 
the time horizon ½M;N would be partitioned into time intervals 
where the data is alternatively increasing or decreasing (for ex­
ample by looking at the 20-years moving average) and then in a 
second step a corresponding optimization problem similar to 
(1)–(2) would be solved. Another option would be to construct a 
one-stage (combinatorial) optimization problem where the solu­
tion is allowed to switch from an increasing regime to a decreas­
ing one, but only after a time interval with constant value of at 
least K time periods (with say K¼20years), or only a certain num­
ber of times.
However, we believe these approaches all suffer in turn from 
other issues. And more importantly, there exists an alternative 
approach that is both simpler, more direct and easier to under­
stand in the context of the threshold question that motivates 
this work.
Minmax average: necessary and sufficient 
conditions instead of a regression
To motivate the alternative proposal below, it is interesting to 
take a step back and discuss the intuitive, colloquial, English 
meaning of “breaching the threshold L at period i” in the climate 
context. Clearly, a necessary condition must be that Ti ≥L (the 
temperature is higher than L in i), otherwise it would make more 
sense to say that the threshold was reached before or after i, but 
not precisely in period i. Also, this is not sufficient. In particular, 
if Ti ≥L but Tiþ1 <<L so that the average temperature in the time 
interval ½i;iþ1 is below L, we understand this as just a temporary 
overshoot in i that does not count. The low temperature iþ1 
more than compensates the high one in i. Therefore an additional 
necessary condition for breaching the threshold L in i must be 
that Ti;iþ1 ≥L. Now the same exact argument will apply also to 
the intervals ½i;iþ2;½i;iþ3;... up to some specified minimum pe­
riod of time K that we deem sufficient to truly conclude that the 
threshold has been attained, so up to ½i;iþK−1.
From this discussion we can conclude that, what we precisely 
mean by “breaching the threshold of L in period i” (for a meaning­
ful duration of K periods), is that the following condition holds: 
Ti;p ≥L
8p 2 ½i; i þ K −1
(4) 
or equivalently that 
TiK ≥L; where TiK¢
min
p2½i;i þ K −1 :
(5) 
This translates mathematically the fact that the temperature is 
higher than L in i, but also that it will never meaningfully (on av­
erage) go back again below L from period i to any horizon of K 
periods or less (i.e. in the short or medium term). Here, TiK is the 
minimum temperature that will be observed on average from pe­
riod i to any future period, within a horizon of K periods.
Note that these conditions are both necessary and sufficient. 
If any of those K conditions is not satisfied, then a good argument 
can be made that the threshold has not been reached. 
Conversely, if all of them are satisfied for sufficiently high K, it is 
clear that the threshold L has been reached in period i. Now, if 
Conditions (4) or (5) are necessary and sufficient, it logically fol­
lows that the proposed concept is the only acceptable one.
Moreover, and somewhat crucially, when K ¼ 1, Equation (5) 
used to define Ti1 is exactly identical to Equation (3) satisfied by 
the isotonic regression. This implies that, for answering the 
threshold question, using the conditions (4) above with K ¼ 1 or 
the isotonic regression will yield the same answer and are equiv­
alent. This shows that Conditions (4) or (5) for finite K are similar, 
but weaker, than checking if the isotonic regression is higher 
than L, because we do not average until the end of time: we only 
take averages up to K periods, which has more sense in the

context of climate science. However, apart from that, the two 
approaches are structurally very similar.
Another consequence is that using Conditions (4) or (5) is 
equivalent to using the isotonic regression when the latter does 
not have constant intervals longer than K periods, or equivalently 
using conditions (e), as long as the temperature is never globally 
decreasing for periods longer than K periods. This is for example 
the case from 1972 to 2023 with K equal to 96 months or more: 
the two methods yield exactly the same result.
As discussed above, and this was our main reason to depart 
from the isotonic regression, we would like our method to auto­
matically be able to track long-term increases, but also 
decreases, in the temperature. Therefore, it is also useful to de­
fine similar conditions and values to determine when the tem­
perature goes below a certain threshold L from period i (that will 
hopefully become useful later in this century):

Here, T
K
i is the maximum temperature that will be observed on 
average from period i to any future period, within a horizon of 
K periods. Observe that by construction, we always have 
that TiK ≤Ti ≤T

i .
We could stop here, and, to the threshold question, we could 
simply answer that it is the earliest period i for which TiK is at 
least L (and similarly to be below the threshold L). However, for 
the sake of clarity and simplicity, it would be helpful to be able to 
plot the evolution of the interesting portions TiK and T

The minmax average ~T starts as equal to T in i¼M, then is kept 
constant, unless it does not fall in the range ½Ti; Ti, in which case 
it is brought within that interval. Broadly speaking, ~T
K
i will track 
the highest past value of TiK while the temperature Ti is globally 
increasing, while it will conversely track the lowest past value of

K
i if Ti is globally decreasing. This makes it possible to directly

both directions.
Applications of the minmax average 
methodology
1850–2023 Dataset
We first apply our methodology to the monthly GMSTA time se­
ries, for K ¼ 120 months ¼ 10 years and K ¼ 240 months ¼ 20 years 
in Fig. 4.
Strictly speaking, the values from 2004 cannot be determined 
for K ¼ 20 and from 2014 for K ¼ 10, but here we just assumed 
that the temperature will not go back under þ 1.29C on average 
from any time interval starting in July 2023 and ending before 
2044, which is a fairly safe bet today [5].
As expected, the minmax average is able to track the 
medium-to-long term ups and downs in the data, while smooth­
ing out the shorter term oscillations. Choosing K ¼ 10 years 
naturally yields a time series that more dynamically tracks the 
ups and downs in the data compared to K ¼ 20. But on balance, 
using K ¼ 20 years seems a better option, first of all because it is 
in line with the current usage of IPCC to allow averaging out 
within intervals of 20 years, and second because the behavior of 
the time series 10 years-minmax seems a bit too dynamic espe­
cially in the period 1870–1910. In particular both the 20-years 
moving average and the 20-years minmax average are monoto­
nously decreasing in that period, while the 10-years minmax av­
erage increases between 1885 and 1900. But we want to highlight 
the fact that this is of little importance in the current regime of 
rapid temperature increases, and that even taking K ¼ 8 years 
would not make any difference since 1972. Rather, this will be­
come more relevant in the future, when the temperatures will 
stabilize, and the discussion will revolve around the question “Is 
the global temperature actually decreasing?”.
Let us turn now to the question of the uncertainty around the 
minmax values computed. Since the minmax average only 
depends on the time series T, the uncertainty about the minmax 
average only depends as well on the uncertainty of this underly­
ing data, and in particular in the joint distribution of these. In 
practice, we are interested in applying the methodology to the 
GMSTA. The Berkeley Earth dataset we use report uncertainties 
in terms of 95% confidence intervals, for monthly, 1-year, 5- 
years, 10-years and 20-years averages [8]. Table 1 summarizes 
typical ranges of these values.
Without knowledge about the joint distributions of the errors 
in different time periods, we cannot estimate similar uncertain­
ties for the minmax average, but we can still give reasonably 
tight bounds from these as follows.
By construction, the minmax average at a certain period is the 
average of the GMSTA within an interval (usually the constant 
interval to which the period belongs to). This immediately 
implies that the uncertainty of the minmax average will be at 
most the monthly uncertainty in the GMSTA, and usually lower,

since it is computed as the average over a certain number of time 
periods. Also, as with the simple multi-years averages, we can ex­
pect the uncertainty of the minmax average to be smaller when 
it corresponds to the average of the temperature over lon­
ger intervals.
Now observe that the intervals of constant minmax average 
are between 1 and 125 months, and usually several years in dura­
tion. We can therefore conclude that the uncertainty of the min­
max average (expressed as a 95% confidence interval) in the 
recent period 1972–2022 will usually be of the order of 0.025–0030 
or lower, which is small. Therefore, in the remaining of this 
study, we will only analyze the central case.
Synthetic time series
Applying the method to generated data allows to better compare 
the minmax average to the processes underlying the data. We 
first compute the minmax average for the five main IPCC scenar­
ios up to 2100 (Fig. 5). For SSP2-4.5 and higher, the minmax aver­
age is simply equal to the time series itself, as they are 
monotone. For SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6, the top of the peak is sim­
ply truncated, but by less than 0.01C because the maximum is 
nearly flat in both cases.
A more insightful experiment is to generate time series as a 
smooth curve with a maximum (similar to SSP1 scenarios above) 
plus an autoregressive process with mean zero. We generated a 
hundred such time series, computed the minmax average for 
each, and report relevant statistics in Fig. 6, together with an il­
lustrative single realization of the stochastic process. We can 
conclude the following. The median minmax average correctly 
identifies the trend, or, more precisely, the minmax average of 
the trend (i.e. trend with the peak truncated). This would justify 
using the minmax average of the median scenario as a correct 
tool to determine GMSTA thresholds attained at some future 
date with 50% probability. Moreover, the median minmax aver­
age converges much faster to the minmax average of the trend 
compared to the rate of convergence of the median of the under­
lying data (not plotted for clarity) to the trend. A similar observa­
tion is that the 5th and 95th percentiles of the minmax averages 
are closer to trend than the corresponding percentiles of the un­
derlying data. This behaviour is expected as the minmax average 
implicitly averages over time, reducing the variance of the error 
with mean zero.
The single realization illustrated is also of interest. For the 
sake of the discussion, let us assume the stochastic process rep­
resents our best (exact in this case) climate model, and the reali­
zation the historical temperature as revealed over time. The 
minmax average is first increasing, reaches a maximum, then is 
decreasing, matching the overall trend of the stochastic climate 
process. But there are substantial differences as well. In the reali­
zation selected, the maximum minmax is reached well before 
the maximum of the trend (2045 versus 2054) and is also lower in 
magnitude (2.55C versus 2.62C). Also the minmax average of 
the single realization has a much less smooth rate of increase/de­
crease than the trend. Simply put, the stochastic error might 
cause an actual temperature record that is qualitatively different 
from the trend. This is also consistent with the actual practice by 
IPCC, where sentences of the type “there is a 50% probability that 
the temperature will stay below 2C if the cumulative emissions 
from 2023 stay below 1150Gt” are common, acknowledging that 
the actual temperature record could be substantially and in 
many respects different from the central case [6].
Analysis of the recent period 1972–2022
In this section, we want to have a closer look to the temperature 
record in the last 50 years, its relationship to the 20 years minmax 
average and then Oceanic Ni~no Index [27]. We will discuss in the 
next Section the recent high temperatures of 2023 and what this 
might mean for the minmax average today.
We can see in Fig. 7 that we passed the 0.5C threshold in 
09/1979, and were already close to it at 0.47C as soon as 12/1976, 
just after a fairly large one-month increase of þ0.154C. From

1976 to 2013, the increase is much more gradual: the maximum 
increase from one month to the next is þ0.066C in 2001, and 
these increases are fairly evenly spaced. The threshold of þ1C is 
passed in 06/2009, although the minmax average stays very close 
to þ1C, between 0.95 and 1.02, from 11/2001 to 07/2013. This 
corresponds to the infamous “hiatus” widely discussed in the me­
dia towards the end of that 12-years stretch [28].
Then the minmax average increases rapidly from 1.02C in 
07/2013 to 1.29C in 10/2015, a þ 0.27C increase in just 
27 months. This corresponds to the fairly strong El Ni~no phase of 
2014–2016. Note that, by construction, the minmax value of 
1.29C is equal to the average temperature anomaly in the period 
10/2015 to 01/2023. Over the period 1972 to 2019, a period long 
enough to smooth out the ENSO cycle, most approaches coalesce 
on a rate of increase of roughly þ0.165C per decade on average 
[8, 16].
One striking feature when looking at Fig. 7 is that to each con­
stant interval of the minmax average typically corresponds one 
or two up-and-down oscillations of the 1-year moving average, 
starting first above the constant segment. For example, on the 
flat segment from 09/1997 to 02/2001, the 1-year moving average 
is larger than the minmax average from 09/1997 until 12/1998, 
then below until 02/2001. Of course this is nearly by construction, 
since we know property (e) holds within each such interval. But 
this seems to corresponds to the ups and downs of the ENSO os­
cillation as observed in Fig. 8, where two time series are plotted. 
The first one is the ONI lagged by two months and the other one 
is the difference between a 3-months moving average of the tem­
perature anomaly minus the minmax average. (The value of 
3 months has been chosen for two reasons. The first is that the 
ONI index is itself computed by averaging over 3 months. The 
second one is that the minmax average does not anticipate rapid 
increases in the temperature anomaly, while a 12-months mov­
ing average does, so taking the difference between these two val­
ues would compare two qualitatively different indicators.) One 
can clearly see a general correspondence between the timing and 
the magnitude of the extrema of the two curves. This is not sur­
prising since it is well known that the ENSO cycle is correlated 
with the global temperature, and that the minmax average ~Ti is 
by construction the average temperature anomaly over a certain 
time interval containing i.
There are a few outliers, notably the 3-months spike in tem­
perature in the period 3–5/1990 that corresponds to a neutral 
ONI. But there is a general correlation between these two time se­
ries as shown in the corresponding scatter plot. This demon­
strates that ENSO is a major driver of the difference between the 
temperature anomaly and its minmax average.
Outlook for 2023
The temperature anomalies in 2023 were suddenly much higher, 
especially in the second half of the year, in line with an El Ni~no 
event starting in May. The average GMSTA for 2023 is 1.54C, 
with a monthly maximum of 1.87 in September, while the last 
6 months average at 1.70C. The main question if of course: what 
will the minmax average end up being mid-2023? With a choice 
of K corresponding to 20 years, strictly speaking, we will need to 
wait until 2043 to answer this question. However, since 1972, us­
ing values for K as low as 8 years makes no difference. 
Furthermore, over the same period, the maximum of ~T
4
i −~T
20
i 
(K¼4) is 0.032, while the maximum of ~T
3
i −~T
20
i 
(K¼3) is 0.044. 
Therefore, we will have a good idea already in mid-2026 or mid- 
2027, or in general after the end of the next La Ni~na phase of 
ENSO. This is because we know that the current warmer phase 
will be followed by a cooler one, and our minmax average mea­
sure is essentially based on averaging these, starting from June 
or July 2023, when the temperature anomaly reached 1.44 and 
1.58 respectively.
To support policy effectively, we would want to obtain an esti­
mate today, instead of waiting. To that end, as discussed above 
and in Betts et al. we would need to simulate the global climate 
for the next three to four years at least, with a sufficient precision 
concerning the duration and the magnitude of the ENSO cycle, 
both up and down [9]. Forecasting the ENSO cycle is currently a 
very active area of research, but the maximum horizon of current 
models is 22 months, with most models limited to 12 months [29, 
30]. Moreover, La Ni~na phase lasts typically longer and is sub­
stantially more difficult to predict than the Ni~no phase [31]. But 
forecasting the duration and depth of the cold part of the cycle is 
actually key to estimate the minmax average today, in the mid­
dle of the warm phase. Therefore, we believe that more research 
is necessary for using climate simulation models to meaningfully 
estimate the minmax average today.
In the meantime, some simple static measures can still help 
shed light on the question. A first approach, based exclusively on 
data up to mid-2023, is to use an average rate of increase per 
year. Up to now, the main difficulty was to determine meaningful 
starting and end time points to compute this average. Indeed, be­
cause of the ENSO cycle, selecting for example a high point in the 
cycle as a starting point and a low one as an end point would re­
sult in an artificially low average rate of increase. But selecting 
two high (or low) points is also problematic because some ENSO 
cycles are much stronger than others, so that a single monthly or

yearly outliers could have an outsize impact on the estimate, ren­
dering the obtained value somewhat arbitrary. A good solution to 
these issues have been to build such averages over long time 
intervals, resulting for example in the þ0.165C per decade for 
the period 1972–2019 discussed above. But this makes it impossi­
ble to closely track a variation in time in this rate of increase.
The minmax average approach offers a simple solution to 
these issues, by dynamically identifying time intervals when the 
global temperature is constant and possibly spanning multiple 
ENSO cycles, and short periods of relatively rapid increases that 
are not reversed later on average. Firstly, it is now easy to select 
points in time similarly placed in this rapid-increase/constant- 
level cycle. Secondly, the minmax average values in a constant 
interval are themselves averages over several years, and so rela­
tively insensitive to outliers.
Table 2 gives the rate of increase in the minmax average 
GMSTA in intervals starting just after periods of rapid increase in 
the minmax average GMSTA, or equivalently at the start of inter­
vals of constant minmax average GMSTA. (Note that the increase 
in 12/1976 happened after a very long period of nearly constant 
minmax average since 1937.) In the period from 12/1976 to 
01/1995, the rate of increase is on average 0.161C per decade, 
while it is 0.253C from 01/1995 to 10/2015, a clear acceleration. 
In that perspective, the rapid increase in GMSTA in the period 
2013–2015 can simply be seen as catching up on a trend that was 
already present in 1995–2001, after the hiatus of 2001–2013.
Now, assuming (i) this trend since 1995 continues, and (ii) a 
new rapid increase in the minmax average in 2023 (as now actu­
ally observed) will merely catch up on the trend after the hiatus 
of 2015–2022, we would expect a minmax average of 
1.29 þ 0.0258 or 1.49C in 2023.
Let us now try to make use of the actual temperature observed 
in the second half of 2023 for our purposes. We already observed 
that the minmax average, during an interval of constant value, is 
typically the mean of the anomaly during one warm-cold cycle 
(and more rarely two), starting with the warm phase. Suppose we 
can estimate (i) the mean temperature over the warm phase of 
the cycle and (ii) by how much the cold phase of the cycle will 
later bring down the average over the full cycle, we can estimate 
the minmax average by just taking the difference between these 
two values.
Now, we can in early 2024 only observe the temperature 
anomaly for the initial months of the warm phase, which is not 
currently over. So what we can do is to apply the methodology 
outlined in the previous paragraph, but using more short-term 
averages than the mean temperature over the full warm phase. 
In particular, Table 3 gives the maximum differences observed 
between the k-consecutive-months averages and the minmax av­
erage, across all the months in the 1970–2022 period.
Assuming these record differences between these short term 
and minmax averages will not be broken this ENSO cycle starting 
in 2023, the implied lower bounds for the minmax average today 
are 1.49 for k ¼ 1 (anomaly of 1.87 in 09/2023 minus 0.38), 1.44 for 
k ¼ 3 (average anomaly of 1.76 in 9–11/2023 minus 0.32) and 1.45 
for k ¼ 6 (anomaly of 1.70 in 07–12/2023 minus 0.25). The highest 
recent 12-months anomaly is 1.54 for the full year 2023, but usu­
ally the maximum is attained later in the El Ni~no phase, typically 
for an interval centered in the month of January or February, so 
this is not too informative yet.
Moreover, according to Fig. 8, record differences between min­
max and short-term averages are typically attained for higher (2- 
months lagged) ONI values. The maximum for the 3-months av­
erage was attained for the month of October 2023, and the 
August 2023 (2-months lagged) ONI was 1.3. Therefore using a re­
cord difference of 0.26 for k ¼ 3 (instead of 0.32), typical for this 
range of ONI values as illustrated in the scatter plot of Fig. 8, 
seems justified, resulting in a stronger lower bound of 1.5.
There are other forcings that might explain the unusually 
high 2023 temperature increase: the solar cycle that is in an as­
cending phase, the water vapor ejected in the atmosphere by the 
Hunga Tonga eruption, or the recent reduction in marine fuel 
pollution [10, 32, 33]. However, these forcings, smaller in magni­
tude than the effect of greenhouse gases and the ENSO cycle, are 
expected to stay at similar levels for the next 3–4 years, and 
therefore cannot be expected to compensate the high tempera­
tures of 2023–2024 later during this ENSO cycle.
It is good of keep in mind that (i) the current El Ni~no phase is 
not over so that the max k-averages values for this 23–24 cycle 
might even be higher, and (ii) these estimated lower bounds are 
derived from record historical differences. Therefore, for the cur­
rent minmax average to be well below 1.5C, for example below 
1.45C, all these record differences must be exceeded. That 
would imply much stronger and/or longer cold phase in the 
ENSO cycle than observed historically to compensate for the re­
cord global temperature anomalies measured in 2023. Rather, it 
seems that a typical cold phase in 2024–2026 would result in a 
minmax average temperature anomaly in 2023 of the order of 
1.5C, or more. We want to emphasize that this is not an esti­
mate, nor the lower end of a confidence interval. The goal of this 
analysis is simpler: to show that such a result is entirely plausi­
ble, without attaching a probability to it. As discussed, this would 
require better simulation models over the full ENSO cycle.
Discussion
We summarize here the advantages of the proposed approach.
 The Paris Agreement (and its ultimate goal, the well-being of 
human societies) is about the actual temperature anomaly, 
not about the man-made, non-cyclic or non-stochastic frac­
tion of it (second section).

 The proposed methodology makes statistical sense, and is 
coherent with the objective of averaging out temporary 
increase or decrease of the temperature that are reversed in 
the short-to-medium term (third and fourth sections). 
 The minmax average tracks the data exactly when it is 
monotone, and as close as possible otherwise (third section). 
 The methodology is simple to explain and justify (e.g. to 
non-scientists), and minimizes assumptions made. It is 
therefore more likely to be widely accepted (fourth section). 
It seems that the main issue with the new approach will be that 
the minmax average time series will typically exhibit “alternating 
plateaus and jumps”, or, more formally, that the evolution of its 
rate of increase is not smooth enough over time. Note that we 
could easily modify the optimization problem (1)–(2) to obtain 
such a smoother solution. But why should we do this? Firstly, in 
abstract, it is hard to see why the evolution of the rate of increase 
is important for answering the threshold question, which is at 
heart a question regarding the level. This seems a category error, 
similar to confounding a function and its second derivative. 
Second, doing so would create the issues discussed in the second 
section. Also, as already pointed out, there is nothing in the pro­
posed methodology that imposes a non-smooth behavior, it 
merely leaves it possible. For example, when applied to the SSP1 
scenarios in Fig. 5, the obtained minmax series is smooth. If there 
are plateaus and jumps when applied to GMSTA, it is because 
these are implicitly present in the temperature record, as the dis­
cussion about the “hiatus” of 2001–2013 illustrated. Now, it is 
clear that the human contribution to the GMSTA is expected to 
evolve smoothly over time, as the stock of GHG in the atmo­
sphere itself evolves slowly over time. Therefore, insisting that to 
answer the threshold question one must use a first-order- 
smoothed GMSTA is a way to implicitly constrain the methodol­
ogy to mainly depend on its man-made contribution. Once this 
constraint is removed, it is hard to see why a smooth rate of in­
crease is important. Finally, it is true that a smooth rate of in­
crease would enable more accurate forecasts of the date a 
threshold is passed. Sudden variations in the temperature record, 
if they are substantial in magnitude, and their timing is hard to 
predict, will increase the uncertainty of these forecasts, and this 
needs to be reflected in a central scenario and comparatively 
large uncertainty estimates. But, as shown in the synthetic data 
section, even using the minmax average, this results in smooth 
median and quantile time series. It is only once the forecasts be­
come measurements that we might observe a non-smooth min­
max average.
Summary and conclusion
After discussing why current approaches to answer the threshold 
question are not fully satisfactory, we have described a new ap­
proach (the minmax average) that is agnostic about attribution. 
We have outlined its close relationships with the standard mono­
tone (or isotonic) regression. We also discussed its advantages 
and tried to answer expected critiques. When applied to the 
GMSTA record, we obtain the following conclusions. First, the 
rate of increase in the temperature anomaly has been þ0.25C 
per decade since 1995. Second, based on this new estimate alone 
and assuming the minmax average will increase in 2023, we 
should plausibly expect the minmax average of the temperature 
anomaly to reach 1.49C in 2023. Factoring in the record- 
shattering actual temperatures of the second half of 2023, we 
conclude that having breached the 1.5C already in July 2023 
seems entirely plausible. This would be much earlier than the 
central estimate of 2030–2032 of the IPCC [6, 9]. Moreover, if the 
current trend of þ0.25C per decade is maintained, we can expect 
to reach the threshold of þ2C in the first El Ni~no phase after 
2043 (so in 2043–2050), or even earlier if an acceleration of the 
rate of increase materializes [34, 35]. On the contrary, if vigorous 
emission reductions are achieved, the rate of temperature in­
crease could slow down rapidly [36].
We will nonetheless have to wait until the end of the next cold 
phase of the current ENSO cycle, probably in 2026 or 2027, to be 
able to meaningfully estimate the new minmax average GMSTA 
reached in July 2023. Improvements in forecasting early the 
mean GMST in a full ENSO cycle would results in an earlier 
such estimate.
Of course, based on the way the indicator is constructed, and 
on the past history, we can expect the minmax average GMSTA 
to stay constant at its new value attained in 2023 for several 
years, be it below or above 1.5C. Even the former case should 
not lead to complacency. This will likely be very close to the 
agreed limit of 1.5C already.
