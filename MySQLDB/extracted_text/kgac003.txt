ABSTRACT
Climate stabilization pathways reviewed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change depict the transformation
challenges and opportunities of a low carbon world. The scenarios provide information about the transition, including its
economic repercussions. However, these calculations do not account for the economic beneﬁts of lowering global tempera-
ture; thus, only gross policy costs are reported and discussed. Here, we show how to combine low carbon pathways’ mitiga-
tion costs with the growing but complex literature quantifying the economic damages of climate change. We apply the
framework to the scenarios reviewed in the Special Report on 1.5C of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
Under a probabilistic damage function and climate uncertainty, we show that Paris-compliant trajectories have net present
economic beneﬁts but are not statistically different from zero. After mid-century, most scenarios have higher beneﬁts than
costs; these net beneﬁts are most prominent in developing countries. We explore the robustness of results to an extensive
set of damage functions published in the literature, and for most of the speciﬁcations examined, we cannot reject the null
hypothesis of net beneﬁts. Future research could improve these results with a better understanding of damage functions
with greater coverage of damages and including adaptation and its cost.
Key words: climate change; IPCC SR1.5C scenarios; mitigation costs; avoided impacts.
INTRODUCTION
Stabilizing climate change can be justified based on multiple
grounds, most notably preserving planetary health. Economic
motives for reducing emissions and adapting to a changing climate
remain crucial, as they play an essential role in implementing miti-
gation policies and international negotiations. Reports such as
those periodically produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) have examined the macroeconomic and
technological consequences of stabilizing climate at different lev-
els. They have partly relied on low carbon pathways produced by
numerical models integrating climate, economy, the energy and
land-use sectors. These tools, or ‘detailed process integrated as-
sessment models’ (IAMs) vary in nature, formulation and details,
and are distinct from simple benefit–cost frameworks [1]. Their
analyses have highlighted the economic consequences of imple-
menting policy goals, such as those consistent with the Paris
Agreement.

The mitigation costs of meeting the Paris goal are uncertain
[2–5] and driven by policy, social and technology factors. They
are often non-negligible in stringent scenarios. However, these
economic assessments have mostly looked at only one side of
the equation: that of policy costs. They do not include the eco-
nomic benefits of reducing global warming, neither reported
nor compared. This generates a partial picture of the economic
appraisal of climate policy, which is focused on the gross costs
of stabilization. Yet, decision-makers and society as a whole de-
mand to know the net consequences of well below 2C
strategies.
Parallel literature, informed by a separate and disconnected
family of IAMs, has focused on benefit–cost appraisals [6]. The
major contribution of this literature has been to identify
welfare-maximizing policies which dynamically equate mar-
ginal benefits and costs [7]. Scholars have discussed the limita-
tions of a fully fledged benefit–cost evaluation [8]. Let alone the
ethical considerations behind the idea of defining the optimal
level of mitigation on the sole basis of cost–benefit considera-
tions, integrating economic benefits have come at the expense
of highly simplified modelling frameworks, none of which is
present in the scenario database of the past IPCC reports (i.e.
the fifth assessment report and the special report on 1.5C).
Damage functions are scarce, they were not built under the em-
pirical rigour of current standards, they lack the temporal
aspects impacting the abatement cost uncertainty and they en-
tail many uncertainties. Because of these issues, and not to
mention the normative elements embedded in fully integrated
frameworks, detailed process IAMs have avoided featuring cli-
mate economic benefits. While this has simplified the discus-
sion and reduced the uncertainties, it also separated the
assessment of mitigation costs from the benefits deriving from
avoided damages.
In recent years, the literature quantifying the economic
impacts of global warming has significantly increased in scope
and methods of assessment. The most significant contributions
have been empirical approaches examining the historical rela-
tions between temperature variations and various outcomes,
including economic ones. This new empirical evidence employs
panel
data
approaches
controlling
for
unobserved
time-
invariant group heterogeneity, such as differences in institu-
tions between countries. The evidence points to a statistically
significant and typically negative relation between temperature,
economic growth and inequality [9–12]. The advantages of this
new literature include reproducibility and quantification of
uncertainties, which were significant sources of concern plagu-
ing the previous generation of impact functions. Both are criti-
cal elements, given the many unknowns characterizing climate
change impacts. Model uncertainty remains a significant con-
cern for the empirically estimated impact functions: methodo-
logical
questions
remain
about
the
extent
to
which
the
estimates can be interpreted as short-term, weather-related
shocks
rather
than
variability
in
long-term
climate
[13].
Estimates vary depending on whether climate influences the
level versus the growth of economic activity and the model for-
mulation assumptions [14]. The retrospective nature of the as-
sessment also makes it impossible to include yet-to-come and/
or unobservable physical and economic impacts, such as sea-
level rise, non-market impacts of health and ecosystem serv-
ices, or crossing specific tipping points, or simply crossing tem-
perature ranges never observed before, something which is
expected to happen at increased frequency [15].
Recently, some studies have introduced this new empirical
knowledge into the simple benefit–cost IAMs. They have shown
that Paris-compliant scenarios can be economically optimal
[16–18] and that climate-induced economic inequalities will per-
sist [19], unlike other studies that found or argued that greater
than 2C warming could be optimal [20]. Still, detailed process
IAMs do not yet consistently account for the impacts from cli-
mate change along with mitigation cost assessment.
Here, unlike in optimal CBA, we are using existing well-
below 2C scenarios, reviewed in the IPCC and we assess the im-
plied net economic consequences. This study aims to lie out an
approach for integrating the vast amount of information emerg-
ing from the literature on potential economic damages in a way
that is internally consistent with the decarbonization scenarios,
without the need to resort to fully integrated, simplistic and
partial frameworks. The unified framework we propose enables
the comparison of mitigation cost and damage function esti-
mates based on the same baseline for multiple decarbonization
scenarios.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The methodology is summarized in Fig. 1. We used the scenar-
ios from the IPCC SR1.5C scenario database [21], in particular,
the global mean temperature and the mitigation cost estimates
until 2100. In the database, the temperatures have been gener-
ated by a probabilistic version of the climate model MAGICC,
calibrated to replicate the climate sensitivity assessment from
the IPCC report on the 1.5 [22]. The analysis employs the three
available quantiles: the median, the 5th and 95th percentiles.
Policy scenarios, compliant with the Paris Agreement goal,
are clustered according to their median temperature estimate
in 2100: the ‘2C’ cluster contains the scenarios with tempera-
ture from 1.5C to 2C and the ‘1.5C’ cluster the scenarios with
a temperature below 1.5C. Some scenarios see a temperature
overshoot, exceeding the temperature in 2100, in particular the
scenarios of the 1.5C cluster (see Supplementary Fig. S3). We
associate each policy scenario with its baseline scenario, where
no policy occurs, and with the shared socio-economic pathways
SSP baseline scenario, which was used to calibrate the detailed
process IAMs baseline. In our analysis, the baseline scenarios
provide the global mean temperature increase and the SSP
baseline scenarios provide the GDP per capita trajectories at the
country level.
For the level-based damage functions [12, 20, 24, 25], we ap-
ply the quadric functions to the global mean temperature in-
crease from preindustrial levels gmt. The global GDP loss is
Dgdpcc ¼ gdp  ðagmtt þ bgmt2
t Þ. gdp is the global GDP from the
scenario (in baseline or policy). gdpcc is the global GDP with the
warming effect. The coefficients a and b are reported in
Supplementary Table S1.
The growth-based damage functions [9, 10, 12, 26–30] are
applied at country level. First, the global mean temperature is
downscaled into population-weighted country-level tempera-
tures according to 20 individual CMIP5 model patterns (see
details in Supplementary Methods). The computation of the
national GDP per capita with the warming effect follows the
procedure described in Ref. [9] and as implemented in Refs.
[27, 31]. GDP per capita is gt ¼ gt1ð1 þ gt þ dðTtÞÞ, where gt is the
national growth rate in the SSP baseline scenario and dðTtÞ is
the warming effect on growth, adjusted to the baseline year
in 2010. The warming effect function coefficients are provided
in Supplementary Table S2. We obtain the country-level
gdpcc, multiplying gt by the SSP country population.
In our main analysis, we employ the growth-based damage

regression uncertainty. We use the coefficients from 1000
bootstrap regressions of the BHM SR specification using the
replication code from Ref. [27]. For this specification, gdpcc
is aggregated at the regional level and at the global level.
For all other specifications, gdpcc is aggregated at the global
level.
Global and regional mitigation costs cmit are primarily
translated into GDP percentage loss from the scenario database,
then applied to the SSP baseline scenario with the warming ef-
fect gdpcc. Mitigation costs compatible with a warming of a
1.5C are higher and more uncertain than those at 2C. The un-
certainty about mitigation costs (the range across scenarios)
increases with time (see Supplementary Fig. S2).

damages are extrapolated constantly in our default setup (see
Supplementary Methods).
To summarize, we account for uncertainties at different lev-
els: the emission scenarios and their mitigation costs (including
multiple IAMs and different underlying socio-economic narra-
tives), the climate projections (including the climate sensitivity
uncertainty and the climate model patterns), the damage func-
tions (including the regression uncertainty for our main damage
specification and a variety of specifications in the robustness
analysis), and the discount rate.
RESULTS
The global net benefits of attaining well below 2C are reported
in Fig. 2a. At a 2% discount rate, our estimates of the net present
value of the net economic benefit are 5.6% of baseline GDP with
warming (13.4% to 20.1%, 90% confidence interval) for the me-
dian estimates of the global mean temperature, 6.0% (6.9% to
18.1%) and 4.9% (28.5% to 25.2%) for the 5th and the 95th tem-
perature percentile, respectively. Looking at the probability dis-
tributions which account for damage, climate and mitigation
cost uncertainties, we find that the net benefits are not statisti-
cally significantly different from zero for all temperature per-
centiles. The overall result is qualitatively the same for different
discount rates: at 1%, net benefits are of 8.8% (17.5% to 32.3%,
90% CI) and at 3%, they are of 3.2% (10.1% to 12.1%) for the me-
dian estimates of the global mean temperature (Supplementary
Fig. S7).
If we compare the net economic benefits between the 1.5C
and 2C scenarios, the two climate targets yield similar benefit–
cost ratios (Supplementary Fig. S8). The additional benefits of
reduced temperature compensate the extra mitigation costs of
tightening the policy by half a degree, which are on average
equivalent to 1.2% of baseline GDP. For a 2% discount rate, the
median net benefits are 6.0% and 5.4% of basline GDP, respec-
tively, for 1.5C and 2C, that is, the benefits of a lower tempera-
ture target are larger than the mitigation costs. There is not a
clear relation between the temperature reached in 2100 and the
net benefits, suggesting the importance of the temperature tra-
jectory, unless we consider a low discount rate at 1% where the

different ways (d). The BHM SR damage function is applied using bootstrap regression coefﬁcients [23] (d.1.) for our main analysis and many different speciﬁcations of

lower the temperature in 2100, the higher the net benefits
(Supplementary Fig. S9).
Looking at the time profile of costs and benefits (Fig. 2b and
Table 1), we find that most scenarios have net economic bene-
fits after 2050 and the majority (>70%) by 2070. This reflects the
different temporal dynamics of mitigation costs and benefits.
We also explore the entire scope of the climate sensitivity and
compute the results for low and high climate sensitivity
(Supplementary Fig. S10). Comparing our results for changes in
climate sensitivity, we find the dynamics are mostly affected af-
ter 2050. With a low climate sensitivity, the number of scenarios
with positive net benefits goes from above 40% to 85%, while
with a high climate sensitivity, this number remains in the
range 60–80% with a decreasing number at the end of the cen-
tury. This suggests the importance of exploring explicitly the
time profiles of net benefits, rather than solely concentrating on
the net present value.
Figure 3 shifts the focus to the geographical distribution of
net benefits and shows how the global picture hides significant
variations across regions. The non-linearity of climate impacts,
as estimated by Burke et al. [9], implies enormous benefits for
the hotter and poorer parts of the world. Mitigation costs de-
pend on assumptions about the regional allocation of mitiga-
tion effort. Most scenarios reviewed by the IPCC assume an
efficient allocation of effort, that is an allocation which mini-
mizes global costs. For this reason, mitigation effort is higher in
carbon-intensive economies with relatively lower marginal
abatement costs. These regions are economies in rapid develop-
ment and endowed with fossil fuels, as for example Middle East
and the former Soviet Union [32]. Such allocation is not based
on ethically based burden sharing rules and different ex post re-
distribution of costs could be defined based on international
negotiations. The regional outcome is that the global south
gains from climate stabilization across all scenarios by the end
of the century and the highest benefits are concentrated in sub-
Saharan Africa, and South and East Asia. OECD region’s net ben-
efits are slightly negative in 2100 for the 1.5C and 2C.
ROBUSTNESS
Given the uncertainties surrounding the estimates of economic
impact, we perform the analysis with a large number of pub-
lished estimates, but without including the regression uncer-
tainty. A crucial distinction exists between ‘level’ and ‘growth’
damage functions. In the former, temperature is assumed to re-
duce economic output, while in the latter temperature affects
economic growth. These two frameworks span the limiting
cases, from full adaptive capacity to persistence of climate-
induced economic impacts. Figure 4 reports the results under 25
damage functions specifications. Out of all scenarios, few entail
net discounted benefits that are statistically negative; others
imply benefits that are either not statistically different from
zero or positive. In particular, at a 2% discount rate and over the
95% range of climate sensitivity uncertainty, for the 2C scenar-
ios, six damage functions find statistically significant net bene-
fits (at 95% level). For the 1.5C scenarios, five damage functions
find significant net benefits (at 95% level). There are not large
differences between the two temperature clusters. The reduc-
tion in damage, from 2C to 1.5C, is compensated by an in-
crease in mitigation costs with a more or less important effect
depending on the damage function.

the growth-based damage function BHM SR, using the 1000 bootstrap regression coefﬁcients [27].

We also consider different discount rates (Supplementary
Fig. S11). At a 1% discount rate, we get similar results than for
the 2% discount rate with one damage function (‘HSM MKT’) be-
coming non-significant on the negative side and 10 damage
functions being significant at the positive side in the 2C cluster
(at the 95% level). At a 3% discount rate, five damage functions
find significant net costs and five damage functions net benefits
(at the 95% level). This also highlights the importance of
inspecting the time dynamics of the net benefits, which vary a
lot across damage functions. However, the trajectory of net ben-
efits always curves upwards at the end of the century, but more
or less quickly (Supplementary Figs S12 and S13).
The confidence intervals around the median values high-
light the large uncertainties surrounding the estimates of the
net economic benefits. These uncertainties are not only because
of climate impact functions but also to the direct costs of

reducing emissions. The macroeconomic repercussions of miti-
gation are also poorly understood, with different assessments
providing different magnitudes of economic losses. These dif-
ferences can be ascribed to assumptions about underlying eco-
nomic
frameworks
and
about
policy
design.
Economic
frameworks involving distortions in markets and innovation
processes, as well as multiple market failures, foresee lower
(and possibly even negative) economic costs than neoclassical
ones [33]. Policy design also matters: the extent to which poli-
cies are harmonized across sources and countries, and how the
revenues of interventions are used, can lead to very different
economic implications of reducing emissions.
In Fig. 4, we treated all damage function specifications
equally, but conclusions have to be drawn carefully, as the meth-
odologies and the sector and impact coverage vary across dam-
age functions. The panel-based damage functions cover only the
market impacts, while it is more varied for the level-based dam-
age functions built from enumerative methods or from a comput-
able generable equilibrium model. Supplementary Table S1
reports the coverage of those functions. The damage function
from Ref. [24] is built from a meta-analysis and can highlight the
impact of the damage function coverage by using the various
specifications. The more inclusive is the damage function, start-
ing with market-only impacts, adding subsequently non-market
impacts, catastrophic damages and productivity effect, the higher
are the net benefits (Supplementary Fig. S14). This may suggest
that the net benefits computed by level-based damage functions
would be higher if additional impacts are considered, but the
implications for those computed by the growth-based damage
functions are unclear.
Another critical aspect about the net present values is the
extrapolation of the net benefits after 2100, as most of the data
from the climate models and the detailed process IAMs is pro-
vided until 2100. We show the implication of the interpolation
for
the
avoided
damages
and
the
mitigation
costs
in
Supplementary Fig. S15. The results are sensitive to how the
avoided impacts are projected into the future. From the conser-
vative assumption (constant extrapolation, our default one) to
the more optimistic one (linear extrapolation), the net benefits
shift towards the positive and this is much visible for the speci-
fication with significant net benefits. This shows that there are
some knowledge gaps and efforts should be devoted to model
the implications of climate policies after 2100, in particular if we
consider low discount rates. After 2100, the impacts from sea-
level rise could become prominent, the panel-based damage
function, calibrated on historical observations, would be applied
far out of the sample and the growth-based damage functions
can be hardly used, as they are, over a long-time horizon.
Finally, we also look at the implication of time aggregation us-
ing a social welfare function. Going beyond the unique discount
rate parameter, we compute the scenario welfare using the isoe-
lastic Constant Relative Risk Aversion utility function and we
compare their Certainty, Equity and Balanced Growth Equivalent
(CEBGE) (see Supplementary Material for details). The policy ben-
efits, expressed as the difference in CEGBE, are mostly positive
for a range of a pure rate of time preference from 0% to 3%. Also,
in the welfare analysis, the order of the damage functions is simi-
lar to the one in Fig. 4. One step further would be to look at the re-
gional aggregation embedding the equity implication.
CONCLUSION
We have shown how to integrate economic costs and avoided
damages from climate change using model scenarios. Overall,
we find that despite large uncertainties, the current benefits
and costs of attaining temperature goals of 1.5–2C are of com-
parable magnitude and not statistically different from each
other. We explored the asymmetric temporal and geographical
distributions of benefits and costs, with benefits outweighing
costs as time proceeds and developing countries exhibiting
larger benefits.
Major uncertainties and caveats exist. On the climate dam-
age side, the reviewed literature is based on historical relations
which do not account for many sources of impacts. These in-
clude sea level rise and tipping points. Non-market damages
are mostly not accounted for, despite their relevance [34].
Finally, co-benefits of mitigation pathways, such as improved
air quality, which would accrue in the early years of decarbon-
ization, are not accounted in these calculations. Mitigation costs
are also uncertain, although arguably less than the economic
impacts of climate change. Mitigation costs will depend on how
emission reduction policies will be implemented and might
even benefit GDP (e.g. when policies trigger large enabling infra-
structure investments). Evidence drawn from existing carbon
taxes points to zero to a modest positive impact on GDP and to-
tal employment growth rates [35], though much higher ambi-
tion in policies than what has been so far implemented is
needed to achieve Paris consistent temperatures. Overall, the
presented estimates of the net economic benefits of 1.5–2C
may be underestimated.
These results have important policy implications. They sug-
gest that ambitious, but well coordinated, emission reduction
strategies are worthwhile from a pure economic standpoint.
The announced climate neutrality goals of several major econo-
mies are an important step forward, but are not enough to limit
the temperature increase. Other countries, including developing
economies, have a clear economic interest in keeping tempera-
tures in check.
