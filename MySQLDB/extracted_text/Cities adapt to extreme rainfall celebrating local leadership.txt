CELEBRATING LOCAL 
LEADERSHIP
Evidence that our climate is changing is now “unequivocal” according to the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world’s leading forum for 
assessing and communicating current knowledge about climate change. In particular, 
extreme rainfall is expected to increase in frequency and severity. ICLEI, the 
leading forum for local governments to promote sustainability, found that the most 
important impacts of climate change identified by member communities around 
the world are i) increased storm water runoff and ii) changes in demand for storm 
water management. The Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction (ICLR) is a world-
class disaster risk reduction research centre at Western University. Actions taken by 
ICLR include work with local governments and other stakeholders to identify best 
practices for managing the risk of loss and damage from sanitary and stormwater 
flooding. In this book, we provide 20 case studies of local leadership across Canada 
to address the growing challenges from waste and stormwater management 
associated with extreme rainfall.
A comprehensive local plan to manage extreme rainfall should include actions to 
enhance municipal infrastructure and also plans to involve property owners with 
waste and stormwater management. ICLR estimates that preventable damage to 
homes and infrastructure in Canada as a result of extreme rainfall presently exceeds 
$2 billion a year. Indeed, urban flooding has recently grown to become the leading 
cause of preventable damage to homes. Moreover, climate change is expected to 
significantly increase the frequency and severity of extreme rainfall across Canada. 
Preventable damage to homes and infrastructure will continue to grow unless 
we adapt our current practices and confront the risks associated with extreme 
rainfall. Best practices for building and maintaining effective waste and stormwater 
infrastructure should include an evaluation of the expected intensity, duration and 
frequency of rainfall events based on historic local experience combined with 
an assessment of the change in the climate during the expected lifetime of the 
infrastructure. 
ICLR has conducted detailed climate assessments for communities like London 
and offers an assessment tool that local officials can apply in any community across 
Canada. Engineers Canada has developed the Public Infrastructure Engineering 
Vulnerability Committee (PIEVC) engineering protocol for local governments to 
guide their efforts to build and maintain waste and stormwater infrastructure in a 
changing climate. And the Insurance Bureau of Canada is testing MRAT (Municipal 
Risk Assessment Tool) in three communities across the country seeking to provide a 
tool for local governments to reduce the risk of basement flooding.

ICLR is a leader in working with local governments on strategies to involve property 
owners in the management of waste and storm water to reduce the risk of damage 
from extreme rainfall. The Institute has identified best practices for protecting 
homes, like the installation of backwater valves and sump pumps, landscaping and 
downspout disconnection to direct storm water to permeable surfaces and away 
from the sewer system, and regular inspection of storm laterals. Actions taken on 
private property are essential to manage the inflow and infiltration of rainwater into 
municipal wastewater systems. Legislative authority and economic considerations 
show that the greatest scope for local action involves the regulation of new 
development. Fortunately we also find many examples of financial incentives, public 
outreach programs and regulatory initiatives that have been successful in convincing 
existing homeowners to participate in actions to reduce risk.
This book provides 20 case studies of local leadership working to reduce the risk of 
loss and damage from extreme rainfall. Most of the identified communities have a 
comprehensive strategy in place but we report on only one element of their overall 
effort. These case studies were chosen because the actions are consistent with 
best local practices identified by the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction and 
they can be applied in most other communities across the country. There is a well-
established science foundation for local action, and many communities have begun 
to lead the way to turn scientific research into local action. Most loss and damage 
from extreme rainfall is preventable through local actions to manage waste and 
stormwater infrastructure combined with homeowner participation to protect their 
property. We are pleased to celebrate these examples of local leadership.

Local actions to address extreme rainfall
Local governments are confronting one 
of the most important issues of our 
time – the alarming recent increase 
in damage to homes from extreme 
rainfall. Communities large and small 
across Canada are now taking action to 
reduce the risk of basement flooding 
and damage to property from sewer 
backup. This book describes 20 of the 
many successful local projects underway 
in communities that are adapting to 
better address the risks associated with 
extreme rainfall.
This book recognizes and acknowledges 
local leadership in addressing the risk 
of basement flooding. Mini case studies 
showcase successful local actions that 
can and should be used by communities 
across the country to confront the dual 
challenge of waste and stormwater 
management. The local policy decisions 
presented in this report are, in our 
opinion, scientifically sound, and provide 
a sustainable foundation for long-term 
success.
In recent years, severe rainfall has 
replaced fire to become the leading 
cause of damage to Canadian homes. 
Damage to homes from sewer backup 
and basement flooding now exceeds 
$2 billion a year, and has been rising 
at an unsustainable rate for more than 
25 years. Moreover, it is inevitable that 
the frequency and severity of extreme 
rainfall events will escalate as a result of 
climate change, threatening to further 
increase the damage to homes unless 
we adapt.
Much of the damage to homes is 
preventable if local governments and 
homeowners apply existing knowledge 
to the design and maintenance of 
buildings and infrastructure. Fortunately, 
local governments, property owners 
and other stakeholders are starting 
to take action. Over the next few 
decades, it is expected that Canadians 
will experience more frequent and 
intense rainstorms. Nevertheless, if 
we adapt, it is possible that we could 
also experience reduced stormwater 
damage to homes.
Local governments need to invest in 
waste and stormwater management 
infrastructure, designed to cope with 
historic extreme rainfall events and 
also the prospect of even more intense 
events in the future. Vancouver is 
replacing all of its combined sewers to 
eliminate the discharge of untreated 
waste into waterways. Stratford 
has invested in stormwater systems 
designed to cope with a 250 year 
storm, well above the 100 year standard 
used in most communities. Welland is 
using PIEVC tools to design and manage 
its stormwater system based on rainfall 
intensity, frequency and duration 
projected under climate change.
Local governments are also working 
to change the behaviour of property 
owners. Halifax provides stormwater 
management guidelines to property 
owners, developers and other 
stakeholders to inform them about 
good practices. Kitchener and Waterloo 
worked together to implement a 
new storm water funding system, 
where property owners that retain an 
increased volume of stormwater and 
reduce the demands on the public 
sewer system are rewarded with tax 
credits.

Quebec City wrote seven times to citizens until 100 percent of the targeted 
homeowners disconnected their downspouts. About 50 percent of the targeted 
property owners in Saskatoon purchased a subsidized backwater valve to reduce 
the risk of wastewater in sanitary sewer pipes backing up into homes. Homeowners 
choosing to undertake major renovations in Surrey must replace their aging sanitary 
laterals. London was able to avoid costly upgrades to its sewer infrastructure by 
encouraging homeowners to sever their weeping tile connections from wastewater 
systems.
There is also a welcome focus on new developments. Boucherville won awards 
for installing wet and dry ponds to retain stormwater in a new development. 
Ottawa requires a normally open valve on the mainline sanitary sewer lateral and a 
normally closed valve on the stormwater connection for new homes. Markham has 
prohibited the construction of reverse-sloped driveways. In Edmonton, lot grading 
for new homes must be pre-approved.
It is possible to significantly reduce the risk of damage to homes from extreme 
rainfall if more communities and more homeowners take action.  Considerable
knowledge exists about the design 
and management of buildings and 
infrastructure to reduce the risk of 
damage from basement flooding 
and sewer backup. There is a strong 
consensus about the best practices 
to reduce the risk of damage. The 
current challenge is to encourage more 
governments and more homeowners to 
take action.
For example, much of the current 
risk of damage to homes from sewer 
backup could be eliminated through 
the installation of a backwater valve. 
The preventable damage to homes 
is greater in any recent year than the 
cost of purchasing a backwater valve 
for every home in Canada. However, 
most homes do not yet have a valve. 
Indeed, thousands of new homes 
continue to be built each year without 
a backwater valve. And communities 
that offer financial incentives to existing 
homeowners frequently discover that 
most property owners fail to take action.
Local governments are typically viewed 
by the public as responsible for ensuring 
that waste and stormwater does not 
enter and damage private property. In 
effect, local governments are seen to 
‘own’ this issue. But many of the actions 
required to address this risk must take 
place on private property. A recurring 
theme in this report is the challenge for 
local governments to serve the public 
good through a comprehensive strategy 
that likely includes regulation of private 
actions.
In this report, we document some of 
the ways local governments seek to 
influence private behaviour. For example, 
Ottawa regulates the construction of 
new homes to ensure that builders 
install backwater valves. Kitchener and 
Waterloo have stormwater fees based 
on usage. London provides incentives 
for at-risk homeowners to disconnect 
weeping tiles. Halifax provides public 
information about the options available 
to interested stakeholders.
Finally, we observe that the trigger 
for action by most governments 
across Canada involved responding to 
damage from an extreme rainfall event. 
Nevertheless some communities have 
been proactive, seeking to take early 
action before large losses strike. For 
example, Collingwood has mandated 
the installation of backwater valves in 
new homes and Surrey requires the 
replacement of storm laterals when 
substantial renovations are planned.
Considerable effort is required 
to regain control over the risk of 
damage to homes from extreme 
rainfall, nevertheless the direction 
we must follow is becoming clear. All 
stakeholders are encouraged to share 
these and other stories of successful 
efforts by local governments, celebrating 
the actions of progressive communities 
that have begun to show the way 
forward.

Reducing Inflow and Infiltration
10
11
THE SCIENCE
THE TRIGGER
Extreme rainfall events temporarily 
increase demands on stormwater 
systems and increase the volume of 
rainwater flowing into streams and 
rivers, but, in theory, should have a 
relatively small impact on flows through 
independent sanitary pipes to treatment 
facilities. However, many municipalities 
experience alarming growth in flows 
through sanitary sewers, increasing the 
costs of wastewater treatment and 
increasing the risk of flooding. There are 
a number of actions local governments 
can take to control and reduce the 
inflow and infiltration of excess water 
into sanitary sewer systems. Reduced 
volumes of rainwater in sanitary sewers 
provide savings to the community 
because they can reduce the need to 
spend on increased sanitary system 
capacity and wastewater treatment 
costs. More importantly, less rainwater 
in sanitary systems reduces the risk 
of sanitary sewer backup damage to 
homes.
The 2012 Canadian Infrastructure 
Report Card noted that 40 to 
50 percent of participating local 
governments have no data on the state 
of their buried infrastructure. The study 
estimated that perhaps 20 percent of 
Canada’s wastewater and stormwater 
infrastructure was in “fair” to “very poor” 
condition. Local governments likely need 
more than $55 billion to replace these 
failing systems, beyond the significant 
funds also needed to modernize 
infrastructure for drinking water, roads 
and address other pressing needs.
The risk of preventable damage due to 
aging sewers and wastewater 
infrastructure is often most acute in 
older neighbourhoods across Canada. 
Some storm and wastewater systems 
are being required to serve for 
decades beyond their original design, 
and to cope with a significant increase 
in demand. Canadians experience 
extensive damage each year from 
sanitary waste backing up into 
homes, and environmental damage as 
untreated sanitary waste is discharged 
into streams and lakes. These losses, 
triggered by extreme rainfall, are largely 
preventable.
In 2009 the Capital Regional District’s 
Liquid Waste Management Plan 
mandated that each municipality in the 
region should not be exposed to peak 
wet weather sanitary sewer flows that 
exceed four times average dry weather 
flows. Flows in the City of Victoria were 
known to be above this target. The City 
needed to establish and implement a 
plan to better control the inflow and 
infiltration of rainwater into the sanitary 
sewer system. 
The James Bay area within the City 
of Victoria was largely developed in 
the late 1800s. Much of the sewer 
infrastructure in the area consists of 
vitrified clay pipes with butt-joints 
for sewer mains and laterals. Aging 
infrastructure is highly vulnerable to 
inflow and infiltration of stormwater 
during heavy rainfall events. Extreme 
rain events can bring a sudden surge in 
the volume of water passing through 
the sewers and can result in the backup 
of sanitary waste into homes and the 
discharge of untreated sewer water 
into the environment.
THE APPROACH 
12
13
During the planning phase, the project focused on determining how stormwater 
was entering sanitary sewer pipes in the James Bay area. This involved video 
inspections of the sewer system, smoke and dye tests, and the collection of flow 
monitoring data. Through this phase, the James Bay area was divided into smaller 
sections and isolated sources of inflow and infiltration were identified in each 
section.
During the subsequent design phase, four different approaches to reduce inflow 
and infiltration were tested, with a focus on the use of trenchless technologies. 
This included mainline rehabilitation using pipe bursting and cured-in-place pipe 
lining, lateral rehabilitation using pipe bursting and cured-in-place lining, manhole 
rehabilitation using a coating system and internal chimney seals, and stormwater 
inflow redirection through the elimination of cross connections.  
A WORD FROM 
VICTORIA
THE OUTCOME
During the evaluation phase, flow 
monitoring was conducted to measure 
the reduction of stormwater in sanitary 
sewer pipes once the rehabilitation 
work was completed. Rehabilitation 
was conducted in three of four sub-
catchment areas so the fourth basin 
would provide a benchmark for 
evaluating progress.
The study conducted by the City 
of Victoria helped the engineering 
department to establish a long-term 
plan to best manage their current 
infrastructure and decide in which 
cases they should adopt renewal or 
rehabilitation practices. According to 
Adam Steele, Sewer and Stormwater 
Quality Technologist Underground 
Utilities for the City of Victoria, the 
study gave the team more confidence 
in the effectiveness of specific methods 
and helped them decide which 
technologies were the most appropriate 
under specific circumstances. “It also 
helped to identify sufficient flow 
monitoring timelines pre- and post- 
renewal/rehabilitation to quantify the 
success of our I&I reduction program,” 
said Mr. Steele. 
When asked what advice he would 
give to other municipalities that would 
like to conduct a similar study, Mr. 
Steele said, “As new technologies 
emerge, being able to evaluate them 
through an exercise like this is useful to 
help justify rehabilitation and renewal 
expenditures.” He also recommended 
a minimum of one year for data 
collection during the study period to 
cover a range of rain storm intensities 
and durations. Having an appropriate 
area with similarly sized catchments 
and similar inflow and intrusion rates 
through the different catchments 
is important in comparing the 
effectiveness of the technologies used.
Victoria’s study in James Bay revealed 
that mainline and lateral sewer 
rehabilitation contributed to a 60 
percent reduction in stormwater inflow 
and infiltration. Moreover, the study 
also found that manhole rehabilitation 
and stormwater inflow reduction were 
not effective in reducing inflow and 
infiltration when conducted as individual 
measures with no attention to sewer 
main and laterals. 
The City of Victoria was unlucky with 
the timing of its study since very few 
rainfall events happened during the time 
allocated for data collection. However, 
the study was successful in that it now 
provides Victoria with a blueprint for 
future inflow and infiltration reduction 
programs in the City. Other objectives 
were related to the elimination or 
reduction of sanitary sewer overflows, 
the improvement of public safety by 
lowering the risk of sewer collapse, the 
reduction of future sewage treatment 
costs and public education. Investments 
in local research and testing like 
Victoria’s study in James Bay provides 
important knowledge to support future 
actions by the City to address long-
term issues.

Persistent communication to 
homeowners

THE SCIENCE
THE TRIGGER
THE APPROACH
Maizerets is a neighbourhood enclaved 
in Québec City’s Limoilou district. 
Developed mostly at the beginning of 
the last century, it is a neighbourhood 
served by a combined sewer system. 
The topography of the area has some 
parts of the neighbourhood located 
on higher ground and some in low-
lying areas, resulting in stormwater 
accumulation, causing basement 
flooding. The neighbourhood is 
also located on the banks of the St. 
Lawrence River where a tide gate has 
been installed. Under normal conditions, 
the tide gate prevents water from 
backing up into the system from the 
St. Lawrence River. However, it does 
increase the risk of flooding during 
extreme rainfall events.
Property owners can and should be 
significant participants in efforts to 
reduce the risk of damage to homes 
from severe weather. Many practices 
that homeowners should follow, 
like disconnecting downspouts, are 
inexpensive and relatively easy to 
implement. Nevertheless it remains 
a considerable challenge to involve 
property owners in retrofit programs. 
Often, efforts by local governments 
to involve property owners are 
constrained by legal issues, like limits 
to the power of municipal officials to 
compel action on private property.
Local government officials consistently 
express concerns about the challenges 
associated with effective communication 
with property owners and other 
stakeholders. What information should 
be shared? What is the best timing? 
Who should write on behalf of the 
City? Some actions to protect homes 
against the risk of damage from 
extreme rainfall are technical and 
require professional implementation. 
Some actions are costly in terms of 
the equipment required and time 
involved. Some actions provide direct 
benefits to an individual homeowner 
while others provide benefits shared 
across a neighbourhood. Best practices 
to influence behaviour remain an 
approach with increasing support from 
local governments willing to share their 
experience.
Faced with frequent basement flooding, 
the City conducted several studies to 
identify the elements contributing to 
the problem. It found that 373 out of 
623 pitched roof houses had gutters 
connected to the foundation drain, 
which meant that roof rainwater 
was directly entering the combined 
sewer system. This connection went 
against municipal regulations and was 
unnecessarily overloading the system 
when it rained. The City launched a 
program in 2005 to fund downspout 
disconnections for the 373 households.
THE OUTCOME
Figure 4: The map and section presented above highlight the vulnerability of the Maizerets 
neighbourhood to sewer backup. Since the neighbourhood is located at the bottom of a steep 
slope, the water tends to accumulate in the low-lying area. A tide gate located on the bank of 
the St. Lawrence River also contributes to the neighbourhood’s vulnerability. This device is an 
opening through which water can flow freely when the tide flows in one direction but which 
closes automatically and prevents the water from flowing in the opposite direction. In the 
Maizerets neighbourhood, the tide gate prevents stormwater from being directed to the river 
during high tide.

Since all of the downspouts in the neighbourhood were on private property, Quebec 
City needed to encourage property owners to participate. The first letter from 
the City provided an explanation as to why disconnection was important for the 
neighbourhood and offered to cover the full cost of disconnection. One quarter of 
homeowners agreed to participate.
Seeking higher compliance, the City decided to make the program mandatory. The 
City wrote again to targeted homeowners explaining the importance of the program, 
that the City would cover the costs of disconnection, offered a free rain barrel 
and noted that compliance was mandatory. Almost 60 percent of the outstanding 
homeowners agreed to participate when the program became mandatory.
The City wrote five more times to reluctant homeowners stressing the value 
of disconnection to the neighbourhood and warning that a $300 fine may be 
imposed for non-compliance. Ultimately 100 percent of the targeted homeowners 
participated in the program by early 2008, about three years after the program was 
launched. 
A WORD FROM 
QUEBEC CITY
Manuel Parent, Urban Infrastructure 
Engineer for Quebec City stressed 
the importance of explaining to 
homeowners how connected 
downspouts can increase the risks of 
sewer backups and why this connection 
goes against municipal legislation. He 
further stated that City representatives 
should make sure that necessary 
retrofits and costs are explained, 
and ideally present the program as a 
turn-key project funded by the City. 
Communication with homeowners 
should be from senior officials and 
ideally no more than three letters 
should be sent. 
If he had to go through the process 
again, Mr. Parent said he would “use 
the first letter as a non-compliance 
notice explaining to homeowners 
that their downspout connections 
go against municipal legislation and 
that they have 30 days to conform 
or a $300 fine could be imposed. 
The second letter would include an 
additional 30 day deadline and inform 
that a $300 fine will be imposed after 
that point. Finally, the third letter would 
inform homeowners that they have to 
pay the fine unless they immediately 
register in the disconnection program. 
It is important to start by promoting 
citizens’ participation instead of 
presenting the program as a constraint,” 
said Mr. Parent.
Securing 100 percent compliance 
required a persistent public awareness 
campaign that ultimately required seven 
letters and two brochures. Further, this 
campaign utilized increasingly senior 
officials and a shift from incentives 
to coercive measures. In addition 
to the downspout disconnection 
program, other mitigation measures 
were also undertaken by the City that 
incorporated stormwater retention 
systems in public parks and parking lots.
Quebec City invested $100,000 in the 
downspout disconnection project and 
$25 million for the construction of a 
retention tank and renovations to the 
sewage system. The City estimated 
that the measures to encourage 
disconnection by homeowners 
allowed the City to build a smaller 
retention tank, saving about $500,000. 
Flow regulators were also installed 
in parks and parking lots around 
the neighbourhood. Replacing the 
combined system with a separated 
system would have required a significant 
investment that the City was not able 
to make. However, the City increased 
the capacity of the system and 
approved a new standard commonly 
used elsewhere in the City. 
By increasing citizens’ awareness, 
enforcing regulations and investing 
in the repair or construction of new 
infrastructure, the City was able to 
significantly reduce the risk of basement 
flooding in Maizerets.

OTTAWA
Mandatory backwater valves on storm 
and sanitary laterals
THE APPROACH 
THE SCIENCE
THE TRIGGER
In July 2009, Ottawa experienced a 
severe rainfall event that resulted in 
the identification of approximately 
1,500 basement flooding incidents in 
the west end of the City. Out of these 
known incidents, almost eight percent 
happened in homes where a  backwater 
valve was installed on the storm sewer 
lateral. The number of homes with 
backwater valves experiencing sewer 
backup was unexpected and suggested 
the need for additional information 
about why the valves failed to prevent 
basement flooding.
A comprehensive review was 
undertaken by the City to understand 
what caused water to enter homes 
protected by a backwater valve, to 
investigate City standards with regard 
to current industry technology and 
practices, and to see what other 
municipalities were doing to prevent 
sewer backups. Once this review was 
completed, the City of Ottawa came 
up with a five-step plan to optimize 
the potential of backwater valves and 
reduce the occurrence of basement 
flooding in the future.
Backwater valves are recognized for 
their effectiveness in reducing the risk 
of damage from sewers backing up. 
A backwater valve, however, is not 
a guarantee that the risk of loss and 
damage will be eliminated. Some homes 
that experience damage from basement 
flooding have a backwater valve in 
place. In particular, if a backwater valve 
is not properly maintained, water and 
sanitary waste can back up into a 
home during an extreme rainfall event. 
Homeowners need to be educated 
about proper maintenance of the valves 
if the mechanisms are to be effective.
Backwater valves are just one tool 
in a complex scheme of storm 
and wastewater management. An 
assessment by the City of Ottawa 
seeking to understand why a number 
of homes in the City with backwater 
valves experienced basement flood 
damage identified these valves as a 
second line of defense. The study by 
Ottawa emphasized the importance 
of properly designed and maintained 
municipal storm and wastewater 
systems as the primary means to 
protect homes from damage due to 
extreme rainfall.
Research and evidence consistently 
recognize backwater valves as a 
powerful mechanism for reducing 
basement flooding, but it is important 
to understand how they can be most 
effective and what their role is within 
the broader system of storm and 
wastewater management.
The plan developed by the City 
covered various aspects related to 
increasing the level of protection 
against sewer backups. The first 
recommendation was to keep 
improving the municipal sewer system 
in order to reduce the reliance on 
backwater valves as defense against 
damage to homes from wastewater 
backing up during extreme rainfall 
events. The underground sewer system

events. Nevertheless, backwater valves were identified as an essential element of a 
comprehensive risk reduction strategy.
The review also identified the need to increase homeowners’ awareness about the 
importance of backwater valve maintenance. The City determined that the main 
mode of failure of the backwater valves was likely through the valve cover, as one 
third of the backwater valves covers inspected were not screwed down tightly, 
resulting in failure of the valve. Ottawa determined that many homeowners were 
not aware of the appropriate maintenance and care required to secure the greatest 
protection from backwater valves.  
A WORD FROM 
OTTAWA
THE OUTCOME
A Residential Protective Plumbing 
Program was implemented in Ottawa 
in 2005 as part of the Sewer Backup 
Protection By-law. It supported the 
installation of more than 900 backwater 
valves. The current program continues 
to focus on high-risk areas and offers a 
subsidy of between 50 and 100 percent 
in areas that experienced basement 
flooding.
Finally, an important recommendation 
of the review was to expand the 
installation of backwater valves 
to have better protection against 
sanitary sewer backup by making 
them mandatory for new homes on 
both storm sewer and sanitary sewer 
laterals.
In 2009, Ottawa introduced a by-law 
requiring installation of a backwater 
valve on all new sanitary sewer 
connections. This applied to all 
properties, including residential and 
commercial, if there is a basement 
with new lateral connections to the 
sewer system. This expands on earlier 
requirements in the City where the 
installation of a sewage backflow 
prevention device was already 
mandatory on new foundation drain 
systems connected to a City storm or 
combined sewer system.
The recommendation presented by 
the City was developed to improve 
protection within areas that have a 
separated sewer system in place. It was 
established that installing backwater 
valves on sanitary sewer service laterals 
as well as on storm connections in new 
homes would not have a big impact on 
costs to the homebuilder. Investing in 
the installation of a backwater valve in 
new home construction is also much 
more economical when compared to 
retrofitting as installations in new homes 
were estimated at $250, compared to 
an average of $1,400 for retrofits. The 
requirement has been well received in 
the community and there has been no 
opposition from the building industry. 
When asked what advice he would 
give to other municipalities considering 
subsidy programs for basement flood 
risk reduction, Eric Tousignant, Senior 
Water Resources Engineer for the City 
of Ottawa, highlighted the importance 
of adequate public education when 
implementing these types of programs. 
He stated that “when this program 
started out, people were not aware 
of it or didn’t understand it. Some 
residents also refused to buy into the 
program because they wanted the City 
to be responsible and accountable for 
the work. It took some time before 
property owners understood that the 
subsidy program was implemented to 
provide a second line of defence after 
adequate infrastructure servicing to 
help residents in high risk areas.”

Sustainable stormwater funding system

THE SCIENCE
THE TRIGGER
Canadian cities, stormwater 
management infrastructure in Kitchener 
and Waterloo was aging, maintenance 
costs were increasing, and growing 
urbanization and climate change were 
pushing the system over its limits. 
Kitchener and Waterloo decided to 
rethink their approach to stormwater 
management to come up with a more 
sustainable way to fund stormwater 
management infrastructure. The result 
was the development of a funding 
mechanism that would provide 
revenue for infrastructure while giving 
property owners a more direct interest 
in awareness of the quality of their 
infrastructure system and its impact on 
the environment.
Kitchener and Waterloo jointly 
conducted a feasibility study 
that encompassed a five-year 
comprehensive public consultation and 
review. The cities decided to replace 
their tax-based funding model with a 
user pay system.  
One of the most important drivers 
for changing the funding approach 
was ensuring that users would pay 
for stormwater management services 
in a way that reflected their use of 
these services. Essentially, those who 
contributed more runoff from their 
property into public stormwater 
management systems would be charged 
more for stormwater management 
services.   When Kitchener and 
Waterloo decided to implement the 
user pay approach, they first had to 
figure out how to determine how much 
each property was contributing to the 
run-off. 
  
Canadian municipalities are responsible 
for the construction and maintenance 
of their stormwater management 
infrastructure. Municipalities across 
the country are struggling with 
aging infrastructure unable to cope 
with existing stresses and loads. For 
example, the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities recently reported that 
more than $50 billion is needed to 
replace or repair municipal storm 
and wastewater infrastructure. Many 
wastewater and stormwater systems 
are approaching the end of their 
service life and often are unable to 
protect homes from extreme rainfall 
damage. Numerous other agencies, 
including the Canadian Water and 
Wastewater Association and the 
Canadian Water Network, have 
reported that local governments 
across Canada are facing significant 
infrastructure deficits, and much of the 
core infrastructure on which current 
cities rely is outdated and under-
maintained. The cities of Kitchener and 
Waterloo, however, have introduced 
a novel way to address infrastructure 
deficits related to stormwater 
management infrastructure. 
In order to find a sustainable way to 
fund stormwater infrastructure, the 
Cities of Kitchener and Waterloo 
decided to re-evaluate their stormwater 
funding system. The first step to this 
process was to launch a detailed review 
of their funding models for stormwater 
infrastructure, which was started in 2004. 
The review brought several concerns to 
their attention. Similar to many other 
24
25
THE APPROACH
The City of Kitchener decided to calculate the fee based on the amount of 
impervious area on each property. The City sampled 500 properties, measured 
the total impervious area and statistically correlated that information to building 
footprints. Kitchener established 13 funding tiers for the new stormwater charge 
ranging from $47 a year for the smallest property to more than $23,000 a year for 
the largest non-residential property. Under the previous tax-based funding model, 
residential properties were paying for about three-quarters of the stormwater 
maintenance costs. This amount dropped to 55 percent under the user-pay 
approach. The remaining funds and overall increase in funds were generated from 
industrial/commercial/ institutional stormwater fees. Overall, this new approach 
generated a $4 million increase to the annual capital and operating budget for the 
City of Kitchener. With this budget, they were able to fund the construction of new 
infrastructure. 
Waterloo’s approach used a tiered structure. Under this structure, the fee is also 
based on the amount of runoff that enters the stormwater management system 
from a property. The runoff level for each property was estimated by a land-use

the residential and non-residential 
sectors. For non-residential property 
owners installation of various features, 
such as stormwater management 
ponds, oil grit separators, rooftop 
storage, underground storage, 
parking lot storage, filter strips, 
paved area sweeping program, salt 
management plans, and so on, can 
result in a lowering of the stormwater 
management fees charged to 
stormwater users. On the educational 
level, businesses, schools and landlords 
can qualify for educational credits 
by implementing training programs 
to increase employee awareness 
of stormwater management or by 
distributing educational material.
classification and property size. In 
Waterloo, the user-pay approach was 
implemented progressively over the 
course of four years, ending in 2014. 
Prior to the implementation of the 
user-pay approach, Kitchener and 
Waterloo identified an annual deficit 
in spending of $4.7 million. This deficit 
led to consequences such as flooding 
and erosion. The new rate structure 
established by both cities made it 
possible to have a dedicated and stable 
funding source to finance both the 
rehabilitation and improvement of 
stormwater infrastructure. Officially 
implemented in March 2012 for 
Kitchener and January 2013 for 
Waterloo, the user-pay approach has 
proven to be sustainable on multiple 
levels. Not only does it encourage 
sustainable practices from property 
owners, but it can also eventually 
help the municipalities to invest in 
capital improvements in areas where 
stormwater infrastructure is non-existent 
or needs to be replaced. As an example, 
the City of Kitchener was able to fund 
the Victoria Park Lake Improvements 
project. 
When the Cities of Kitchener and 
Waterloo decided to switch to a 
user-pay approach for stormwater 
management, they also introduced a 
stormwater credit program. With a rate 
structure and the utility model, it became 
feasible to provide financial incentives for 
properties that have implemented onsite 
stormwater controls to reduce runoff 
from impervious areas. In both Kitchener 
and Waterloo, stormwater credit 
programs have been created for both
 
A WORD FROM   
KITCHENER/WATERLOO
When considering a user-pay program 
for stormwater management, Todd 
Chapman, Manager of Programs, Water 
Services for the City of Waterloo 
recommended that municipalities 
implement some kind of stormwater 
credit or rebate program for property 
owners. In Waterloo, around 750 
applications for the rebate program 
have been made to the City since 
its implementation at the beginning 
of 2013 and Kitchener has received 
4,500 applications less than a year after 
making applications available to the 
public. Mr. Chapman also mentioned 
that several residents have contacted 
his team to get more information 
on various stormwater retention 
techniques.

Mandatory replacement of sewer laterals
THE SCIENCE
THE TRIGGER
they can no longer perform their 
intended function for the property 
owner. 
Wet weather sanitary sewer overflows 
and sewer backups are generally 
caused by excessive amounts of 
rainwater inflow and groundwater 
infiltration entering the sanitary sewer 
system. Excessive inflow can occur 
when roof drain leaders, foundation 
drains and drainage catch basins are 
incorrectly connected to sanitary 
sewers instead of storm sewers. 
Further, cracks and loose joints in 
storm sewer laterals can lead to 
exfiltration into the sanitary system.
A particular challenge for local 
governments involves confronting 
problems with sewer connections 
and laterals on private property that 
have the potential to cause damage 
that may occur elsewhere in the 
community. Losses resulting from 
excessive inflow and infiltration are 
frequently misidentified by the public 
to be exclusively the result of a failure 
in municipal infrastructure when in 
reality, they often come from problems 
that should be addressed by private 
property owners.
Inflow and infiltration in sewer systems 
can cause many problems. Excessive 
water flow can severely limit the 
capacity of existing sewer systems to 
serve expanded populations, generate 
sewer backups, flood basements, 
impose health risks, increase the 
operation and maintenance costs of 
treatment and pumping facilities, and 
lower groundwater levels leading to 
detrimental effects on water resources. 
In certain cases, sewer laterals may 
also deteriorate to the point where
The City of Surrey is a relatively young 
community that has not experienced 
much damage to homes from sewer 
backup and basement flooding. 
Nevertheless, the City is proactive 
in monitoring the performance of its 
sanitary and stormwater management 
systems and has identified and taken 
action to address an emerging, longer-
term problem with private sewer 
connections.
Surrey’s sanitary system is separated 
into several catchment areas. These 
catchment areas are monitored through 
flow monitoring devices to determine 
the extent of inflow and infiltration 
for each area across the City. The 
severity of the inflow and infiltration is 
then ranked and rehabilitation work is 
assigned accordingly.
Over the years, local authorities in 
Surrey have come to learn that 30 to 
70 percent of inflow and infiltration 
originates from private laterals. Owners 
are responsible for repairing or 
replacing their sewer connection so no 
rainwater or groundwater enters the 
system, yet a significant and growing 
volume of rainwater has been entering 
the sanitary sewer system through 
private connections. The City of Surrey 
took early action to confront this 
problem with a by-law to ensure better 
maintenance of private laterals (sanitary 
and storm).
28
29
THE APPROACH 
Several triggers can lead to the mandatory replacement of sewer laterals in Surrey. 
If the service connection or the building sanitary sewer is more than 30 years 
old, replacement or new service is required when a property owner submits an 
application for a building permit with construction value greater than $100,000 or 
where a parcel of land is being redeveloped.
 
If a building’s sanitary sewer lateral is less than 30 years old, then an application 
for a building permit for construction value greater than $100,000 must include a 
video inspection of the service connection. This video inspection is also required 
when a parcel is being redeveloped. The City will review the inspection videos and 
determine if the connection is adequate or has excessive damage. The owner must 
repair or replace the connection if needed. 
In addition, all no-corrode, asbestos, cement, or clay service pipes have to be 
replaced, regardless of their age. Also any shared service connections and building 
sanitary sewers have to be replaced when an application for a service connection 
accompanies a building permit for construction with a value greater than $100,000 
or where a parcel is being redeveloped.
A WORD FROM 
SURREY
THE OUTCOME
Central to the approach in Surrey 
is the focus on properties choosing 
to undergo significant renovation 
or redevelopment. The assessment 
of laterals has been included in the 
building permit management process, 
and improvement in private sewer 
connections becomes one element of 
a larger renewal process. The general 
view is that private property owners 
are not aware of the health of their 
sewer connections, and a period when 
property owners choose to make a 
significant investment in renewing their 
homes is an ideal time to assess the 
state of their sewer laterals.
When asked what advice he would 
give to other cities that would like to 
implement a similar by-law, Jeff Arason, 
Manager, Utilities for the City of Surrey, 
responded that “it is very easy to 
demonstrate that pipes are at the end 
of their service life but I think that in 
future years there will be more and 
more pressure on municipalities to 
replace these connections. However, 
I believe there needs to be some 
consideration for those that have 
unplanned replacements of their homes 
and that cities should be flexible in that 
regard.” Mr. Arason also mentioned that 
requiring all homeowners to change 
their sewer laterals, which would 
equate to approximately 90,000 sewer 
laterals in Surrey, would be practically 
impossible, but using building permits as 
a way to enforce the by-law has proven 
to be very efficient.
In Surrey, most development has 
occurred over the past 30 years so 
the City has not experienced many 
circumstances when sewer laterals 
required replacement. The mandatory 
sewer connection replacement 
program provides a mechanism 
to address an issue of poor sewer 
connections on private property that 
is expected to grow in importance 
over time. Creating the by-law was a 
relatively simple task and no one has 
challenged it since its implementation.
The City is looking to revise the 
mandatory sewer lateral replacement 
by-law. Surrey seeks to focus on 
property owners that choose to do 
significant renovations but would like 
to provide an exemption for property 
owners required to conduct major 
unplanned renovations. This may be 
the result of a catastrophic fire or 
other extreme event. 
TORONTO
Mandatory downspout disconnection
30
31
THE SCIENCE
THE TRIGGER
The risk that extreme rainfall 
events will overwhelm storm and 
wastewater systems is increased 
where downspouts discharge directly 
into sewers. A large volume of water 
can be collected from rooftops during 
an extreme rain event and if this water 
is directed into the storm, sanitary 
or combined sewer system, sewers 
can quickly become overwhelmed, 
increasing the risk that water and 
wastewater is driven into homes, or 
that untreated wastewater will pollute 
local surface water. The increased risk 
of damage to homes from basement 
flooding not only affects houses with 
connected downspouts, but can 
also affect neighbouring properties. 
Accordingly, the benefits of downspout 
disconnection can be perceived both 
at the lot level and neighbourhood 
level.
A smaller volume of storm water 
in the sewer system reduces the 
risk of basement flooding caused 
by sewer backup and improves the 
quality of the water that is discharged 
from storm sewer systems into 
local streams and rivers. Roof runoff 
contains deposited atmospheric 
pollutants, particles or roofing 
materials and concentrations of other 
pollutants that can have negative 
environmental impacts on local lakes 
and streams. When downspouts are 
disconnected and drain over lawns 
and gardens, the rainwater is filtered 
through plant roots improving water 
quality and benefiting the environment.
Over the past few decades, the City 
of Toronto has experienced a number 
of extreme rainfall events resulting 
in extensive damage to homes from 
basement flooding. There have been 
several major loss events affecting the 
City including extreme rainfall events 
in 2000, 2005 and 2013. Damage to 
homes has been evident in older parts 
of the City with combined storm and 
sanitary sewer systems, but most of 
the largest losses occurred in relatively 
new neighbourhoods with modern, 
separated storm and sanitary systems. 
Actions to address the risk of damage 
from sewer backup and other 
water perils are a priority issue for 
the City. Toronto has developed a 
comprehensive program focusing 
on local infrastructure needs and 
actions seeking to involve property 
owners in taking steps to protect 
their homes. The long-term program 
includes specific action plans for each 
flood vulnerable neighbourhood 
throughout the City, a significant 
investment in sewer infrastructure 
renewal, financial incentives to 
encourage high-risk homeowners to 
install backwater valves and disconnect 
foundation drainage from the City’s 
sewer system, and a major public 
outreach campaign. Toronto has 
consistently demonstrated a long-term 
commitment to aggressively confront 
the risk of damage to homes from 
sewer backup and extreme rainfall.

For new homes, Toronto’s municipal code prohibits the connection of downspouts 
to sanitary, combined or storm sewer systems. Therefore, under normal 
circumstances, property owners and home builders cannot connect downspouts 
to sewers, and should instead drain eavestrough stormwater at grade away from 
buildings and adjacent properties. For existing homes a City-wide Voluntary 
Downspout Disconnection program was implemented in 1998 to decrease 
stormwater loads in the sewer system. The program targeted homes where 
downspouts were legally connected to either the combined or separate sanitary 
sewer system at the time of construction. Toronto offered to disconnect the 
downspouts at no cost to property owners. 
In 2003, Toronto’s Wet Weather Flow Management Master Plan identified 
downspout disconnection as one of the most effective and readily available source 
control options available to the City to reduce demands on the capacity of sewer 
systems. 
The Voluntary Downspout Disconnection program initially focussed on two high 
risk neighbourhoods serviced by combined sewer systems. By 2006, a total of

2,300 downspouts disconnected 
each year, with $1.5 million in annual 
funding. In 2007, the City Council 
approved a by-law to move from a 
voluntary program to a mandatory 
disconnection requirement starting in 
2011, with all areas of the city to be 
covered by 2016. Every homeowner in 
Toronto is required to disconnect their 
downspouts unless they secure an 
exemption because the disconnection 
would create a hazardous condition.
disconnections and advice for 
hiring a contractor to perform the 
work. When the City’s Mandatory 
Downspout Disconnection program 
was implemented, there was some 
push-back from property owners in 
areas serviced by separated sewer 
systems that did not feel disconnection 
should be a requirement for them. 
Transitioning from a voluntary to a 
mandatory program brought a number 
of challenges for the City. Toronto 
needed to develop the necessary 
computer systems, communications, 
application, processes and reporting 
tools to process applications for 
exemptions. The City also needed 
to communicate with the public and 
educate homeowners, Councillors 
and internal stakeholders about their 
underground plumbing system and how 
it operates.
Toronto does not provide financial 
incentives for the current mandatory 
downspout disconnection program 
unless property owners can prove 
financial assistance is needed. The City 
offers a reimbursement of the costs of 
labour and materials up to a maximum 
of $500 for eligible low-income seniors 
or low income persons with a disability. 
Toronto provides tips on its website 
about what should be considered 
before disconnecting, how property 
owners can perform their own 
When asked for advice he would give 
to other municipalities that would 
like to implement a similar program, 
Michael Caruso, supervisor of the 
Downspout Disconnection Program 
for Toronto Water, recommended 
that “there should be an easy process 
for property owners that cannot 
comply with the by-law to apply for 
an exemption. In Toronto’s experience, 
it was also important to provide 
sufficient staffing resources to handle 
calls and emails about the program, 
requests for assistance, inspection 
and the review of exemption 
applications,” said Mr. Caruso. “Further, 
municipalities considering a similar 
program should keep in mind that low 
income property owners might need 
financial assistance and that seniors 
may need additional help to complete

Incentive for installing backwater valves
THE SCIENCE
THE TRIGGER
Backwater valves are a powerful and 
cost-effective mechanism to reduce 
the risk of damage to homes from 
basement flooding, however most 
homes do not have a valve installed. 
Local governments across Canada 
are applying programs to inform 
and encourage homeowners about 
how to reduce the risk of damage 
to homes from basement flooding. 
Most local programs include a focus 
on encouraging the installation of a 
backwater valve as a critical element 
of property owner participation in 
protecting a home from sewer backup 
damage as a result of extreme rainfall. 
Most communities, however, have been 
disappointed by the small number of 
homeowners that install a backwater 
valve despite financial incentives 
offered by the local government. 
There is agreement within the expert 
community on the importance and 
protective value of backwater valves, 
but there is not yet agreement 
concerning the best way to convince 
homeowners to take action. Saskatoon 
has been successful in achieving a high 
participation rate. The City targeted 
its program to homeowners with an 
increased risk of sewer backup. 
A professional plumber can significantly 
reduce the risk of basement flood 
damage to a specific home through 
the installation of protective devices 
like backwater valves and foundation 
drain disconnection. Each home is 
unique, including the circumstances of 
its location, so a professional can best 
determine the best protection for a 
particular dwelling. Saskatoon actively 
worked with plumbing contractors 
in the implementation of the City’s 
backwater valve installation program, 
and this partnership is another factor 
contributing to the success of the 
program.
Sakatoon’s Flood Protection Program 
was introduced following extreme 
rainfall events in 2005, 2007 and 2010. 
Unacceptable and largely preventable 
water damage to homes led the City 
to develop the program. One element 
of the program included financial 
incentives encouraging homeowners to 
take action to protect their dwellings 
from the risk of sewer backup 
damage by installing backwater valves. 
Homeowners who wish to qualify must 
also redirect weeping tile flows away 
from the floor drain and into a sump 
pit where the water may be pumped 
outside. In addition, they need to safely 
drain the water expelled by the sump 
pump away from the property and 
onto a suitable lane, ditch, street, or 
easement. The City decided to focus 
its initial efforts on the identification of 
properties with a higher risk of sewer 
backup damage, and targeted incentives 
to these homeowners. 
Partnerships between Saskatoon 
and local plumbing and restoration 
professionals is consistent with research 
by ICLR and others identifying the 
importance of the unique nature 
of each home. Experts can identify 
the ideal strategy to reduce the risk 
of damage to a particular home 
from sewer backup and other perils 
associated with extreme rainfall.

THE APPROACH
Two different analyses were conducted to identify which properties were at risk 
in the City. First, the location of flooded basements was mapped. This map allowed 
the city to evaluate roughly which properties were located in more vulnerable 
areas and were likely to flood in the future. After completing this first assessment, 
a hydraulic model of the area was created to provide the City with more precise 
information on which houses were at higher risk of sewer backups and basement 
flooding. A challenge for Saskatoon was the identification of dwellings that had 
previously experienced damage. Many homeowners do not report flood damage 
to the City, and privacy laws prevent insurance companies from sharing their 
confidential information about specific policyholders, so it can be difficult for local 
governments to identify the extent of the problem.  
A WORD FROM 
SASKATOON
THE OUTCOME
Saskatoon next needed to craft 
a strategy for encouraging at-risk 
homeowners to take action. The City 
chose to focus on financial incentives 
to pay for retrofits that would reduce 
the risk of sewer backup damage. The 
City was aware that most communities 
with programs experienced low rates 
of take up. The City also approached 
120 plumbing contractors to determine 
their capacity, interest and willingness to 
install risk reduction measures.
who had backwater valves had no 
further flood issues.  
Saskatoon’s Flood Protection Program 
has consistently led to sewer backup 
damage reduction investments by 
about half of qualifying homeowners, 
a very high uptake rate for this kind of 
program. The mapping and hydraulic 
modeling was used to identify higher-
risk homeowners that would qualify 
for the Program. The City offered these 
residents up to $2,500 (increased to 
$3,000 in 2010) to install backwater 
valves on their sanitary sewer lateral. 
Homeowners were given the choice of 
paying the contractor and recovering 
funds from Saskatoon, or having the 
City pay the contractor directly. 
About 50 percent of targeted 
homeowners participated in the 
program. The uptake rate for the 
program was higher than programs 
offered in other communities because, 
in part, Saskatoon offered the Flood 
Protection Program immediately after 
flooding events in 2005, 2007 and 
2010. When damage had just happened 
homeowners where found to be more 
willing to invest in protection. Moreover,

Engineering Manager for the City of 
Saskatoon, mentioned that his team 
was happy with their decision to limit 
the program to people most likely 
to need it. The program was initially 
managed through a consultant but the 
City of Saskatoon realized that this 
kind of program was best managed 
internally. “Administratively, it’s pretty 
intensive and it takes quite a bit of 
personnel and several hours to manage 
the program but I believe it is better 
to run it internally because there are 
too many things that are tied into the 
process.”

Backwater valve incentive program

THE APPROACH
THE SCIENCE
THE TRIGGER
Backwater valves permit the flow of 
wastewater away from a home to the 
municipal sanitary sewer system. During 
an extreme rainfall event, the valve will 
close automatically if sewage or water 
approaches the home through the 
sanitary or storm lateral. A backwater 
valve is one of the most effective tools 
available to reduce the risk of damage 
to homes from stormwater and 
sanitary waste. Most homes in Canada, 
however, do not have a backwater 
valve.
Backwater valves are particularly 
cost effective when installed in a new 
home. This can be encouraged by local 
by-laws and provincial building codes. 
Backwater valves are also powerful 
tools to protect more than eight 
million existing homes connected to 
the sanitary or combined sewer system, 
although the cost of installation is 
higher than during initial construction. 
Many communities offer financial 
incentives to encourage property 
owners to install backwater valves and 
other protective devices. The outcome, 
however, has been disappointing in 
many communities. Frequently the 
majority of homeowners do not 
participate in these programs. The 
incentive program in Moncton was 
successful in reaching about half 
of eligible homes, a higher take up 
rate than most communities. In part 
Moncton’s success was the result of a 
rigorous communication effort. 
basement flood damage in 2008 in 
the Pearlview West area led to a City 
pilot project of financial incentives 
for homeowners to install backwater 
valves and other measures to reduce 
the risk of basement flooding.
The initial success of the pilot project 
combined with damage across the City 
the following year from sub-tropical 
storm Danny led to a comprehensive 
effort by Moncton to address the risk 
of loss and damage from basement 
flooding.
Similar to many Canadian communities, 
extreme rainfall and basement flooding 
occurs regularly in Moncton. Significant
Backwater valves were offered to 
100 homeowners in Pearlview West. 
Approximately 50 percent of the 
eligible homes agreed to participate in 
the program. This is a high uptake rate 
relative to most other communities. No 
basement flooding occurrences have 
since been reported in these homes. 
The pilot program included a number of 
other measures to assist homeowners in 
the reduction of basement flooding risks. 
This included active public education 
about backwater valves, weeping tiles 
and sump pumps. Requirements for lot 
grading and window well covers were 
also adopted. The pilot was successful in 
determining actions Moncton could use 
in city-wide efforts to reduce the risk 
of basement flood damage. In particular, 
the City focused on the opportunity for 
financial incentives to be a mechanism 
for Moncton to secure the participation 
of residents in the implementation of 
actions to reduce the risk of basement 
flooding, such as installing backwater 
valves on private property.
THE OUTCOME
40
41
Following the success of the pilot program in Pearlview West and the extensive 
damage to homes the following year from Danny, various initiatives were 
undertaken to promote and encourage the use of backwater valves in the City. 
In 2009, a by-law was implemented to require the installation of normally open 
backwater valves in sanitary laterals for new homes. In 2010, Moncton established a 
$250 rebate for backwater valve installation on household sanitary and combined

laterals. The rebate was later increased 
to $500, which represents half of the 
estimated cost of installing a backwater 
valve in Moncton, to increase the 
number of homeowners that use the 
program. The program was expanded 
beyond a normally open backwater 
valve on the sanitary lateral to also 
provide a $150 rebate for installation of 
a normally closed backwater valve on 
the storm sewer connection.
Moncton also developed literature 
-- The Homeowner’s Guide to Flood 
Protection -- to educate the public 
about the best methods to reduce the 
frequency and severity of basement 
flooding. The materials explain why 
basements flood, how municipal 
drainage systems work and provides a 
list of actions that can be conducted by 
property owners to reduce the risk of 
water damage. This includes information 
about lot grading, downspout 
disconnection, and the installation of 
backwater valves and sump pumps. 
The broad objective of the City was 
to empower homeowners with the 
information needed to participate in 
protecting their property from damage 
during extreme rainfall events.
In addition to the rebates provided 
for the installation of backwater valves, 
Moncton City Council launched a 
new program that was directed to 
homeowners who had been denied 
sewer backup coverage by their 
insurance provider. If it was found 
that homeowners were ineligible for 
insurance coverage for sewer backup 
damage, residents may qualify for the 
installation of a backwater valve at no 
cost.
 Moncton also embarked on a number 
of projects working directly with the 
insurance industry to demonstrate 
the City’s commitment to confronting 
the risk of basement flooding. This 
included partnership with ICLR’s 
Showcase Homes program and work 
with the Insurance Bureau of Canada 
toward development of its Municipal 
Risk Assessment Tool (MRAT) for 
combating urban flooding.
A WORD FROM  
MONCTON
When asked what advice she would 
give to municipalities that would be 
interested in implementing a similar 
incentive program, Sherry Sparks, 
Director of Building Inspection 
for the City of Moncton, spoke 
about the importance of effective 
communication with the public. “In 
Moncton, information about the 
incentive and grant program was 
included in all water bills with a link to 
the program’s website. This same link 
was also included in staff members’ 
electronic signatures. In addition, the 
City used media to reach out to the 
community, including twitter, radio and 
television interviews, and local bilingual 
newspapers.”

Stormwater management guidelines

THE TRIGGER
THE APPROACH
THE OUTCOME
In 2000, Halifax’s Regional Council 
recommended that the Municipality 
conduct a Water Resources 
Management Study to determine when 
and how new development should 
happen in Halifax Regional Municipality. 
This study also addressed “the 
importance the community places on 
the health of water systems and health 
issues such as preserving water quality 
and avoiding flood risk and damage.” 
The report recommended that Halifax 
develop guidelines to protect the 
environment from adverse impacts of 
urban stormwater runoff.
The guidelines identifiy good 
stormwater management practices for 
developments that could provide the 
required environmental protection, 
function appropriately over time, 
were safe, were easy to operate and 
maintain, and had public acceptance. 
The guidelines were designed to be 
used by professionals from various 
sectors such as planning, design, 
review, operation and maintenance of 
stormwater facilities. The document 
provides BMPs that can be used 
individually or in combination to 
improve water quality while reducing 
flood risk. The guidelines do not act 
as a substitute for any pre-established 
standards, but rather as an additional 
tool to better manage stormwater. 
They provide details on stormwater 
management methods that can achieve 
adequate quantity and quality targets 
while achieving economic sustainability.
In order to identify which stormwater 
management practices were most 
appropriate for Halifax Region, the 
study reviewed the latest technical 
literature and past experiences in 
planning, design and construction of 
stormwater management facilities. 
Halifax then identified four broad 
categories of preferred alternatives: 
source controls, conveyance controls, 
end of pipe controls and miscellaneous 
controls. 
Design criteria were set for the Region 
for both water quantity and quality. The 
objective behind quantity control is to 
manage flood hazards by preventing 
or reducing damages associated with 
extreme storm events. In terms of
The goal was to set general design 
criteria for stormwater quantity, quality, 
erosion and base flow control in 
new residential, industrial, commercial 
and institutional developments in 
Halifax. By presenting several Best 
Management Practices (BMPs), Halifax’s 
objectives were to minimize the 
adverse effects of stormwater on and 
off development sites, to preserve a 
site’s natural features and to develop 
a new stormwater system that could 
closely reproduce pre-development 
drainage and infiltration conditions. 
The guidelines were an additional 
tool towards appropriate stormwater 
management facilities. The Region 
found that design principles that are 
oriented toward the preservation 
of natural features on sites were a 
good way to reduce the lifecycle cost 
for stormwater management and 
minimize the need for costly capital 
improvements.
Figure 11: The table presented above shows some of the BMPs recommended in the 
Stormwater Management Guidelines. Each BMP is presented with its applicability, advantage, 
disadvantage, effectiveness and operation/maintenance to help users choose which method 
could be the most appropriate for their needs.

water quality, the main objective was 
to ensure that water quality pre- and 
post-development be similar. 
The introduction of BMPs in the 
Municipality was done to minimize 
adverse stormwater effects on and 
off development sites. Although there 
are no practices that could suit every 
development, Halifax identified that 
the most efficient site design would 
happen when BMPs are selected in the 
following order: Water Quality Control, 
Runoff Peak Attenuation for Flood and 
Erosion Control, and Groundwater 
Recharge and Base Flow Maintenance.
The guidelines provide examples of 
best practices but also a four-step 
selection process to ensure that 
appropriate practices are chosen 
for a particular site. The first step of 
the design process is to establish the 
objectives of the practices and identify 
corresponding design criteria for the 
site. During the second step, the user 
chooses the most suitable practices for 
the site with the help of a screening 
tool that has been developed to 
compare the capabilities and limitations 
of each practice. The user then 
develops a refined list of alternatives 
derived from the initial assessment 
that would take into account the 
capability to remove pollutants, 
space requirements, environmental 
considerations and health and safety 
issues. The final step reviews and 
analyzes the list developed to make a 
final selection. 
As soon as the Stormwater 
Management Guidelines were 
completed, the document was made 
available online to be used as a 
reference tool for developers, planners, 
designers and contractors. 
When asked what advice he would 
give to other municipalities that are 
considering implementing stormwater 
management guidelines, Cameron 
Deacoff, Environmental Performance 
Officer for Halifax Regional Municipality 
Energy & Environment, responded that 
it is essential to be clear about your 
objectives and their scope. It is also 
important to fully assess the available 
approaches to determine which one 
is the most appropriate to meet a 
specific objective. Also, to make sure 
that the guidelines are appropriate 
for a specific municipality, Mr. Deacoff 
recommended thoroughly reviewing 
the basic assumptions and conditions 
affecting this locality. “Are your flood 
plain maps up to date? Do rainfall 
models (i.e. IDF curves) adequately 
account for expected changes in 
precipitation patterns?”
Finally, Mr. Deacoff highlighted the 
importance of reaching out to other 
members of the community. “Consult 
with professionals in your area for 
expert guidance [and] with members 
of your community to identify their 
concerns and their priorities. [Also], 
consider working with non-profit 
organizations in your area. They may be 
able to help to engage your residents 
and/or other stakeholders in a number 
of ways, including but not limited to 
surveys, direct-to-owner programs, 
workshops and demonstration 
projects.”

THE SCIENCE
THE TRIGGER
Backwater valves are recommended or 
required by many municipalities across 
Canada as a measure to reduce the 
risk of sewers backing up into homes 
during extreme rainfall events. Sewer 
backup can happen in any home, 
new or old, when municipal sewer 
systems receive more water than they 
can handle. This additional volume of 
water can create a surcharge, pushing 
water and untreated waste backwards 
through private sewer laterals and 
eventually causing sewage to back up in 
homes through basement floor drains, 
toilets and sinks. 
When a proper backwater valve is in 
place, it can considerably reduce the 
risk of damage to homes from sewer 
backup. In Canada, municipalities have 
developed a variety of mechanisms to 
encourage the installation of backwater 
valves. This includes education 
and subsidy programs for existing 
homeowners. By-laws and code 
enforcement are some approaches 
used to influence new home 
construction. There is a wide consensus 
among local government experts 
across Canada that backwater valves 
are a valuable protection mechanism 
for all homes connected to a sanitary 
sewer system.
Data provided by insurance companies 
indicates that damage to homes from 
sewer backup has been growing for 
three or four decades, including an 
alarming increase over the last five to 
10 years. In recent years damage to 
homes from sewer backup and other 
water damage has exceeded $2 billion 
a year. Most communities taking action
to encourage the use of backwater 
valves are responding to a major local 
loss event, so many actions have been 
implemented relatively recently. Some 
communities, like Winnipeg, took initial 
action in the 1970s, and continue to 
evolve and renew their programs 
to prevent damage to homes from 
basement flooding.
THE TRIGGER
The City of Winnipeg is located 
in a former glacial lake with a 
remarkably low-lying flood plain over 
a flat topography. Sewers and other 
buried infrastructure are particularly 
vulnerable to damage from flooding 
because they are located below ground 
at very low elevation.
Moreover, sanitary sewers and 
stormwater systems are vulnerable 
to water inflow and infiltration from 
also extreme rainfall events. The 
City has experienced many extreme 
rainfall events in the past that have 
overwhelmed the capacity of the storm 
and wastewater management systems.
These extreme rainfall events have 
convinced local authorities early on to 
think more aggressively about possible 
mitigation measures to protect homes 
from basement flooding. In particular a 
backwater valve by-law was developed 
in 1979, followed by a sump pump by-
law in 1980.
Figure 12: Depending on the plumbing in a house, homeowners may need one or more 
backwater valves of either the normally open or normally closed type to properly protect their 
basement from flooding. The City of Winnipeg recommends that homeowners consult with a 
plumbing contractor licensed by the City for an assessment of the cost involved in installing any 
of these two eligible devices.

THE APPROACH
48
49
Winnipeg was one of the first municipalities in Canada to create a by-law requiring 
the installation of backwater valves in all new homes. Since 1979, houses have 
to be built with an in-line backwater valve on the sanitary sewer connection. 
Approximately 28 percent of houses across the City have installed a backwater 
valve and 15 percent have installed a sump pit system since the implementation of 
the by-laws.
The core area of Winnipeg was built prior to 1979. Recently the City has 
implemented a subsidy program to encourage the installation of backwater valves 
and sump pumps in older homes. Winnipeg will pay 60 percent of the invoiced 
costs for the installation of an in-line backwater valve, up to a maximum of $1,000. 
The City will also pay 60 percent of the invoiced cost of a sump pit drainage system 
up to a maximum of $2,000. The province of Manitoba and the City of Winnipeg 
share equally in the cost of funding the program. All homes in Winnipeg qualify for 
the program regardless of their flood history.
A WORD FROM 
WINNIPEG
THE OUTCOME
Early implementation of backwater 
valve and sump pit by-laws made it 
possible to protect a relatively large 
part of the City of Winnipeg against 
basement flooding. Over time, the 
number of homes with protection has 
continued to grow. In particular it has 
been possible to ensure that the risk 
of basement flooding is low in new 
developments for more than 35 years.
It was important to extend Winnipeg’s 
efforts into the historic core of the 
City. Winnipeg has made significant 
commitments to renewal of sewer 
infrastructure, and this is now 
supported by the Basement Flood 
Relief Subsidy Program. Over the past 
three years, the program has generated 
an additional 1,532 backwater 
valve and 2,275 sump pit approved 
applications, a significant increase in the 
number of protected homes in the City. 
Securing cost sharing with the Province 
of Manitoba was an important element 
to the early success of the subsidy 
program.  
that Winnipeg faced when 
implementing the subsidy program 
was to ask the province for a fifty 
percent cost-sharing. “We received a 
commitment from them for the last 
three years and we are going to ask for 
three more,” said Mr. Boulet. 
Through his career, Mr. Boulet noticed 
that homeowners are not always 
aware of whether or not they have a 
backwater valve or sump pump, where 
it is located and how it needs to be 
maintained. In order to better educate 
the public, the City of Winnipeg has 
been hosting presentations directed to 
homeowners through a local Home 
and Garden Show where they explain 
to the public how to find and maintain 
a sump pump and backwater valve. 
They also send flyers to homeowners 
on a regular basis as well as information 
on backwater valves. 
When asked about his thoughts 
on the by-laws and the flood 
damage reduction subsidy program 
developed by Winnipeg, Charles 
Boulet, Senior Project Engineer for 
the City of Winnipeg responded that 
he would completely support the 
implementation of similar programs 
in other cities since it represents an 
effective means to prevent basement 
flooding. One of the biggest challenges

Disconnecting weeping tiles
THE SCIENCE
THE TRIGGER
THE APPROACH
Wet weather sanitary sewer overflows 
and sewer backups are often the result 
of excessive inflow and infiltration 
overwhelming sanitary sewers. The risk 
of excessive inflow increases when 
roof drain leads, foundation drains and 
drainage catch basins are connected to 
sanitary sewers. For several decades, 
most communities have prohibited the 
connection of weeping tiles in new 
homes to the sanitary sewer system, 
but this practice was common in the 
past and remains present in many 
homes.
The City of London assessed source 
control and infrastructure alternatives 
to reduce the risk of damage from 
basement flooding in Sherwood Forest. 
Research commissioned by the City 
found that a $2 million investment 
in source control would achieve 
greater protection than a $10 million 
investment in protective infrastructure. 
The City launched a source control 
pilot project to disconnect weeping 
tiles from the municipal sanitary sewer 
system. “On top of the cost savings, it 
was simply a better option,” says Kyle 
Chambers, Wastewater and Drainage 
Engineer for the City of London. “By 
adopting this approach, the City did not 
have to worry about the sizing of new 
infrastructure. Disconnecting weeping 
tiles also represented a sustainable 
option since it contributed to reduced 
sewage pumping and treatment costs 
at municipal facilities.”
The City of London implemented a 
sump pump program more than 20 
years ago. The level of grant funding 
was initially set at 50 percent of the 
eligible cost, and increased in 2009 to 
75 percent. Even with this increase, 
the program has experienced a very 
low uptake rate, highlighting the need 
for further mitigation actions. The 
City decided to work directly with 
homeowners in Sherwood Forest 
to reduce inflow at the source by 
disconnecting household weeping 
tiles from private sanitary sewer 
connections.
The pilot project for Sherwood Forest 
Over the past decade or two, the City 
of London has experienced a number 
of extreme rain events that resulted 
in extensive basement flood damage 
to homes. Some neighbourhoods have 
experienced recurring flooding. In the 
City of London, connection of weeping 
tiles to sanitary sewers was a common 
practice for homes built prior to 1985. 
Some neighbourhoods, like Sherwood 
Forest, were mostly developed in the 
late 1970s and early 1980s and now 
experience chronic basement flooding 
because the sanitary sewers become 
overwhelmed with foundation drainage 
water during  heavy rainfall events.
Sherwood Forest’s vulnerability to 
basement flooding is enhanced by 
clay soil conditions resulting in poor 
rainwater absorption. Lot grading in 
this area has also settled over time 
and homes are close to each other 
reducing the neighbourhood’s drainage 
capacity due to a relatively high 
percentage of impervious surface area.

Figure 14: On September 21 2013, after the pilot project resulted in the disconnection of 50% 
of the weeping tiles on Blanchard Crescent, a rainfall of approximately 99mm occurred in the 
neighbourhood. Flow monitoring (red line for Blanchard Crescent) during the storm revealed 
that weeping tile disconnection has resulted in a surprising reduction of extraneous flow in the 
sanitary sewer system. The difference in flows is also highlighted by the comparison with 
Ardsley Crescent (purple line) and Aldersbrook Road (green line) where no disconnection was 
in place.

Area. This graph highlights the fact that there is a direct correlation between the amount of 
rain received (approximately 80mm during the rainfall event) and high flow in the sanitary 
sewer, evidence of Inflow and Infiltration.

targeted 65 homes. Through computer modeling, the City was able to determine 
that it was necessary to disconnect weeping tiles for at least 50 percent of the 
homes to ensure that enough excess foundation drainage water was removed from 
the sanitary system to reduce sanitary sewer backup risk for the neighbourhood. 
Several methods were used to reach out to households to encourage participation 
in the program. Public meetings were organized and homeowners were contacted

THE OUTCOME
by mail and phone. Once homeowners 
signed up, the City met with each 
of them to explain the pilot project 
in more detail, and assessed each 
basement to determine retrofit 
feasibility. In order to get a high 
uptake rate, the City covered all the 
costs associated with the retrofit and 
provided an additional $1,000 payment 
for future maintenance.
Moreover, there has been no sewer 
back up damage in participating homes, 
despite the occurrence of extreme 
rainfall events.
THE OUTCOME
32 of the 65 households participated in 
the full pilot program, while five more 
houses installed a private storm sewer 
lateral. The Weeping Tile Disconnection 
Pilot Project presented the City with 
several challenges. First, it required 
working directly with homeowners 
on private property and inside homes. 
This brought a number of legal 
challenges for the City, including the 
need for police record checks for all 
contractors and their staff, additional 
requirements for liability insurance, and 
comprehensive insurance coverage 
for all employees. Coordination with 
the City’s Building Division was also 
necessary to obtain building permits for 
each house. 
Working directly with homeowners 
also implied that several individual 
agreements needed to be signed prior 
to each retrofit, and that contractors 
were able to work under a flexible 
schedule.
Since the weeping tiles were 
disconnected there has been a 
dramatic decrease in the flow of water 
within the sanitary sewer system during 
extreme rainfall events. 
When asked for his thoughts on the 
Weeping Tile Disconnection Pilot 
Project, Mr. Chambers said that he 
believed it was a great program 
for homeowners willing to buy 
into the solution. As anticipated, 
scheduling was a challenge as it was 
difficult to coordinate the work 
with homeowners’ work schedules. 
However, they proved to be flexible 
and accommodating, and most adapted 
their schedules to coordinate with City 
workers. Mr. Chambers mentioned that 
if he had to go through the process 
again, he would probably have spent 
more time explaining the project to 
homeowners. “When doing the work, 
some people asked us to repair the 
sidewalk or repave parts of their 
streets. I think it is very important to 
be clear and set realistic expectations 
about what we are doing and not 
doing from the beginning”, said Mr. 
Chambers. Overall, homeowners that 
took part in the project were very 
cooperative and pleased with the 
work that had been done. Monitoring 
done by the City showed that the 
project was a success, with a significant 
reduction of excess flow in the sanitary 
sewer system. The City will be able 
to draw more conclusions out of this 
pilot study after the next significant rain 
event in the neighbourhood.

THE APPROACH
THE SCIENCE
THE TRIGGER
Southern Ontario is expected 
to experience an increase in the 
frequency and severity of extreme 
weather as a result of climate change. 
Climate change presents a challenge 
that may be most evident in the 
design, operations and maintenance 
of public infrastructure that seeks to 
provide service to the public over a 
lengthy period of time. For example, 
sanitary sewer pipes and stormwater 
management infrastructure typically 
remain in place for 50 to 100 years or 
more. 
Across most of Canada, a significant 
increase is expected in the severity 
of extreme rainfall events under 
changing climate conditions. Local 
governments across Canada recognize 
that stormwater management systems 
must not only demonstrate their 
capacity to successfully cope with 
historic extreme events, but the design 
and construction of new systems need 
to anticipate the expected increase 
in future rainfall events. Climate 
change is an important priority for 
local governments, particularly with 
respect to the design, maintenance and 
operation of stormwater systems and 
extreme rainfall.
collection system at risk of failure, 
damage or deterioration from extreme 
climatic events.
Stormwater management in Welland 
at the time was based on Intensity 
Duration Frequency (IDF) rainfall 
curves established in 1963 using data 
from Buffalo, NY from the 1930s, 
1940s and 1950s that needed to be 
updated. The City also used a two-year 
design standard for buried stormwater 
management infrastructure, which 
needed to be reviewed. Faced with 
ongoing sewer separation and aging 
infrastructure, Welland wanted to 
ensure that new assets were designed 
to an adequate standard that would 
prevent obsolescence in the face 
of climate change. Also, the City 
experienced basement flooding and 
sewer overflows in the past, a risk that 
needed to be addressed. Furthermore, 
Welland was looking to review its 
standards for new development 
projects that would lead to additional 
loads on the sewer system in place.
In 2005, the Canadian Council of 
Professional Engineers created the Public 
Infrastructure Engineering Vulnerability 
Committee (PIEVC) to develop a 
tool to better design and manage the 
potential impact of climate change on 
public infrastructure. Welland applied the 
tool to identify the components of the 
City’s wastewater and surface drainage
THE APPROACH
Welland first identified the 
infrastructure components to be 
evaluated. Applicable design codes 
and policies, criteria, best practices and 
procedures were then identified for 
each of the infrastructure components 
when the information was available. 
The City then established a set of 
climate parameters describing climatic 
and meteorological phenomena 
relevant to the City of Welland and 
a general probability of occurrence 
of each climate phenomena, both 
historically and in the future. Once 
these components were identified

for stormwater system design. The comparison shows consistent increases for all durations for 
all scenarios.

and the nature and levels of risk were established, a vulnerability assessment based 
on two future time frames - 2020 and 2050 - was developed. With this information 
in mind, the study assessed the adaptive capacity of the infrastructure in place and 
developed specific recommendations on adaptive measures.
High priority vulnerabilities for the wastewater collection system were those 
associated with performance responses, like combined sewer overflows, which can
A WORD FROM 
WELLAND
generate environmental contamination 
and risks to public health and safety. It 
was determined that increased rainfall 
and the associated increase in sewer 
flow were acting as triggers for these 
vulnerabilities. For this reason, it was 
recommended that Welland work with 
all levels of  government to establish 
a consistent funding program for the 
sewer separation and maintenance 
program. It was also recommended 
that the City conduct further studies in 
specific areas such as the relationship 
between increased rainfall and inflow 
and infiltration rates in the collection 
systems. An assessment of the 
applicability of green infrastructure, as 
an additional tool to increase resiliency 
in adapting to climate change, was also 
recommended. 
Welland is a two-tier municipality, 
which means that the Region looks 
after the wastewater treatment plant 
and pump stations. For the Region’s 
wastewater treatment plant, the 
vulnerabilities identified as being of 
the highest priority were related 
to screening, grit removal and flow 
splitters. The operational life of these 
systems would be reduced with 
an expectation of more intense 
rainfall events, which would lead to 
maintenance and replacement costs.
One of the goals of the vulnerability 
assessment was to update the City 
of Welland’s IDF curves to anticipate 
predicted changes in precipitation 
with climate change. With the tools 
available at the time of this study, it was 
estimated that the 1963 IDF curves 
provided conservative results for more 
frequent storms and it was therefore
recommended to keep working with 
these curves.  
After the publication of the PIEVC 
report, the City of Welland moved 
forward with the lower cost, high-
priority recommendations, 
including further analysis of its IDF 
curve. At the moment, the City and 
the Region are also working on the 
preparation of a City Wide Sanitary 
Sewer Model and subsequent Pollution 
Control Plan update.
To successfully complete the 
Vulnerability Assessment of Public 
Infrastructure to Climate Change, 
Marvin Ingebrigtsen, Technical Analyst, 
Infrastructure Programs for the City 
of Welland, recommended that cities 
first come up with good asset data 
and good storm event records to 
ensure the review of the infrastructure 
reaction is accurate. He added that 
“it is very useful to have senior 
staff including operators and Public 
Works and Operations foremen 
that can provide insight into how the 
infrastructure system reacts to climate 
variables, usually storm events.” To 
conclude, Mr. Ingebrigtsen suggested 
that cities interested in implementing 
a similar project first gather specific 
data on how their infrastructure 
reacted to extreme events in the past. 
Once the final recommendations are 
made, he recommended following up 
on recommendations as soon as the 
report is finalized while the information 
is still fresh in peoples’ minds.

STRATFORD
Implementation of a 250-year 
stormwater management standard
THE SCIENCE
THE TRIGGER
Most developments in Canada built 
after the 1970s are protected from 
flooding caused by extreme rainfall 
events in two ways: An underground 
stormwater management system that 
conveys water from relatively frequent 
events (i.e. the minor system), and an 
overland flow system to protect homes 
from very severe rainfall events (i.e. the 
major system). In most communities, the 
major system of overland stormwater 
management is designed and managed 
to cope with stormwater flows likely to 
occur once every 100 years. Even more 
severe events are possible, but are rare.
New subdivisions are built with both a 
major and a minor stormwater system. 
The minor system consists of a pipe 
network, plus gutters and inlets which 
provide a conveyance system to rapidly 
move storm runoff away from roads. The 
major system typically conveys volumes 
of water expected for a one in 100 
year rainfall event that would exceed 
the capacity of the minor system. The 
major system mostly relies on overland 
drainage conveyance elements. 
More common events, like a 20-year 
storm or a 50-year storm, may be 
disruptive to transportation or other 
aspects of daily life due to flows and 
ponding in streets, but they should not 
result in damage to well maintained 
homes and public infrastructure. 
Rainstorms that overwhelm sanitary 
and stormwater systems should be rare 
events, and they should seldom result 
in damage to homes and infrastructure 
in communities with major and minor 
systems. Unfortunately there have been 
many extreme rainfall events over the
past five to 10 years that have resulted 
in extensive damage to homes and 
infrastructure. 
Moreover, there has been an increase 
in the frequency and severity of 
extreme rainfall events. This is projected 
to increase over the next few decades 
as a result of climate change. By 2100, 
the storm of the century design 
standard of the past may occur five to 
10 times a century.  
In 2002, an extreme rainfall event 
overwhelmed Stratford’s stormwater 
management system. The storm 
resulted in major damages and 
significant costs for the City. There 
was extensive basement flooding in 
hundreds of homes.
This unprecedented flood event also 
resulted in a class action lawsuit against 
the City. The mediated settlement 
provided compensation totalling $7.7 
million to more than 800 homeowners. 
The flooding was a trigger to develop 
a new stormwater management plan 
for Stratford. Prior to the 2002 flood, a 
sanitary sewer master plan was initiated 
to analyze the sanitary collection 
system, identify problems and suggest 
potential solutions. The plan evaluated 
existing and future developments and 
arrived at a conclusion that $35 million 
should be invested in priority projects 
and $16.5 million for other strategic 
projects. In addition, the Sanitary Sewer 
Master Plan recommended to conduct 
a stormwater study that resulted in the 
creation of a City Wide Storm System 
Master Plan. 
THE TRIGGER
60
61
THE APPROACH
The City Wide Storm System Master Plan was completed in October 2004 and 
presented a comprehensive action plan for Stratford to develop and implement the 
required changes and improvements to the storm system infrastructure to meet 
current and future needs. It evaluated the performance of the existing storm system, 
reviewed and updated city drainage policies and created a city-wide computer 
model. Additional activities were also carried out such as the review of the city’s 
drainage policies and standards, the development of a system improvement strategy, 
the implementation of a sewer flow monitoring program and a drainage system 
inventory. Assessments of storm sewer capacities, major drainage system flow and 
ponding areas was also conducted. 
A WORD FROM 
STRATFORD
THE OUTCOME
Through the development of the Storm 
System Master Plan, a Court Drain 
Subwatershed study was conducted in 
2002 and resulted in the introduction 
of a 250 year storm standard for the 
City of Stratford. This proposed new 
standard would lead the City to upgrade 
its infrastructure to accommodate the 
rate of runoff that would occur in a one 
in 250 year rainfall event. As previously 
discussed, a one in 100 year return 
period is a widely accepted standard 
used across Canada in the design of 
stormwater management systems. 
However, Stratford decided that looking 
at the past was no longer sufficient and 
that a 250 year storm standard would 
be more appropriate to prepare for 
future storms. The implementation of a 
250 year design standard implied that 
the City had to change the design of its 
storm system so it could support a 15 
percent increase in peak flows. 
According to Ron Shaw, Stratford’s 
Chief Administrative Officer, “It became 
evident shortly after the flood that 
the problem was not only related 
to the sanitary system and that a 
more global approach was needed to 
prevent similar events from happening 
in the future.” The City of Stratford 
undertook major sanitary and storm 
sewer upgrades after the storm and is 
now considered a leader in basement 
flood prevention. As most Canadian 
Municipalities tend to plan for ‘the 
flood of the century’, Stratford has 
decided to improve its management of 
basement flooding risk by establishing a 
safer flood standard.  
The City of Stratford has spent $70 
million to retrofit its stormwater 
management infrastructure to comply 
with the new 250 year design standard. 
Infrastructure such as stormwater 
management ponds, overland flow 
routes and oversized trunk storm 
sewers were built to accommodate 
surcharging of local systems. Stratford 
also established two incentive programs: 
one to replace old sanitary laterals in 
order to reduce inflow and infiltration 
into the sanitary system and another 
to assist with installing sump pumps 
for storm laterals to reduce the risk of 
surcharging storm mains.

Stormwater Infrastructure Climate 
Change Vulnerability Assessment

THE SCIENCE
THE TRIGGER
Traditionally, local government best 
practices have used historic local weather 
data as the guide for the design and 
maintenance of waste and stormwater 
infrastructure. Lengthy delays by 
Environment Canada to update intensity, 
duration and frequency (IDF) rainfall 
records, combined with growing evidence 
of change in extreme rainfall patterns, 
indicate that traditional approaches to 
waste and stormwater infrastructure 
management are slow to evolve.
The expectation that waste and 
stormwater infrastructure may be in 
place for 50 to 100 years or more further 
increases the importance that both 
historic and future climate considerations 
are addressed. Climate models have 
emerged in recent years as a new tool 
available to local governments to manage 
the impact of extreme rainfall on waste 
and stormwater infrastructure.
Climate projections combined with 
historical data are now available to 
help municipal governments anticipate 
local extreme rainfall risks. Tools have 
been developed, including Engineers 
Canada’s PIEVC assessment protocol, 
assessing how extreme rainfall risks 
can be accommodated in stormwater 
management design, maintenance and 
operations. Municipal infrastructure that 
can cope with, say, a 15 to 20 percent 
increase in the volume of waste and 
stormwater flows may add one percent 
to the initial cost of construction 
while avoiding the risk that waste and 
stormwater infrastructure becomes 
prematurely obsolete and needs to be 
replaced in 20 or 30 years because it 
is unable to cope with the predicable 
increase in flows. 
A small additional initial investment in 
waste and stormwater to use available 
information about the expected change 
in the climate will also reduce the local 
government’s exposure to liability for 
damage to homes from sewers backing 
up.
In 2009, the City of Castlegar became 
part of a case study evaluation of various 
types of infrastructure in different 
climate settings throughout the country. 
The Columbia Basin Trust provided 
funding to apply Engineers Canada’s 
Public Infrastructure Engineering 
Vulnerability Committee (PIEVC) 
Engineering Protocol for Climate 
Change Infrastructure Vulnerability 
Assessment. The study focused on the 
impact of climate change on the city’s 
stormwater infrastructure.
Local officials and other stakeholders 
were concerned that watersheds 
surrounding Castlegar were changing 
and that these changes could 
eventually affect the reliability of local 
stormwater infrastructure. Under the 
PIEVC protocol, a vulnerability risk 
assessment of Castelgar’s stormwater 
infrastructure was developed to identify 
the components most vulnerable to 
future climate events.  Three years after 
specific recommendations emerged 
from this study, the City of Castlegar 
faced a spring marked by heavy rainfall 
events that caused widespread flooding 
and heavy erosion throughout the City. 
The recommendations made through 
the PIEVC assessment provided timely 
advice to support implementation of 
a number of actions to rehabilitate 
the most vulnerable stormwater 
infrastructure.

The protocol used for the study was divided into five distinct steps: project 
definition, data gathering and sufficiency, risk assessment, engineering analysis, and 
recommendations. For the first step, the team developed system boundaries 
for an adequate assessment of infrastructure vulnerabilities. In order to achieve 
this, the City first considered stormwater infrastructure in a broader context 
by looking at catchment and various drainage areas, physical infrastructure and 
operations, maintenance and resource requirements for stormwater management. 
The City then decided to focus the study on the infrastructure draining five upland 
catchments since they were the most likely to be impacted by climate change.
A team from the Pacific Climate Impact Consortium was brought into the project 
to help assess the local probabilities of climate change, including changes in the 
intensity, duration and frequency of extreme rainfall events. For the City of Castlegar, 
climate models projected more rain and less snow, with an increased risk of 
extreme rainfall events that could result in more frequent and larger flow events in 
streams and stormwater management systems.
The study conducted under the PIEVC protocol indicated that the City of Castlegar 
is vulnerable to climate change. Over the course of the study, 11 climate change 
events were applied to 35 infrastructure elements and 313 interactions were 
considered to have a cause-and-effect relationship necessitating further assessment. 
This assessment revealed that 34 of the 35 stormwater infrastructure elements 
studied were at medium or high risk, including 10 at high risk.
A WORD FROM 
CASTLEGAR
The study recommended that the City 
review the 10 high risk infrastructure 
elements, develop an action plan to 
address these issues and explore funding 
opportunities that might be available at 
the provincial level to quickly fix these 
elements. In order to address the 10 
high risks elements, actions such as the 
development of a mitigation strategy 
to prevent erosion for a creek, resizing 
certain culverts and storm sewer trunks 
and improving sections of a stream 
channel to carry expected peak flow 
were deemed necessary. 
When Castlegar faced heavy rain events 
in the spring of 2012, the City conducted 
infrastructure workshops with the City’s 
Public Works Department in order to 
explain which infrastructure elements 
were identified as the most vulnerable 
and to have a discussion about which 
other elements might have been 
identified as vulnerable by the workers. 
“Some of the projects we decided to 
work on were related to the study and 
some others were things we noticed by 
looking closer in the field by looking at 
specific elements and wondering how 
much of a risk they were. This process 
brought up things we never questioned 
before and encouraged us to do more 
preventative work,” said Chris Barlow, 
Director of Transportation and Civic 
Works for the City of Castlegar. 
The study also brought a change in the 
way the City was monitoring extreme 
rainfall events. As an example, it was 
identified in the PIEVC report that inlets 
and outlets were an issue. 
Altough there was no budget available to 
conduct rehabilitation work, the City
started to monitor weather forecasts 
more closely and sent a crew to 
check inlets and outlets every time a 
heavy rain event occurred. Since 2012, 
several large stormwater infrastructure 
projects were also completed such as 
the installation of storm sewers in areas 
that were washed out during previous 
storm events and the addition of curb 
gutters.
The Stormwater Infrastructure Climate 
Change Vulnerability Assessment 
also contributed to the development 
of a comprehensive climate change 
adaptation strategy for the City of 
Castlegar. In addition, it became part of 
a learning network established by the 
Columbia Basin Trust to support other 
Basin communities with climate change 
adaptation. 
When asked for his thoughts on the 
Stormwater Infrastructure Climate 
Change Vulnerability Assessment, 
Mr. Barlow mentioned that one of 
the aspects that made this project 
successful was the involvement of 
multiple stakeholders. “When we first 
looked at vulnerabilities, we brought in 
our Public Works Department. They 
are the front line guys and the ones 
that are the most aware of what is 
really happening in the field. Bringing 
these people into this training helped 
a lot.” Mr. Barlow also mentioned 
the importance of including elected 
officials early on in the process since 
funding is always necessary for the 
successful completion of infrastructure 
rehabilitation projects.

THE SCIENCE

THE APPROACH
The sanitary waste system takes 
wastewater discharged from toilets, 
sinks and other household plumbing 
through municipal sewer pipes to a 
treatment facility. An independent 
stormwater system transports rainwater 
underground in sewer pipes or above 
ground flow in ditches, sending this 
water into local surface water after some 
treatment. Independent (i.e. separated) 
waste and stormwater sewer systems 
have been municipal best practice for 
new developments for the past five or 
six decades. However, before current 
practices were adopted, the approach in 
Canada had been to service homes with 
a combined sewer system to carry both 
sanitary waste and stormwater.
Combined systems continue to serve 
many homes across Canada, particularly 
in older neighbourhoods. Combined 
sewers are designed to discharge 
untreated sewage into local receiving 
waterbodies during intense precipitation 
events.
Some local governments replace 
combined sewers when they approach 
the end of their service life, choosing to 
install independent sanitary and storm 
water systems. Nevertheless, many 
homes in Canada are presently serviced 
by combined sewers.
although a secondary impact of the 
approach chosen may be a reduction 
in the risk of damage to homes 
connected to combined sewers from 
the backup of sanitary wastewater.
The federal Fisheries Act prohibits the 
discharge of stormwater runoff that 
would negatively impact fish and their 
habitat. In order to understand and 
prevent changes in stormwater runoff 
quantity and quality, Metro Vancouver, 
its member municipalities, and 
provincial and federal environmental 
agencies combined their efforts in 
the formation of the Stormwater 
Interagency Liaison Group in 2002 
under the provincially approved 
Liquid Waste Management Plan. This 
organization’s main objective was 
to facilitate the co-ordination and 
sharing of common research related to 
stormwater management.
Metro Vancouver is seeking to eliminate 
the discharge of untreated sanitary 
waste during extreme rainfall events. 
The primary objective of the member 
municipalities of Metro Vancouver is to 
eliminate the discharge of pollutants, 
THE TRIGGER
THE APPROACH
In 2002, several environmental goals 
for the province were set under the 
Liquid Waste Management Plan. Since 
the largest impact of climate change in 
this area is expected to be increased 
frequency and severity of intense 
rainfall events. It was considered 
crucial for the Metro Vancouver area 
to improve stormwater management. 
Starting in 2002, Metro Vancouver 
initiated sewer studies analyzing long 
term rainfall records and climate 
change scenarios.
One of the goals of the Plan is the 
elimination of wet weather combined 
sewer overflows. In order to reach that 
goal, all combined sewer systems in 
Metro Vancouver will be replaced with

separated sewer systems. 
Metro Vancouver has relatively young cities that experienced considerable growth 
in recent decades. Most of this expansion has been supported by modern sewer 
infrastructure. Some older neighbourhoods have legacy combined sewer systems 
but combined sewers are less common in Greater Vancouver than in many other 
large, older cities in North America. 
THE OUTCOME
In the Metro Vancouver area, the three municipalities with the highest percentage of 
combined sewers are Vancouver, Burnaby and New Westminster. Other 
A WORD FROM 
VANCOUVER
communities were developed more 
recently and were predominantly built 
with separate sewer systems. Vancouver, 
Burnaby and New Westminister have 
launched multi-year sewer separation 
programs, with regular reporting to the 
public in neighbourhoods where the 
work is completed, and a schedule for 
future work. Most combined sewers are 
to be replaced by 2050, with the last 
replaced by 2075.
The major challenge to emerge 
involves addressing sewer laterals on 
private property. The main purpose of 
the sewer separation program is the 
long-term elimination of wet weather 
combined sewer overflows into the 
ocean and Fraser River. To also reduce 
the risk of sewer backup, some work 
on private properties would need to 
be done. Sewer backups are generally 
caused by excessive amounts of 
rainwater inflow and groundwater 
infiltration entering the sanitary sewer, 
or by blockages caused by tree roots 
or debris in private sewer laterals. 
Excessive infiltration can occur when 
foundation drains and roof downspouts 
are incorrectly connected to sanitary 
sewers, or when the condition of the 
sewer lateral is poor, allowing excessive 
groundwater to flow into the sanitary 
sewer.
Metro Vancouver commissioned 
research to explore whether it would 
be feasible to implement a regulatory 
private sewer lateral certificate 
program in Metro Vancouver. The study 
reported that using the time-of-sale 
of a home or a property transfer as a 
triggering circumstance for requiring the 
rehabilitation of private sewer laterals 
could be a feasible option for 
long-term management of inflow 
and infiltration from private 
properties. That option would 
imply a commitment from external 
key professionals in the building, 
plumbing, real estate and property 
transfer industries. Sewer lateral 
maintenance and rehabilitation tend 
to be far out of the average property 
owner’s regular consciousness and, 
according to the report, “success is 
most likely to result from a staged 
timeline for implementation, to 
build understanding of the issues, 
acceptance of responsibilities, and 
move towards a general acceptance 
of the need for regular private sewer 
lateral maintenance over the long 
term.” It would be the role of Metro 
Vancouver municipalities to enforce 
these recommendations through 
various programs or by-laws.
As explained by Robert Hicks, Senior 
Engineer, Liquid Waste Services 
Department for Metro Vancouver, 
“Private sewer laterals seldom receive 
any maintenance or inspection after 
their initial construction and most 
property owners do not know the 
condition of their sewer connections.” 
The private portion of a sewer system 
is more difficult for municipalities to 
tackle because of complex jurisdiction 
issues. In Metro Vancouver, several 
jurisdictions, like the City of Surrey 
and Vancouver, have implemented 
sewer lateral replacement programs 
to minimize the long-term impact of 
inflow and infiltration.

Mandatory backwater valves in all new 
homes
70
71
THE SCIENCE
THE TRIGGER
Extreme rainfall events have resulted 
in widespread basement flood damage 
across Canada. Damage has been 
evident in older neighbourhoods but 
surprisingly also in newer homes. This 
includes some homes supported by 
relatively new infrastructure, separated 
sewer systems and modern best 
practices for home construction. In 
particular, data provided by insurance 
companies shows an alarming increase 
in loss and damage to homes through 
the backing up of water and sanitary 
waste through sewer laterals.
Damage to homes in Canada from 
sewer backup exceeds $2 billion a 
year. Most of the damage to homes 
from the backflow of sanitary sewers 
is preventable. A backwater valve can 
be installed in new homes for less 
than $250 and automatically closes 
when wastewater flows back through 
the sewer system toward a home, 
significantly reducing the risk of damage. 
Provincial building codes require the 
installation of a backwater valve in new 
homes “where a building drain or a 
branch may be subject to blackflow”. 
However, thousands of new homes are 
built in Canada each year without a 
backwater valve. This is due to ambiguity 
about when a home may be subject to 
backflow. Some homebuilders and local 
code enforcement officials seek a prior 
history of basement flooding in the area 
as evidence of the risk, so many new 
homes do not have a backwater valve. 
Several recent large scale sewer backup 
events in relatively new separated 
sewer systems indicate that all homes 
connected to public underground 
sanitary sewer systems have the 
potential to experience sewer back up. 
Unfortunately, the wording of current 
provincial building codes is unclear 
about when to install a valve. 
Several communities, like Collingwood, 
have taken action to address ambiguity 
in the building code by giving clear 
direction to developers and builders 
that all new homes connected to 
the sanitary sewer system are at risk 
of backflow so a backwater valve is 
required. This may involve revision 
of a local by-law or clarification of 
enforcement practices.
Collingwood’s Director of Building 
Services and Chief Building Official 
participated in an ICLR study on how 
municipal officials interpreted the 
building code provision concerning 
backwater valves in new houses. The 
research led the Director to review the 
evidence of increasing risk of basement 
flooding during extreme rainfall events, 
and to consult with local homebuilders 
about the risk of backflow. This resulted 
in a public statement by the Director 
on January 10, 2013 that all new 
homes in Collingwood connected to 
the sewer system require a backwater 
valve.
A number of communities across 
Canada have begun to mandate the 
installation of backwater valves in all 
new homes. Typically this change was

Discussions between ICLR and building code officials across the country have found 
significant variation in local interpretation of the building code requirement for the 
installation of backwater valves in new homes. The findings of consultations with 
local code enforcement officials were identified by Collingwood as influential in 
their decision to require backwater valves in all new homes.
THE APPROACH
A WORD FROM 
COLLINGWOOD
THE OUTCOME
Town officials in Collingwood confirmed 
with local developers and builders that 
there is some risk of backflow in all 
homes connected to the sewer system, 
including new homes. Accordingly, the 
Town decided that interpretation of 
the building code would require the 
installation of a backwater valve in all 
new homes. Moreover, Collingwood 
chose to avoid the potentially complex 
task of developing a by-law, an approach 
that has been used in some other 
communities seeking to ensure the 
benefits of backwater valves. Rather, 
Collingwood issued a public statement 
about its interpretation of the current 
building code. On January 10, 2013, Bill 
Plewes drafted a letter indicating that 
the Town requires backwater valves in 
all new home construction effective 
February 1, 2013. The Chief Building 
official noted in his letter that “there 
is enough historical data collected in 
Collingwood to require backwater 
valves be installed in every new dwelling 
that has fixture(s) below adjoining street 
level.”
inexpensive. Some contractors even 
mention that a backwater valve is one 
of the best investments they can put 
in a new home. A small investment in 
safety can significantly reduce the risk 
of damage to homes and may even 
lower the cost of insurance.
Town officials indicated that a useful 
area for future work would focus on 
actions to encourage the installation of 
backwater valves in existing homes. In 
particular the Town may explore the 
idea of a by-law for property owners 
that conduct a major renovation to 
mandate installation of a backwater 
valve.
Collingwood issued a public letter 
indicating that the Town would require 
the installation of backwater valves in all 
new home construction. This decision 
was well received by developers. Some 
developers are using the backwater 
valve as a selling feature, noting that 
most of the existing homes in the region 
do not have a backwater valve but 
these safety features are present in new 
homes. There was no push back from 
home builders in Collingwood since 
backwater valves are easy to install and

Services and Chief Building Official, 
said “We found it very easy to make 
the installation of backwater valves 
mandatory. Interpreting the code 
in a way that requires developers 
to install backwater valves in new 
homes allowed the Town to avoid 
the complicated task of developing 
a municipal by-law to require this 
important measure.”

Lot grading drainage by-law

THE SCIENCE
THE TRIGGER
THE APPROACH
Lot grading is a powerful mechanism for 
managing the risk of damage to buildings 
from extreme rainfall. Where possible, 
water should be directed safely away 
from buildings through appropriate 
grading to reduce the risk of damage 
from inflow and flooding associated with 
overland flows and seepage. Moreover, 
if water is permitted to accumulate near 
buildings, it can overwhelm drainage 
systems and sewers, increasing the risk 
of sewer backup damage to the building 
and neighbourhood, and water damage 
from flooded basements, especially 
when foundation drainage is connected 
to sewer systems.
Land that slopes toward buildings 
increases risk of flood damage, while 
the risk is reduced if the land slopes 
away. Water should be directed 
toward permeable surfaces, like grass 
covered swales, lawns, rain gardens, and 
appropriate stormwater management 
infrastructure. The lot grading must not 
increase flood risk for neighbouring 
properties.
Moreover, appropriate lot grading 
created during the construction of a 
new residential development needs to 
be maintained to remain effective. Over 
time, land will settle and may reduce 
the protection initially in place. Also 
property owners may inadvertently 
alter the lot grading protection for 
their homes through landscaping and 
gardening projects. Responsibility for 
ensuring the effectiveness of lot grading 
shifts over time from homebuilders 
and landscape specialists during initial 
construction to the property owner.
Edmonton is widely recognized for 
its leadership in the identification 
and implementation of local actions 
to reduce the risk of damage to 
homes from basement flooding. 
Many elements of Edmonton’s 
comprehensive flood reduction 
strategy have been in place for more 
than three decades, like a requirement 
that all new homes install a backwater 
valve (1989).
The City of Edmonton has also been 
a pioneer in testing actions to address 
lot grading. This evolved from a strong 
relationship with local developers and 
home builders seeking direction from 
the City about how to best address 
the risk of basement flooding. In the 
mid-1980s, surveyors, developers 
and builders approached the City to 
create an enforcement process for all 
developers, builders and owners for 
an approved surface drainage plan 
design. In 1988, the Municipal Planning 
Commission requested that a strategy 
be developed to enforce lot grading 
design plans for new developments.
The Drainage By-law was developed 
and implemented by the City of 
Edmonton to reduce flood risk in 
new buildings through appropriate lot 
grading. The by-law requires that the 
City Manager approve surface elevations 
and grades of residential lots in two 
stages: the rough grade and the final 
grade. The rough grade stage is typically 
the responsibility of the homebuilder. 
During this phase, the lot is graded 
approximately seven to 20 cm below

the proposed final grade elevations in order to generate a drainage template before 
the final grading and landscaping.
Once that step is completed, seven to 20 cm of topsoil is placed on the lot to 
create the final surface drainage pattern. An inspection has to be completed by 
a lot grading inspector following the completion of each phase to determine if 
the surface elevations are within acceptable tolerance of the design elevations on 
the approved Lot Grading Plan. During the inspection, inspectors make sure that 
driveways and sidewalks are completed, that the site is clean and free of debris and 
construction materials, that the grading is uniform and free of ruts, depressions or 
excess soils, and that the lot slopes away from foundation walls.
Every sloped surface on a lot has to effectively drain water away from foundation

EDMONTON
THE OUTCOME
foundation walls, including areas 
under steps and decks. To meet this 
requirement, a 10 percent slope has to 
be generated for the first 2.0 m around 
the building with a minimum of 20 cm 
drop for final landscaping. The slope 
standard for concrete, asphalt and other 
impervious surfaces is 0.75 percent. The 
slope standard for grass drainage swales 
is 1.5 percent and paved swales have 
to meet a minimum slope requirement 
of 0.75 percent. Swales are lower tracts 
of land designed to collect and convey 
surface runoff away from the building. 
The standards apply to new home 
construction and major renovations.
Edmonton has been recognized for 
its leadership in addressing a number 
of stormwater management issues, 
including lot grading. Since the adoption 
of the Drainage By-law, several 
municipalities across Alberta have 
approached the City of Edmonton to 
mirror their lot grading requirements.
THE OUTCOME
The establishment of the lot grading 
by-law in Edmonton has evolved over 
three decades. Following  requests by 
surveyors, developers and builders, 
the City of Edmonton implemented 
drainage and lot-grading standards 
under the Minimum Property Standards 
By-law in 1989. Edmonton’s Building 
by-law was amended in 1993 to 
accommodate lot grading approval 
fees and from this point residents who 
applied for a building permit were asked 
to cover the charges of lot grading 
approval. In 1997, the Surface Drainage 
By-law came into effect, consolidating 
parts of the Minimum Property 
Standards and Edmonton Building by-
laws. The Surface Drainage By-law was 
consolidated into the Drainage Bylaw on 
June 1, 2013. 
Even though the drainage by-law only 
came into effect as it is today in the late 
1990s, the lot grading standards stated 
in the by-law are enforced retroactively 
for all properties developed after 1989.  
A WORD FROM  
EDMONTON
When asked for his thoughts on the 
Drainage by-law, Filipe Gonçalves, 
Lot Grading Inspector for the City 
of Edmonton, suggested that it was a 
great method to establish a standard 
for the industry and owners in order 
to avoid drainage issues for properties. 
Mr. Gonçalves stated that “…during 
the implementation process, we faced 
some resistance from property owners 
back in 1993 when the final grade 
inspection became mandatory. At the 
time, some property owners felt like 
a surprise additional cost was added 
when renovating or buying a new 
property. Now, the owners expect that 
cost as part of the purchase of a new 
property since the process has been in 
place for more than 20 years.”

By-Law to prohibit construction of 
reverse slope driveways

THE SCIENCE
THE TRIGGER
Figure 22: Flooded driveways following an extreme rain event. (Source: ICLR)
Reverse slope driveways are present in 
many communities across Canada. This 
kind of driveway tends to be found in 
high-density areas where there is limited 
area to build external garages. However, 
reverse slope driveways increase the risk 
of basement flooding.
Reverse slope driveways have a high 
potential to direct overland stormwater 
into homes. Stormwater directed into a 
house through a reverse slope driveway 
may also increase the risk of sewer 
backup when the water enters the 
sanitary sewer system through basement 
floor drains. In some cases reverse slope 
driveways have catch basins connected 
into the weeping tile system or 
sanitary sewer lateral increasing sewer 
backup risks for the home and the 
neighbourhood. Connections into storm 
systems can be a problem. The resulting 
surcharge in the municipal sewer 
system may force stormwater back into 
catch basins, where it may flow into 
basements, garages and weeping tiles. 
Catch basins may also be blocked by 
debris which can reduce their draining 
capacity and further increase the risk of 
basement flooding.
In August 2005, a major storm struck 
Southern Ontario. Until July 2013, 
this was the most expensive natural 
catastrophe in Ontario history costing 
insurance companies $718M (2013 
dollars). As much as 153 mm of rain fell 
on the Northwest area of Toronto in 
less than three hours, causing extensive 
damages in Southern Ontario. 
There was significant basement flood 
damage in the West Thornhill area of 
Markham. Damage to residences in this 
area, like other older neighbourhoods 
in the storm’s path, was affected by 
limitations in the capacity of the surface 
drainage system and high infiltration 
overwhelming the wastewater 
system. Storm flows and volumes 
exceeded the storm and wastewater 
infrastructure capacities in the area. 
In the aftermath of the August 2005 
storm, residents petitioned the City 
of Markham for remedial measures 
to prevent future problems. The 
public was seeking a long-term and 
comprehensive plan for reducing the 
risk of basement flood damage in 
Markham.
THE APPROACH

The City of Markham initiated a Municipal Class Environmental Assessment study 
and hired a consulting firm to identify preferred alternatives to improve current 
storm system performance in West Thornhill and increase it to an appropriate 
level of protection. The City also initiated an internal review of wastewater system 
capacity to identify required upgrades and infiltration reduction opportunities.
In addition to an assessment of the City’s storm sewer capacity, other measures 
were identified that could reduce the amount of run-off entering the sewer system. 
The study was to identify and assess a broad range of measures that could be 
undertaken by the City and by property owners. The external consultant and 
internal reviewers sought to provide a comprehensive assessment of alternative

these neighbourhoods will be reduced 
by requiring homeowners to fix the 
cross-connection.
THE OUTCOME
In April 2012, a by-law amendment 
was approved by the City of Markham 
prohibiting reverse slope driveways 
for new home construction. Where 
a private driveway leads to a parking 
garage attached to a dwelling unit, the 
finished floor elevation of a garage must 
be higher than the elevation of the 
public street or public lane from which 
access to the parking garage is provided. 
The by-law is enforced when developers 
and property owners submit their 
construction plans to the City.
Markham is also taking action to reduce 
the risk of basement flooding for existing 
homes with reverse slope driveways. 
The City is seeking to limit the depth 
of water on the street by adding more 
sewer and inlet capacity to reduce the 
risk of spill onto driveways. This measure 
has been taken in areas that have faced 
historical flooding problems. Markham 
also has a road operations group that is 
doing minor asphalt grading at locations 
where the grade is not sufficient 
between the road gutter and the high 
point in the driveway (see illustration 23 
& 24). 
Recently, while conducting sewer smoke 
testing, the City of Markham found that 
some reverse driveway catch basins 
were potentially connected to the

Rain gardens and swales in brownfields

THE SCIENCE
THE TRIGGER
THE APPROACH
Many communities across Canada have 
brownfield lands with potential for 
development if specific environmental 
challenges are successfully addressed. 
These are often former industrial sites 
requiring treatment of contaminated 
soils before development can proceed. 
Stormwater management is often an 
important dimension of successful 
brownfield redevelopment, particularly 
for large projects.
During development of brownfield 
sites, and later when the lands are 
returned to active use, it is essential 
that contaminated runoff does not 
pollute nearby streams, lakes and rivers. 
Moreover, redevelopment has the 
potential to significantly alter the rate 
and volume of stormwater flows but 
can be designed to avoid or at least 
reduce increasing the risk of damage 
to existing and future homes and other 
dwellings in the area during extreme 
rainfall events.
The Low Impact Development (LID) 
approach to stormwater management 
and site development is becoming 
popular as a mechanism to provide 
localized, small-scale source water 
control. This approach uses natural 
features like rain gardens, retention 
basins and swales, as an alternative or 
supplement to traditional stormwater 
management infrastructure like 
underground piping, gutters or curbs.
in Calgary, in 2005, 2010 and 2013. The 
City has also experienced a number of 
other damaging extreme rainfall events 
over the past few decades, with losses 
affecting the cost of providing municipal 
services, the price of insurance and 
ultimately, the cost of living in Calgary.
Currie Barracks presents a novel 
approach to urban flooding. Local 
awareness of the potential adverse 
impact of severe weather has been 
particularly evident in Calgary after 
the many extreme events experienced 
in the city, events that oriented the 
approaches taken to enhance this re-
development project.
Canada Lands Company and the City 
of Calgary were looking to redevelop 
Currie Barracks, a former military 
site near the downtown of the City. 
This brownfield site was to become 
a medium- to high-density residential 
development. Calgary was seeking an 
innovative approach to stormwater 
management because of restrictions in 
the capacity of the downstream storm 
sewer system stormwater systems to 
accept the projected increases in runoff 
from the site.
The consulting engineer for this project 
developed a Low Impact Development 
design to ensure that the rate of 
the runoff leaving the site would not 
exceed the capacity of the downstream 
stormwater system. In particular, 
abandoned fields were converted 
into rain gardens, vegetated swales 
and gravel infiltration trenches were 
incorporated at strategic locations as 
part of the green space in the new 
urban fabric.

The rain gardens were designed with topsoil blended with compost and drywall 
surplus materials with a thickness of over 1.0 m compared to 10 to 15 cm of topsoil 
in a traditional development. This type of soil combined with the use of vegetated 
swales made it possible for the area to accumulate most of the rainwater long 
enough for it to seep and replenish groundwater. The amount of hard area in Currie 
Barracks is similar to, or actually even higher than pre-development conditions 
because of the higher density. However, it is dealt with in a better way by making the 
landscaped areas act as a sponge. The water is then distributed around the site and 
does not overwhelm the city’s stormwater system.
THE OUTCOME
The Currie Barracks brownfield project was successful in retaining most peak rainfall 
on site, meeting the design challenge of limiting discharge from the property. The 
project also addressed concerns about the functionality of the design feature

during winter freeze-thaw events. Low 
Impact Development projects rely on 
soil moisture, evapotranspiration and 
infiltration to absorb heavy rainfall 
but these natural processes may not 
perform as well in cold climates. In 
addition, traditional catch basins tend 
to clog during Chinook conditions, 
common in Calgary, due to the 
bottom outlet design being at risk of 
clogging and freezing. This problem was 
addressed in the project with the design 
of a raised outlet with a non-clogging 
tie-in to the storm sewer system.
During the approval process of the 
project, several meetings were held that 
included various stakeholders such as 
the design team, approvals departments 
and senior management. Together 
they worked through the specific 
differences between the proposed Low 
Impact Development design and more 
traditional stormwater management 
designs. In addition, multiple meetings as 
well as weekly site meetings were held 
with the entire team to ensure that the 
principles and goals behind the design of 
the Currie Barracks brownfield project 
were properly understood by everyone. 
In parallel, the City of Calgary developed 
a Stormwater Source Control 
Handbook to address design criteria for 
Low Impact Development applications 
within the city. Before releasing the 
Handbook, the City of Calgary made 
sure that the personnel assessing the 
design and granting approval were well 
trained and had a good understanding 
of Low Impact Development principles.
The Currie Barracks brownfield  re-
development project was also used as a 
pilot project in Canada for LEED
Neighbourhood Development, a 
rating system that integrates the 
principles of smart growth, urbanism 
and green building into a system for 
neighborhood design. The approved 
site plan of the project has received a 
Stage 2 Gold rating. The project also 
received the Consulting Engineers 
of Alberta award for progressive 
engineering for its Low Impact 
Development stormwater design.
A WORD FROM  
CALGARY
At the time the Currie Barracks 
brownfield project was developed, the 
concept of Low Impact Development 
was fairly new to the City of Calgary. 
For this reason, the approval process 
was more challenging since City staff 
was not familiar with the specificities 
of Low Impact Development as many 
of the proposed features were not 
standard. Currently, the City of Calgary 
continues to develop Low Impact 
Development applications throughout 
the City. “Any upcoming greenfield 
development and redevelopment 
will need to be very Low Impact 
Development intensive to meet new 
stormwater targets and guidelines,” said 
Bert Van Duin, Senior Development 
Engineer for the City of Calgary. Mr. Van 
Duin concluded by mentioning that 
as long as Low Impact Development 
features are used appropriately, they 
should be implemented on all future 
projects.

THE TRIGGER
Greenfield developments sometimes 
transform farmland, forests and 
pastureland into modern, high-density 
housing. Land that previously had 
considerable capacity to absorb and 
slow rainfall flows may become covered 
with roads, buildings, shopping malls 
and other impermeable surfaces with 
little capacity to absorb rainfall. There 
can be a considerable change in the 
flow of stormwater in the area that 
is developed and to adjacent regions. 
Changes in stormwater flows both 
negatively affect the environment and 
increase flood risk. Also, established, 
downstream homes some distance 
away may begin to experience an 
increased risk of basement flooding 
and water damage as rainfall during 
extreme events quickly flows out 
of impermeable, developed lands 
into established neighbourhoods 
overwhelming the capacity of existing 
stormwater management systems.
Boucherville chose to orient the 
development of this neighbourhood in 
a way that would reduce the expected 
peak flow of stormwater from the 
new neighbourhood into the river 
during extreme rainfall events, and to 
ensure that waters that eventually flow 
into the river were naturally filtered 
to absorb pollutants from rooftops 
and paved surfaces. Boucherville also 
identified the potential of the new 
development to provide recreation 
features for residents, including 
attractive natural paths for walking, 
jogging and cycling.
Consulting engineers conducted 
preliminary studies that included 
hydrologic simulations to help 
determine the best stormwater 
management practices for the new 
Harmonie neighbourhood. The 
research identified an approach using 
double drainage principles. There would 
be wet and dry detention ponds in the 
neighbourhood. Two ponds or small 
urban lakes would have permanent 
water retention (wet detention ponds), 
and two ponds would be dry most 
of the time but would have capacity 
to temporarily hold water in the 
eventuality of heavy rainfall events (dry 
detention ponds). Drainage pathways 
were created to connect the dry ponds 
to wet ponds.
The four ponds protect the quality of 
urban water runoff from roads, parking 
lots, residential neighbourhoods and 
other impervious areas. The ponds also 
help to reduce peak stormwater runoff 
rates by providing temporary storage
The City of Boucherville wanted to 
grow and welcome new development. 
When the City decided to develop the 
Harmonie neighbourhood, they faced 
a stormwater management problem. 
The Sabrevois River located nearby 
could only safely cope with a limited 
amount of stormwater runoff before 
encountering the risk of environmental 
problems. Also, the cost of installing 
new high-capacity sewer systems and 
rainwater collectors would be expensive 
- a cost that the City did not want 
to impose on developers and new 
residents.

during heavy rainfall events. The wet 
detention ponds have plants that 
provide a natural filter for storm water. 
Dry detention ponds are designed to 
drain within 24 hours after a storm. The 
four ponds provide a capacity to retain 
extreme rainfall water volumes similar 
to that present before the development, 
minimizing the risk of increase 
stormwater flowing into established 
neighbourhoods and resulting in flood 
risk reduction.
The Harmonie project received 
Quebec’s Consulting Engineering 
Award for its stormwater
management system. The project 
has been popular with the citizens 
of Boucherville and demonstrates 
sustainable approaches to new 
development, where actions to 
support growth can be consistent with 
environmental protection.
When asked for his thoughts on the 
project, Claude Poirier, Engineer for 
the City of Boucherville responded 
that “the project has been successful 
and extremely well received by 
the population because the City 
was not afraid to be visionary. 
Many stakeholders were involved 
and decided to join their efforts 
and worked together in the same 
direction. There was a vision for that 
neighborhood. Instead of just digging 
big holes in the ground, we were able 
to create an attraction that became 
highly popular in the neighbourhood,” 
says Mr. Poirier.
The project achieved a number 
of recreational and environmental 
objectives beyond minimizing the 
impact of the new development on the 
stormwater management capacity in 
existing neighbourhoods.
The small urban lakes created in 
Boucherville were used as the 
starting point of the neighbourhood’s 
development. After their construction, 
they were connected to municipal 
parks by multifunctional corridors for 
cyclists and pedestrians. These corridors 
surrounded by drainage ditches were 
used for draining purposes, but also 
to connect the new parts of the 
neighbourhood with the rest of the city. 
Through this land use planning, the city 
created ‘blue’ and ‘green’ networks that 
increased the popularity of the area. 
One of the urban lakes created in 
the project was also conceived as a 
mitigation measure to control erosion 
on the Sabrevois River by procuring 
better waterflow control. This same 
lake also allowed best stormwater 
management practices because of 
its high retention capacity that helps 
prevent flooding in the event of a one 
in 50 year extreme rainfall, compared to 
the one in 10 year capacity of traditional 
systems in the City.

Local action has the potential to 
significantly reduce the risk of 
damage to homes from sewer 
backup and basement flooding 
resulting from extreme rainfall. Ideally, 
local governments should pursue a 
comprehensive strategy that includes 
communication, local actions and 
incentives for action for private property 
owners. Critical elements of a plan are 
set out below:
COMMUNICATION
Sewer backup and basement flooding 
during extreme rainfall events has 
recently emerged as the leading cause 
of damage to homes in Canada. Water 
damage to homes has increased 
significantly over the past five to 10 
years, and a further increase is inevitable 
over the next few decades unless steps 
are taken to reduce risk.
Surprisingly, homeowner awareness 
about the peril is very low. A primary 
objective of local government 
communication should involve informing 
property owners about the risk. All 
homes connected to the sanitary and 
stormwater systems are at some risk of 
damage from backup. Overall damage 
to homes is presently in excess of $2 
billion a year with most of the damage 
being preventable
The Government of Canada issues 
more than 13,000 severe weather 
warnings each year. Most do not result 
in damage to homes. Most homes 
in Canada are well built and well 
maintained. In circumstances when 
extreme rainfall results in damage to 
homes property owners typically
blame their local government. Local 
governments are seen to “own” the 
issue of basement flooding.
Wastewater and stormwater in 
municipal sewers can back up into 
homes and cause damage due to 
decisions made by local governments 
and also decisions made by private 
property owners. Communications 
should identify the need for action by 
both the government and property 
owners, while stressing the importance 
of leadership from the local 
government.
In some circumstances, like the efforts 
of the City of London in Sherwood 
Forest, communication will involve 
local officials visiting individual 
property owners in their homes to 
discuss implementing specific plans to 
protect their particular home. In other 
circumstances, like Quebec City’s effort 
in Maizerets, escalating communication 
was required over a period of almost 
three years before 100 percent 
homeowner participation was secured.
The effort in Halifax Region focuses 
on educating homeowners about the 
costs and benefits of a broad range 
of options that could be implemented 
by property owners. In contrast, 
communication in Toronto needed to 
increase awareness that a voluntary 
program funded by the City had 
evolved into a mandatory program 
funded by homeowners. 
Some programs, like the one offered by 
Moncton, targeted homes at high risk 
of basement flooding, and needed to 
include information about why these
homes were selected. Other programs, 
like the incentive program in Winnipeg, 
is available throughout the City to any 
household that does not yet have a 
backwater valve, focusing the program 
on the benefits of action.
Some programs target new home 
construction, like those in Markham, 
Ottawa, Edmonton and Collingwood, 
so the primary audience includes 
builders, developers, landscapers and 
building code enforcement officials. 
Other programs aim at influencing the 
behaviour of existing homeowners, 
so the communication and policy 
challenges can use a variety of tools 
including information, financial incentives, 
regulatory requirements and even fines.
An exciting recent development involves 
the use of Low Impact Development 
design in new developments with the 
object of retaining stormwater in the 
new development while minimizing 
the impact on the capacity of the 
existing stormwater system. Low Impact 
Development, like that in Calgary, is 
expected to emerge across the country 
as an important tool for managing 
stormwater in new developments and 
reducing the potential adverse impact of 
development on existing homes.
Communication needs to be tailored 
to the specific circumstances of the 
basement flood reduction program, with 
considerable scope to learn from the 
experience of other communities across 
Canada. Communication will often need 
to be sustained over several decades, 
like that in Edmonton and Winnipeg. 
Communication needs to acknowledge 
the importance of local leadership
while introducing the idea that local 
governments and private property 
owners share responsibility for 
managing the risk.
LOCAL ACTIONS
Local and regional governments 
are responsible for the systems that 
treat sanitary wastewater and for 
stormwater management. Local 
decisions about the design and 
management of these systems can 
increase or reduce the risk that 
untreated waste and water are driven 
into homes during extreme rainfall 
events.
Wastewater from toilets, sinks and 
other plumbing flow through sanitary 
sewers to treatment facilities. The 
risk that sanitary sewers backup and 
damage homes is associated with 
the initial construction, and ongoing 
maintenance of the sewers. Moreover, 
the risk is significantly affected by inflow 
and infiltration of excess water into 
sanitary systems.
Ongoing performance monitoring is 
an essential element of managing this 
risk. Victoria seeks to ensure that wet 
water flows never exceed four times 
dry water flow through sanitary sewer 
pipes. Local governments should set a 
performance target and monitor the 
system to determine when action is 
required.
Detailed research is often required 
to determine the source of problems. 
The City of London determined that 
weeping tile connections increase the 
inflow of rainwater into sanitary sewers.
Surrey determined that inflow and 
infiltration in their community was the 
result of private storm lateral failures. 
Quebec City and Toronto chose to 
focus on downspout disconnection. 
Some communities use smoke tests to 
find illegal cross connections between 
sanitary and stormwater systems. Local 
action can be clear when the problem is 
well understood.
The decision in Metro Vancouver to 
replace all combined sewers is a bold 
step to reduce the risk of basement 
flooding. Moreover, the primary 
objective of this program is to eliminate 
the discharge of untreated waste into 
streams, rivers and the ocean.
Considerable progress has been evident 
in recent years in the management 
of stormwater. Many existing systems 
were put in place decades ago, using 
historic rainfall intensity, duration and 
frequency information that no longer 
reflects current knowledge about 
risk. Communities should reassess 
the capacity of their stormwater 
management systems based upon 
a current assessment of the risk of 
extreme rainfall. This assessment 
should also seek to take into account 
uncertainties associated with climate 
change and other risks. For example, 
London conducted some pioneering 
research concerning the local impact 
of climate change and assumes that 
stormwater flows will increase by 21 
percent.
Most communities across Canada 
design their overland major stormwater 
management system to cope with the 
expected intensity of a 100-year rainfall
event. Stratford has chosen to focus 
on the more severe 250-year event, 
with peak flow rate 15 percent higher 
than the 100-year storm. Communities 
choose the degree of safety that 
will be provided through the design 
and maintenance of the stormwater 
management system and we anticipate 
that progressive communities will seek 
to provide higher safety margins due 
to the growing evidence of major 
losses resulting from current levels of 
protection.
Best practices for local governments 
require updating climate information 
and adding scope to deal with 
uncertainty associated with risks 
like climate change. This may involve 
targeting the 250-year storm, or 
targeting the 100-year storm with at 
least 10 to 20 percent adjustment to 
deal with uncertainty.
Furthermore, the minor stormwater 
system of sewers and underground 
infrastructure typically has focused on 
the five year rainfall event. Increasingly 
local and regional governments 
are now designing their buried 
infrastructure to address the 10-
year event, again using more current 
information about rainfall intensity 
and perhaps an adjustment for climate 
change.
Shifting to a higher standard typically 
results in the installation of somewhat 
larger diameter sewer pipes. Larger 
pipes have a higher purchase cost than 
smaller pipes but may reduce the cost 
of stormwater management. The cost 
of the pipes is a very small component 
of the overall cost of sewer installation  
and replacement. Moreover, sewers 
with larger pipes are less vulnerable to 
early redundancy with a likely increase in 
future rainfall intensity.
Local governments have primary 
responsibility for managing the risk of 
damage from sanitary and stormwater. 
Failure to provide adequate protection 
can result in legal action, as was 
experienced in Stratford. The significant 
values at risk suggest that local and 
regional governments will take action 
to increase the degree of protection 
that they provide. This will involve 
higher capacity in buried infrastructure 
and change in the ability of overland 
systems to cope with extreme rainfall. 
Uncertainty associated with climate 
change further increases the incentive 
for local governments to build in 
conservative assumptions for the 
design and maintenance of sanitary and 
stormwater management systems.
HOMEOWNER PARTICIPATION
A particular focus of the Institute for 
Catastrophic Loss Reduction has been 
on securing participation of private 
property owners in the management of 
the risk of damage from extreme rainfall. 
Many of the specific actions are well 
known and enjoy widespread support 
among local government experts – 
install a backwater value, install a sump 
pump, maintain appropriate lot grading, 
maintain sewer laterals, disconnect 
downspouts. The challenge is for local 
governments to get largely uninformed 
private property owners to participate.
The foundation for involving private 
property owners begins with
understanding property owners 
motivations and providing outreach 
to inform homeowners about the 
importance of working together to 
confront the risk of damage. This 
involves a shared understanding 
about the factors contributing to the 
risk of damage, and the scope of the 
problem. Local governments find 
relatively few partners that can join in 
the communication of this information. 
There has been a growing recent 
interest by academics, local contractors 
and plumbers, renovation experts 
and home appraisal professionals. An 
important new partner in sharing 
information is found in the insurance 
industry, a group with a shared 
interested with homeowners and local 
governments to aggressively confront 
sewer backup and basement flooding 
risk.
Backwater valves represent a critical 
element of homeowner action to 
reduce the risk of basement flooding. 
Some communities, like Edmonton and 
Winnipeg, have required backwater 
valves in all new homes for more than 
three decades.  Federal and provincial 
actions to mandate backwater valves 
in new homes through the building 
code continue to result in thousands 
of new homes built each year in 
Canada without a backwater valve, a 
disappointing ambiguity in the code 
that can be resolved by local action, 
like that found in Edmonton, Winnipeg, 
Ottawa, Collingwood and elsewhere. 
A greater challenge has been 
encouraging the installation of 
backwater valves in existing homes. 
Every home connected to the sanitary
sewer system is at some risk of damage 
from backup, while those with a history 
of flooding are at high risk. Some 
communities target high risk homes. 
Saskatoon secured a high participation 
rate among high risk homes by offering 
financial incentives immediately following 
three major basement flooding events.
Some communities require installation 
of backwater valves in existing homes 
when homeowners decide to conduct a 
significant renovation. This may involve a 
requirement to install backwater valves 
or may be a general requirement to 
bring the home up to the standards of 
the current building code, which may be 
interpreted to require a backwater valve. 
Some day communities may mandate 
installation of a backwater valve in all 
existing homes, as has been done in 
Toronto for downspout disconnection. 
A comprehensive strategy for local 
governments to reduce the risk of 
damage to homes from sewer backup 
and basement flooding should involve 
actions to require backwater valves in all 
new homes, likely through a by-law; and 
incentives or regulations to encourage 
homeowners to install valves in existing 
homes. Manitoba has been willing to 
share in the funding of the program 
offered in Winnipeg, so it will be 
interesting to determine the potential 
future role of provincial governments. 
In addition, the experience in Ottawa 
demonstrates that homeowner 
knowledge about the maintenance 
of backwater values is important to 
effectively reduce this risk so local 
governments should become involved in 
education programs.
The experience in Quebec City 
provides guidance about actions to 
secure 100 percent homeowner 
participation in downspout 
disconnection. The first phase of 
communication includes information 
about why compliance is required and 
informing homeowners that the City 
is willing to pay all costs. The second 
phase would clarify that compliance 
is mandatory and fines are possible. 
And the final phase would indicate that 
fines will be issued unless participation 
is immediately ratified. It would be 
interesting to see how this approach 
could be modified for mandating some 
of the other important actions that 
would reduce the risk of basement 
flooding like the installation of 
backwater valves, sump pumps, storm 
lateral replacement or lot grading.
Surrey has implemented a strategy 
for inspecting and replacing sewer 
laterals when significant renovations 
are planned for homes. Participation 
is mandatory, but must be triggered 
by the choice of homeowners to 
renovate. This approach is less intrusive 
than mandating participation for all 
existing homeowners.
Local governments have adopted a 
number of approaches in terms of 
willingness to pay for action by private 
property owners. In some instances the 
government will pay the full cost, like 
downspout disconnection in Quebec 
City and weeping tile disconnection 
in London. In some instances the 
government mandates compliance but 
makes no financial contribution, like 
downspout disconnection in Toronto 
and sewer lateral replacement in   
Surrey. Many communities will pay 50 
percent or more of the cost of installing 
backwater valves, although incentives 
may be restricted to homes at high 
risk or property owners with lower 
incomes. There is no consensus about 
best practices found in the experience 
of local governments or the academic 
literature. The most effective programs 
in terms of high rates of homeowner 
participation do not necessarily provide 
the most generous incentives.
Experience does show that local actions 
generally escalate over time, in part due 
to poor uptake rates by homeowners. 
Most local action is triggered by a large 
loss event. An initial response provides 
information to homeowners about 
potential actions, with few homeowners 
choosing to change their behaviour. A 
second or third loss event may lead to 
a local program encouraging voluntary 
action, perhaps with a financial incentive, 
but again most homeowners fail to 
participate. A fourth or fifth loss event 
may lead to regulations mandating 
action by homeowners with the local 
government willing to pay most costs, 
resulting in higher compliance. 
Subsequent events ultimately lead to 
more aggressive regulations mandating 
action, perhaps introducing fines and 
often withdrawing local subsidies. 
Increasingly local governments may 
move quickly to mandate action by 
local property owners given the large 
number of other communities across 
Canada that have adopted similar action. 
Practices with respect to the generosity 
of financial incentives will likely be 
influenced by local decisions about 
financial incentives with respect to other 
issues affecting the community.
CONCLUSION
Damage to homes from sewer backup 
and basement flooding is largely 
preventable, yet has been growing at 
an alarming and unsustainable rate. 
Local action is essential to address 
this important issue. Dozens of 
communities across the country have 
begun to confront this issue. And 
there is a strong consensus about the 
specific actions that would best reduce 
this risk. The present challenge is to 
secure greater participation by local 
governments and private property 
owners. This book seeks to celebrate 
the leadership of 20 communities that 
are taking action now, actions that can 
be replicated in other communities 
across Canada. Through local action 
it is possible to break the alarming 
and unsustainable trend of rising 
damage to homes from sewer backup 
and basement flooding as a result of 
extreme rainfall.
