There is global consensus that we must immediately prioritize climate change
adaptation—change in response to or anticipation of risks from climate
change. Some researchers and policymakers urge ‘transformative change’, a
complete break from past practices, yet report having little data on whether
new practices reduce the risks communities face, even over the short term.
However, researchers have some leads: human communities have long gener-
ated solutions to changing climate, and scientists who study culture have
examples of effective and persistent solutions. This theme issue discusses cul-
tural adaptation to climate change, and in this paper, we review how processes
of biological adaptation, including innovation, modification, selective reten-
tion and transmission, shape the landscapes decision-makers care about—
from which solutions emerge in communities, to the spread of effective adap-
tations, to regional or global collective action. We introduce a comprehensive
portal of data and models on cultural adaptation to climate change, and we
outline ways forward.
This article is part of the theme issue ‘Climate change adaptation needs a
science of culture’.
1. Introduction
The United Nations underscores that climate change adaptation—by which
decision-makers usually mean change in response to or anticipation of the risks
posed by climate change [1]—must become a priority now [2]. Some researchers
and policymakers advocate
‘entirely
new
practices’
and
‘transformative
change,’ which usually entail technocratic solutions recommended by experts;
however, we know little about whether these new practices actually reduce the
risks important to communities, even over the short term [3,4]. What is needed
are systematic data on which solutions, new or old, are effective at reducing
risk for communities and persist across time [5]. Luckily, scientists working at
the intersection of climate change and culture, often in close collaboration with
communities, already have evidence for what has worked—and what has
not—for humans past and present. This includes cautionary tales of the perils
of top–down interventions introduced by organizations or policymakers without
engaging communities in decision-making. However, this existing evidence often
fails to reach organizations, policymakers and researchers. Climate change
adaptation needs to embrace the science of culture: funding priorities should
be set with adequate information about how communities actually adapt to
climate change.
Here, we review key studies of cultural adaptation to climate change and
their implications for future research and policy interventions. We begin with
an overview of the scientific study of culture, then organize our review by
scale: community-centred approaches (the micro level), population-level

outcomes (meso level) and global-level perspectives (macro
level). We wrap our discussion by introducing a data portal
that incorporates data ranging from foraging returns to emis-
sions, all pertinent to cultural adaptation to climate change.
Along the way, we identify what researchers still need to
know about climate change adaptation, highlight strategies
for how to support communities on the frontlines, and
explore how work done collaboratively with communities
can do both.
2. Why is culture relevant to climate change
adaptation?
Different disciplines and sectors variously define ‘culture,’ but
regardless of how it is defined, most agree that culture impacts
climate change adaptation—for example, by influencing the
adoption,
innovation
and
persistence
of
solutions
(e.g.
[1,4,6,7]). Here, we adopt one definition that is inclusive of
many others: culture refers to information learned or adopted
from other people that is stored in the mind [8]—information
that often produces or affects things that exist outside the
mind, like social relationships, societies and objects.
(a) How culture affects climate change adaptation
Culture is often treated as static, a barrier to adaptation [9], but
it can be a mediator of adaptation [10,11]—for example, as a
predictor of adaptation motivation [12]. Importantly, culture
generates candidate adaptations, ideas that have not yet
reduced climate risk but may when put to the test [1,5,13].
Examples include agricultural techniques, migration, and
even climate-related policy and funding. Because their liveli-
hoods are entwined with climate, farmers are often at the
forefront of climate change mitigation and adaptation, creating
innovations that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions [14] or
selectively adopting suggestions from organizations, policy-
makers and researchers based on what works locally [15].
Humans past and present have often used migration to
respond to climate-related risks—although, thanks to borders
and other restrictions, climate-related migration can be difficult
today. Migration can be short-term, especially for groups reli-
ant on mobile resources like fish or animal herds [16], or
permanent, when climate shocks are large and/or recurrent
(e.g. [17]). Climate-related policy and funding are also cultural,
with fads and fashions in funding and prioritized projects
impacting what candidate solutions are available to commu-
nities [18]. For example, investment in urban green spaces
has exploded, but meta-analyses reveal that urban green
spaces can have neutral or even negative impacts on heat,
energy consumption and equity, depending on the dynamics
of the communities where they are introduced [19,20]. Urban
green spaces are candidate adaptations; their adaptiveness
depends on specific local social and ecological dynamics [5,21].
To illustrate the process of climate change adaptation,
imagine two communities, A and B, and an outside organiz-
ation whose mission it is to foster climate change adaptation
(figure 1). Candidate adaptations are innovated—whether by
community members or organization staff, usually built on or
modifying existing variants. If candidate adaptations success-
fully reduce risk—that is, if they’re adaptive—they are more
likely to be retained and transmitted, whether to members
of the same community or even across community bound-
aries (e.g. between A and B in figure 1). Retention and
transmission happen (a) through memory, teaching and
learning, and (b) for a variety of reasons, including cognitive
biases (e.g. a candidate adaptation may be more memorable
or more consistent with what is already in someone’s mind)

Figure 1. A review of the innovation and adoption, selective retention, and transmission (IARMT) of candidate climate change adaptations. For another overview in
this issue, see [15]. At time point 1, an organization introduces candidate adaptations to community A (striped purple); A has existing local adaptations (solid
orange) and a new innovation: a local candidate adaptation (striped orange). Nearby is community B, with their own local adaptations (solid green). At time
point 2 in community A, in addition to one preexisting local adaptation, one introduced candidate adaptation and one local candidate adaptation were retained
from time point 1; we now call these candidate adaptations ‘adaptations’ (and use solid colours accordingly) because they persisted, presumably (although not
always) because they reduce risk. Community B adopts a local adaptation from A; this is now a local candidate adaptation in B (striped orange) because it has not
yet reduced risk locally. At time point 3, community B has retained the local candidate adaptation from A, making it a local adaptation in B (solid orange). Under
ideal circumstances, the organization will learn and perhaps adopt local adaptations from A or B as well.

and how much candidate adaptations help their bearer
respond to risks, including from climate [8,22–24]. For
example, worldview impacts which innovations are adopted
and which are ignored [9,25–29]. In turn, innovation and
adoption, selective retention, modification and transmission
are path-dependent, as past events or decisions constrain
later events or decisions [30]. Innovation and adoption, selec-
tive retention, modification and transmission (IARMT) are
processes with parallels in biological adaptation; indeed,
because of these similarities, some use the phrase ‘cultural
evolution’ to talk about how culture changes or stays the
same across time (for reviews, see [15,31]).
(b) Studying how culture affects climate change
adaptation
The science of culture is not limited to the field of cultural
evolution, however: research on the role of culture in climate
change adaptation spans disciplines, sectors and method-
ologies. Psychologists and sociologists study the degree to
which subjective internal states (e.g. values, perceptions,
appraisals)—affected by culture among other things—impact
behaviour related to climate change adaptation, including
IARMT [9,32]. Indigenous and rural peoples have long inno-
vated their own candidate adaptations. Indeed, Indigenous
and Local Knowledge affects both internal states, like values
and IARMT; further, while Indigenous and Local Knowledge
is largely absent from earlier, Western research on climate
change adaptation, work involving Indigenous method-
ologies, knowledge co-production, and participatory action
frameworks is increasingly common in the adaptation litera-
ture [33–35]. For example, in their adaptation research in
Samoa, Latai-Niusulu et al. [16] used talanoa methods—
unstructured interviews in which stories are freely shared,
inspired by Pacific Island communities. Historians and archae-
ologists sometimes track changes in environment and culture
longitudinally, over centuries or millennia, by reconstructing
paleoclimates and aggregate data from multiple archaeological
sites (e.g. [36–40]). Hoyer et al. [17] integrate data on 150+
societies from the past 10 000 years to investigate which vari-
ables predict how societies respond to crisis. Cross-cultural
ethnographic and survey data provide a synchronic view of
the relationship between environment and culture, at the
level of individuals and societies (e.g. [41–43]). Several articles
in this theme issue provide detailed qualitative and quantitat-
ive data on the relationship between cultural practices and
contemporary climate, which can be compared and contrasted
across contexts [16,44–46] and can be compared to environ-
mental data, such as carbon emissions data [14]. Agent-based
models draw from both past and contemporary data to
simulate future outcomes (e.g. [46–48]). In short, scientific
approaches to culture take many forms, all with implications
for our understanding of climate change adaptation.
3. What is known about culture and climate
change adaptation?
Using diverse methods, scientists of culture have gained
insight into climate change adaptation with implications
for future research and policy interventions. Here, we
review key findings from this literature, some of which
feature in this theme issue. We flag notes of caution
throughout, with recommendations for how to avoid similar
issues in the future.
Scientists of culture usually focus on the micro, meso, or
macro levels of cultural adaptation—as do organizations and
policymakers. The IARMT of culture takes place on the
micro, individual level, but the evolution of climate change
adaptation is apparent at the meso level—for example, in the
frequency of candidate solutions and their spread within and
between populations [15,49,50]. Macro-level approaches to cli-
mate change adaptation incorporate multiple populations of
people, generating insight that spans time—for example,
which variables predicted successful adaptation in past
societies—and space—for example, how patterns within- and
across-populations impact regional and global outcomes
today. An organization may focus on micro-level investment
in the hope that it will scale up to meso- or macro-level
change, or on the macro level in the hopes of changing the
balance of power between the Global South and the Global
North [51]. We thus organize our discussion by the micro,
meso and macro levels to facilitate quick navigation by
researchers, policymakers and organizations alike.
(a) The micro level
Micro-level approaches to climate change adaptation reveal
how IARMT unfold, while also allowing researchers to identify
hurdles to grassroots climate change adaptation [5,15]. To
understand the extent to which communities are impacted by
climate change, and what other concerns may be more immedi-
ate to them, researchers can use research design and methods
sensitive to local context and in collaboration with community
partners when appropriate [16,52,53]. Data collection methods
may involve community members in research and can identify
constraints on locally led adaptation, yet data collection need
not be time intensive: for busy researchers, Buffa et al. [54] out-
line how a small team can obtain community-centred data on
constraints to adaptation in as few as two weeks.
Local context is key to weaving community-held expertise
into understandings of grassroots climate change adaptation
[55,56]. One form of such expertise is traditional ecological
knowledge (TEK), ‘a cumulative body of knowledge, practice
and belief, evolving by adaptive processes and handed down
through generations by cultural transmission, about the
relationship of living beings (including humans) with one
another and with their environment’ [6] . TEK often encom-
passes adaptations to climate, including climate variability
[57]. For example, in response to contemporary climate risks,
cultural practices promote food security—such as mobility in
Samoa or sharing country foods in Canada (e.g. fish, seal, cari-
bou) [16,57–59]. When communities can innovate, modify and
transmit candidate adaptations without outside interference,
their adaptive capacity may be higher (e.g. [15,46,54]). In other
words, communities may be better able to respond to climate
change [60] because they can experiment with different
solutions [5].
Caution: While communities may mix TEK with ideas
introduced by organizations or policymakers [6], non-local cul-
tural variants can crowd out local variants [47,61–63] and offer
solutions that increase rather than reduce risks salient to com-
munities (e.g. [22,24]). In turn, decreased transmission of TEK
may prevent younger generations from acquiring candidate
adaptations [57,64]. Given that contemporary climate change
can be rapid, hurdles to grassroots adaptation can impact

its ability to keep pace [1]. To avoid displacing TEK and
other local knowledge, organizations and policymakers may
consider: (a) introducing non-local ideas and letting commu-
nities decide whether to adopt them—rather than letting
non-local prerogatives or power be the ultimate deciding
factor [65,66]; (b) avoiding policies that prevent the use of
TEK, as such policies can hinder the transmission of TEK to
future generations [62,67]; (c) fostering information-sharing
networks, especially if existing networks have been displaced
by government interventions, colonialism and other forces
[5]; and (d) supporting relationship to place, as TEK is tuned
to
specific
localities
[13,46,53,62].
Organizations
and
policymakers may propose ‘transformative’ adaptations that
represent a break from past practices [4,68], but when commu-
nities have agency to pick their own solutions, especially
solutions not heavily curtailed by outside constraints [53], the
solutions they choose—whether traditional, modified, non-
local or a mixture—are more likely to be effective and persistent
than other options [33,68–71].
Candidate adaptations that communities choose to use
often reflect the conditions they face—climate-related and
otherwise. Caution: When asked, communities on the fron-
tlines of climate change do not always perceive the impacts
measured by atmospheric scientists [72]. This may mean
that adaptations are working well [73]. For example, among
Yucatec Maya, investment in cash cropping, social network
connections and economic diversification can mediate the
relationship between climate risks and reports of good versus
bad harvest years [45]. Other impacts on crops, finances and
well-being, such as market forces or government policies,
may be more salient than climate change because they have
more day-to-day impact [72,74,75]. Indeed, even if commu-
nities feel threatened by climate change, market forces and
government policies can hinder their ability to adopt new can-
didate adaptations: for Inuit, changes in sea ice as well as
increased reliance on cash employment are shifting hunting
preferences and the equipment needed for harvesting country
foods [37], and many households cannot afford this new equip-
ment [75].
(b) The meso level
Meso-level analyses of climate change adaptation often exam-
ine regional or population-level outcomes—such as changes
in the frequency of candidate adaptations, revealing cultural
evolution;
to
group-level
collective
action;
and
human-
environment integration. To understand how population
structure aids or hinders climate change adaptation, consider
a population with homophilous subpopulations that do not
interact regularly but are open to learning from each other.
Contexts like these can foster transmission of candidate
adaptations [47,68,76]. Similarly important are majority–
minority dynamics, e.g. between minoritized and majority
ethnic groups, or between urban and rural communities.
Even if subpopulations transmit cultural information to each
other, if the flow of majority ideas to minority subpopulations
is minimized—for example, if (a) minority subpopulation iden-
tity is strong, (b) the minority subpopulation has protected
lands, or (c) organizations and policymakers refrain from
swamping local solutions with non-local solutions—minority
subpopulations can be important sources of innovation that
may be adopted by the majority [47,77,78]. Per our recommen-
dations above, if organizations and policymakers wish to
encourage innovation and transmission in minority subpopu-
lations, they can support relationship to place (e.g. by backing
land or resource rights) and community agency by studying,
identifying and selecting candidate adaptations [26,79,80].
Culture is also relevant to analysis of collective action
around
common-pool
resources—resources
that
can
be
depleted and from which users are difficult to exclude.
Common-pool resources are particularly sensitive to overuse:
when individuals prioritize their private benefit over group
outcomes—benefits that can be shared by all users—a tra-
gedy of the commons can result [81]. However, individual
and group benefits need not be at odds: when users expect
joint benefit from cooperation or face the same outside
threat (e.g. from pests or people from other user groups), col-
lective action around common-pool resources is more likely
[81–83]. Additionally, when individual and group interests
are aligned, as may be the case with crop switching in the
US [15], collective action is easier to get started. Organiz-
ations and policymakers wishing to foster collective action
around common-pool resources can leverage groups and
group
dynamics—for
example,
by
emphasizing
shared
threats or by encouraging groups to compete over who can
best manage risk [7,82].
Scientists of culture also investigate interactions between
human populations and the environment by focusing on the
integration between them [84–86]. For example, consider rice
paddies or swidden systems, also known as slash-and-burn,
milpa, or shifting cultivation. Adjacent paddies and swiddens
may become spatially correlated approximating a power law:
a candidate adaptation adopted by one farmer impacts their
neighbours in an exponentially decreasing, nonlinear way, such
that close neighbours are more impacted than those further
away [14]. This can signal a transition from exclusively local
control to a complex adaptive system, which can approach
Pareto optimality—where no one in the system could do better
without negatively impacting someone else’s outcomes [82].
Comparing and contrasting across socio-ecological systems
has shown that specific recurrent features of the environment
tend to favour similar cultural adaptations [17].
(c) The macro level
Macro-level
approaches
to
climate
change
adaptation
incorporate multiple populations of people, allowing investi-
gation of how individual- or population-level patterns can
impact regional or global outcomes, and offering insight
into past adaptation successes and failures from societies
in human history and prehistory. Traditional forms of forest
management offer an intriguing example. Humans have
long used techniques like controlled burns and dispersing
seeds to manage species in local forests [87,88]. Today, forests
allow local communities to diversify their responses to
climate risk—for example, to access alternative income
streams, foods or sources of fuel (e.g. firewood). Caution: If
policies remove other components of people’s diversified
risk-management portfolios, forests may become overhar-
vested, reducing potential carbon stores and the intactness
of traditional lands for Indigenous peoples [46]. Mitigation
policies like REDD+ (Reduce Emissions from Deforestation
and Forest Degradation) carbon credits, for example, can
favour technocratic solutions for management that displace
customary management systems; allowing some traditional
management and limited harvesting can help protect people’s

livelihoods
[89].
Another
reason
to
support
customary
management systems is their potential impact on global
outcomes: anthropogenic forests can respond differently to cli-
mate change than do unmanaged forests [88] and recognizing
Indigenous territories has been shown to reduce deforestation
inside their borders [90,91]; in other words, in some cases,
adaptation and mitigation can be complementary.
In other cases, like the REDD+ example highlighted
above, climate change mitigation and adaptation are some-
times at odds. For example, among Diné and Hopi peoples,
data suggest that reduced access to coal, consistent with miti-
gation goals set by the government, will undercut energy
sovereignty, key to climate change adaptation (e.g. staying
warm in winter) [46]. At the global scale, mitigation efforts
often emphasize energy efficiency. Paradoxically, as energy
becomes more efficient, use may actually increase, reducing
the potential energy savings of increased efficiency [92].
However, additional cultural innovation can offset these
effects: if efficiency, or even carbon sequestration technology,
increases faster than increased demand—if improvements in
technology can be accelerated or reductions in demand be
incentivized—this paradox may not be realized [48].
Analysis of paleoenvironmental, archaeological and his-
torical data provides insight into past responses to climate
stress [88,93,94]. Multi-population datasets can include indi-
cators of social instability and other variables that impact
population-level responses to climate events [17,95], as well
as cascading risks where failures in one area of the world
impacted others [96]. Unfortunately, insights on how past
societies successfully responded to climate, or failed to do
so, often do not reach policymakers [39,40,97]. For useful
overviews of what is known about the effectiveness of differ-
ent candidate adaptations in the face of myriad climate-
related risks, see [37,38].
Caution: Archaeological and historical data remind us that
grassroots climate change adaptation does not always produce
effective solutions. Because innovations often build on one
another, path dependence can constrain adaptation—for
example, given existing norms and practices in use [21,30,53].
Due to adaptive lag, variants that used to reduce risk may
no longer be adaptive when the environment changes, but
may still be retained and transmitted at higher rates because
they are more memorable or more consistent with what is
already in the mind [8,22,24]. That said, while local cultural var-
iants are not always effective at reducing risk, they can be [21]—
so rather than swampingcommunities with non-local candidate
adaptations or, at the other extreme, leaving communities
to adapt on their own, organizations and policymakers can sup-
port opportunities for local innovation [5,53]. Cultural analyses
can help by offering insights on how climate change adaptation
emerges and spreads [47]and,throughactive collaborationwith
communities, by identifying which local solutions are locally
effective and persistent [54]. Climate justice involves both pro-
tecting communities on the frontlines and recognizing and
supporting these communities’ agency in selecting their own
candidate climate change adaptations [65].
(d) Cross-level interactions
Importantly, all three levels—micro, meso and macro—are
interconnected and often overlapping. For example, the adop-
tion of variants by individual farmers at the micro level (like
different approaches to watering) affects ecology at the meso
level[98] and determines which adaptations becomelocally pre-
dominant [14,15]. In other cases, national-level policies (macro)
impact the transmission of TEK (micro), with implications for its
preservation among Indigenous peoples (meso; [44,46]). In
short, though scientists, organizations and policymakers may
focus onjust one ofthese threelevelsto maketheir researchtract-
able or to set funding priorities, all three are fundamentally
interconnected. For a pertinent review, see [99].
(e) A portal for the curious
The data we summarize above range from household data, to
archaeological data, to data on carbon emissions from rice pad-
dies—all pertinent to the study of cultural adaptation to climate
change. Curious readers can visit the Dryad Digital Reposi-
tory for this theme issue: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.
bnzs7h4h4 [100], where contributors have uploaded examples
of these diverse data and often the code needed to analyze it,
along with detailed readmes. Example uses of these data
include: (a) comparing and contrasting field-based research
on climate change adaptation—for example, exploring a poten-
tial negative relationship between the effectiveness of existing
adaptations and the salience of local climate impacts; (b) mod-
ifying and exploring the predictions of models—for example,
of how changes to social network characteristics change
impact the innovation of candidate adaptations, or of how
much incentive for cultural adaptation is needed to increase
energy efficiency faster than demand; and (c) adopting and
deploying tools used by researchers to study cultural adap-
tation to climate change, including community-collaborative
research methods and leading-edge statistical models.
4. Conclusion
Recent reviews of the climate adaptation-related literature
have concluded that little is known about the effectiveness
and persistence of different climate change adaptations,
largely due to a lack of longitudinal data [4]. However, out-
side the climate literature, scientists of culture have been
studying the relationship between culture and environment
for decades: for example, how innovative candidate adap-
tations reflect local experiences of climate, how population
structure impacts the spread of adaptations and how these
adaptations impact outcomes for other populations in turn.
Going forward, scientists of culture must continue to reach
out to organizations and policymakers to share what we
have learned. Better understanding how climate change
adaptation unfolds, at the micro, meso and macro levels,
will enable organizations and policymakers to better support
communities as they respond, by providing resources and
respecting their autonomy [5].
