Climate Resilience Express
A COMMUNITY CLIMATE 
ADAPTATION PLANNING GUIDE
November 2021
Climate Resilience Express — Overview  | 1
Overview
Why do you need a Climate Adaptation Plan?
The climate is already changing. Alberta’s climate has warmed by about 2°C over the past 
50 years and is projected to warm by another 4°C by the end of this century.
Communities are experiencing significant negative impacts under current climate 
conditions. Past climate change influenced the 2016 wildfire in Fort McMurray and 2013 floods 
in Southern Alberta. Further climate change is inevitable meaning such events will become 
more common and severe. 
Planning for climate change will make your community more resilient — reducing 
economic, social and environmental impacts, and saving money. There are many simple, cost-
effective actions your community can implement today.
Understand how the climate and natural environment in your region is projected to change in 
the future.
Prioritize climate change impacts affecting your economy, municipal infrastructure and 
services, the natural environment, and the health and lifestyle of residents.
Identify and implement local actions to manage climate risks and opportunities to ensure your 
community is resilient and adapted to future climate change.
Climate Resilience Express provides a flexible approach to 
climate adaptation planning that can be tailored to your 
community’s needs and will help you:

Climate change is one of the greatest challenges we face. 
Managing climate change involves:
1.	
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing sinks that capture and store carbon (climate mitigation).
2.	 Preparing for the impacts of a changing climate (climate adaptation).
Mitigation will help avoid the unmanageable. Adaptation is essential to manage the unavoidable.
Greenhouse gases 
are released to 
the atmosphere, 
trapping heat and 
causing global 
warming

Climate Resilience Express is focused on climate ‘adaptation’ — actions to efficiently manage the negative 
impacts of climate change or take advantage of new climate-related opportunities.
Global warming 
is changing the 
regional and local 
climate which 
will impact your 
community
Climate Resilience Express — Overview  | 3

climate adaptation planning, that involves four steps:
Step 1
Get started
Step 3
Action plan
Step 2
Assess risks & 
opportunities
Step 4
Implement
The purpose of step 1 is to:
•	
Determine the scope of the planning process
[Pages 4 & 5]
•	
Develop a plan to engage stakeholders and residents
•	
Compile climate trends and projections for your community
[Page 6]
The purpose of 
step 4 is to:
•	
Commit funding 
and staff time to 
implement actions
•	
Partner with local 
and regional 
organizations
•	
Monitor impacts 
and actions
•	
Repeat the process 
every 5-10 years 
[Page 18]
The purpose of
 step 2 is to:
•	
Understand your 
communities’ 
vulnerabilities
•	
Develop climate 
impact statements
•	
Conduct a climate 
change risk 
and opportunity 
assessment
•	
Determine 
priorities for action 
planning
[Pages 7–13]
The purpose of step 3 is to:
•	
Define actions to manage priority climate impacts and 
consequences
•	
Assess and prioritize actions
•	
Formulate a Climate Adaptation Action Plan
[Pages 14–17]
Climate adaptation 
planning and 
implementation is an 
ongoing process. We will 
always need to adapt!
Climate Resilience Express — Get started  | 4
Step 1
Get started: determine the scope of the 
planning process
Climate Resilience Express is a flexible approach to Climate Adaptation Planning. The 
approach can be applied at almost any scale, for example:
Single asset: a specific site, facility, building, or piece of infrastructure
All municipal assets, services and operations: parks, transportation networks, civic 
buildings, and infrastructure, etc.
Community-wide: in addition to 2 , all homes, private buildings and infrastructure, 
the local economy, ecosystem functions and services, the health and well-being of 
residents, etc., across the entire community or within a region.
Sector-specific: a specific sector or theme within your community, such as food security 
and agriculture, public health and safety, water security,  ecosystems, recreation, etc.

You may also want to consider critical infrastructure and services outside your municipal 
boundaries. Daily life and economic activity in your community likely relies on water, energy 
and food sourced from outside the municipality, as well as systems for transportation and 
distribution.

Across the scoping options outlined on page 4, the 
Climate Resilience Express process can be tailored to 
your community’s needs, resources, and timelines.
The climate adaptation planning process can be implemented as a simple, high-level screening 
exercise or as a more detailed, quantitative exercise, with many options in-between!
A simple process is likely more 
suitable for smaller communities 
with limited staff and resources
Minimal; one staff dedicating 1-2 
days to process
Qualitative; based more on 
experience and perceptions of 
stakeholders
Qualitative; based more on 
stakeholder knowledge and 
preferences
Minimal or none
Short; can be completed in a 
few months
Low
Simple, high-level screening
Community size
Demands of staff
Cost
Duration
Stakeholder engagement
Climate risk assessment
Action planning
A more detailed, quantitative 
process may be more suitable 
to larger communities with more 
resources and staff
High; one or more staff dedicating 
several hours per week over the 
duration of the project
Quantitative; based more 
on research and analysis of data on 
the likelihood and consequences 
of climate risks
Quantitative; based more on 
analysis of the costs and benefits 
of potential actions
Intensive stakeholder engagement 
including workshops, community 
surveys, open houses, etc.
Lengthy; may take up to a 
year or more
High
Detailed, quantitative

To perform the climate risk assessment in Step 2, you 
need to know how climate in your area is projected to 
change in the future. The final activity of “getting started” 
is to compile this information.
The Climate Atlas of Canada (the Atlas) is a great source of 
local climate data (www.climateatlas.ca). The Atlas provides 
valuable information for climate risk and vulnerability 
assessment and adaptation planning, such as:
•	
Future climate projections for a range of mean 
temperature and precipitation variables as well as 
extremes
•	
Projections for the 2030’s (2021-2050) and the 2060’s 
(2051-2080), relative to the historic climate
•	
Projections for two climate change scenarios – a low 
emissions scenario (RCP 4.5) and a high emissions 
scenario (RCP 8.5)
•	
Downloadable data which can be used to approximate 
the likelihood of climate impact events occurring in the 
future [Page 9]
In addition to monthly and seasonal temperature and 
precipitation projections, information is available for many 
different indicators of climate change such as:
•	
The Warmest Maximum Temperature of the year
•	
The total number of Very Cold Days when the 
temperature drops to -30°C or below
•	
The total number of Cooling Degree Days in the year, 
an indicator of demand for space cooling in homes and 
buildings
•	
The length of the Frost-free season
Example output from the Climate Atlas of 
Canada showing projected changes to the 
number of very hot (+30°C) days per year in 
Alberta (to the 2060s under a high emissions 
scenario). Historically, Alberta had less than 
4 days per year above +30°C. By the 2060’s, 
Alberta can expect over 20 per year.
In addition to compiling information on local climate projections, it is also necessary to build an understanding of how these 
projections could impact assets, services, residents, and economic, cultural, social and natural resources in your community. 
To help with this, it is necessary to review academic journal articles and other research reports prepared by governments, 
non-profits, and the private sector.
Climate Resilience Express — Assess risks & opportunities  | 7
Step 2
Assess risks & opportunities
Step 2 in the Climate Resilience Express planning process is where climate risks and 
opportunities are identified, assessed and prioritized. This involves:
1.	
Developing climate impact statements (or scenarios), that describe the links between 
projected changes in the local climate, a related hazard or opportunity, and potential 
impacts and consequences for your community.
2.	 Defining a threshold or intensity level for each identified climate hazard or opportunity, 
and assessing the likelihood of it occurring at that level in the future.
3.	 Assessing the severity (or magnitude) of consequences contained in each impact 
statement.
4.	 Generating measures of climate risk for each impact statement and presenting them in 
a format - like a risk rating matrix - that allows stakeholders to interpret and evaluate the 
results, and make decisions about priorities to take forward to action planning.

One way to present 
the findings of the risk 
assessment is to use a risk 
rating matrix (or ‘heat 
map’), where likelihood 
and consequence scores 
for all climate hazards 
and opportunities are 
combined to determine 
an overall risk rating. 
Priorities for further action 
are then determined 
based on this combined 
rating. Climate hazards 
and opportunities with 
a higher likelihood and 
consequence (those in 
the top right corner of 
the matrix) are higher  
priority for action 
planning.

Developing climate impacts statements
For each climate risk and opportunity, an impact statement should be drafted. An impact 
statement identifies the “someone” or “something” that may be impacted, the specific way 
they could be impacted, and links these impacts to changes in the climate, as shown in the 
example below. Each statement should be specific to a single climate event with a defined 
threshold or intensity level.
The impact statement could be based on actual past events or on anticipated future 
scenarios. The important thing is to make them realistic, as they are used throughout the 
planning process and form the foundation of the risk and opportunity assessment.

•	
Talk to experts, members of the community 
and elders to understand their experience 
with weather and extreme events.

Determine the likelihood of climate impacts occurring
Climate risk is a function of the consequences of a climate impact event of a given intensity 
and the likelihood of it occurring. To assess the risk of an event, it is necessary to determine 
the likelihood that it will occur. When you generated the climate impact statements you will 
have defined a suitable threshold or intensity level for each climate event (e.g., number of 
“very hot days”). By suitable, we mean a level that could result in noteworthy impacts to 
your community. 
If possible, you should generate likelihood estimates for the defined event threshold or 
intensity level both historically and in the future.

4
Likelihood estimates can be generated using one or more of the following methods:
1.	
Historic event occurrence: The likelihood of a climate event occurring in the 
past can be estimated from historic data, if available. Local reports or news 
articles may also contain estimated likelihoods for events that have affected 
your community.
2.	 Known return intervals: In some cases, the defined climate impact event will 
already be associated with a return interval, such as a 1-in-100 year 24-hour 
rainfall total, or 1-in-200 year low river flows, etc.  
3.	 Analysis of frequency distribution: For some climate impact events, frequency 
distribution data can be downloaded from the Atlas, from which it is possible to 
approximate the likelihood of the defined threshold or intensity level occurring. 
4.	 Research from other assessments or studies: Existing assessments or 
research studies may contain relevant likelihood estimates, or data from which 
estimates can be generated or extrapolated.
5.	 Professional judgment: When none of the other approaches are possible, the 
professional judgment of staff and stakeholders in your community can be used 
to estimate the likelihood of events occurring today and in the future.
Ultimately, your likelihood estimates will need to be transcribed onto a likelihood 
scale, like the example shown on page 10.

Below is an example likelihood assessment scale which can be tailored to your 
community needs and existing risk management systems.
Your climate impact statements will likely include a mix of recurring (or discrete) events and 
single (or chronic) events. The likelihood scoring scale needs to allow for the assessment of 
both types of impacts.
Recurring events are those with the potential to happen (return) multiple times over a given 
time frame, such as severe storms, flooding and heat waves. Climate change may affect the 
frequency, intensity and duration of these events. 
Single events, in contrast, occur when a specific threshold is reached in the future as a result 
of ongoing, gradual shifts in the climate. For example, the loss of a species, an irreversible 
shift in an Ecoregion, the permanent loss of a winter recreation opportunity (like outdoor 
skating), or a change in streamflow timing of the temperature of a water body.

To continue the risk and opportunity assessment process, the next step is to analyze the 
severity of potential consequences listed in each impact statement. Similar to likelihood, 
consequences can be assessed using a five-point rating scale, which differentiates between 
insignificant and extreme consequences for your community. Ideally, you should assess 
(‘score’) the severity of consequences anticipated to result from a climate impact event for 
each of the following dimensions:
•	
Public health & safety: Fatalities, injuries, disease, and hospitalization, as well as impacts 
on mental health and emotional well-being. 
•	
Social function: Temporary or permanent displacement, disruption to community 
cohesion, exacerbation of inequalities, impacts to cultural resources.
•	
Buildings and infrastructure: Damage to buildings, equipment, vehicles and infrastructure, 
and loss of services such as transportation, water, energy, etc.
•	
Economic vitality: Disruption or loss of ability to produce, consume and trade goods and 
services, and to generate income and support livelihoods.
•	
Natural environment: Impacts to land, water, air, plants and animals, and the provision of 
ecosystem services.
•	
City services and operations: Impacts to the City’s reputation, ability to deliver services 
without interruption, and operating and capital budgets, including contingency reserves. 
An example consequence rating scale for one of these dimensions - “public health and safety - is shown below. Scales 
used to assess consequences should be tailored to the size of the municipality and existing risk management practices.

Assess consequences
At this point, you may also want to 
engage community members in the 
process, possibly through a survey 
or similar tool, to better understand 
community priorities.
Taking a precautionary approach, the 
overall consequence score assigned 
to a climate impact event should be 
based on the maximum score across 
all consequences categories.
What key assets are exposed to 
climate hazards? How sensitive are 
community activities, assets and 
services to changes in climate and 
changes in climate hazards? What risk 
management measures are currently 
in place? What is your community’s 
ability to adjust, or take advantage of 
changes in climate and changes in 
climate hazards?
The assessment of consequences should 
be conducted using a participatory 
approach that draws upon the expertise 
of municipal staff and local stakeholders in 
your community. 
The goal is to assign a consequence score, 
usually a numerical value from 1 to 5, to 
to all consequences listed in the impact 
statements.
The consequence assessment should 
consider your community’s current 
vulnerabilities.
Climate Resilience Express — Assess risks & opportunities  | 13
The consequence assessment is often completed through a facilitated workshop process 
with City staff and key stakeholders. There are many techniques available to help staff and 
stakeholders score the severity of consequences of each climate impact statement. One 
approach is to use voting software. This method of engagement involves an evaluation exercise 
(voting) combined with facilitated dialogue that encourages the sharing of expertise and 
perspectives to stimulate deeper analysis of climate change impacts. Voting software records 
the scores assigned to each impact statement and allows participants to view the collective 
results in real-time. In cases where an initial vote produces a large variance in scores, group 
discussion can be used to help reach consensus. For example, one or more participants 
may have expertise they can share about severity of historic climate events the vulnerability 
(sensitivity) of community, assets, or the presence of vulnerable populations in the community. 
The digital voting approach is effective in both achieving alignment on consequence scores, and 
more importantly, a shared understanding of local climate risks and priorities.
Example of achieving alignment in a climate change risk assessment through digital voting 
and discussion:
How significant would the consequences be of a heat wave 
(3 days above 30°C) be for your community?

Evaluate risk and opportunities
Results of the consequence and likelihood assessments are combined at this stage to 
generate an overall risk rating for each climate impact event. You can present the results in 
the form of a risk rating matrix, like that shown on page 7, or as a total risk score out of 25 
(calculated by multiplying the consequence and likelihood scores). This information can then 
be used to differentiate between low, medium and high climate risks or opportunities, and 
hence acceptable and unacceptable risks for your community.
The table below provides an example of action planning thresholds that can be used to 
determine which risks and opportunities are prioritized for action planning and ultimately to 
help prioritize where to focus effort during the action planning step.
Example action planning thresholds

Low risk
10 –14
Actions could be developed, particularly where low-cost options are 
available that provide other social, economic or environmental benefits
Acceptable risk
<10
No action required, beyond consideration as part of regular reviews
Once you have determined an initial set of priorities for the action planning step, you should evaluate the rankings with 
staff and stakeholders and make any adjustments as necessary. You might adjust the priority assigned to a specific risk 
or opportunity because a strong argument is made that it has been either over- or under-estimated, or to align your 
recommendations for action planning  with an upcoming review of a strategic plan or a funding opportunity. 
Options for generating a risk or opportunity matrix at a workshop to visualize the results of the consequence and likelihood 
assessment, and support the evaluation process, are shown below. (examples from the Climate Resilience Express process, 
2015-2018).
1. Use tape to draw the matrix on a 
large wall
2. Draw the matrix on a large sheet 
of paper or cardboard
3. Draw the matrix digitally and 
project it on a screen

Step 3
Action plan
Step 3 in the Climate Resilience Express planning process where actions to address priority 
risks and opportunities are identified, evaluated and prioritized. This involves:
1.	
Identifying actions to reduce or avoid the harmful consequences of priority climate risks 
or to capture the benefits presented by priority climate opportunities
2.	 Evaluating actions against key decision criteria to help determine priorities for 
implementation
3.	 Characterizing priority actions and developing implementation plans, including 
information on estimated costs, timelines, the implementation lead(s) and partners
To provide structure to the action planning process, it is helpful to organize your priority 
climate impacts around ‘themes’, with accompanying goals and objectives. Adaptation actions 
can then be developed around each theme and to achieve your goals and objectives.
•	
Conduct research, if you don’t have enough 
information about the nature of a risk, or the potential 
costs and benefits of actions to make robust decisions
•	
Update or develop new policies, plans, or bylaws 
that embed considerations of climate-related risks and 
opportunities and corresponding actions
•	
Modify operations and/or maintenance schedules, 
for example, increasing the frequency of storm drain 
cleanouts, enhanced tree management, or water leak 
detection 
•	
Build new or upgrade existing infrastructure, 
to provide protection against climate risks, for 
example, flood prevention, erosion control structures, 
permeable roads and sidewalks to retain water, or a 
wetland restoration
•	
Increase awareness and education to help your 
community better understand (and visualize) risks 
and adaptation actions
•	
Emergency management measures such as 
response and evacuation planning, hazard 
mapping, and early warning or alert systems
•	
Human resourcing options, for example dedicating 
additional staff time to climate adaptation planning 
and implementation, establishing a task force or 
committee, or hiring an expert
What is a climate adaptation action? 
Climate adaptation actions take many different shapes and forms, and will include things your community currently 
does. Here are some examples of actions that could be implemented in your community to address climate risk 
and opportunities:
Climate Resilience Express — Action plan  | 16

Ask:
•	
What key actions, completed or underway, currently 
support management of the climate risk or opportunity?
•	
How effective are existing actions? Can they be enhanced 
or improved to more efficiently manage the priority risk or 
opportunity?
•	
Are there new actions needed, that your community can 
lead or support, to enhance community climate resilience?
An effective climate adaptation 
action planning process involves 
collaboration and input from 
local experts, municipal staff and 
community stakeholders. When 
brainstorming actions consider the full 
list of options outlined on Page 14.
Examples of actions identified to address priority climate risk and opportunities  by communities who participated in the

Depending on the diversity of identified climate resilience actions, consideration could be given to forming a working 
group of municipal staff and external stakeholders to oversee implementation of the Action Plan. This group could 
coordinate the ongoing selection and implementation of actions.

It is unlikely that you will be able to implement all potential adaptation actions, due to staff and 
financial constraints and/or competing priorities. As a result, it is necessary to evaluate and 
prioritize actions to identify those that will perform best with respect to key decision criteria. 
This can be done using a simplified analysis of the potential costs and benefits of each action, 
as shown in the table below, or based on a full quantitative cost-benefit analysis.
On the cost side, in addition to any required capital expenditures and ongoing annual 
expenses, you should also consider the potential for negative side-effects, for example 
increasing greenhouse gas emissions or negatively impacting wildlife habitat. Feasibility 
considers action is possible, given technological, legal and/or economic constraints, and 
acceptability is about whether the public/City Council would accept and implement the action.
On the benefit side, the effectiveness of the action in achieving your adaptation goals is 
clearly important. But it is also important to consider equity, and whether the action helps 
under-served and marginalized groups in the community. To help manage uncertainty about 
future levels of climate change, a higher priority should be given to actions that offer greater 
flexibility to modify, or scale-up or down over time. Finally, the potential for the action to 
generate co-benefits for the community in addition to reducing risk, should be considered.

The performance of each adaptation action with respect to each of these decision criteria can 
be scored by staff and stakeholders using a 5-point scale like that shown, with the resulting 
total scores across all criteria used to rank and prioritize actions for inclusion in your climate 
adaptation action plan.

An implementation plan can include, for each priority action, 
information about:
•	
the type of action, for example, whether it is a program, 
plan, policy, project, partnership, etc.
•	
the timeline to have the action implemented or 
initiated, whether in the short-, medium-, or long-term
•	
total implementation costs, estimated in dollar values 
ranging from low to high
•	
the lead agency or organization that will be responsible 
for ensuring the action is implemented
•	
other partners or stakeholder required to support 
action implementation, both within your community and 
externally
Once priority actions have been identified, 
you can build your community’s climate 
adaptation plan by compiling information to 
support implementation. In general, you will 
find that a number of actions in your Action 
Plan can be implemented quickly with minimal 
investment, whereas other actions will have 
longer-term timelines, require a higher level of 
investment, and may require a more detailed 
implementation strategy with dedicated 
budgets and new funding sources, timelines 
and milestones for specific activities, and 
defined roles and responsibilities for specific 
stakeholders and groups.

A Climate Adaptation Action Plan documents the actions a community plans to implement 
in order to manage priority risks and opportunities posed by climate change. It also describes 
the process of arriving at the recommended actions, provides all materials used to support the 
decision-making process, and outlines how, when and by whom actions will be implemented.
Between 2015 and 2018, All One Sky Foundation and the Municipal Climate Change Action Centre 
partnered to deliver phase 1 and phase 2 of the Climate Resilience Express program. The program 
developed Climate Resilience Action Plans for 13 communities in Alberta, as well as development of the 
Climate Resilience Express Action Kit - a detailed how-to guide for municipal climate adaptation planning.

Implement
Once your climate adaptation plan is complete, the real work begins  – implementation! Some 
key considerations as you prepare for implementation and moving forward with making your 
community climate resilient are outlined below.
An important aspect of implementation is ‘mainstreaming’ – integrating climate resilience, as 
a matter of routine, into your community strategies, plans, policies, programs, projects, and 
administrative processes. This includes, for example: land use and development decisions; 
administrative processes such as bids, tendering and contracts for planning and development 
work; strategic plans (e.g., the Municipal Development Plan) and neighborhood scale plans; 
and decisions related to the design, maintenance, and upgrading of long-life infrastructure 
and assets.
Your  Climate Adaptation Action Plan should be evaluated regularly—at least every 5 years—to 
ensure it remains effective and relevant. The evaluation should consider:
•	
Lessons learned from the implementation of actions, both in terms of whether actions 
have been implemented as intended and the effectiveness of implemented actions in 
achieving the intended results. 
•	
New research and scientific information on climate projections and impacts, which may 
affect the understanding of risks and opportunities facing the community. 
•	
Changes to community goals, or changes to social, economic or environmental 
conditions, which likewise may affect the understanding of risks and opportunities facing 
the community. 
Keeping your Action Plan relevant may only involve a few minor adjustments, but more than 
likely will require revisiting some of the steps in the planning process and preparing an 
updated Action Plan.

What are the keys to a successful adaptation planning process and implementation? Take 
some advice from municipal climate resilience leaders across Alberta:
The climate change risk assessment process gave us a clear understanding of 
our climate change impact priorities. We used the results to guide our climate 
adaptation planning and to evaluate and prioritize the most effective climate 
resilience measures for our community. Since completing the Plan in 2016 we 
have been working on major steep creek flood hazard mitigation and community 
FireSmarting.
—Amy Fournier, Town of Canmore 
As a small rural community, we’ve found success by partnering with other small 
communities in our region through the Resilient Rurals project. We are sharing 
resources and collaborating on regional climate adaptation and resilience initiatives. 
Particularly for rural communities, success requires a strong local champion and 
volunteers who are passionate about improving our livelihoods and moving projects 
forward.
—Jill Yanch, Town of Bruderheim
Link climate adaptation actions to existing initiatives and take implementation 
step-by-step.  For example, if the Fire Department is planning on educating the 
public on emergency preparedness, work with them to incorporate information on 
climate risks for the region. Offer support to other departments and champion their 
initiatives.  Ask for budget in increments.
—Kerra Chomlak, City of Leduc
An important priority for us was to ensure our community was engaged and 
informed throughout the process. We conducted several community surveys, hosted 
a virtual town hall meeting, and worked with community groups and schools to 
capture a range of perspectives. Specific efforts were made to connect with youth 
and our most vulnerable residents to ensure their feedback was taken into account 
in the development of the action plan. Effective community engagement is key to 
success and ensuring we develop and implement a just and equitable plan.
—Caitlin Van Gaal, City of Spruce Grove
ALL ONE SKY FOUNDATION is a not-for-profit, charitable organization established to help vulnerable 
populations at the crossroads of energy and climate change. We do this through education, research 
and community-led programs, focusing our efforts on adaptation to climate change and energy 
poverty. Our vision is a society in which ALL people can afford the energy they require to live in warm, 
comfortable homes, in communities that are resilient and adaptive to a changing climate.
Our Work
Our climate is changing and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. How do we prepare for impacts 
on our infrastructure, public services, economic activity, environment and quality of life? We can work with your 
community or organization to minimize harm from these changes, take advantage of beneficial opportunities, 
and help you anticipate and prepare for the impacts of climate change.
Energy poverty is a cross‐cutting policy issue, with implications for general poverty alleviation, health and social 
well-being, housing and climate change strategies. Our work focuses on researching the extent, causes and 
impacts of energy poverty, convening stakeholders to discuss barriers to action and solutions, and designing 
projects and programs to address the issue.
Information on the economic impacts of climate change, and the costs and benefits of alternative courses of action, 
is increasingly required by decision-makers. Our work focuses on generating economic information and tools to 
help make the case to invest in climate mitigation and adaptation, and to inform the selection, timing and level of 
investment in specific actions.

We support communities and organizations to:
•	
Plan for climate change impacts and build resilience
•	
Build capacity to better understand changes, risks, 
vulnerabilities and actions
•	
Conduct research on climate impacts and adaptation
In Alberta, we have worked with over 20 municipalities 
and directly engaged over 500 municipal staff members 
on climate adaptation and resilience planning projects. 
Our Experience
The Municipal Climate Change Action Centre (Action Centre) was founded in 2009 as a 
collaborative initiative of Alberta Municipalities, Rural Municipalities of Alberta, and the 
Government of Alberta. 
The Action Centre delivers funding, technical assistance, and education to help 
Alberta municipalities, school authorities, and community related organizations 
advance actions that lower energy costs, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and 
improve climate resilience. 
In October 2020, the Government of Alberta announced the allocation of $4.5 million 
to the Action Centre to develop and administer the Climate Adaptation Program. 
The Climate Adaptation Program enhances the ability of Alberta municipalities and 
Indigenous communities to prepare for and respond to climate-related risks.  
Through the Climate Adaptation Program, the Action Centre provided funding for the 
development of the Climate Resilience Express Planning Guide, in partnership with      
All One Sky Foundation.  
This update to the Climate Resilience Express resources was made to reflect 
the significant advances in access to climate information now available to 
support adaptation planning, and new international standards published for 
climate vulnerability, impacts and risk assessments, and adaptation planning for                          
local governments.
