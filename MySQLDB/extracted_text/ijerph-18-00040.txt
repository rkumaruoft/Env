Abstract: The world is faced with signiﬁcant climate change, rapid urbanization, massive energy
consumption, and tremendous pressure to reduce greenhouse gases. Building heating and cooling
is one primary source of energy consumption and anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. First,
this review presents previous studies that estimate the speciﬁc amount of climate change impact
on building heating and cooling energy consumption, using the statistical method, physical model
method, comprehensive assessment model method, and the combination method of statistical and
physical model methods. Then, because the heating and cooling degree days indices can simply
and reliably indicate the effects of climate on building heating and cooling energy consumption,
previous studies were reviewed from the aspects of heating and cooling degree days indices, re-
gional spatial-temporal variations in degree days and related indices, inﬂuencing factors of the
spatial distributions of degree days, and the impacts of urbanization on degree days. Finally, sev-
eral potential key issues or research directions were presented according to the research gaps or ﬁelds
that need to be studied further in the future, such as developing methods to simply and accurately
estimate the speciﬁed amounts of climate change impact on building cooling and heating energy
consumption; using more effective methods to analyze the daytime, nighttime, and all-day spatial-
temporal changes in different seasons in the past and future under various environment contexts by
considering not only the air temperature but also the relative humidity, solar radiation, population,
etc., and further exploring the corresponding more kinds of driving forces, including the various
remotely sensed indices, albedo, nighttime light intensity, etc.; estimating the daytime, nighttime,
and all-day impacts of urbanization on heating degree days (HDDs), cooling degree days (CDDs),
and their sum (HDDs + CDDs) for vast cities in different environmental contexts at the station site,
city, regional and global scales; producing and sharing of the related datasets; and analyzing the
subsequent effects induced by climate change on the energy consumption for building heating and
cooling, etc.

1. Introduction
Buildings are among the sectors with the highest energy consumption, accounting
for approximately 40% of the total global energy consumption and generating more than

30% of human-made carbon dioxide emissions [1]. A considerable part of this energy
consumption is used in space heating and cooling. Heating, ventilation and cooling account
for 35% of primary energy use in America, while a similar level will be reached within ﬁve
years in China [2]. Meanwhile, near-surface temperatures have increased signiﬁcantly in
most parts of the globe over the past 100 years, especially in recent decades [3]. During the
62 years from 1951 to 2012, the temperature increased by 0.12 ◦C every 10 years, which was
1.88 times the increase observed since 1880 [3]. Moreover, in recent decades, rapid and
intensive urbanization has occurred worldwide, especially in Asia and Africa [4]. In 2018,
55 percent of the world’s population lived in cities. By 2050, the proportion will rise to
68% [4]. Rapid and high-intensity urbanization can lead to signiﬁcant changes in urban air
temperatures, relative humidity, wind speeds and other climatic factors due to the increase
in impervious urban surfaces, the decrease in vegetations and water bodies, the inﬂuxes
of population and the increase in human activity intensities. The median decline and
increase in global urban building heating and cooling energy consumption caused by urban
heat islands caused by urbanization were 18.7% and 19.0%, respectively [5]. However,
the effects varied signiﬁcantly among different cities [5]. The heating decrease rates were
3–45%, and the cooling increase rates were 10–120% [5]. In the future, urban climate change
will have a more signiﬁcant impact on energy consumption with the rapid progression of
global urbanization, the increase in ownership and utilization rates of air conditioning [2,6],
the improvements in people’s economic conditions [7], the popularity of glass facade
buildings [8], and so on. The urban heat island effect, for example, can cause consequences
that are not only related to the energy consumption for heating and cooling but also to
the worsening of comfort conditions in buildings (working and educational spaces ﬁrstly)
and to the increase of the stress principally in the most sensible part of the population
(such as old people) in many time periods and places with hot climate [9–11]. The greater
energy demand for cooling is caused by the increased heat stress may well present a
growing threat to human health [11,12] and economic productivity globally [11,13].
It is of great theoretical and practical value to analyze the inﬂuences of global, re-
gional or urban climate change on building heating and cooling energy consumption.
Therefore, numerous previous studies have been carried out in this research ﬁeld. How-
ever, relevant reviews are quite scarce. Thus, this paper aimed to review the related
previous studies in terms of the adopted methods, including the statistical method, physi-
cal model method, comprehensive assessment model method, the combination method of
statistical and physical model methods, and degree days method; ﬁnally, several potential
key issues and research directions were proposed.
2. Speciﬁc Amounts Estimation of Climate Change Inﬂuences on Building Heating
and Cooling Energy Consumption
Many studies have been carried out on estimating the speciﬁc amounts of inﬂuences
of global, regional or urban climate change on building heating and cooling energy con-
sumption in the past or future. Research methods have mainly included statistical method,
physical model method, comprehensive assessment model method, and the combination
of the statistical and physical model methods (Table 1).
2.1. Statistical Method
The statistical method aimed to establish the relationship between the meteorological
factors and the total energy consumption of a single building [14,15], energy consumption
that has overcome the social and economic impacts by the de-trending method [16–18],
or the components of energy consumption caused by seasonal changes obtained through
multiplicative decomposition [19] for a region or city (Figure 1); or build the relationship
between the total energy consumption [20,21], energy consumption per capita [6,22], en-
ergy consumption per household [6], or energy consumption per unit of gross domestic
product (GDP) [23] of a city or region, and meteorological, social or economic factors.
These meteorological factors can be classiﬁed as air temperature driven type, non-air tem-
perature driven type, and compound driven types. The air temperature driven factors

include hourly temperature [14], daily maximum temperature [14,16], minimum tempera-
ture [14], and mean temperature [14,18,20,23], monthly mean temperature [6], and degree
days [14,17,24], degree-hours [25], degree-minutes [24], number of days during the heat-
ing period [22], power function of degree days [22] calculated based on temperature, etc.
Non-air temperature driven factors mainly include the total solar radiation [24], aver-
age relative humidity [6,24], total precipitation [16,24], days of precipitation [6], average
wind speed [6,24], average atmospheric pressure [24], and so on. Compound driven
type factors have also been proposed, such as a modiﬁed air temperature index con-
sidering the air temperature, urban heat island effect, humidity effect and cumulative
effect [26]. Social or economic factors mainly include GDP per capita [17,22], total GDP [21],
income per capita [22,25], urbanization rate [22], population [21], number of employ-
ees [25], energy price [21], and so on. Methods used to establish the relationship between
energy consumption and its inﬂuencing factors mainly include simple regression analy-
sis [6,16,19,21,22,25], subsection regression analysis [14], econometric model [15,24], par-
tial correlation analysis [16], bivariate correlation analysis [16], Spearman rank correlation
analysis [27], polynomial ﬁtting method [20,28], and so on.

The statistical method has some limitations. First, this method usually requires build-
ing heating and cooling energy consumption records with a long historical span and the
corresponding driving factors of the same spatial and time caliber [18–20,23,37]. This con-
dition is not easy to satisfy. First, the data itself are sometimes not always readily available.
For example, since 2005, China’s electricity data have been stated conﬁdential data [46].
Second, the energy consumption data for building heating and cooling are often mixed with
these data for other uses. Third, the statistical caliber of the obtained building heating and
cooling energy consumption data may not be consistent with the driving factors. Therefore,
the relationship between building heating and cooling energy consumption and climate
factors may be weakened largely by mixing together data from different backgrounds
or time periods due to different driving mechanisms. For example, it is very difﬁcult
to separate urban and rural energy consumption data in China [46]. Second, the energy
consumption data of building heating and cooling are not only affected by climate, but also
by economic, social and technological factors. On this basis, previous studies have usually
adopted energy consumption per capita, per household or per unit GDP rather than total
energy consumption, or used de-trending methods to eliminate the interference of other
factors. However, it is difﬁcult to completely eliminate the interferences of non-climatic
factors because there are too many factors and their interactions are complex, and the
tendencies of some social, economic and climatic factors themselves. Third, the spatial
and temporal resolutions of the research results obtained based on the statistical method
are low [5].
2.2. Model Method
2.2.1. Physical Model Method
The physical model method has commonly used software to simulate the heating
and cooling energy consumption of buildings under past, present and future climate or
building parameters, including TRNSYS [32,33,40], EnergyPlus [30,47–50], thermal analysis
system [51], VisualDOE [29,39], IES-VE [52], etc. According to different simulated building
objects, this method can be further divided into the prototype method that simulated
some artiﬁcial set buildings, that did not exist in reality but could realistically represent
the main building types [30–33,38,47,50], and the sample method that simulates highly
representative buildings that existed in the real world [51]. The parameters required in
the model to represent past and present states were derived from actual observations or
statistics [30,31,51]. Future meteorological and building parameters were mostly derived
from numerical model simulation and relevant planning respectively [31,51].
In addition, previous studies used physical models to analyze the impacts of ur-
banization on the energy consumption for building heating and cooling by comparting
the differences in energy consumption under different urban and rural meteorological
parameters derived from meteorological observation records, including temperature, rel-
ative humidity, wind speed, dew point temperature, etc. [32,33,47]. Moreover, the local
microclimate changes under different ameliorative measures can be simulated by using the
urban microclimate simulation software, such as ENVI-Met. Then, these meteorological
parameters were input into the energy consumption software to obtain the corresponding
amounts of energy consumption, and the impacts of different ameliorative measures on
energy consumption were further analyzed [52].
This method requires very detailed building and environmental parameters, such as
the orientation, position and size of doors and windows, lighting inside the building, num-
ber of people, building materials, other energy consumption terminals, etc. (Table 2) [30,50].
This method can simulate energy consumption up to the hour scale, spends on a large
amount of computational time, requires a high level of professional knowledge, and is
mainly suitable for a single building or local scale studies [32,33,47,49,50]. Based on the
simulation of a typical single building, a few studies have extended the research to the
regional scale by combining the investigation data of different types of single buildings
and their energy consumption values [30,31].

2.2.2. Comprehensive Assessment Model Method
In this method, some key parameters affecting the heating and cooling energy con-
sumption of buildings were selected instead of the overly detailed building parameters
for rough simulation [34–36] or calculation [7,37].
Some unknown parameters were
roughly and simply set to a ﬁxed value. This method is usually used to simulate en-
ergy consumption at the year [7,35] or month [37] scale, and is suitable for regional [35,37]
or global scale [7].
2.3. Combination Method of the Statistical and Model Methods
In this method, ﬁrstly, the building heating and cooling energy consumption sim-
ulated by the physical model was taken as the actual energy consumption. Secondly,
the relationship between the simulated energy consumption and climate factors was es-
tablished. Finally, the impacts of future climate change on energy consumption were
predicted [29,38–40]. This method can estimate speciﬁc amounts of inﬂuences of climate
change on building heating and cooling energy consumption in a single building without
using actual energy consumption data. Moreover, it can alleviate the problems of time-
consuming and complex operation of the physical model method to some extent, but it still
cannot avoid the inherent defects of the physical model method.
3. Inﬂuences of Climate Change on the Energy Consumption of Building Heating and
Cooling Based on the Degree Days Method
Building heating and cooling energy consumption is generally assumed to be pro-
portional to the differences between indoor and outdoor temperatures. Based on this
assumption, the degree days indices, which are closely related to temperature, have be-
come a widely recognized and adopted simple, efﬁcient and reliable indicator to represent
the impacts of climate change on the energy consumption of building heating and cool-
ing [43–45,53].
3.1. Indices Related with Degree Days
From the indicated content aspects, the existing indices of degree days can be mainly
divided into three categories: heating degree days (HDDs), cooling degree days (CDDs),
and their sum (HDDs + CDDs). HDDs and CDDs refer to the sum of the degrees in which
the outdoor average daily temperature is lower than the heating or higher than the cooling
reference temperature, calculated within the numbers of days characterizing the heating
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 40
8 of 18
or cooling period respectively (Equations (1) and (2)) [53]. In addition, some studies have
used HDDs + CDDs to indicate the total energy consumption of heating and cooling [54,55].
Other derived indicators have also been applied, including the numbers of days during the
heating or cooling period [42,56,57], beginning and ending dates of the heating or cooling
period [42,56], and boundary lines of heating areas [56].
CDD =
n
∑
i=1
(Tmeani −Tbc)+,
(1)
where Tmeani is speciﬁed as the mean daily air temperature on the ith day during the study
period, usually referring to the cooling period; Tbc is the baseline temperature for cooling;
n is the days in the study period, usually referring to the cooling period; and + means that
only positive values can be used.
HDD =
n
∑
i=1
(Tbh −Tmeani)+,
(2)
where: the Tmeani and + have the same meaning in Equation (1); Tbh is the baseline temper-
ature for heating, n is the days of the study period, usually referring to the heating period.
From the calculation aspects, these indices can be mainly divided into two categories:
temperature-driven and multifactor-driven indices. Temperature-driven indices were
calculated based on only air temperature data, mainly including degree days calculated
based on quarterly [41], hourly [58,59], daily [26,45], or monthly mean temperatures [60],
degree-hours based on hourly temperatures [61], and degree-minutes based on minute
temperatures [24]. The setting of the reference temperature was related to the accuracy
of indicating the actual energy consumption of such indicators [60,62–64]. The reference
temperature was mainly determined based on the relationship between actual energy
consumption and temperature data [62–65] or complied with the standards speciﬁed by
international, national or regional authorities [42,56,58,60,66–68]. The multifactor-driven
indices not only considered the air temperature, but also other factors closely related to
energy consumption. These factors included degree days calculated by the heat index or
humidex, both of which were derived from both air temperature and relative humidity [43],
CDDs calculated based on wet-bulb temperature [44] or enthalpy which accounts for latent
heat as well as sensible heat [69], degree days based on environmental stress index that
considered temperature, relative humidity and solar radiation at the same time [43], and an
extended version of CDDs calculated based on temperature, including the temperature,
speciﬁc humidity effects, and residual temperature in recent days [70].
Despite the existence of a variety of degree days indicators, most of the existing studies
still adopt temperature driven indicators, which only consider the impacts of temperature
on energy consumption and ignore the roles of factors such as relative humidity, solar ra-
diation, etc. [43,46,70]. In addition, due to the lack of long-term detailed time-interval
temperature observation data, most studies have adopted the degree days calculated based
on the average daily temperature, which was unable to characterize the inter-day detailed
changes in energy consumption during all-day period [61].
3.2. Spatial-Temporal Changes in Indices Related to Degree-Days
Existing studies have analyzed the spatial-temporal changes in HDDs or CDDs [43,45,53],
HDDs + CDDs [55], numbers of days during the heating or cooling period [42,71–73],
start and end times for heating [42,56], boundary lines for heating areas [56] etc., in the
past [43–45] or the future [20,55,74] at the city scale [58,75], region [53,76] or global scale
(Figure 2) [43–45], and have used observational records of sites [45,53], simulation results
from climate models [71,77] or reanalysis data [43,44]. Previous studies have mostly been
carried out at the site scale and analyzed the spatial-temporal changes in degree days
by using site observation data [42,56,64,72,78]. Some studies used the inverse distance
interpolation [45], ordinary kriging model [55], co-kriging model [58], regression krig-

ing [41], kriging with external drift scheme [60], and the multiple regression model [79]
to interpolate the results on the sites to the surface. Moreover, some previous studies
analyzed the interannual variation trends of degree days, by using the Man-Kendall
method [42,44,56,80], linear trend analysis [42,78], or a simple comparison of degree days
in the historical and future periods [20], etc.
 
Figure 2. Global cooling degree days accounting for humidity by setting the base temperatures as 18 ◦C. The data
were derived from http://hs.pangaea.de/model/MistryM_2019a/CDD_wetbulb_GeoTIFF.tar.gz [33]. The classiﬁcation
thresholds were determined by the natural break method.
Some deﬁciencies still exit in this research ﬁeld. Firstly, previous studies generally
analyzed the spatial-temporal changes in all-day HDDs or CDDs in a speciﬁc region during
the whole heating or cooling period. Comparative studies are lacking in terms of the
variation rules between the daytime and nighttime, and among different seasons or regions
with different contexts. However, the mechanisms of the degree days are likely to be
different under different conditions. Secondly, most of the existing studies have used the
degree days calculated by daily temperature, ignoring the inﬂuences of natural factors
such as relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed, etc., and social and economic factors
such as population and GDP, etc., and also have failed to indicate the inter-day changes
in detail. Thirdly, most studies have analyzed the interannual variability of degree days
by only calculating the variation rates and their signiﬁcance. Other research contents or
effective analysis methods can be considered in the future. For instance, the future change
trends of degree days can be explored using the Hearst exponent calculated by the rescaled
range analysis method. Regionalization of degree days changes can be realized using
the rotated empirical orthogonal function or cluster method. Both geostatistical analysis
and landscape methods can be considered to analyze the spatial-temporal patterns more
effectively. Fourthly, the degree days are different in urban, suburban and rural areas.
Nevertheless, this issue has not been fully considered by previous studies focusing on
the analysis of spatial-temporal changes in a certain area. The spatial resolutions of both
climate models and reanalysis data were too crude to fully reveal the above-mentioned
differences. The spatial resolutions of the former were 0.11◦, approximately 12.5 km [76],
or even 0.25–1◦[71], while the spatial resolution of the typical reanalysis data from the
National Center for Environmental Forecasting was 0.25◦. However, most of the studies
based on the observation data of stations directly used the data of all stations without
distinguishing the types of stations [45], thus leading to a certain level of error. It was
truly appreciated that some studies interpolated the observed results at these station points
to the regional extent by considering some urbanizing factors. For example, Schatz and
Kucharik [41] used the regression kriging or linear regression method to consider the

inﬂuences of the abundances of the impervious surfaces on the upscaling (from the station
point scale to the region space ﬁeld scale) of HDDs and CDDs in Madison, Wisconsin USA.
3.3. Inﬂuece Factors of the Spatial Distribution of Degree Days
Mastering the inﬂuencing factors of degree days is not only necessary for the regula-
tion of the energy consumption of heating and cooling, but also beneﬁcial to accurately
extend the observation results on the station points to the space ﬁeld of the region. However,
such studies are very limited (Table 3). The current study areas were limited to a very small
number of places, including Madison, Wisconsin, USA (Table 4) [41], Florence, Italy [68],
Andalusia Autonomous Region, Spain [79], Bangladesh [53], Xinjiang, China [80], etc.
Previous studies have only analyzed the driving factors of HDDs or CDDs throughout the
whole day, ignoring the differences in the mechanisms of degree days between daytime
and nighttime, or among different seasons, and have not considered the inﬂuencing factors
of HDDs + CDDs. Factors that have been considered were limited to latitude, longitude
and altitude [53,80], distance to large water bodies [41,79], abundance of impervious sur-
faces [41,68], large scale atmospheric circulation indices [53], etc. The analysis methods
mainly included partial correlation analysis [79], linear regression [53], spatial regres-
sion [41], Random Forest (RF) model [53], etc.

3.4. Impacts of Urbanization on Degree Days
To clarify the impacts of urbanization on degree days (Figure 3), existing studies
usually simply compare the differences in the HDDs or CDDs calculated based on daily
temperature data between urban and suburban or rural stations of a single city [41,81–83].

To the best of our knowledge, only Klimenko, et al. [84] compared the differences in the
HDDs and CDDs between the urban and suburban stations for several Russian cities.
Figure 3. Schematic diagram of the impacts of urbanization on heating and cooling degree days.
Existing studies have usually ignored the differences in the inﬂuence of urbanization
inﬂuence on the degree days within cities, among different cities, between the daytime
and nighttime, and among different seasons or years, as well as the effects of relative
humidity, population, and other factors. Moreover, studies are still lacking which evaluate
the urbanization effects on HDDs, CDDs, and HDDs + CDDs for numerous cities under
different environmental contexts, using the hourly or even subhourly data, considering not
only the air temperature but also the humidity, solar radiation, population, etc., at multiple
spatial scales, including station, city, and regional scales.
4. Future Directions
Although many studies have been carried out on the impacts of climate change on
building heating and cooling energy consumption, there are still some blank areas or re-
search ﬁelds that need to be further deepened. Based on the above review, several potential
key issues or research directions are proposed.
4.1. Estimating the Amounts of Impacts of Climate Change on Building Heating and Cooling
Energy Consumption
What are the adaptation possibilities and what can be done to mitigate the impact
of climate change on buildings energy requirements? The effort to guarantee high levels
of energy efﬁciency in the building sector is currently recognized as an important goal
and it is also promoted by national and international legislation [85]. Simpler and more
effective methods are urgently needed to accurately assess the impact of climate change
on building cooling and heating energy consumption accurately, especially in regions
where it is extremely difﬁcult to obtain and separate data on building heating and cooling
energy consumption. These studies may be carried out at different scales, or by considering
different elements. For instance, which kinds of design schemes are more energy-saving
buildings under various contexts? These potential designs can be obtained by investi-
gating the various functions of the existing buildings, and the ideas of the designers can
also be brought into play. Both passive and active strategies can be developed in these
designs, including adopting the correct orientation of the buildings, planning the ventila-
tion corridors properly, using more effective materials, taking full advantage of the solar
radiation, integrating of new systems fed by solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric energy,
etc. [85]. Not only the building but also the vegetation and water elements should be
considered by using the building energy consumption and urban microclimate simulation
software (such as ENVI-Met) together. The amount and pattern of green or water space,
vegetation types (forest, shrub, and grass) or species, greening methods (roof greening,
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 40
12 of 18
horizontal, and vertical greening) and so on can be considered. Similar studies can be
carried out at the building block scale. The two- and three-dimensional information about
buildings, green spaces, and water bodies in urban and regional areas can be obtained
by using various methods, including remote sensing, geographic information technology,
ﬁeld research, viewing the statistical data, and big data technology, etc. Based on the
above-mentioned information and the simulation results at the building and building block
scale, the amounts of impacts of climate change on building heating and cooling energy
consumption can be estimated at the city or region scale.
4.2. Spatial-Temporal Changes in Heating and Cooling Degree Days and Their Inﬂuencing Factors
Studies focusing on more representative study areas under different contexts, espe-
cially at the global scale, should be considered, rather than limiting to a few or some cities
or a speciﬁed region. Urban, suburban, and rural regions should be treated as separate,
rather than being mixed together. Both the intra-annual and inter-annual spatial-temporal
changes in degree days should be studied in the HDDs, CDDs, and HDDs + CDDs during
not only the all-day periods, but also during the daytime and nighttime in the past and
the future. The degree days indices should be calculated based not only on the daily air
temperature, but also on the relative humidity, solar radiation, population, etc. Moreover,
hourly or even minute-level data should be used at higher density stations. More ef-
fective methods should be introduced to more deeply analyze spatial-temporal changes,
such as the Hurst exponent method, rotated empirical orthogonal function (REOF) method,
geostatistical and landscape analysis, etc.
Future studies should be carried out on the natural, social, or economic factors inﬂu-
encing the spatial-temporal changes in HDDs, CDDs, and HDDs + CDDs during daytime,
nighttime, and all-day in different seasons under different climatic contexts, such as land-
scape composition and pattern, remote sensed indices of building, vegetation, water or
bare soil, albedo, nighttime light intensity, sky view factor, heat release, population density,
etc. (Figure 4). In addition, the analysis method of the inﬂuencing factors of degree days
also needs to be improved. For instance, the scale effects of inﬂuencing factors for each
degree days index under different conditions should be considered. More effective methods
should be introduced, such as the machine learning method.

4.3. Impacts of Urbanization on Heating and Cooling Degree Days
It is necessary to accurately estimate the effects of urbanization on the heating and
cooling degree day during the daytime, nighttime, and all-day in different seasons and the
whole year under different environmental contexts at different scales, which can be possible
done by comprehensively utilizing multi-sources data and several methods. These data
may include hourly or subhourly meteorological data of high-density stations, land use
data in the middle or even high spatial resolution, raw remote sensing data, MODIS data,
defense meteorological satellite program (DMSP), and visible infrared imaging radiometer
suite (VIIRS) nighttime light data, digital elevation models, spatially discrete population
data, big data, etc. These methods may involve station observation methods, geographic in-
formation technology, remote sensing method, mathematical statistics, grey correlation,
machine learning method, landscape analysis, abrupt climate change detection, homog-
enization of climate data, etc. It should be noted that a large number of studies have
been carried out on the urbanization effects on the air temperature, apparent temperature,
and land surface temperature closely related to degree days, which can provide impor-
tant references for these studies on degree days. For example, previous studies on urban
heat islands [86,87] and the contribution of urbanization to temperature change [88,89]
can provide important theoretical and methodological references for analyzing the impacts
of urbanization on degree days. Based on the land use data, urban and rural stations
can be identiﬁed. Then, the impacts of urbanization at the site scale can be deﬁned as
the differences in the HDDs, CDDs, and HDDs + CDDs, and their corresponding interan-
nual variation rates between the urban and rural stations during the daytime, nighttime,
and all-day in each season and the whole year. The HDDs, CDDs, and HDDs + CDDs
at the regional scale can be obtained based on their values at the sites, and their relation-
ships with many inﬂuencing factors. Finally, the urbanization effects on HDDs, CDDs,
and HDDs + CDDs at the regional scale can be derived based on urban and rural areas
using land use data.
4.4. Production and Share of Related Datasets
Accurate high-resolution datasets are extremely important for understanding the
effects of climate change on the energy consumption of building heating and cooling.
These datasets may involve weather data (including near-surface temperature, humidity,
solar radiation, heating and cooling degree days, etc.), energy data of building heating
and cooling (consumed fuel type and quantity), building parameters, land cover/use data,
digital elevation data, raw remote sensed data, remote sensed indices, nighttime light data,
sky view data, air conditioning usage data, motor vehicle data, population data, gross do-
mestic product per capita, related standards or policies, etc. These datasets should have
high spatial and temporal resolutions, consider not only the past but also the future period,
distinguish the differences between the urban and rural regions, take into account the het-
erogeneity within the city, etc. For instance, the heating and cooling degree datasets should
consider not only the temperature, but also the humidity, solar radiation, wind speed,
population density, etc. in hourly or even minute resolution in the past and the future,
produced based on the observed data in the higher density weather stations, taking into
account the heterogeneity inside the city or differences among different cities or regions,
etc. While producing and sharing these data sets is quite important, multidisciplinary
efforts and cross-cutting studies are required in the future.
4.5. Subsequent Effects Induced by the Climate Change on the Energy Consumption of Building
Heating and Cooling
Climate change can not only affect the energy consumption of building heating and
cooling, but also further cause other issues, such as the emissions of carbon dioxide and
the release of air pollutants (sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, freon, PM2.5, PM10, etc.),
decrease of the comfort level in human settlements, increase of the disease risk among
residents, leading to water thermal pollution and further destroying its ecological balance,
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 40

impeding the increase of economic productivity, etc. All these research ﬁelds should be
encouraged to be studied in the future.
5. Conclusions
This paper aimed to summarize the important progress of previous research involving
the effects of climate change on the energy consumption of building heating and cooling,
analyze some shortcomings in this research ﬁeld, and propose several potential research
directions. The main ﬁndings are as the follows.
(1) Estimating the amounts of impacts of global, regional, or urban climate change
on building heating and cooling energy consumption accurately can provide direct and
clear research results for sustainable human development. However, most of the existing
studies either require detailed data on energy consumption and its inﬂuencing factors,
or rely on complex and time-consuming physical models that require detailed building and
background environmental parameters and can usually only simulate individual buildings.
How to mitigate the impacts of climate change on buildings energy requirements and guar-
antee high levels of energy efﬁciency in the building sector should be highly emphasized.
These studies may be carried out at different scales (single building, building block, city and
region scales), or by considering different elements (building, vegetation, and waterbody),
by making use of multisource data and various methods.
(2) Previous studies have analyzed the interannual spatial-temporal changes in degree
days during all-day periods in a certain region on the station or regional scale in both the
past and the future. However, the vast majority of these studies used the degree days
calculated based on the daily air temperature of all stations, ignoring the inﬂuences of
relative humidity, solar radiation, population, etc., failed to indicate the inter-day changes
in detail, and neglected the different mechanisms between the daytime or nighttime,
among different seasons, under different environmental contexts, and in urban, subur-
ban, and rural regions. Moreover, more effective methods should be introduced to more
deeply analyze spatial-temporal changes more deeply, such as the Hurst exponent method,
REOF method, geostatistical and landscape analysis, etc. Research on inﬂuencing factors
of spatial-temporal changes in degree days was quite limited. It is urgent to deepen the
study of more inﬂuencing factors of degree days in different time periods or environmental
contexts, such as the remotely sensed indices of building, vegetation, water, bare soil,
albedo, nighttime light intensity, etc.
(3) Some existing studies on the impacts of urban climate change on building heating
and cooling energy consumption based on the degree days method were usually limited
to comparing the differences in HDDs or CDDs between urban and suburban or rural
stations for one city. In the future, these studies can be carried out to analyze the impacts of
urbanization on HDDs, CDDs, and HDDs + CDDs for vast cities in different environment
contexts at the station site, city, region, and global scales. These studies should use hourly
or subhourly data, consider several key factors of degree days, including temperature,
humidity, population, etc., and take into account the differences in urbanization impacts
on degree days within the same city, between daytime and nighttime, among different
seasons and years. A large number of previous studies on urban heat islands, the contri-
bution of urbanization to temperature change, etc., can provide important theoretical and
methodological references for analyzing the impacts of urbanization on degree days.
(4) The production and sharing of related datasets (not limited to weather datasets
of the past and future) with high accuracy at high spatial and temporal resolutions are
extremely important for future studies. This will require many multidisciplinary efforts
and cross-disciplinary studies in the future.
(5) Not only are the impacts of climate change on the energy consumption of building
heating and cooling considered, but further induced issues should also be emphasized,
such as the emissions of carbon dioxide and air pollutants, decrease in the comfort level in
human settlements, and increases in the disease risk among residents, etc.

(6) It is possible to solve the above issues by comprehensively utilizing multisources
data and several methods. These data may include hourly or subhourly meteorological
data from high-density stations, long-term historical observation data from stations, re-
mote sensing data, and population data, etc. The necessary methods may involve station
observation methods, geographic information technology, remote sensing method, machine
learning method, etc.
