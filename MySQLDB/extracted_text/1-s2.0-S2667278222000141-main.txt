The global crises of climate change and of the COVID-19 pandemic are straining young peoples’ mental health
and their mitigation behaviours. We surveyed German-speaking university students aged 18 to 30 years on
their negative emotions regarding both crises repeatedly before and during the COVID-19 crisis. Different
emotional patterns emerged for climate change and for COVID-19 with negative emotions regarding COVID-
19 increasing during the pandemic. We were further able to differentiate between emotional responses asso-
ciated with impaired wellbeing and those associated with mitigation efforts. Our ﬁndings emphasise the
need to focus on a mixture of highly inactivating and activating emotions regarding COVID-19 as they are
associated with both reduced wellbeing and mitigation behaviours. The ﬁndings broaden the understanding
of how young adults react to the burden of two global crises and what role negative emotions play.

1. Introduction
When the COVID-19 pandemic emerged, researchers early on
focused on the mental health impacts of the pandemic and the meas-
ures implemented to limit the spread of the virus. Studies found an
increasing prevalence of mental illness with young people being par-
ticularly affected [1]. One explanation is an increase in negative emo-
tions during the pandemic [2] which were found to be associated
with different psychopathological symptoms [3,4]. However, the
COVID-19 pandemic is not the only global crisis humanity is currently
facing. Even if greenhouse gas emissions were limited during lock-
downs, climate change did not halt [5]. Climate change will particu-
larly affect younger people as they will likely suffer from its impact
during their lifetime and might be particularly vulnerable to mental
health impacts exacerbated by climate change [6,7]. Regarding men-
tal health effects on people who are not directly exposed to climate
change impacts, there is a focus on emotions like anxiety, worry,
anger, or grief [8−11]. Simultaneously, negative emotional reactions
are deemed a critical factor for climate-friendly behaviour [12,13].
Taken together, negative emotions regarding climate change might
constitute healthy and adaptive responses to this threat but might
also lead to problematic outcomes [10]. Therefore, there is an increas-
ing focus on differentiating emotions [6,11]. Following Feldman Bar-
rett [14,15], emotions can be differentiated by levels of pleasure and
activation. Accordingly, emotions can be experienced as positive or
as negative and they can vary in their degree of inducing activity or
mobilization. Stanley and colleagues found that the activating nega-
tive emotion eco-anger −but not the less activating eco-anxiety and
eco-depression −is associated with both better mental health out-
comes and more mitigation efforts [11].
As climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic represent global
crises with several similarities and presumed mental health impact,
especially for young people, studying both simultaneously is one step
in understanding emotional reactions to crises and their mental
health and behavioural implications. This is especially important
since the combination of both crises might increase the burden on
mental health in interconnected ways. In this article, we compare
emotional reactions regarding COVID-19 and climate change, explore
changes over time, and analyse emotional patterns. Due to the nov-
elty of the situation and the research questions, analyses are explor-
atory. Additionally, we examine effects of negative emotions on
wellbeing and mitigation behaviour.
2. Method
This study is based on longitudinal data collected in online sur-
veys. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of

the University of Innsbruck. All participants provided informed con-
sent at the beginning of each survey. Participants were university stu-
dents recruited via mailing lists of two universities in Innsbruck,
Austria, and by contacting students who participated in a previous
survey. In total, three surveys during the COVID-19 pandemic are
included in this analysis:
 T1 −July 8 to August 29, 2020
 T2 −November 23 to December 21, 2020
 T3 −April 13 to May 13, 2021
The cross-sectional focus of this study is on T3. We further used
data from a survey conducted to research effects of climate change
on young people’s mental health before COVID-19 became a
pandemic:
 T0 −December 3, 2019, to January 3, 2020
2.2. Measures
At the beginning of each survey, participants provided informa-
tion on basic sociodemographic data.
Negative emotions were measured using an eleven-item scale
based on a German translation of a scale measuring climate change
distress by Searle and Gow [16]. Participants rated the extent they
felt each emotion when thinking about climate change or the COVID-
19 crisis on a four-point Likert response format (1 does not apply at
all to 4 does apply completely or all the time). Negative emotions asso-
ciated with climate change were assessed in the surveys T0 and T3.
Negative emotions associated with the COVID-19 crisis were assessed
in surveys T1 through T3 (see Table 1).
Wellbeing was measured using a German version of the WHO-5 at
T3 [17]. Five items were rated on a six-point Likert response format
(0 never to 5 all the time, Cronbach’s a = 0.89). The scale was formed
by using the sum of all items.
Mitigation behaviour was assessed using four items for climate
friendly-behaviour and two items for adherence to COVID-19 meas-
ures at T3. Frequency of climate-friendly behaviours (e.g., ‘I make
sure to save electricity’) was assessed on a seven-point Likert
response format (1 very rarely to 7 very often). Participants could opt
out of answering individual items as not all items applied to every
person. Adherence to COVID-19 measures (e.g., ‘I independently take
measures to counteract the spread of the virus.’) was assessed on a
ﬁve-point Likert response format (1 does not apply at all to 5 does
apply completely). Mean scores were calculated with higher values
indicating more frequent mitigation behaviour. Internal consistency
was Cronbach’s a = 0.62 for climate-friendly behaviour and a = 0.62
for adherence with COVID-19 measures.
2.3. Sample
Participants were university students aged between 18 and
30 years. Students who did not complete the whole survey or who
had missing data in the relevant scales were excluded from the analy-
ses (the opt-out option was not considered missing data). At T0
N = 574 students participated, at T1 N = 430, at T2 N = 578, and at
T3 N = 314. Age and gender for all data collection points are presented
in Table 2. Of all students, n = 45 participated in all surveys T1
through T3 which was trackable via an anonymised code that could
be entered optionally. Amongst those participants women were
more frequent (n = 36, 80.0%) than men (n = 8, 17.8%). Mean age at T1
was 23.20 years (SD = 2.92). As we did not plan to use the data col-
lected before the pandemic in a longitudinal study, we did not
include a code to match participants in T0.
2.4. Data analysis
Data was analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics, Version 26.0. To
examine differences in emotions regarding the two crises as well as
changes over time, we used non-parametrical Wilcoxon-tests, Mann-
Whitney U-tests, and Friedman H-tests. To assess the factorial struc-
ture of the emotion scales, we used main-axis factor analyses using
data of T3. Factors were extracted based on the Eigenvalue > 1. The
effects of these emotion scales on wellbeing and mitigation behav-
iour at T3 were assessed by hierarchical linear regression analyses
with forced entry.
Additional details on descriptive data for all tests and subsamples
are presented in the appendix for reasons of space and clarity.
3. Results
3.1. Comparing emotions regarding COVID-19 and climate change
Using Wilcoxon-tests, we compared emotions evoked by the two
crises at T3. Results are presented in Fig. 1 (see also Table A.1). Partici-
pants felt more powerless (Z = 4.83, p < 0.001, h2 = 0.074),
depressed (Z = 5.86, p < 0.001, h2 = 0.109), stressed (Z = 8.84, p <
0.001, h2 = 0.249), and tense (Z = 4.85, p < 0.001, h2 = 0.075), when
thinking about the COVID-19 pandemic compared to climate change.
Climate change evoked feeling worried (Z = 5.98, p < 0.001,
h2 = 0.114) and concerned (Z = 5.97, p < 0.001, h2 = 0.114) more
strongly. There were no differences in feeling helpless, sad, hopeless,
angry, and anxious.
Correlations between emotions regarding climate change and
COVID-19 are presented in Table 3 (see also Table A.3). Correlations
were small to medium sized with largest associations for anxiety and
smallest associations for anger.
3.2. Changes during the COVID-19 crisis
Using only the subsample of students who participated in all three
surveys during the COVID-19 crisis, we assessed changes in their
emotional reactions during the pandemic. There were signiﬁcant
increases in feeling depressed (x2(2) = 12.39, p = 0.002, h2 = 0.275),
hopeless (x2(2) = 28.97, p < 0.001, h2 = 0.644), and helpless
(x2(2) = 17.53, p < 0.001, h2 = 0.390) in this subsample (see Fig. 2).
The remaining emotions did not reach the Bonferroni-corrected sig-
niﬁcance level of p < .004, although generally negative emotions
trended towards increasing (see Table A.4).

Using Mann-Whitney U-tests, we examined differences in climate
change associated emotions before and during the COVID-19 pan-
demic. There were signiﬁcant changes in some of the emotions. Stu-
dents felt less sad (U = 73,666.00, Z = 4.70, p < .001, h2 = 0.023),
anxious (U = 79,489.50, Z = 3.03, p = 0.002, h2 = 0.010), and angry
(U = 69,133.00, Z = 5.98, p < 0.001, h2 = 0.037) about climate change
during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to before (see Fig. 2). There
were no differences in the other emotions evoked by climate change
(all p > 0.004, see Table A.5).
3.3. Factorial structure of negative emotions
Data at T3 was used to analyse the factorial structures of both emo-
tion scales. For emotions regarding COVID-19 two factors were extracted
(KMO = 0.90, x2(55) = 1716.08, p < 0.001). The factors were named
‘despair’ (eight items) and ‘concern’ (three items). Both had a satisfactory
reliability of Cronbach’s a = 0.89 for despair and a = 0.81 for concern.
Mean for despair was M = 2.68 (SD = 0.77), mean for concern was
M = 2.52 (SD = 0.81). The pattern matrix is presented in Table 4.
For climate change, two factors were extracted (KMO = 0.92,
x2(55) = 1823.48, p < 0.001). The pattern differed from COVID-19
emotions. Eight items were combined into the scale ‘distress’. The
remaining three items referred to the factor ‘hopelessness’. Internal
consistency was Cronbach’s a = 0.90 for distress and a = 0.83 for
hopelessness. Mean for distress was M = 2.55 (SD = 0.76), mean for
hopelessness was M = 2.60 (SD = 0.88). The pattern matrix is pre-
sented in Table 5.
3.4. Effects of emotions on wellbeing
Correlation analyses indicated negative associations of negative
emotions and wellbeing. The more intense negative emotions were,
the lower was students’ wellbeing (see Table 6). Emotions correlated
positively. There were no effects of gender and age on wellbeing, but
women reported more negative emotions than did men.
We tested effects of the emotional reactions on wellbeing sepa-
rately for each crisis. COVID-19 associated emotions explained 33% of
variance of wellbeing (F(2, 311) = 76.05, p < 0.001, R2 = 0.33). Despair
had strong negative effects (B = 4.06, b = 0.57, p < .001). There
was no effect of COVID-19 concern (B = 0.05, b = 0.01, p = 0.903).
Negative emotions associated with climate change also had signiﬁ-
cant effects on wellbeing (F(2, 311) = 6.49, p = 0.002, R2 = 0.04). There
were signiﬁcant effects of hopelessness (B = 1.24, b = 0.20,
p = 0.008), but not of distress (B = 0.04, b = 0.01, p = 0.945).
Using multiple linear regression analysis, effects of all emotion
scales on students’ wellbeing were analysed simultaneously (see
Table 7). The model improved predictability of wellbeing signiﬁcantly
compared to the mean (F(4, 309) = 38.08, p < 0.001, R2 = 0.33). When
all emotions were included, the only signiﬁcant predictor for wellbe-
ing was despair associated with COVID-19 (b = 0.57, p < .001).
3.5. Effects on behaviour
Negative emotions were further tested for their effects on mitiga-
tion behaviour. Climate change distress (b = 0.21, p = 0.004) but not
hopelessness was associated with increased climate-friendly behav-
iour (F(2, 311) = 6.52, p = 0.002, R2 = 0.04; see Table 8, Model 1).
When adding COVID-19 emotions into the model, despair about the
pandemic was associated with reduced climate-friendly behaviour
(b = 0.15, p = 0.037; F(4, 309) = 4.38, p = 0.002, R2 = 0.05; see Table 8,
Model 2). However, DF(2, 309) = 2.19 (p = 0.114) was not signiﬁcant.
Adherence with COVID-19 measures was predicted by higher lev-
els of concern (b = 0.22, p = 0.001) and lower levels of despair
(b = 0.16, p = 0.020) regarding COVID-19 (F(2, 311) = 5.28, p = 0.006,
R2= 0.03; see Table 9, Model 1). Adding climate change emotions did
not signiﬁcantly improve the model (DF(2, 309) = 0.90, p = 0.409; see
Table 9, Model 2) and climate change emotions did not predict
COVID-19 mitigating behaviour.
4. Discussion
In this study, we examined negative emotions regarding the two
crises COVID-19 pandemic and climate change. Distinctive patterns
of negative emotions emerged for either crisis and different emotions

were more pronounced. These differences represent the effects of the
crises on peoples’ lives: COVID-19 severely affects everyday lives and
poses an immediate health threat. Climate change poses a threat as
well, but it is more abstract and does not yet directly affect peoples’
lives in the survey regions [18].
The severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on peoples’ lives
might have caused an urge to act against the crisis. However, people
might not have felt like they were actively and effectively contribut-
ing to crisis mitigation during social distancing as ﬁrst lockdowns
have not sustainably eased the pandemic. Consequently, emotions
like powerlessness and hopelessness were prevalent and increased
as the pandemic prolonged. This resulted in a mixture of strongly
activating and inactivating emotions which points to reduced emo-
tion differentiation. Emotion differentiation is characterised by the
ability to identify discrete emotions [19]. Being able to clearly differ-
entiate between emotions beyond their valence is important for
emotion regulation and adequate responses [19,20] which might
explain both reduced mental health and reduced mitigation behav-
iours. The second factor we identiﬁed was made up of activating
emotions like concern and worry. These emotions did not have men-
tal health impacts and were associated with increased mitigation
efforts which imply adaptive reactions to the COVID-19 crisis. Con-
cern, worry, and anxiety appeared to represent an adaptive response
to climate change as well, as these emotions were associated with
increased mitigation efforts. In contrast, the inactivating emotions of
hopelessness, powerlessness, and helplessness were associated with
decreased wellbeing, which resembles results for COVID-19. Hope-
lessness has been suggested to obstruct emotion regulation [21] and
to contribute to depression [22,23]. Therefore, motivating action
against crisis to support hope and a positive perspective might be
one pathway of protecting mental health while mitigating the crises.
Other than for COVID-19, emotions regarding climate change
were more clearly differentiated into activating and inactivating fac-
tors. One reason might be the longer presence of the climate crisis
than the pandemic that allows a more nuanced emotional reaction.
Supporting this assumption, factorial structures were stable over
time and samples [16]. Still, the results illustrate the dominant nature
of the COVID-19 pandemic in young adults’ lives as the pandemic also
made climate change mitigation behaviours more difﬁcult. For exam-
ple, protests were not possible and public transport was avoided.
Accordingly, some activating emotions regarding climate change
decreased during the pandemic. As people were unable to actively
ﬁght the pandemic or climate change during the COVID-19 crisis,
decreased activating emotions when action was not possible might
be adaptive. Other reasons for decreased climate change concern or
mitigation efforts during the pandemic might be economic strains
[24] or a ﬁnite pool of worries [25]. However, the decrease in emo-
tions should be interpreted with caution as other studies report no
decreases in climate change concern or climate-relevant behaviour
[26,27]. The differences might be due to different operationalizations
or different times of surveys during the COVID-19 pandemic.
While there was a negative effect of inactivating climate change
emotions on wellbeing, the effect was small and rendered non-signif-
icant when adding COVID-19 emotions to the model. The results do
not suggest that negative emotions regarding climate change have
effects on wellbeing beyond the effects of other stressors like COVID-
19. This is in line with ﬁndings from Verplanken and colleagues [28]
and suggests that the associations between negative climate change
emotions and mental health are based on a general tendency to expe-
rience negative emotions in some people which increases vulnerabil-
ity to psychological strains. For most people, negative emotions seem
to be appropriate regarding the threat and are not associated with
mental health. However, this missing link between climate change
emotions and wellbeing should not dismiss concerns about potential
mental health impacts of eco-anxiety and other emotions. Even if
there were no effects on a statistical level, there might be individuals
in whom concerns about climate change cause mental health strains.
Additionally, as climate change progresses, effects on mental health
can also be expected to increase.
4.1. Strengths and limitations
This study focused on a comparison of negative emotions regard-
ing climate change and COVID-19. A strength of the study is the lon-
gitudinal time frame that allowed to assess changes over time.
However, when interpreting the results of this study, its limitations
should be considered: First, we focused on a homogenous sample of
German-speaking university students and results cannot be general-
ised to other groups. Second, we compared emotions regarding cli-
mate change before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using two

different cross-sectional samples. Third, the results concerning miti-
gation behaviours should be interpreted with caution as internal con-
sistencies of both scales are relatively low, they relied on self-
reported behaviour, they were not directly comparable due to the dif-
ferent levels of abstraction, and there were issues concerning the nor-
mality of residuals in the analyses. Additionally, we focused on
negative emotions and did not consider effects of positive emotions.
The approach of measuring negative emotions using individual emo-
tion words cannot be equated with studies that conceptualise, for
example, eco-anxiety or climate change concern as multidimensional
constructs (e.g., [8,9,29]). Also, the scale cannot be considered com-
prehensive for the whole spectrum of possible emotions. Recent
efforts in creating taxonomies of climate change emotions [30] will
further enhance research.
Conclusion
Young people were feeling increasingly depressed, helpless, and
hopeless during the COVID-19 pandemic. The strong impact COVID-
19 had on students’ everyday lives dominated their wellbeing and cli-
mate change moved to the background. Comparing emotions evoked
by both crises enabled discrimination between emotions that induced
behavioural changes without impacting mental health on the one
hand, and emotions that impacted mental health on the other hand.
Our results further highlight the importance of psychosocial support
for young people suffering from the threat of two global crises.
