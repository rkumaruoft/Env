Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       xiii  
Executive Summary 
Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time. Rising atmospheric concentrations 
of greenhouse gases are altering the earth’s climate, driving increases in global average 
temperatures and variability and extremes of weather. These changes are causing 
unprecedented impacts, transforming ecosystem structure and function, damaging 
infrastructure, disrupting business operations, and imposing harm to human health and well-
being. Physical climate impacts and risks to human, natural and built systems in Ontario are 
driven by average annual warming temperature and extreme heat, drought, changes to 
intensity and frequency of precipitation and other climate variables. Avoiding or reducing the 
worst impacts of human-induced climate change requires action on parallel fronts: rapid and 
deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and proactive and planned measures to adapt to 
current and imminent future changes. While there are adaptation efforts underway to address 
these impacts, the rapid pace of climate change requires large scale, accelerated action in all 
facets of our society and economy.  
The Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment (PCCIA) provides an overview of 
impacts, including risks and opportunities, that stem from a changing climate. This report 
presents results of the comprehensive and multi-sectoral assessment of potential climate 
change-related impacts that underscore the understanding of how and where climate change 
may affect Ontario’s economy, infrastructure, communities, public health and safety, and 
ecosystems, and provides the impetus for adaptation planning and resilience action across the 
province. The PCCIA establishes a foundation of impacts against which future assessments can 
be compared and provides a methodological model for future province-wide studies. Methods 
used in the PCCIA can also inform derivative assessments of climate change impacts at, for 
example, regional, watershed, sectoral scales. The PCCIA and its related products can be 
considered one of many sources of information to inform adaptation decisions and priorities 
across Ontario sectors and sub-regions. 
The assessment was designed to utilize known best current practice for climate change risk 
assessment with methods grounded in International Standards (ISO 31000 and 14090). The 
assessment employed a diversity of knowledge, research and skills in areas that include 
climatology, thematic subject-matter, risk assessment, engagement and communications, 
socio-economics and geospatial expertise. The process included targeted and broad 
engagement and sought validation from an Impact Assessment Inter-Ministerial Advisory 
Committee (IAIC) and external stakeholders. There was also a dedicated initiative to engage 
with Indigenous organizations across Ontario. In total, more than 250 partners and subject-
matter experts were actively engaged over the course of the PCCIA. 
 
 
Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       xiv  
The impact assessment was conducted across five Areas of Focus and in six regions that cover 
the entire province (Far North, Northeast, Northwest, Eastern, Central and Southwest). The five 
Areas of Focus for the PCCIA include:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sub-themes for each Area of Focus were developed to enable assessment at finer levels of 
granularity as noted by Level 1 and 2 categories. Direct impacts were assessed for frequency, 
consequence and likelihood, and indirect impacts were qualitatively identified and 
characterized, within Level 1 and 2 categories.  
The PCCIA process and results are reported as main sections of this report. Section 1.0 provides 
a summary of the project context and goals of the impact assessment. An overview of the 
approaches used to assess climate change impacts and capacity, as well as limitations 
associated with the PCCIA is included in Section 2.0. A characterization of Ontario’s historical 
and future climate conditions, including the climate information used to inform the assessment 
of impacts is summarized in Section 3.0. Socio-economic modeling and projections used to 
support the impact assessment can be found in Section 4.0.  
The findings for each Area of Focus are included under the following sections: 
- 
Section 5.0 – Food and Agriculture  
- 
Section 6.0 – Infrastructure 
- 
Section 7.0 – Natural Environment 
- 
Section 8.0 – People and Communities  
- 
Section 9.0 – Business and Economy  
The characterization of current and future climate change impacts that stretch across and 
between Areas of Focus are labeled as ‘cross-sectoral’ and is provided in Section 10.0. Finally, 
Section 11.0 summarizes recommended next steps for Ontario to advance adaptation and build 
capacity to respond to the identified impacts. 
 
 
 
Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       xv  
What are the key findings of the PCCIA? 
More than 3,400 risk scenarios were developed and analyzed as part of the PCCIA. Risk scores 
were calculated in levels or layers through a step-wise process, then totaled and rolled up into 
the relevant Level 1 and 2 categories. 
Risk scores were assigned for current, mid-century (2050s) and end of century (2080s) time 
periods. When evaluating the consequences of an impact, ratings of ‘very low’, ‘low’, ‘medium’, 
‘high’, and ’very high’ were used. Depending on the Area of Focus, different categories were 
used to assess consequences in relation to a single risk scenario. Consequences were assessed 
based on consideration of one or more of the following categories: 
- 
Impacts to Human Health and Safety 
- 
Environmental Damage 
- 
Disruption of Services 
- 
Financial Loss 
Based on the consequence of impact, likelihood of occurrence, and frequency of the associated 
climate variable, risk scores were determined for categories assessed for every Area of Focus 
and applicable region of Ontario. A summary of risk scores for Level 1 categories is provided 
below in Table 1.0.  
Climate conditions and events driving the highest climate risks differ depending on the 
timeframe, Area of Focus, and region of the province being assessed. Overall, extreme heat, 
extreme precipitation and seasonal temperature-related impacts are the drivers of highest risks 
across Ontario. However, wildfire, drought conditions and seasonal precipitation were also 
found to be particularly impactful for future time periods in certain regions and Areas of Focus. 
A summary of key takeaways for each Area of Focus is provided below. 
Food and Agriculture  
While changes in particular climate conditions (e.g. low temperature) may present stable or 
even declining risk scores for specific commodities and regions, any potential opportunities are 
likely to be offset by negative impacts, resulting in declining productivity, crop failure, and 
livestock fatalities. Several commodities, particularly in the southern regions of the province, 
are expected to face ‘very high’ climate risks by the end of the century. 
Infrastructure  
Existing infrastructure condition pressures combined with a changing climate will drive mid- to 
long-term challenges in managing Ontario's infrastructure. Not a single asset included in this 
assessment is considered to have a risk profile less than ‘medium’ under current climate 
conditions. Across most regions and asset types, this risk is expected to rise in the future by 
 
 
Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       xvi  
mid-century (2050s). Risks may be amplified by existing interdependencies between 
infrastructure types, triggering cascading impacts across systems.  
Natural Environment  
Climate change is already causing significant changes to Ontario’s natural environment, and 
risks to species, habitats, and ecosystems, will continue to rise into the future. The impact 
assessment finds that risk profiles across almost all natural systems and species assessed are 
rising to ‘high’ by mid-century. By the end of century, one quarter of these are expected to be 
‘very high’. Regional differences are important to recognize, with human development 
enhancing risks in regions further south, and an accelerated rate of climatic changes driving 
risks in northern regions of Ontario. 
People and Communities  
The PCCIA finds that climate risks are highest among Ontario’s most vulnerable populations and 
will continue to amplify existing disparities and inequities. Climate risks to Indigenous 
Communities and associated systems are found to be significant based on additional layers of 
sensitivity and exposure. 
Business and Economy  
Climate impacts, and the associated economic shocks will not be uniform across Ontario. The 
impact assessment finds that most Ontario businesses will face increased risks due to climate 
change, with the largest increases in risk expected for businesses dependent on natural 
resource systems and where historical infrastructure deficits exist. 
Cross-Sectoral Themes  
To represent the inherent connectedness and complex interactions between Areas of Focus, 
cross-sectoral analyses were conducted and summarized in Section 10.0. The cross-sectoral 
evaluation centered around human populations and impacts were viewed through an equity 
lens which highlighted unique factors or populations that may be disproportionately impacted. 
The cross-sectoral impacts are qualitatively characterized under five broad themes: 
- 
Food security 
- 
Water security 
- 
Energy security 
- 
Human health, safety, and well-being 
- 
Community function  
 
 
 
Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       xvii  
Identifying Adaptation Priorities  
Climate change adaptation enabling factors, noted as Adaptive Capacity, were also included in 
the PCCIA. The categories of Adaptive Capacity included technology, resource availability, 
sector complexity, equity, and governance. Based on the risk scores derived from this impact 
assessment and identified levels of capacity, adaptation priorities are identified for each Area of 
Focus (Sections 5.0 – 9.0), in regions and sectors where risks are highest, and capacity is lowest. 
Moving Forward 
The PCCIA has produced a number of products aimed at improving knowledge and capacity and 
stimulating adaptation action across Ontario. This report and each of the accompanying PCCIA 
products are complimentary to one another and are founded in the findings presented in this 
report. The external products are identified and referenced in the following section. 
The information gained from the PCCIA is not meant to be an endpoint, and it is important to 
recognize how these findings can be used to spur action to protect residents, ecosystems, 
businesses and communities across Ontario. As such, key findings should be aligned and used to 
inform policies, programs, research, and investment decisions moving forward. A next step in 
this process could be to evaluate specifically how risk results can be used to accelerate 
adaptation at various scales and in various sectors and systems across Ontario.

Key Terms and Definitions  
Adaptation: Process of adjustment to actual or expected climate events and their effects.  
Adaptive Capacity: The ability of systems, institutions, humans, and other organisms to adjust 
to potential damage, to take advantage of opportunities, or to respond to consequences. 
Area of Focus: The five Areas of Focus defined by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, 
Conservation and Parks for the PCCIA. These include: Food and Agriculture; Infrastructure; 
Natural Environment; People and Communities and Business and Economy. 
Cascading Impacts: A climate-related event or trend that triggers a chain of impacts across 
different Areas of Focus. Cascading impacts are often associated with interdependencies 
between systems where components may be intrinsically dependent, or rely upon, one another 
to provide a function. (e.g. critical infrastructure failures can cause cascading impacts across 
several different sectors). 
Climate Change: Refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g. using 
statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties, and that persists 
for an extended period, typically decades or longer. It refers to any change in climate over time, 
whether due to natural variability or as a result of human activity. 
Climate Resilience: The ability of systems and structures to absorb the shocks of climate change 
related events and impacts and return to normal functioning without major delays. 
Climate Variable: A measurable aspect of weather that contributes to the characterization of 
weather conditions in a given area.  
Climate Variable Group: Climate variable(s) grouped together based on commonalities such as 
temperature or precipitation and representing changes in climate (physical events or stressors) 
that have the potential to cause harm, damage, or losses. 
Consequence Criteria: Criteria used to assess the level of impact (or damage) to human health 
and safety, environmental damage, disruption to services, and financial loss. Consequence of 
impacts are rated from ‘very low’ to ‘very high’ based on the given criteria.  
Consequences: Negative impact that arises when a climate variable interacts with an Area of 
Focus. 
 
 
 
 
Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       xxii  
Cross-Sectoral Impacts: Climate change impacts that span multiple Areas of Focus. For the 
purposes of Ontario’s PCCIA, cross-sectoral impacts are characterized across five themes: 1) 
food security, 2) water security, 3) energy security, 4) human health, safety and well-being, and 
5) community function. More details can be found in Section 10.0.  
Direct Impact: Effects of changes in climate that in and of themselves cause an impact. Also 
referred to as primary effects of climate change. In the context of Ontario’s PCCIA, direct 
impacts are those resulting from climate interactions within each Area of Focus and have been 
quantitatively assessed following the PCCIA methodology and given risk scores.  
Equity Lens: Within the context of the PCCIA, this is a term specifically used within the cross-
sectoral analysis (Section 10.0). An equity lens has been applied to every cross-sectoral theme, 
which identifies unique factors or populations that may be disproportionately impacted 
associated with the cross-sectoral theme. 
Event: Occurrence or change of a particular set of circumstances. 
Expert [evidence, experience]: Refers to assessment-related subject matter knowledge, 
expertise and experience that was represented by the assessment consulting team. This also 
refers to external expertise derived from those who participated in the engagement process, 
providing input to risk characterization and assessment. 
Exposure: An interaction, either actual or expected, between the climate variable and the 
presence of people, livelihoods, species or ecosystems, environmental functions, services, 
resources, infrastructure, or economy. Exposure was not explicitly assessed as a discrete 
element of vulnerability under the PCCIA methodology. 
Frequency: The number of occurrences of a repeating climate variable per unit of time (e.g. a 
flood event that is reasonably expected to occur 1 time in a 100-year time span has a frequency 
= 1/100 years or is sometimes called “Annual Frequency”). Using this example, “1 time in a 100-
year time span” is expressed as 1:100 year, which is called a “Return Period”. Frequency is also 
referred to as ‘likelihood’ within the report. 
Impact: The effect of climate change variables on natural, built and human systems. 
Impact Assessment: Process used to identify, analyze, and evaluate impacts, inclusive of risks 
and opportunities. 
Indirect impacts: For the PCCIA, indirect impacts are secondary effects of changes in climate 
and are directly tied to (stem from) a primary impact within an Area of Focus. Indirect impacts 
were excluded from the quantitative assessment but are characterized qualitatively.  
 
 
Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       xxiii  
Individual Risk Score: The quantification of each interaction between a climate variable and 
area of impact as noted by a Level 1 or 2 category within each Area of Focus and region (e.g. 
interaction between extreme precipitation event (short-term) and rail infrastructure in Central 
Ontario). 
Interaction: The combination of a region and asset/service/operation with a climate variable 
that has the potential to impact the asset/service/operation in the given region. 
Interconnected linkages: A term used to represent the inherent connectedness between Areas 
of Focus as part of cross-sectoral analyses in Section 10.0. Interconnected linkages are defined 
as complex interactions among system components that are dependent, or rely upon, one 
another to provide a function.  
Likelihood: In the context of the PCCIA, likelihood is a measurement of the probability of 
consequence associated with an impact occurrence. Likelihood scales are characterized by the 
percent chance of an impact occurring, categorized as ‘improbable’, ‘remote’, ‘occasional’, 
‘probable’, and ‘frequent’ levels of occurrence. 
Most Probable Worst-Case Event: The Most Probable Worst-Case Event (MPWCE), otherwise 
referenced as a ‘risk scenario’ and represents the most severe possible outcome that can 
reasonably be expected to occur based on a specific interaction between the climate variable, 
Level 1 or 2 category and region. The MPWCE is a conservative risk estimate in order to provide 
latitude for adaptation planning purposes to reduce risk. 
Normals: In reference to the climate, Normals are averages over a period of time (usually 30 
years) that are used to summarize or describe the average climatic conditions of a particular 
location. 
Opportunities: Opportunities are cases where risk scores decrease over time or are described 
qualitatively where evidence suggests that a changing climate may lead to favourable effects 
under each Area of Focus. 
Probability: Percentage chance of the occurrence of an event. 
Risk: Risk is measured as the combination of the probability of an event, with its likelihood of 
impact and severity of consequences. 
Risk Analysis: Process of understanding the nature of risk and its characteristics including 
likelihood and consequence. 
Risk Evaluation: Process of comparing the risk results with the risk tolerance criteria to 
determine the degree to which action is required. 
 
 
Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       xxiv  
Risk Identification: Process of finding, recognizing, and describing risks. 
Risk Scenario: Derived from the Most Probable Worst-Case Event (MPWCE), a PCCIA risk 
scenario describes the interaction between a select climate variable, a Level 1 or 2 category and 
within an applicable region. For example, the risk scenario developed for extreme heat days 
(climate variable) and corn crops (Level 2 category) in Southwest Ontario (region) reads as: ‘An 
extreme heat event (+32° C during day/+20°C at night) occurs during later reproductive phases 
(blister and maturity) of corn development, reduces crop productivity by impacting the grain fill 
period, lowering kernel weight, and resulting in yield losses of between 20 to 40%’. 
Sensitivity: The degree to which a system is adversely or beneficially affected by the climate 
variable to which it is exposed. Sensitivity was not explicitly assessed as a discrete element of 
vulnerability under the PCCIA methodology. 
Severity: The degree of impact of an event and related to consequence. 
Threshold: Context-specific, a point beyond which a system is deemed to be no longer effective 
or efficiently functioning (economically, technologically, or environmentally). Thresholds define 
inflection points at which time declines in function occur. Threshold is also “The level of risk 
exposure above which risks are addressed and below which risks may be accepted.” A 
threshold level is a level beyond which an organization does not want to tolerate the risk. 
Vector-borne Diseases: Human illnesses caused by parasites, viruses, and bacteria that are 
transmitted by mosquitoes, sandflies, triatomine bugs, blackflies, ticks, tsetse flies, mites, snails, 
and lice.  
Vulnerability: The extent to which a system or component is susceptible to damage from 
climate change. This is calculated based on the potential impact (exposure and sensitivity) and 
the Adaptive Capacity of the system or component. It is important to note that Ontario’s PCCIA 
is an assessment of climate impacts, including risks and opportunities as a function of likelihood 
and consequence, and does not explicitly assess vulnerability.

1.0 Introduction  
The Sixth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (AR6) 
concluded with certainty that human influence has been the main cause of recently observed 
global temperature increases and that if greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are not significantly 
reduced, warming trends will continue into the latter half of this century, leading to an increase 
in more devastating and frequent extreme weather. Binding agreements forged at the 
international Conference of the Parties meeting in 2015 (COP21) - the Paris Agreement – 
established a goal to limit global warming to well below 2˚C above pre-industrial levels by 2050, 
and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5˚C. The IPCC has emphasized that 
in addition to the need for deep reductions in GHG emissions, adaptation is critical as continued 
warming over the coming decades is no longer reversible even with mitigation efforts.  
Domestically, the Council of Canadian Academies established the Expert Panel on Climate 
Change Risks and Adaptation Potential who published Canada’s Top Climate Change Risks 
which outlines 12 major areas of climate change risk for Canada which have the potential to 
impose significant loses, damages or disruptions over the next 20 years. The Panel noted that 
the top six areas of concern are physical infrastructure, coastal communities, northern 
communities, human health and wellness and ecosystems and fisheries. In addition to the risk 
findings, the report notes the importance of more detailed assessments for, and with, 
Indigenous Communities, as well as better coordination of adaptation between levels of 
government (Council of Canadian Academies, 2019). Jurisdictions within Canada including 
British Columbia, Nova Scotia, and Yukon, have conducted assessments of climate change risks 
looking both at the impacts to the function of government and business and services, as well as 
whole-of-region risk assessments. In both cases, results improve knowledge of the priority 
climate risks and provide the impetus for adaptation action along with supportive policies and 
programs.  
Ontario’s mean annual temperature has increased by 1.3°C between 1948 and 2016, with mean 
annual precipitation increasing by 9.7% over the same period (Bush and Lemmen, 2019). 
Climate model projections indicate that these changes will continue, highlighting that the risks 
currently presented by climate change will become even greater in the future. Gradual changes 
in average climate conditions combined with increased variability and changes in the frequency, 
intensity and duration of extreme weather events, drive impacts that are having, and will 
continue to have, predominantly negative effects across the province (Cohen et al., 2020; Zhang 
et al., 2019). Ontario has already been affected by climate change as evidenced by recent 
events such as flooding, heat waves, and unusually high climate variability or extremes. The 
impacts of climate change have the potential to affect built and natural systems through water 
shortages, forest fires, power outages, outbreaks of diseases, and more. These changes in 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       2  
climate translate into risks to economic sectors, ecosystems, communities, and people. Ontario, 
in general, has high institutional, technical, human and financial levels of capacity to support 
adaptation actions, however, this capacity has not yet been mobilized widely despite the 
imperative (Environmental Commissioner of Ontario, 2018).  
Incorporating climate change resilience into decision-making requires the right information, 
tools, resources and most importantly, willingness. Mainstreaming climate change adaptation 
into existing frameworks and processes will ease the seeming burden and more fully engrain 
climate considerations which serve to protect the environment, public health and safety, 
infrastructure, economies and communities. While it is responsible and cost-effective to 
integrate considerations of future climate change into decision-making processes, current 
infrastructure investment, community planning and business operations often don’t, and 
subscribe to the assumptions of predictable climatic conditions (Boyd and Markandya, 2021). 
Climate change has created the need for data and information that includes projections at its 
core to provide decision-makers with the information in support of more resilient outcomes.  
While some local-scale climate change risk assessment and adaptation planning has occurred in 
Ontario, notably by provincial ministries, municipalities, Indigenous Communities, and non-
governmental organizations, the PCCIA is the first province-wide assessment. An identification 
and assessment of climate change impacts and key climate change risks and opportunities at 
this scope and scale is unique amongst Canadian jurisdictions and will help set the context for 
broader Ontario-wide climate change adaptation and resilience policy development, as well as 
advance the capacity of jurisdictions to respond to climate change events as they occur. 
Regional and municipal climate change risk assessments such as those for Barrie, Thunder Bay, 
Windsor, Oakville, Sudbury, Durham, Peel, York and Waterloo have led to plans and action to 
build climate resilience. Conservation Authorities in Ontario have been leaders in incorporating 
climate change into their stewardship and other activities. Ontario has also conducted climate 
change assessments at various scales such as by Eco-region (e.g. 3E-1), watershed (Lake 
Simcoe) and sector- or theme-based (e.g. Public Health Units).  
As changes in Ontario’s climate are expected to continue at unprecedented rates, it is critical 
for governments and regulatory agencies to support and enhance adaptation by developing 
enabling policies and programs. Climate resilience is strengthening the ability of social, 
economic and natural systems to withstand climate change including hazardous and 
catastrophic events or shifting trends in ways that these systems can maintain their essential 
functions or structures, as well as the capacity to respond to future changes. The PCCIA outputs 
promote improved general preparedness for governments whose role is to serve civil society 
with adequate structure and function. Emergency preparedness in times of extreme weather is 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       3  
crucial for society to respond to, and recover from, the impacts of extreme weather. The 
findings of the assessment can also support policy development at provincial and other scales.  
Inherent momentum in the climate system will continue to drive hazards and impacts for many 
years and thus advancements in the regulatory environment will ensure that impacts are being 
adequately managed to limit damage and liability. The PCCIA results also highlight the need for 
policy consistency and alignment between levels of government, not only to improve climate 
resiliency, but also to avoid maladaptation.  
By assessing climate change impacts and the associated risks and opportunities across Ontario, 
this assessment provides important information on the urgency required for action and priority 
areas for adaptation planning and decision-making. The findings from this assessment can 
inform a strategic approach to adaptation prioritization and serve as a foundation for 
developing or updating appropriate climate change risk management processes by a wide range 
of decision-makers. By identifying, understanding and communicating the existing and potential 
future climate impacts across Ontario, the provincial government, municipalities, Indigenous 
Communities and other local decision-makers will be further supported in making informed and 
timely choices that can help keep communities and people healthy and safe, protect the natural 
environment and infrastructure, support a strong economy. 
Information from the PCCIA can inform climate-smart investment in capital and other areas of 
business development. Awareness of the physical impacts of climate change can empower 
businesses and the public sector to manage the transition to more climate-sensitive business 
operations and perform climate risk due diligence through various regulatory reporting 
processes. The pervasive nature of climate change also invokes interacting and compounding 
effects on other important societal issues such as biodiversity loss, food and water insecurity, 
inequity and conflict. Ontario’s actions to manage risks in these areas should recognize climate 
change impacts identified throughout the PCCIA.  
Perhaps most importantly, outputs from the PCCIA help to establish a baseline level of climate 
risk against which continued and new risks can be evaluated. Knowledge of the baseline for 
climate risk helps determine the degree to which adaptation measures have been implemented 
and their effectiveness. The PCCIA also forms a mechanism for future assessment where new 
science and new or unique methods can be applied to re-evaluate based on continued climate 
change. A climate risk baseline can also be used to establish targets for climate risk reduction in 
the context of an adequate monitoring and measurement system.

1.1 PCCIA Objectives and Outputs 
The objectives of the Ontario PCCIA include the following: 
- 
To allow for future decisions to be more resilient to climate impacts 
- 
To inform a more strategic approach to adaptation by governments, businesses, and 
communities 
- 
To help protect livelihoods, public health, and investments  
- 
To provide a methodology that can be scaled for smaller scale application 
- 
To provide a foundation from which future assessments can be measured

Adapting to climate change is a shared responsibility. Awareness of impacts and priority risks 
and implementation of spatially appropriate adaptation measures is a shared responsibility 
across levels of government, institutions, and individuals. As such, the PCCIA has produced a 
series of information products that will support a wide range of decisions and be helpful to a 
similarly wide range of audiences and decision-makers (see Table 1.1).

2.0 The PCCIA Approach  
The province-wide climate change impact assessment was enabled by a detailed method that 
supported an accounting of the scale and breadth. The PCCIA methodology was designed to be 
systematic, structured, transparent, and to align outputs with adaptation planning and decision 
making. Applying the methodology across the chosen sectors and systems (Areas of Focus), 
enabled consistency where possible and provided a scalable approach for future province-wide 
assessments as well as those of smaller scale in regions and sectors. In the following section, a 
summary of the methods used to characterize impacts is provided and includes the high-level 
assessment of Adaptive Capacity. A more fulsome description of the methods is provided in the 
PCCIA Methodology Framework (External Resource – 1). 
2.1 Overview of Methodology  
Climate change impact assessment requires a scientifically robust approach that enables 
systematic characterization of climatological, biophysical, and human factors that create 
impacts and drive risks. An international review of approaches and frameworks used to assess 
impacts informed the PCCIA approach, including guidance from the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). A standard 
published in 2019: ISO 14090, provides two options 
in undertaking climate change impact assessment: 
1. Option One: The consideration of 
vulnerabilities, exposure, and climate change 
hazards. 
2. Option Two: The consideration of likelihood 
and consequences. 
 
Other standardized approaches to risk assessment, such as in ISO 31000, were consulted. The 
scale of the PCCIA and accompanying top-down nature of the design led to the selection of 
Option Two. Thus, climate risk reported through the PCCIA can be interpreted as a “function of 
the frequency of a climate variable occurring now and/or in the future, the consequence(s) of 
its impact on the Area of Focus component, and the likelihood of it leading to the identified 
impact” (see Figure 2.1). These three building blocks of risk (frequency, consequence, and 
likelihood) are referenced throughout this report. 
 
For the purposes of the PCCIA, 
risk is measured as the 
combination of the frequency of a 
climate event, the severity of 
consequences and its likelihood 
of impact. 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       8  
Figure 2.1: PCCIA Climate Risk Formula 
 
 
The Methodology Framework was applied across the entire province using the sub-division 
based on 1) Geographic Regions and 2) Areas of Focus. Further details on the structure of the 
Methodology Framework by geographic region and Areas of Focus are provided in the 
respective subsections below. 
2.2 Geographic Regions  
For the purposes of the PCCIA, the Province was divided into six Geographic Regions (see Figure 
2.2): 
- 
Southwest  
- 
Central  
- 
Eastern  
- 
Northeast  
- 
Northwest  
- 
Far North 
The boundaries are derived from Census Canada Divisions with the exception of the Far North 
region which used the Far North boundary line. As a result, certain areas of Kenora, Cochrane 
and Thunder Bay appear in two distinct geographic regions.  
Each of these regions were explicitly considered and characterized within the PCCIA, with 
regional differences, gaps in data available and/or variations being documented. This regional 
approach was used in literature review search terms, for the development of risk scenarios, and 
to identify relevant data sets that informed mapping and qualitative characterization of risk. 
 
 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       9  
Figure 2.2: Geographic Regions Defined in Ontario’s PCCIA 
 
 
Southwest Region  
Southwest Ontario is defined as all areas between Essex County in the west to Grey and Bruce 
Counties in the north to Niagara in the south. Southwest Ontario excludes Hamilton, Halton and 
Peel Region, but does include Haldimand-Norfolk, Brant and Wellington Counties. 
Central Region  
Central Ontario is defined as the areas that lie between Georgian Bay and the eastern end of 
Lake Ontario. The region includes the Greater Toronto Area, including Hamilton, Halton, Peel, 
York, Simcoe, Durham, Kitchener-Waterloo, and Toronto. Notably, Central Ontario excludes 
Niagara Region, which is included in Southwest Ontario. 
Eastern Region  
The Eastern Ontario is defined as all areas east of Central Ontario, from Kawartha Lakes to 
Prescott and Russel. Renfrew and Haliburton are the two counties further north included in this 
region of the province. 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       10  
Northeast Region  
The Northeast Ontario includes all areas north of Central and Eastern Ontario between 
Muskoka and Nipissing in the south, up to Algoma and parts of Cochrane in the north. 
Northwest Region  
For the purposes of the PCCIA, Northwest Ontario is comprised of almost all of Thunder Bay, all 
of Rainy River, and portions of Kenora. Small areas in the far north of Thunder Bay are included 
in the Far North region of Ontario, along with vast areas of Kenora. 
The Far North Region  
Far North Ontario was defined for the PCCIA based on the Ontario Ministry of Natural 
Resources and Forestry Far North Boundary Line. This region includes significant areas of 
Kenora, northern areas of Cochrane and the farthest north areas of Thunder Bay.  
2.3 Areas of Focus 
Climate change impacts were assessed within five broad thematic areas. These areas, defined 
as Areas of Focus, constitute the broad diversity of ecological, social, and economic systems in 
Ontario. The Areas of Focus include: 
- 
Food and Agriculture 
- 
Infrastructure 
- 
Natural Environment 
- 
People and Communities 
- 
Business and Economy  
Each Area of Focus was sub-divided to inform impact assessment in greater detail. A simple 
hierarchical classification system, ‘Level 1 and Level 2’ categories, was developed to label 
further thematic detail. Level 1 categories refer to a primary branch of an Area of Focus, similar 
to how a “sector” is defined under the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS). 
Level 2 categories provide additional speciation based on each Area of Focus component or 
criteria, similar to how subsectors and/or industry groups are identified in NAICS. Figure 2.3 
identifies the conceptual speciation of an Area of Focus, illustrating how some of these 
categories are further delineated to include sub-categories, labeled as Level 1 and 2 categories. 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       11  
Figure 2.3: Structural Breakdown for Each Area of Focus 
  
Areas of Focus were divided and categorized differently where NAICS classifications were not as 
applicable or appropriate. For example, the Natural Environment Area of Focus employed 
criteria informed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) principles for 
species conservation alongside additional international classification of ecosystem services. As a 
result, Natural Environment Level 1 categories include themes such as species, regulating 
services, among others. Focal, or representative species, were then defined via literature and in 
consultation with the Government of Ontario to inform Level 2 categories.  
A summary of the Level 1 categories for each Area of Focus is provided in Table 2.1. Defining 
the Level 1 and Level 2 categories was an iterative process, based on a suite of criteria for each 
Area of Focus as well as discussions with government staff (IAIC members) to ensure relevance. 
General criteria used to identify categories for Areas of Focus included considerations of:  
- 
Alignment with relevant North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes 
- 
Data availability for each Level 1 and 2 category  
- 
Regional differences and commonalities across Ontario 
- 
Societal and economic importance and contribution 
- 
Sensitivity and exposure to climate-related impacts

2.4 Approach to Characterizing Impacts and Adaptive Capacity 
Following the identification of Level 1 and 2 categories for each Area of Focus, extensive 
literature review was undertaken to a) identify possible impacts to each Level 1 and 2 category, 
now and in the future, b) identify risk scenario (using the ‘Most Probable Worst-Case Event’) 
and the consequences associated with that scenario, c) determine any assumptions or 
uncertainties in information based on 
literature, and d) document indirect and 
cross-sectoral considerations for qualitative 
characterization. 
Information sources used for the PCCIA 
included qualitative and quantitative 
sources. Figure 2.4 shows the types of input 
which were sought and applied at different 
stages of the assessment. The illustration is 
not representative of the balance of 
qualitative and quantitative inputs.  
 
Figure 2.4: Types of Information Used in the PCCIA 
 
A systematic search and input process was developed for the literature review to ensure 
standardization and replicability, and to produce a transparent and defensible process. 
Literature focusing on both current and future climate conditions and impacts was collected 
simultaneously as some reports included information under current, 2050s and the 2080s time 
periods. Similarly, region-specific literature was also collected concurrently, as many study 
areas cover more than one PCCIA sub-region. The strength of evidence was evaluated to 
indicate the availability of sources of information and the extent to which information has high 
quality data to inform risk scoring. Table 2.2 summarizes the criteria used in this evaluation. 
The Most Probable Worst-Case Event, 
otherwise referenced as a ‘risk scenario’, 
considers the most severe possible 
outcome that can reasonably be expected 
to occur based on a specific interaction 
between the climate variable and Level 1 or 
2 category. This process provides a 
precautionary approach for assessing 
climate change impacts on different Areas 
of Focus and Geographic Regions.

2.4.1 Climate Variables and Frequency  
Climate variables used in the PCCIA refer to individual and distinctly separate aspects of 
weather and climate that are a) going to change from current to future (2050s or 2080s), and b) 
going to have the most impact on an Area of Focus. Consideration and selection of individual 
climate variables was iterative with consideration given to scale and scope of the PCCIA. Input 
was received from the Impact Assessment Inter-Ministerial Committee (IAIC) on variables most 
relevant to the specified thematic area and led to a list of 15 climate variables. Climate 
variables were ultimately selected based on data availability and the extent to which they 
represent the greatest number of impacts across the different Areas of Focus and regions of the 
province.  
In some cases, climate variables can interact with each other in the form of combined or 
cumulative events. The complexity is further compounded when indirect impacts are 
considered. As a result, only single and discrete, slow-onset or extreme climate variables were 
used in the PCCIA. Table 2.3 provides a high-level summary of the 15 climate variables, 
organized into eight groups which were used to inform the frequency analyses. The rationale 
and additional details associated with these variables are provided in Section 3.0 of this report.

2.4.2 Current and Future Risks  
Climate risks were evaluated as a function of the frequency of the climate variable (within a 
grouping), the consequences of an impact, and the likelihood of that impact occurring. The 
frequency scales were characterized by the amount of change from baseline conditions, with 
the direction of change indicating potential for increased risk or opportunity.  
Consequences, that form part of the risk equation, were classed in the following themes: 
- 
Impacts on Human Health and Safety 
- 
Environmental Damage 
- 
Disruption of Services 
- 
Financial Loss 
Consequence rating or ranking were done using a five-point scale and were qualitatively 
defined as ‘very low’, ‘low’, ‘medium’, ‘high’, and ‘very high’. The likelihood of an impact was 
characterized as the probability or percent chance of an impact occurring, categorized as 
‘improbable’, ‘remote’, ‘occasional’, ‘probable’, and ‘frequent’ levels of occurrence. All 
consequence and likelihood criteria (scales) are included in Appendix 2. Additionally, details on 
consequence evaluation are provided for each Area of Focus in Sections 5.0 to 9.0. 
Risks were scored using a four-point scale, which is referenced throughout this report and is 
shown in Table 2.4.

Risks were evaluated in all Level 1 and 2 categories for each Area of Focus. The evaluation 
included the 15 climate variables, with consideration given to specific agricultural commodities, 
infrastructure, ecosystems, populations and services, and economic sectors, present in 
different regions, according to available data and literature. Consequences were identified and 
scored under current, mid-century (2050s) and end of century (2080s) time periods.  
As a result, risk scores were produced for each unique interaction (e.g. one climate variable and 
its associated risk scenario for a particular Level 2 category and provincial region). Every risk 
score was then compared, evaluated, normalized and added, or ‘rolled-up’, to produce a 
representative risk profile for a Level 2 category, then a Level 1 category, then an entire Area of 
Focus, and finally across an entire geographic region.  
The approach of normalization applies to all levels of roll-up, as shown in Figure 2.5 that 
illustrates the conceptual roll-up of risk scoring. It is this roll-up process that enables significant 
scalability in results for future assessments, where local decision-makers can leverage, build 
upon or dive deeper into a particular theme, sector or system that is strategically important for 
their context. Additional details on the scoring process and application of the methodology are 
available in Section 2.5. 
Figure 2.5: Visual Risk Roll-Up Approach 
 
 
 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       18  
The various levels of roll-up avoided prejudice across the Level 1 and 2 categories, since some 
of the categories may be broken down to less or more degrees of granularity (e.g. more 
branches). The process involved normalizing the specific risk scores as they are summed during 
a roll-up, so that a category with more branches does not get a higher score than categories 
with fewer branches. As an example, if there are three individual risk scores for soybeans and 
six individual risk scores for rail, simply summing the risk scores will result in rail having a higher 
total risk score than soybeans.  
Figure 2.6 and 2.7 provide an example (Natural Environment Level 2 category – Bogs) that 
demonstrates the second finest level of risk scores calculated as part of the assessment, 
corresponding to roll-up #2 as shown in Figure 2.5. The example below illustrates risk scores for 
bogs with a spatial resolution of 10 km x 10 km grid cells for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, 
respectively. The graphics reveal the level of detail available for climate variables and 
projections assessed across Ontario (see Section 3.0). The results can then be rolled up to 
different spatial (regional and provincial) and methodological (Level 1 category and Area of 
Focus) scales representing the scalability of the assessment.

2.4.3 Climate Change Opportunities  
The PCCIA defined opportunities as a decrease in risk score over time. Each Area of Focus has 
been reviewed for interactions that have reductions in risk over time, to identify potential 
opportunities. In select cases, risk scenario interactions exhibited a declining risk score (current 
to 2050s or current to 2080s), indicating a reduction in risk that may pose opportunities for the 
future. However, the assessment found that there are very few specific interactions or Level 2 
categories that meet this criterion. The interactions that did decline in risk overtime were 
mainly linked to risks driven by low temperature. For example, declining frequency of Extreme 
Cold Days resulted in reduced risk scores for select animal and plant species (e.g. certain reptile 
species) assessed under the Natural Environment Area of Focus, as opportunities may exist for 
species to shift and expand their ranges. In addition, certain field crop and fruit and vegetable 
commodity interactions assessed under the Food and Agriculture Area of Focus saw declining 
risk scores based on declining risk associated with low temperatures. It is important to note 
that while there may be some opportunities associated with specific interactions, risks to 
overall Level 1 categories were mainly found to outweigh the potential opportunities across the 
Areas of Focus. Opportunities and appropriate adaptation action to limit the identified risks and 
help materialize potential opportunities are discussed throughout Sections 5.0 to 9.0. 
2.4.4 Adaptive Capacity  
Adaptive Capacity is a measure of the facets of a system, organization, or industry that can be 
used or applied to support climate change adaptation. Adaptive Capacity was qualitatively 
characterized based on literature review, engagement and expert experience. The components 
were scored on a three-point scale from ‘low’ to ‘high’. Two Adaptive Capacity rankings were 
generated: 
- 
Level 1 Category Adaptive Capacity within each Area of Focus  
- 
Regional Adaptive Capacity for each Geographic Region  
Note that Adaptive Capacity was assessed at the Level 1 instead of Level 2, based on available 
information and evidence to support the 
rankings. Although not exhaustive, the 
PCCIA used the following categories to 
evaluate Adaptive Capacity: 
- 
Technology 
- 
Resource Availability 
- 
Equity 
- 
Governance 
- 
Sector Complexity 
For the purposes of the PCCIA, Adaptive 
Capacity is defined as “the ability of 
systems, institutions, humans, and other 
organisms to adjust to potential damage, to 
take advantage of opportunities, or to 
respond to consequences” (ISO 14090). 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       22  
Technology refers to machinery, equipment or knowledge that can support the resilience of a 
system. Technology can include both hard technologies (e.g. field irrigation systems, real-time, 
road weather monitoring systems, etc.), and practices and planning (e.g. climate change-related 
best practices) as they relate to expertise in the field, lessons learned databases, best practices 
implementation, and capacity to innovate. Technology was included in the Adaptive Capacity 
assessment for all Areas of Focus and Geographic Regions. 
Resource Availability relates to financial, human and natural resources that are available to an 
organization, industry, or system. Resources can be applied and/or redistributed to support 
resilience. This component was applied to all Areas of Focus and Geographic Regions. 
Equity refers to the presence of equally distributed opportunities such as access to healthcare, 
employment opportunities, distribution of income, and social cohesion. This component was 
applied only to the People and Communities Area of Focus. 
Governance notes the level of political or administrative presence and its organization and 
function to support resilience within an organization/industry. It addresses how an 
organization/industry is prepared to adapt for, and respond to, climate change hazards and 
shocks, including implemented policies, programs, and recognition of climate change. This 
component was applied to all Areas of Focus. 
Complexity relates to the number of stakeholders or decision-makers present in a sector or at a 
regional level. The capacity to make decisions and change course at the sector or regional level 
can be inversely correlated to the number of decision-makers/stakeholders. This component 
was applied to all Areas of Focus and Geographic Regions. 
The full characterization of Adaptive Capacity for each Area of Focus is provided in Sections 5.0 
to 9.0 of this report. Full details on Adaptive Capacity for each Area of Focus and Region are 
available in Appendices 10 and 11. The characterization involved evaluating one or more of the 
five Adaptive Capacity themes, assigning a score of Low, Medium, or High based on literature 
and expert judgment for each Level 1 categories. Adaptive Capacity ratings were derived from a 
weighted average of the components, with complexity weighted higher than technology, 
resource availability or governance (or equity, for People and Communities). Full details on 
Adaptive Capacity scoring steps, including assigning scores to each Adaptive Capacity 
component for every Level 1 category and regions a, are available in the PCCIA Methodological 
Framework document (External Resource – 1). 
 
 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       23  
2.4.5 Climate Adaptation Priorities  
Climate change adaptation priorities were also identified as part of the impact assessment. An 
adaptation priority is defined as any Level 1 or Level 2 category in a given region that has 
relatively lower Adaptive Capacity rating and a relatively higher risk score. More specifically, if a 
Level 1 or 2 category and associated region receives an Adaptive Capacity rating of ‘medium’ or 
lower and exhibits a risk score of ‘high’ or ‘very high’, it is labelled as an adaptation priority. In 
general, these represent sectors and regions of Ontario that may have lesser capacity to adapt 
and exhibit a relatively high risk to climate change impacts. Current and emerging priorities 
were identified for Level 1 and Level 2 categories and regions within each Area of Focus 
(Sections 5.0 to 9.0). General adaptation options are identified for each Area of Focus to 
address priority areas. The adaptation options are drawn from the PCCIA Adaptation Best 
Practices Report (External Resource – 2), which provides more specific adaptation options and 
supporting details for each Area of Focus and Cross-Sectoral Theme. 
2.5 Application of the PCCIA Methodology 
The PCCIA methodology has been developed in a manner that is scalable to local contexts, 
scopes, and needs. Single risk scores for the PCCIA have been rolled up for each Level 1 and 
Level 2 category across applicable regions of Ontario. Regional averages have been used in 
characterizing the climate variable frequency – based upon the scale and scope of this top-
down process across the province. The PCCIA Methodology Framework (External Resources – 1) 
establishes a top-down approach, beginning with climate modeling, tailoring those projections 
to assess impacts, evaluating risks and Adaptive Capacity, and ultimately recommending best 
practices for adaptation. A bottom-up risk assessment on the other hand, begins with 
characterizing in greater detail localized 
datasets, sensitivities, and exposures. This local 
characterization then informs thresholds and 
indicators to drive climate model projections 
and whether systems exceed those thresholds 
and are at higher risk or have lower capacity to 
respond. In the context of the PCCIA 
Methodology Framework, there may be 
instances in the future where bottom-up, 
localized impact assessments (e.g. those 
undertaken across a specific jurisdiction or 
sector) that have more detailed and local 
information to be incorporated, can bolster the granularity of results that align with 
geographic-specific policies and priorities.  
A top-down impact assessment 
approach begins with climate 
modeling, tailoring those projections 
to estimate impacts and risks.  
A bottom-up impact assessment 
begins with characterizing in greater 
detail localized datasets, 
sensitivities, and exposures. 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       24  
The PCCIA Methodology Framework (External Resource – 1) has been fully detailed and can be 
scaled or applicable in a variety of ways:  
- 
Area of Focus structures (Level 1 and 2 categories) can be adopted and built upon to be 
more locally specific and therefore increase resolution in what systems are being 
assessed across Ontario (e.g. transportation could examine freeways, regional roads, 
collector roads, local roads at a finer scale for an infrastructure climate change risk 
assessment). 
- 
The risk criteria (e.g. defining scores and consequence categories) can be adopted and 
applied to different themes of climate change impact assessment. 
- 
Risk and Adaptive Capacity scores can be assessed and employed at various scales, 
ranging from characterizing one particular climate variable for a given Level 2 category 
in one geographic region of Ontario, all the way up to examining an entire sector or 
system across Ontario as a whole. Subsequent local climate change impact assessments 
could leverage this information at the scale that aligns with their scope and scale, and 
dive into further depth and/or explore further indirect impacts or consequences that 
align with their mandate. 
- 
The resources and literature being compiled and synthesized to inform risk and 
Adaptive Capacity scoring can be a springboard for future assessments at the local level, 
particularly where sectors and systems have not yet been assessed or where resources 
are challenging to find. 
2.6 Limitations of the PCCIA 
Achieving great depth and detail in a climate change impact assessment for Ontario’s broad 
geography and complex built, social and natural systems proves challenging. Necessarily, and by 
design, the assessment is at coarse scales and is informed by representative scenarios of 
climate risk. The scale of risk reporting is at regional and Area of Focus levels and is founded on 
a variety of knowledge sources (e.g. datasets, literature, consultation, professional judgement 
etc.). Finer scales of climate change impact assessment and accompanying adaptation response 
could be conducted independently following on methods used by the PCCIA. The following 
limitations constitute general challenges that accompany broad scale climate change impact 
assessments and specifically those encountered as part of the overall PCCIA process. In 
addition, limiting factors specific to Areas of Focus are listed throughout Sections 5.0 to 9.0. 
Open Access to Relevant Data 
The PCCIA methodology was structured based on an underlying assumption of publicly available 
and accessible data sources. Data on losses, damage, declines in function and changes to 
structure help establish trends and projections of change which are fundamental to climate 
change impact assessments. Datasets sought for the PCCIA lacked comparability and 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       25  
consistency (e.g. time scales and length), and in some cases ideal data were not captured or 
freely available. In many cases, datasets were available in a subset of jurisdictions or upon 
request from specific organizations, however, data availability constrained desired assessment 
in some regions and sub-sectors. Data also play an important role in the development of 
geospatial analysis of climate impacts and risk which are powerful communication tools. Future 
assessments may have greater access to improved or longer datasets which can be 
incorporated into climate risk identification, analysis and evaluation. 
Uncertainty in Climate Change and Socio-Economic Projections  
Climate model output and projections of socio- economic change are foundational to 
characterizing potential future risks in any climate change impact assessment. These inputs 
paint a picture of the bounds of future conditions that directly or indirectly influence climate 
risk. There are various inputs to both climate change and socio-economic projections that have 
inherent uncertainties in determining future conditions. All are plausible and require clear 
communication around their boundaries and limitations. 
With relation to socio-economic data specifically, there are many possible developments that 
are not accounted for in projections. Therefore, the socio-economic scenarios should not be 
classed as ‘predictive’ but rather be used to provide a plausible and consistent reference case 
from which to assess different climate risk scenarios and consider the relative scale and 
importance of anticipated impacts. In other words, we use a single scenario to identify plausible 
changes in socio-economic factors that are related to climate change alone and not differing 
pathways of socio-economic change. In addition, population forecasts have been updated since 
this analysis was conducted in 2021, and therefore the socio-economic scenarios applied in the 
PCCIA are no longer based on the most recent projections (Ontario Ministry of Finance, 2022).  
For climate change projections, some variables or indices are difficult to model, most notably 
those associated with extreme weather (e.g. high winds or extreme sub-daily precipitation). 
Regardless of the source of these data, an explanation about degrees of confidence is 
important for the reader to appreciate the full range of plausible future states. Uncertainties 
are inherent within climate downscaling including the statistical processes associated with 
defining future climate variables (see Box 1). The top-down approach to the PCCIA means that 
climate variables were scaled to 10 km x 10 km grid cells covering the entire province and were 
then averaged or “fitted” to the regions defined by the Ontario Ministry of Environment, 
Conservation and Parks. The fitting of climate variables within geopolitical boundaries 
introduced additional uncertainty into the assessment process, as did evaluating climate risk 
across entire regions (where significant variability may exist within one region of Ontario). 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       26  
 
Selection of Climate Variables  
A suite of 15 different climate variables were selected for the PCCIA based on their prominence 
in literature, application to the Areas of Focus, and through consultation with provincial 
departments associated with the PCCIA. Some climate variables of interest were not included in 
the assessment because they could not be downscaled with acceptable accuracy. Specifically, 
freezing rain and high winds were excluded from the analysis, as these variables cannot be 
Box 1: Uncertainty Associated with Climate Models  
When using any ensemble of regional or global models, a distribution of outcomes is 
determined primarily by the individual model formulations. In most cases the models tend to 
produce a near-Gaussian distribution with a cluster of model estimates near the mean or 
median and smaller tails to the distribution. The mean of the ensemble is the implied 
convergence of estimates from the cloud of outcomes. This is not a consensus, but a ‘best 
estimate’, illustrated below, in a sample box and whisker plot of mean annual temperature 
projections. In the plot below, coloured dots represent individual model values with the 
larger blue circle representing the model ensemble average. The top of each box represents 
the 75th percentile value and the bottom of each box the 25th percentile value of all the 
models. The top and bottom horizontal lines represent the highest and lowest model values, 
respectively.  
 
From the boxplot it is evident there is uncertainty in projections from the range of possible 
model outcomes. This is accepted in any climate change impact assessment and explains 
why the PCCIA applies the model ensemble average (the value of the blue circles) as the 
projected value.  
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       27  
readily projected due to data gaps, poor data quality or data insufficiency. The climate variables 
that were used, expressed as indices, have been designed to be multi-purpose and to meet the 
needs of each Area of Focus, but as technology and data processing improves, additional or 
expanded climate variables could be used in subsequent impact assessments. 
Scale of Risk Assessment 
As noted above, the assessment of climate change impacts occurred across six Geographic 
Regions of Ontario and assumed average conditions across each region. Finer scale assessments 
would help to develop information at more granular and localized scales to better inform 
decision-makers in communities and organizations, and ensure information is usable and 
pertinent to their jurisdictions, members and networks. The PCCIA includes a suite tailored and 
targeted Decision-Making Supports (DMS) (External Resources – 3) to provide different 
audiences with understanding of the scalability of the PCCIA process and assistance with 
interpreting how they could use PCCIA information in their respective roles.  
Additionally, the PCCIA was constrained to impacts inside of provincial boundaries. Numerous 
participants throughout engagement noted strong external influence on systems, processes 
and communities within Ontario. Climate impacts occurring outside of Ontario that could 
cascade through to, or impact Ontario (e.g. widespread brownouts) were not assessed under 
the PCCIA and could be considered in future assessments.  
Due to the scale and scope of the PCCIA and the complexity that can appear, indirect and 
cascading impacts were not quantitatively scored. The scope of the assessment would 
exponentially increase if those interactions were to have been accounted for through risk 
scoring. In many cases, the indirect and cascading impacts are jurisdictional or context-
dependent and would not scale well within a province-wide assessment. Such impacts have in 
most cases been qualitatively characterized within each Area of Focus (Sections 5.0 to 9.0).  
Evaluating the Consequence of Climate Change Impacts 
Commensurate with the scale of the impact assessment and the breadth of data and 
information applied, a single consequence criterion was typically used to quantify each risk 
scenario, dependent on relevance to each Area of Focus. Using a single category to assess 
consequence has limitations, as it not only reduces the inputs into the impact assessment, but 
also does not allow for inclusion of a more holistic picture of consequence. If the PCCIA 
Methodology Framework were to be reproduced or replicated at finer spatial scales, multiple or 
additional criteria (such as legal/regulatory risk and reputational risk) could be used to 
represent a variety of consequence types across each Area of Focus.  
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       28  
Cost of Impacts and Inaction 
While it is well-documented that climate change impacts have and will continue to have 
economic consequences for public and private sectors, a cost analysis of impacts or inaction 
(absence of adaptation) was not included within the PCCIA. The costs associated with climate 
change related risks and adaptation could be an area of future study. 
Engagement Constraints 
Original plans for PCCIA engagement included in-person workshops in the regions of the 
province. The COVID-19 pandemic altered the engagement approach to full-virtual. While 
technology enabled comprehensive input from groups across the province, the virtual delivery 
constrained discussion depth and the natural ‘building’ or ‘playing off’ that occurs when 
discussions are in-person. By the time virtual engagement sessions were underway, there had 
been a (perceived) degree of virtual fatigue and resulted in lower-than-expected participation.  
Indigenous Engagement Limitations  
Indigenous culture and traditional ways of life in Ontario are a key area of risk under a changing 
climate, particularly in northern and remote regions of the province. While a unique 
engagement process took place for Indigenous engagement, the nature of the Area of Focus 
categories along with time and budget availability were such that the required, more fulsome 
engagement of Indigenous Peoples and Communities was not possible. Through engagement 
activities and interviews with Indigenous organizations, it was emphasized that inclusion of 
Indigenous Peoples and respectful use of Indigenous Knowledge is fundamental to an Ontario-
wide climate change impact assessment and must been recognized a fundamental limitation of 
this assessment.

3.0 Ontario’s Changing Climate 
3.1 Approach to Characterizing Climate Change 
3.1.1 Defining Climate Variables used in the PCCIA 
Historical and projected climate data were a fundamental component of the PCCIA. In 
consultation among all Area of Focus leads and with select provincial departments (Ministry of 
Environment, Conservation and Parks and other IAIC members), climate variables were selected 
and vetted for their utility in the assessment. Each variable was rationalized based upon a) the 
degree to which the variable led to impacts within an Areas of Focus, b) the level of uncertainty 
associated with future projections, and c) the scope of the PCCIA. Ultimately, 15 climate 
variables were selected for the PCCIA. The selected variables are defined in Table 2.3, with a 
brief rationale for their inclusion outlined in Table 3.1. Climate variables that were excluded 
from the PCCIA are listed in Table 3.2, with supporting rationale for their exclusion. 
 
Table 3.1: A Summary of the PCCIA Climate Variables and Rationales for Inclusion 
Climate Variable 
Rationale for Inclusion 
Extreme Hot 
Days (> 30°C) 
Extreme Hot Days were selected as they impact all Areas of Focus. This 
variable has a variety of applications, including human health impacts on 
vulnerable populations, livestock stress, limits to outdoor recreational 
activities, algae or water quality impairments on water bodies, electricity 
infrastructure impacts, and road pavement deterioration, among others. 
Degree Days  
< 0°C 
Degree Days < 0°C represent the accumulated cold days below zero 
throughout the year and can act as a proxy for a warming climate/region, 
which may be especially important in the North. Applications can include 
seasonal lake, ice formation, winter roads capacity or maintenance 
impacts, impacts to roadbeds and pavement, deterioration of assets or 
foundations, construction practice restrictions or costs, snow and ice 
accumulation, among others.  
Cold Days  
< -25°C 
Cold Days represent winter extremes and can vary between regions (e.g. 
Far North thresholds of cold temperatures are different from those of 
Southwest Ontario). Impacts include human health, infrastructure 
limitations, potential for discontinuous permafrost, and viability of pests 
and invasive species, among many others. 
Cooling Degree 
Days (18°C) 
This variable is used to design cooling and ventilation systems and can be 
used as a measure for summer energy use. It can also be used as a proxy 
for overall change in average annual temperature. Specific applications 
include infrastructure HVAC impacts, heat stress or human health 
consequences, and shifts in cooling needs or electricity demand in the 
summer.  
Growing Degree 
Days (5°C) 
Growing Degree Days is an important variable for Food and Agriculture 
and Natural Environment Areas of Focus, indicating potential changes in 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       31  
Climate Variable 
Rationale for Inclusion 
growth patterns over time. Applications of this variable include 
agricultural conditions for crops, new varieties, seasonality of pests, 
management, or possible impacts to forestry, and shifts in wildlife 
populations, among others. 
Growing Season 
Length 
Growing Season Length is an important variable for Areas of Focus that 
include (or rely upon) the natural environment and can help to refine the 
limitations for agricultural decisions and vegetation types. This variable 
could be applied to Food and Agriculture, Natural Environment, People 
and Communities (especially Indigenous Communities Level 1 category), 
and Business and Economy Areas of Focus.  
Spring 
Precipitation 
Spring Precipitation can be used to inform and characterize the 
frequency of spring flood potential, pre-growing season precipitation for 
crop germination and productivity, water supplies and nutrient 
disturbance regimes for ecosystems, soil erosion, pavement 
deterioration, among others. 
Summer 
Precipitation 
Summer Precipitation is relevant in characterizing tourism and 
recreational activity limitations, forest productivity and/or wildfire risks, 
water levels, water supply or sources and streamflow conditions in the 
natural environment, among other applications. 
Autumn 
Precipitation 
Autumn Precipitation variable can be useful to evaluate reservoir or 
water storage capacity and operations, some crops (e.g. forages or spring 
wheat) germination, forest health and habitats for fall-spawning fish 
species. 
Winter 
Precipitation 
Winter Precipitation variable includes snow and rainfall occurring within 
the winter months; changes in the variable can impact infrastructure and 
communities across Ontario. Applications could include flood risks and 
timing, winter sports potential and season length, impacts to soil 
moisture and lake levels, tree survival, underground infrastructure, and 
disruptions to supply chains or industry from storms, among numerous 
others. 
Winter Rain 
Percentage 
(Rain:Snow Ratio) 
The Winter Rain:Snow Ratio allows for the detection of changes in 
precipitation regimes in the wintertime, which can impact all Areas of 
Focus. This variable can be used to characterize flood impacts in winter 
and spring, impacts to spring soil moisture or water storage and 
recharge, water levels, soil erosion or runoff, perennial and forage crop 
productivity, winter road maintenance, and de-icing needs for 
transportation such as at airports, among others. 
Extreme 
Precipitation 
(Short Duration)  
Short Duration Extreme Precipitation events can impact all regions and 
all Areas of Focus. Applications include risks associated with damage to 
buried and ground level infrastructure, crop damage or timing of losses, 
flooding and health risks and supply chain or industry disruptions. 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       32  
Climate Variable 
Rationale for Inclusion 
Extreme 
Precipitation 
(Long Duration) 
Long Duration Extreme Precipitation events tend to have a longer lasting 
impact on natural systems, and possibly on the built environment as well. 
Applications for this variable include examining soil erosion, crop pests or 
diseases timing, reservoirs or streamflow levels, and flooding risks, 
among others. 
Moisture 
Deficit/Drought  
Moisture Deficit/Drought variable represents a function of precipitation 
and evaporation (based on temperature), so it does not fit in either the 
temperature or the precipitation groupings. The impacts of drought can 
be wide-ranging and affect agricultural production, water storage and 
supply, streams and lake levels, and wildfires. 
Wildfire Index  
Fire return period is estimated using multiple climate variables. It is 
identified in this study as a standalone climate grouping. The 
consequences of wildfire can be severe, and impact natural systems, the 
communities that rely on them, and the communities in the way of the 
fires. This variable can be used to characterize wildfire risks, community 
health risks from wildfires and smoke, forest management, emergency 
response, and infrastructure losses or disruptions. 
 
Table 3.2: A Summary of Climate Variables Excluded from the PCCIA and Rationales for 
Exclusion 
Excluded Climate 
Variable  
Rationale for Exclusion 
Heatwave 
The impact from a heatwave can be captured by the more multi-purpose 
variable of Extreme Hot Days (>30°C), which is applicable to all Areas of 
Focus and not just human health and/or electricity demand/stress. 
Mean Maximum 
Summer 
Temperature 
This is better captured by the Extreme Hot Days variable, which is more 
multi-purpose.  
Mean Winter 
Temperature 
There are not many applications for this variable since Low Temperature 
variables (Degree Days <0°C and Cold Days <-25°C) already capture 
winter cold or accumulated colder days.  
Mean Spring 
Temperature 
There are not many applications for this variable since spring 
temperatures are captured by Growing Degree Days and Growing Season 
Length variables. 
Mean Summer 
Temperature 
This is captured by High and Extreme Temperature and Temperature 
variables (Extreme Hot Days, Cooling Degree Days, Growing Degree 
Days, Growing Season Length); there are not as many applications for 
this variable.  
Mean Annual 
Precipitation 
The variable is redundant as it can be calculated from seasonal 
precipitation totals. 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       33  
Excluded Climate 
Variable  
Rationale for Exclusion 
Freeze-Thaw 
Cycles 
Daily freeze-thaw cycles are usually rated as low consequence in risk 
assessments, relative to other impacts. Other ground frost variables 
such as Degree Days <0°C are more important and can be used as proxy. 
Freezing Rain/Ice 
Storm 
Freezing rain and ice precipitation cannot be reliably projected and are 
difficult to estimate for current conditions due to climate data 
insufficiency. 
Cold Season 
Length 
This is captured for more applications by Cold Days <-25°C. 
Cold Snap 
This is captured for more applications by Cold Days <-25°C. 
High Winds 
This variable cannot be reliably projected and is difficult to estimate for 
current conditions due to declining quality of the climate data. High 
winds and their projections are particularly challenging since they tend 
to be very site-specific due to fetch, land surface type, and model 
formulation. 
 
3.1.2 Historical and Future Data Methods 
Current climate impacts were assessed using Environment and Climate Change Canada’s latest 
official Climate Normals released for the period of 1981 to 2010 (Environment and Climate 
Change Canada, 2022a). Then, using climate projections the same impacts were assessed in the 
future time horizons of the 2050s (representing the period from 2041 to 2070) and the 2080s 
(representing the period from 2071 to 2100). The changes from current conditions inform the 
quantified degree of expected future climate conditions. 
Historical Data 
A high resolution (10 km by 10 km) dataset of temperature and precipitation observations 
covering the entire province was used for the assessment (Environment and Climate Change 
Canada, 2016a; Natural Resources Canada, 2020a) and has been used widely within Canada for 
other climate research (e.g. for developing wildfire indices by the Canadian Forestry Service) 
(McKenney et al., 2011; Hopkinson and McKenney, 2011; Hutchinson et al., 2009). In general, 
the dataset used for this study represents climate conditions very well, but because it is based 
upon observational data there is a larger potential error in data-sparse parts of Canada’s North.  
Daily observed minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitation (including rain and 
snow) were used for the development of the gridded historical dataset (Natural Resources 
Canada, 2020a; Mckenney et al., 2011). As outlined, interpolation of station data uses a 
smoothing-spline technique to interpolate data between stations to produce a continuous 
climate surface. Stations with data records of more than five years were included. No additional 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       34  
corrections or interpolations were necessary because the dataset provides daily data at a 10 km 
by 10 km resolution and amounts to slightly over 18,000 data points across Ontario. 
Future Projections  
Projections are the possible future changes in climate conditions under different GHG emissions 
scenarios and socio-economic factors (e.g. use of technology, governance, land-use change 
etc.). Climate scientists develop projections of future climate conditions using results from 
different climate models. These projections are created through a standard set of computer-run 
experiments with mathematical models that simulate a coupled atmosphere-ice-ocean-land 
system. To calculate projected changes in climatic conditions, models compare future climate 
projections against a historical baseline period to determine expected changes. Average climate 
conditions are typically represented by 30-year time periods. For example, the 2071-2100 time 
period is typically used to represent the end of the 21st century and 1981-2010 is used to 
represent historical baseline climate. Climate models simulate the future climate using 
prescribed emissions scenarios or pathways. 
In the PCCIA, 32 Global Climate Models (GCMs) were used in the RCP4.5 ensemble, while 33 
models were used in the RCP8.5 ensemble to calculate projections of future conditions. 
Maximum, minimum, and mean temperature are standard output variables from these GCMs, 
as is precipitation. The suite of models used in AR5 is from the Fifth Coupled Model 
Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), coordinated by the World Climate Research Program (IPCC, 
2013). The newest assessment (AR6) was released after completion of the climate projections 
for PCCIA and was not considered. 
The use of multiple models to generate a best estimate of climate change is preferred over a 
single model outcome. Research has indicated that the use of multi-model ensembles is 
preferable to the selection of a single or few individual models since each model can contain 
inherent biases and weaknesses (IPCC-TGICA, 2007; Tebaldi and Knutti, 2007).  
Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) refer to a set of emission standards used 
primarily by climate modelers to explore plausible future emissions options and their 
implications for climate responses. Expressed as watts per square meter, they refer to 
consistent prescribed pathways by 2100 for GHG and aerosol concentrations, together with 
land use change. Each RCP (2.6 to 8.5) is the resulting level of “forcing” in the atmosphere that 
would result from the scenario being realized. For the PCCIA, an ensemble of GCM projections 
was utilized for future projected climate conditions based on two future GHG emission 
pathways: RCP4.5 (moderate emission pathway) and RCP8.5 (high emission pathway). 
In this assessment, the approach used to derive downscaled climate change projections is the 
Delta Approach, which is one of several methods for obtaining downscaled and bias-corrected 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       35  
projections of future climate. This approach is perhaps the simplest, the easiest to understand, 
and has been widely used for impacts and adaptation studies. It has also been shown to 
compare well with other more complicated downscaling approaches. When this method is 
coupled with the use of many models to generate projections, it generally provides more useful 
information than when a single or small set of models are used, regardless of their spatial or 
temporal resolution. 
The approach used to downscale GCM projections to develop regional scale projections is only 
reasonable for a provincial scale assessment of this nature. This approach and resulting climate 
projections would not be technically reasonable for local scale risk assessments as more 
sophisticated approaches are currently available, such as the use of Regional Climate Models 
(RCMs) that better account for Ontario’s unique geophysical features (e.g. Great Lakes, Niagara 
Escarpment, Hudson Bay) and their influence on local climate and weather, particularly 
extreme weather events. These downscaling approaches and associated climate projection data 
should be used for local scale assessments. A full description of the methods used to derive 
future projections is provided in Appendix 4. 
3.1.3 Addressing Uncertainty  
Inherent in any climate change projection are uncertainties in future conditions. The level of 
uncertainty (see Box 2) can vary by variable assessed, by future time period (longer time in the 
future is more uncertain), by region, and by the spatial scale of the assessment. Projections 
included in the PCCIA somewhat address the uncertainties associated with the last factor by 
averaging data points found within larger regions of Ontario, however they should not be used 
for specific guidance for individual locations. Local projections can be influenced by highly site-
specific conditions and processes and should be developed using more sophisticated 
downscaling methodologies.  
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       36  
 
A recent document released by Environment and Climate Change Canada (Environment and 
Climate Change Canada, 2020) summarizes the levels of certainty according to qualitative 
descriptors such as ‘very high’, ‘high’, ‘medium’, ‘low’ and ‘very low’ confidence. Overall, the 
confidence in thermal (temperature related) variables is high since the relationship between 
GHG increase in the atmosphere and its thermal effect is well captured by climate models. 
Confidence in precipitation variables is lower, followed by others such as wind and snowfall. 
Accordingly, the variables assessed in PCCIA can be classified into the qualitative categories 
outlined in Table 3.3.

Box 2: IPCC Sixth Assessment Report and Uncertainty 
Since this PCCIA was started, new climate change projections have become available with the 
IPCC Sixth Assessment report (AR6). These new projections do not negate the utility of the 
currently assessed AR5 projections. 
In the IPCC guidance documents broad uncertainty statements are made about overall 
climate variables assessed with the understanding that some can be more definitively 
projected than others. In the IPCC documents more quantitative levels of confidence are 
applied and outlined below (Mastrandrea et al., 2011).  
-
Virtually certain (99 to 100% probability) 
-
Extremely likely (95 to 100% probability) 
-
Very likely (90 to 100% probability) 
-

Model Uncertainty 
There are several sources of uncertainty involved in climate change projections. The main 
sources are the assumption of the GHG forcing pathway (e.g. RCP4.5 (lower emission pathway) 
versus RCP8.5 (high emission pathway)), and the climate models themselves. Climate models 
are mathematical representations of the physics of the atmosphere and so are approximations 
of reality, where some features are well known, and some are not and require 
‘parameterization’. Parameterization is the process whereby some processes are simplified as 
indicated empirically by experiment.  
In addition, some natural variability processes such as ‘El Nino’ are not ideally captured within 
climate models. Long period averages are, therefore, much more reliable than any estimate of a 
single year or shorter than a 30-year average value. For the PCCIA, as for IPCC assessments, an 
ensemble of many models tends to add to the strength of the projections because multiple 
estimates are combined to produce an ensemble average. This reduces the potential errors or 
limitations of any individual model in the final projection value. Additionally, the process used 
in PCCIA only considers the difference (delta) between the model average baseline historical 
condition and the future period condition – or the model climate change signal. The actual 
accuracy of the model in representing the baseline condition, which may be biased, is not 
considered. This means the model specific uncertainty is reduced by both the use of the 
ensemble and the delta process upon an identical baseline observed climate used in this PCCIA 
assessment. Nevertheless, the gridded dataset itself based upon point measures at 
Environment and Climate Change Canada observation stations, introduces some uncertainty in 
locations where few stations are situated (e.g. Ontario’s Far North). 
Methodology Uncertainty 
Uncertainty is also introduced and acknowledged with the use of the delta methodology within 
the PCCIA. Specifically, the model ensemble delta ‘signal’ from the GCMs is generated at a 250 x 
250 km resolution over Ontario which is then overlaid upon the higher resolution 10 km x 10 
km baseline period average. This mismatch in resolutions can result in some artificial 
boundaries between the larger grid resolution cells over the province. This anomaly effect is 
visible in some variables for the projected periods (as an example, the ‘Extreme Cold Days’ 
projection map near Hudson Bay and James Bay). This effect however would not influence the 
regional average climate conditions used for evaluation purposes since cells across both sides 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       38  
of the boundary would be averaged together (e.g. spatially weighted by their number falling 
within the region considered).   
Several points are to be considered regarding the use of GCMs in PCCIA versus more spatially 
discrete RCMs. Firstly, there are far more GCM estimates of climate change than that of RCMs 
for Ontario. A larger ensemble average is preferable over fewer higher resolution models for a 
provincial-scale assessment considered here. For site-specific locations going forward the use of 
an RCM may be a better option. Secondly, all RCMs require their linkage to a specific GCM 
which helps to set their ‘boundary conditions’ at the edge of the RCM area being considered. 
This GCM highly influences any outcome of the RCM, meaning if the GCM used is warmly 
biased, so too will be the RCM output.  
Looking at the benefits, such RCMs may include better parameterizations than that found 
within a GCM. This would theoretically improve the projection of higher resolution effects 
associated with variables such as extreme precipitation where convection is important since 
convection can be explicitly modeled and not parameterized. Environment and Climate Change 
Canada adds that ‘Such convection-permitting models, however, remain largely experimental 
because of their very high computational cost’ (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 
2020). Such experimental outcomes from ensembles of RCMs still find however, that there is no 
‘convergence’ of model projections with this higher resolution – models still show a spread of 
projected values. Even with a high-resolution output there is still model projection uncertainty 
– it is not eliminated or even necessarily reduced due to different model formulations of RCMs.  
Uncertainty in Climate Variables  
Short Duration Precipitation  
Additional discussion regarding uncertainty for the projection of short duration precipitation is 
also warranted. It is acknowledged that both the historical observation of extreme short 
duration precipitation events (such as thunderstorms) and projections of such events are ill-
suited to climate models. Novel attempts to improve both these estimates were utilized within 
PCCIA – firstly, to improve the baseline estimates of potential extreme event gridded values by 
the adjustment of the gridded values based upon station specific extremes and, secondly, the 
use of the Clausius-Clapeyron temperature-related effect upon extreme precipitation 
projections. Both attempts introduce potential uncertainty themselves, but it is also 
understood that these procedures improve the final outcomes by incorporating observed and 
measured daily extremes for the historical condition as well as scientifically published and 
recommended methodology for the projections. It is recognized that a gridded historical 
precipitation value even at 10 km x 10 km resolution is often beyond the spatial scale of a single 
intense thunderstorm and the gridded value average would therefore be less than an extreme 
event value which was experienced. This was the intention of the use of 70 observation station 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       39  
extremes to determine the ‘adjustment factor’ to apply to the gridded values for such an 
extreme. Across all regions an adjustment of on average 38.5% increase was found, with little 
variation among the regions assessed. This gives some confidence in the fact that the factor 
determined was related to the ‘grid scaling effect’ versus any specific regional effect which one 
might expect to be very different region to region. As such, the historical gridded one-day 
rainfall maximum was increased by 38.5% from the original value (Environment and Climate 
Change Canada, 2016a). This brought the ‘observed’ historical values closer to the actual 
station observed extreme daily totals.  
When considering future precipitation daily extremes, models produce such an output directly, 
but based upon the literature and recent recommendations of Environment and Climate 
Change Canada for the projections of extreme precipitation, the Clausius-Clapeyron 
methodology was used (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020). Changes in 
temperature are much more certain than precipitation, therefore, a thermal adjustment based 
upon the theoretical association between temperature increase and increased moisture holding 
capacity of seven percent was applied. This method should be considered the ‘default’ going 
forward for the projection of short-duration precipitation up to one day due to model 
limitations at such high spatial and temporal scales – including even RCMs. Quoting 
Environment and Climate Change Canada, ‘Given that more confidence can be placed on 
regional temperature projections, the use of temperature scaling factors – expressing the 
relative change in precipitation extremes as a function of warming – is recommended’ 
(Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020). This methodology was applied in the PCCIA. 
Wildfire Index  
The wildfire variable provided by the Canadian Forestry Service (CFS) can be used for long-term 
guidance of future fire occurrence, specifically the ‘fire return period’. It can range from several 
years where fire is most frequently expected to occur, to thousands of years where the burn 
rate is less frequent. Fire return interval (e.g. the average time between fire events, determined 
by climate and burnable material) in this case is exactly the inverse of the burn rate. The 
methodology of scoring this fire index by using the standard deviation (SD) of the historical 
range of frequencies results in a time range which is much larger than other variables since it 
can span between a few to thousands of years. For this reason, it did not properly reflect the 
potential wildland fire occurrence expected in Ontario and therefore the variable has not been 
included in this report. When all data points within a single region are statistically considered, 
standard deviations are very large. Using the same consistent standard deviation categories 
used for all other variables (+/- 1.5) and then (+/- 2.5), we find that applying the future 
projections very often generates a future value which falls within the +1.5 SD of historical 
datapoints. This would mean that a cell would retain the current period score of ‘4’ which 
incorrectly implies there is no additional fire risk. The nature of this variable (because of its very 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       40  
large ‘natural variability’) makes it difficult to capture the predicted increases in fire occurrence 
as it means a future change in return period must be quite large to move categories even 
though all points through the province show shortening return fire period, in other words, 
increased fire occurrence. 
To supplement the wildfire, return period index used for scoring within this report, two 
additional fire variables are provided here for additional information which are not scored. 
These are the ‘Annual Area Burned’ and ‘Number of Fires’, also produced by CFS for all of 
Canada using the CanESM2 and for the same baseline and future period under the RCP8.5 
scenario as provided for other variable maps (adapted from Boulanger et al., 2014). Both 
Ontario-based maps indicate in other ways the importance of wildfire in a future climate and 
indicate both an increase in the annual area burned and an increase in number of large fires 
(classified as being greater than 200 ha).  
The annual area burned is shown in northern Ontario (particularly in the Northwest Region) to 
increase by over four points of percentage (which represent more than a four-fold increase) 
from the baseline reference period by the 2070s, (Figure 3.1), while the number of fires also 
more than doubles in this area from 10 to 20 to between 40 to 80 fires of over 200 ha – a four 
times increase (Figure 3.2). Together these two additional maps imply that the scoring from 
PCCIA using ‘Fire Return Period’ scoring underestimates the increased risk from fire under 
future climate change conditions using the standard deviation categories used for all other 
variables. This additional information is intended to highlight this limitation of the PCCIA index 
and its standard deviation categorical scoring.

3.2 Historical Climate Trends and Future Projections  
While a detailed region-by-region climatological characterization of Ontario was not part of the 
assessment scope, historic (current) climate conditions and future projections are foundational 
to understanding where and how climate risks may be changing. Prior to examining changes 
from current conditions into future time periods within the context of the PCCIA, a brief 
historical characterization is provided.  
Ontario’s average annual air temperatures increased between 1 to 1.5°C between 1948 and 
2012, with northern regions experiencing slightly larger increases than areas further south 
(Vincent et al., 2015). Seasonally, the rate of increase is most accelerated in the winter season 
and associated with minimum air temperatures (Woudsma and Towns, 2017) 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       42  
Warming air temperature has already led to declining ice cover in the Great Lakes Basin, with 
maximum ice cover decreasing by five percent per decade, on average. While annual variability 
is large, long term historical trends indicate declines since the 1970s with the greatest declines 
occurring in Lakes Superior, Huron, St. Clair, and Erie (Wand et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020). 
Precipitation across Ontario increased between 1948 and 2012, with more notable changes 
occurring in the northern regions of the province. Rain, as a proportion of total precipitation, 
has been increasing in the winter season while snowfall has decreased across all regions 
(Vincent et al., 2015). In Ontario, there has been a 9.7% increase in normalized total 
precipitation between 1948 and 2012. This translates to a 5.2% observed increase in winter, a 
12.5% increase in spring, a 17.8% increase in autumn and an 8.6% increase in the summer 
season (Zhang et al., 2019). 
Water levels on the Great Lakes are continuously monitored by U.S. and Canadian federal 
agencies (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2022) using a network of water 
level monitoring stations in the region. Over the 100-year period (1918 to 2020), lake levels 
have had a two-metre range between the recorded maximum monthly average and minimum 
monthly average. In the past three decades, a greater degree of fluctuation has been observed 
relative to this two-metre range. For the period 1999 to 2014, average annual lake levels were 
at near-record low levels across all Great Lakes; however, since that period lake levels have 
been near record highs.  
Concise characterizations for each climate grouping used in the assessment are provided below. 
Sections 3.2.1 through 3.2.7 describe data associated with current (1981 to 2010), mid-century 
(2041 to 2070) and the end of century (2071 to 2100). Section 3.3 describes how all climate 
data were translated into frequency scores to inform risk evaluation. 
3.2.1 High and Extreme Temperatures 
High and extreme temperatures used in the PCCIA are represented by Extreme Hot Days and by 
Cooling Degree Days. Extreme Hot Days, or the average number of days where mean air 
temperatures exceed 30°C, are expected to rise significantly across Ontario. The extent of this 
increase is particularly pronounced in Southwest, Central and Eastern Ontario and by the end of 
the century (2080s). Regionally, Extreme Hot Days are already prevalent in Southwest, Central 
and Eastern Ontario (all averaging around 8.6 to 9.1 days per year). In Northeast Ontario, 
between 1981 and 2010, 4.1 Extreme Hot Days occurred per year, and in Northwest, that 
number is 3.8. The Far North region only had on average 2.4 Extreme Hot Days per year within 
the baseline condition. By the end of the century, Southwest, Central and Eastern Ontario are 
projected (under RCP8.5) to experience an average of over 60 Extreme Hot Days per year. 
Northeast and Northwest Ontario are both anticipated to see rises from 3.8 and 4.1 days now, 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       43  
respectively, to over 35 days per year, on average. Importantly, the impacts of rising 
temperatures may be felt stronger in the Far North, Northwest and Northeast regions of 
Ontario, despite the absolute temperature numbers being lower, compared to Southwest, 
Central and Eastern regions. There may be an increase in the number heat warnings in the 
northern regions (issued at lower thresholds compared to the southern regions) to account for 
region-specific heat-health relationships linked to acclimatization (Environment and Climate 
Change Canada, 2016b). 
Figure 3.3 visualizes Extreme Hot Days geographically, illustrating current and 2080s conditions 
(under RCP8.5) and regional averages used to inform the PCCIA. It is critical to note that Figure 
3.3 illustrates absolute conditions of this climate variable. For the purposes of the PCCIA, 
change in condition relative to the baseline was used to assess the frequency of climate 
variables (see Section 3.3).  
Cooling Degree Days indicate a very similar trend to Extreme Hot Days. In all regions, Cooling 
Degree Days are projected to increase in number and frequency scores (see Section 3.3) reflect 
this rise. This indicates an increased energy demand for cooling and ventilation in summertime, 
and amplifies the importance of a reliable energy system. Regionally, Southwest, Central and 
Eastern Ontario are shown to have the highest increases in Cooling Degree Days, followed by 
Northeast and then Northwest Ontario (see Figure 3.4).

3.2.2 Low Temperatures 
The PCCIA used two climate variables to characterize possible impacts associated with low 
temperatures: Extreme Cold Days where mean air temperature drops below -25°C and Degree 
Days Below 0°C. The latter represents accumulated cold days below zero throughout the year 
and can act as a proxy for a warming climate and region. Both climate variables show 
decreasing trends across all regions of Ontario, for all time periods analyzed (2050s and 2080s). 
These trends are decreasing regardless of how quickly greenhouse gas emissions are reduced 
(e.g. a high emissions RCP8.5 scenario or a moderate emissions RCP4.5 scenario). 
Considering Extreme Cold Days, all regions show declines, with the Far North expected to feel 
impacts the most significantly. The Far North region currently experiences on average over 55 
Extreme Cold Days per year. By the end of century, that region is expected to only experience 
around 12 Extreme Cold Days per year. Northeast and Northwest Ontario exhibit a similar 
trend, experiencing an average of 27 and 33.5 Extreme Cold Days per year now and projected 
to drop to 6 and 8 Extreme Cold Days per year by the 2050s and 2080s, respectively. In 
Southwest, Central and Eastern Ontario virtually no Extreme Cold Days are anticipated (on 
average) by the end of the century under RCP8.5.  
Figure 3.5 illustrates Extreme Cold Days across Ontario and how this condition is expected to 
change by the 2080s. Notably, Degree Days Below 0°C indicate consistent trends, with northern 
regions of the province showing more significant declines in colder conditions by both mid and 
end of century (see Figure 3.6).

3.2.3 Temperatures and Growing-Related Conditions 
Temperature-related variables considered within the PCCIA included Growing Season Length (in 
days/yr) and Growing Degree Days (GDD). The GDD indicator is a measure of the seasonal 
accumulation of heat where the mean temperature is greater than 5°C and is an important 
variable for both Natural Environment and Food and Agriculture conditions. As air 
temperatures continue to increase, both climate variables also indicate rising trends.  
Under current conditions, Growing Season Length is longest in Southwest Ontario, which 
experiences an average of just over 206 days per year. Central and Eastern Ontario also 
experience extended growing season length at 198 days per year and 181 days per year, 
respectively. Unsurprisingly, regions in northern Ontario (Northeast, Northwest, and the Far 
North) exhibit relatively shorter growing seasons, ranging from about 143 days/year to 158 
days per year. Regardless of how quickly GHG emissions are reduced or mitigated, Growing 
Season Length is expected to increase across all regions of Ontario and future time periods 
(Figure 3.7) 
Results determined for Growing Degree Days indicate a similar result as Growing Season 
Length, with significant increases anticipated in all regions. Seasonal accumulation of heat (e.g. 
measured in average degrees per year) is highest in Southwest, Central and Eastern Ontario, 
though rising heat in areas further north may lead to several impacts or changes, such as in 
species or in agricultural production (Figure 3.8). These changes are described further in Section 
5.0 (Food and Agriculture) and Section 7.0 (Natural Environment).

3.2.4 Precipitation  
Precipitation conditions are described for all seasons except winter, which is described in 
Section 3.2.5 explicitly and in greater detail associated with rain and snow. Seasonal 
precipitation conditions across Ontario are more variable than temperatures, with the Far 
North, Northwest and Northeast regions experiencing somewhat less average precipitation, 
particularly in spring. Southwest and Eastern Ontario currently experience the highest average 
Total Precipitation across non-winter seasons. Seasonally, historical precipitation tends to be 
higher in autumn compared to summer conditions. 
A summary of precipitation across spring, summer and autumn based on historical data 
indicates the direction of change associated with future projections (Figure 3.9 to Figure 3.11). 
Notably, future Spring and Autumn Precipitation are increasing across all regions, with the 
extent of these increases highest in the springtime. This can be particularly impactful due to the 
risk from flooding or rain on frozen ground. Future summertime conditions, on the other hand, 
exhibit no notable change compared to current climate conditions. This implies that while air 
temperatures rise, summer conditions may be punctuated by periods of wetter or potentially 
drier conditions which can be particularly impactful for streamflow, water levels, agricultural 
production, ecosystems, and infrastructure.

3.2.5 Winter Precipitation  
Winter precipitation poses unique impacts and risks to all Areas of Focus assessed within the 
PCCIA. This season has therefore been explicitly captured within a separate climate grouping. It 
is represented by two climate variables: Mean Winter Precipitation, and Rain:Snow Ratio. Mean 
Winter Precipitation reflects the total amount of precipitation falling between December and 
the end of February, both as rain and snow, whereas the Rain:Snow Ratio reflects the percent 
rain falling in the wintertime. It should be noted that in most regions of the province, winter-
like conditions occur during shoulder seasons, specifically the months of March and November, 
so the changes in winter precipitation may be more pronounced. Rain-on-snow events can be 
particularly problematic for infrastructure and other systems in light of frozen conditions or in 
systems that may be closer to capacity due to ice and snow melting.  
Results for Winter Precipitation indicate increases, particularly under a high emission scenario – 
RCP8.5. Regionally, there is a greater extent of change projected in Southwest and Eastern 
Ontario, followed by Central and Northeast Ontario. Northwest Ontario and the Far North still 
exhibit increases but to a less significant extent (Figure 3.12).  
Examining the Rain:Snow Ratio provides a much more consistent picture across the province. 
Historically, Southwest and Central Ontario have experienced the highest amount of rain falling 
in the winter season, with Rain:Snow Ratios measuring 39.4% and 34.3%, respectively. Eastern 
Ontario has experienced a substantial amount of rainfall during this season, with a Rain:Snow 
Ratio of around 26.3% historically. Regions further north largely experience snowfall, with 
Rain:Snow Ratios ranging from 1.3% (Far North) to 8.4% (Northeast). In the future, all regions 
are expected to experience more rain falling during the winter season, with the largest 
increases in winter rain projected for Central, Eastern and Southwest Ontario (Figure 3.13). In 
the northern regions, initial increases in snowfall (triggered by greater water holding capacity in 
the atmosphere due to warming temperatures, and longer periods of open water) are expected 
to be followed by declines and more precipitation falling as rain, thereby increasing the 
Rain:Snow Ratio.

3.2.6 Extreme Precipitation  
Within the context of the PCCIA, Extreme Precipitation was represented using two climate 
variables: 1-Day Maximum Precipitation and 3-Day Maximum Precipitation. Appendix 4 
provides a detailed discussion of the methods used to derive and project these variables. It 
should be noted that sub-daily (e.g. hourly) precipitation was not assessed as part of the scope 
due to the level of uncertainty in future projections but also the scale and scope at which 
information was required (e.g. regional averages). Future climate characterizations of Ontario 
could benefit from sub-daily future extreme precipitation analyses. 
Extreme precipitation events can lead to devastating consequences for all Areas of Focus, 
including flooding and infrastructure damage, injuries and detrimental health effects, habitat 
degradation and decreased water quality, soil erosion and crop damage, as well as disruptions 
to services and the economy. 
Under current conditions, 1-Day Maximum Precipitation varies quite significantly across 
Ontario, even considering regional averages. With Extreme Precipitation, more localized 
variability can be expected, and it is important to acknowledge regional averages do not always 
reflect specific communities or experiences within one watershed. Across Ontario, the 
Southwest region has historically experienced the largest 1-Day Maximum Precipitation 
amounts across the entire year (e.g. an average of 102 mm in one day). This can be compared 
to Eastern Ontario (91 mm in one day), Central Ontario (85 mm in one day), Northwest Ontario 
(81 mm in one day), Northeast (79 mm in one day) and the Far North (52 mm in one day). In the 
future, 1-Day Maximum Precipitation amounts are projected to increase in all regions of the 
province, and higher frequency scores reflect this increase by the end of the century (2080s) in 
all regions (Figure 3.14). 
3-Day Maximum Precipitation displays a similar trend, although somewhat muted compared to 
1-Day Maximum Projections. It is important to note that 3-Day Maximum Precipitation typically 
is more large-scale in nature (e.g. low pressure systems) and not necessarily reflective of highly 
convective extreme events that some regions in Ontario experience in the summer season. 
Additionally, the 3-Day Maximum Precipitation amounts represent the annual average over all 
seasons combined, and in some locations Summer Precipitation shows little changes which can 
offset increases in other seasons. Figure 3.15 illustrates current and future (2080s) 3-Day 
Maximum Precipitation across Ontario. Slight increases and significant variability can be 
observed in this climate variable.

3.2.7 Drought and Wildfire  
Drought and wildfire conditions were represented within the PCCIA using two climate variables: 
1) Annual Moisture Deficit and 2) Average Wildfire Return Period in years. Appendix 4 provides 
a detailed description of the methodologies used to derive these two variables and data 
interpretation.  
Dry conditions or drought indicates slight increases in Moisture Deficit across all regions of 
Ontario (Figure 3.16). However, frequency scores determined for Drought (see Section 3.3) do 
not indicate moderate or large changes from existing conditions to warrant an increase in 
scoring. Importantly, drought is particularly challenging to represent due to the need to factor 
in evapotranspiration and the numerous definitions of drought used by various communities 
(e.g. climatological, agricultural drought, etc.). 
Wildfire was characterized based upon the average Wildfire Return Period determined by 
climate and presence of burnable material. The values and methodology for deriving this 
variable were obtained directly from the Canadian Forestry Service (CFS). Historically, wildfire 
occurs most often in the Far North, Northwest, and Northeast regions. Figure 3.17 illustrates 
current Wildfire Return Periods and can be compared with those by the end of century (2080s) 
and as regional averages. As an illustrative example, the regional average wildfire return is 614 
years in the Far North, but that is projected to decrease (indicating increased frequency) to 183 
years by end of century under the high emissions scenario (RCP8.5).

3.3 Interpreting Climate Information for Use in Risk Evaluation 
The development of climate information (e.g. historical data and future projections) is a 
foundational step in evaluating risk. However, additional steps are needed to evaluate the 
frequency at which climate variables within climate groupings may occur now and in future 
time periods (e.g. 2050s and 2080s). It is important to distinguish between absolute climate 
conditions and interpreted climate variable frequency scores used in risk scoring. This 
evaluation, by climate variable, and change in frequency (either no change, positive or 
negative) is one of three major components of evaluating risk. 
To enable a multi-variable risk scoring approach in assessing climate risk, one of the 
methodologies which can be applied is the calculation of a ‘Normalized Z-Score’. The result of 
this approach (or Z-Score) is unitless and therefore has value when combining variables which 
are different (e.g. temperature, precipitation, and winds). Z-Scores are taken from statistical 
literature and represent the deviation of a population of observed climate (or other) variable 
from its historical condition. The Z-Score is useful since it can be considered a metric of the 
difference of a variable from its observed normal ‘range’. The Normalized Delta (or Normalized 
Z-score) is used in the analysis as a measure of a variable’s departure from ‘average’ conditions. 
Essentially, the larger the Z-score, the greater the change and therefore the greater the risk 
going forward. Appendix 4 describes the development of the Z-Score in additional details, and 
Appendix 2 indicates all criteria used in evaluating risks (including climate variable frequency). 
Using this approach, Z-Score results of each grid cell across Ontario resulted in the evaluation of 
climate variable frequency scores based on the criteria presented in Table 3.4.

The five-step scale (Table 3.4) was used to attribute numerical scores based on the principle of 
“equal distribution of importance” for each category, doubling the value/score between each 
integer – 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 to show that each subsequent category is weighed double, compared to 
the previous one. The current climate (1981 to 2010) frequency of all variables was set at 4 to 
represent a baseline in current conditions under which future frequency scores either increase 
or decrease, associated with the climate variable (e.g. extreme cold and extreme heat 
frequency in 2050s receive frequency scores lower and higher than 4, respectively, due to their 
differing trends). The future climate variable categorization depended upon the future 
departures of the climate variable from the historical condition according to the Z-Score. In the 
normalized Z-Score equation above, the ‘value’ was the projected value of the climate 
indicator. The mean and standard deviation remained the historical computed values for 1981 
to 2010.  
Table 3.5 provides a summary of each climate variable used in the PCCIA and the frequency 
scores determined for the 2050s and 2080s, under a moderate emissions scenario (RCP4.5) and 
a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5). Historic climate data and changes from the baseline used to 
determine frequency scores are contained in Appendix 5. Frequency scores (ranging from 1 
through 16) can be thought of as one component in scoring risk across all Areas of Focus and 
Geographic Regions of Ontario.

3 The scoring methods for the Wildfire index by using the standard deviation (SD) of the historical range of frequencies results in a time range 
which is much larger than other variables, since it can span between a few to thousands of years. For this reason, it did not properly reflect the 
potential wildland fire occurrence expected in Ontario, and therefore the variable has not been included in this table.

 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         71  
Table 3.5 can be best interpreted using a series of illustrative examples. Absolute conditions in 
Extreme Hot Days, for example, indicate that the largest increases in the variable are projected 
to occur in Southwest, Central and Eastern Ontario by the end of the century. In fact, current 
conditions indicate that these regions experience, on average up to 18 days over 30°C per year. 
By the end of century (2080s), projections indicate this number to rise significantly over 60 days 
per year across Southwest, Central and Eastern Ontario. In terms of extreme heat, climate 
variable frequency scores have been determined to be ‘16’ (large increase from baseline) 
except for the Far North region under a moderate emissions scenario RCP4.5, which is expected 
to be ‘8’ (moderate increase from baseline). This may appear to suggest that the Far North may 
not be impacted as much and as quickly – but that is not the case. Examining only one climate 
variable for a particular geographic region does not tell the entire story, and one must 
remember these are average conditions across climate normal periods (30-years). Increased 
variability and temperature swings across all regions of Ontario could be expected.  
In the Far North, the frequency of Extreme Cold Days (less than -25°C) is expected to be 
reduced the fastest in this region, with frequency scores of ‘1’ in all future time periods 
regardless of emissions scenario. A frequency score of ‘1’ denotes a large decrease from 
baseline conditions. In real world conditions, this represents a drop from a regional average of 
about 55 Extreme Cold Days per year under current conditions down to only 12 days in the Far 
North by the end of century. Across other regions of Ontario, Extreme Cold Days are also 
declining and at a faster rate of change in northern regions compared to Southwest, Central 
and Eastern Ontario. It must be acknowledged that just because climate variable scores remain 
at ‘4’ for Southwest, Central and Eastern Ontario, it does not indicate a lack of decline in 
extreme cold conditions in the future. Frequency scores are based upon standard deviations 
away from mean conditions, so in these regions the criteria were not met to lower the 
frequency from ‘4’ to ‘2’, or to ‘1’. In other words, compared with other regions, the change is 
more significant in the Far North, given that Extreme Cold Days are already fewer and become 
even less in number in Southwest, Central and Eastern Ontario. 
Other notable reflections regarding climate variable frequency scores include the following: 
- 
Cold Days (<-25°C) and Degree Days < 0°C are the only two climate variables where 
frequency is decreasing. 
- 
Mean Spring Precipitation is the most regionally uneven variable in terms of its 
increasing frequency, with scores some regions (e.g. Southwest, Central, Eastern and 
Northeast) showing increases up to a frequency score of ‘16’ by the 2080s, and others 
(e.g. Northwest) showing increasing frequency but not to the same extent. In the Far 
North region frequency scores remain unchanged for this climate variable. 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         72  
- 
Rain:Snow Ratio is particularly dynamic across Ontario, with all regions showing 
increasing frequency of more rain falling during winter. Southwest, Central and Eastern 
regions show large increases in frequency compared to baseline (scores of ‘16’), with 
the Northeast, then Northwest and the Far North also increasing but at slightly lesser 
paces. 
Several other variables (e.g. Mean Summer Precipitation, Mean Autumn Precipitation, Mean 
Winter Precipitation, Extreme Precipitation, Drought) are projected to change (described above 
with data summarized in Appendix 5) but frequency scores indicate no changes or increases by 
the 2080s (e.g. extreme short duration precipitation, wildfire). 
Climate variable frequency scores, organized by climate variable and for each region, are one of 
three major components of evaluating risk, and as a result climate variables and associated 
risks are further characterized by Area of Focus (see Sections 5.0 to 9.0).

4.0 Socio-Economic Projections  
Socio-economic development will drive Ontario’s new infrastructure, industrial development, 
and land-use, as well as influence demographics such as migration and population structure. A 
socio-economic profile was prepared for the PCCIA to help anticipate how Ontario populations 
and assets will change in the future. This profile creates the backdrop against which climate 
change unfolds and informs other considerations and pressures alongside climate change. 
These equally dynamic factors can contribute positively and negatively to climate change (more 
or less GHG mitigation and degrees of embedded adaptation), but also inform new or enhanced 
adaptation needs across regions and sectors.  
4.1 Approach to Developing Socio-Economic Projections 
Similar to climate models and projections of climate change, projections of socio-economic 
factors assume a wide range of variables and yield a wide range of plausible future scenarios. 
Consideration of several of these plausible futures in the context of the PCCIA would create a 
significantly larger analysis portfolio, thus a single “middle of the road” socio-economic 
projection that balances socio-economic challenges for adaptation and mitigation was 
developed. This relatively conservative scenario is based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 
2 (SSP2), published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This pathway is 
deemed to most closely resemble the current trajectory of development for Ontario and was 
therefore selected for this assessment. SSP2 considers an integrated global model to estimate 
population and economic growth for a climate scenario that lies between RCP4.5 and ECP8.5. 
By selecting SSP2, this enables a pathway between RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (both of which are 
applied to the PCCIA) and avoids making broad scale assumptions regarding fossil-fueled 
development (SSP5), regional rivalry (SSP3), significant inequality (SSP4) or widespread 
sustainability (SSP1). Under SSP2 social, economic, and technological trends do not shift 
significantly from historical patterns, with development and income growth continuing to 
proceed unevenly (Fricko et al., 2017). SSP2 also assumes that internationally, progress is slow 
towards achieving sustainable development goals, environment systems continue to be 
degraded, but the overall intensity of resource and energy use declines (Riahi et al., 2016).  
Socio-economic projections should not be classed as ‘predictive’ but rather be used to provide a 
plausible and consistent reference case from which to assess different climate scenarios and 
consider the relative scale and importance of anticipated impacts. In other words, this single 
scenario is used to identify plausible changes in socio-economic factors that are related to 
climate change alone and not differing pathways of socio-economic change. It should be noted 
that since this analysis for the PCCIA took place in 2021, updated demographic trends, 
reflecting increased federal immigration targets have become available (Ontario Ministry of 
Finance, 2022). In addition, as noted in the Appendix 6, the population projections used for the 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         75  
PCCIA were found to lie roughly halfway between Ontario’s Reference population projection to 
2046 and Ontario’s Low population projection to 2046. 
The projections include a set of demographic and economic indicators that are spatially 
constrained at the Ontario census division level and then applied to the six PCCIA regions in 
Ontario. The twelve socio-economic metrics and indicators available are summarized below in 
Table 4.1.

A detailed methodology to develop the projection and each of the indicators are provided in 
the socio-economic projection report in Appendix 6. Broadly, the global SSP2 scenario provides 
published country level population and economic growth projections that are downscaled to 
Ontario to provide demographic trends (population, age structure) and economic trends 
(consumption levels and patterns, size of labour force) and are consistent with global damage 
functions associated with climate change. The projection covers every annual year between 
2020 and 2100; however averaged values are also provided for three time periods of interest 
(current, 2040 to 2070 and 2070 to 2100). While the global damage functions and climate 
sensitivity of the SSP2 scenario don’t align specifically to Ontario’s circumstances, the 
projection is parameterized within a long-term globally consistent frame in which national 
policies will develop.

4.2 Summary of Results and Application to the PCCIA 
Compared to today, the socio-economic projection anticipates slowing population growth and 
an aging population distribution such that by 2100, the fraction of the population over the age 
of 65 rises to 35% from 18% today (see Figure 4.1). The average growth rate of the gross 
domestic product (GDP) also starts to decline in the later part of the century, although only 
slightly.  
Figure 4.1: Index of Major Socio-Economic Indicators for Ontario (2020 to 2100) 
 
The socio-economic projection shows relatively even growth of GDP between the six regions, 
with the Central region contributing 52% to 53% of Ontario’s GDP in both 2020 and 2050 (see 
Figure 4.2).  
The distribution of housing types also shifts significantly into the future with larger growth in 
attached or semi-detached dwellings and apartments. Additional indicators and how they 
change in time and/or by region and census division are provided in the detailed report in 
Appendix 6.

Socio-economic indicators were applied to the PCCIA by Area of Focus and included those most 
applicable and influential for each sector or theme. The sum of those indicators became the 
final suite that was calculated and used in the PCCIA. The selection was constrained to three to 
five indicators for each Area of Focus in order to make the calculations manageable for the 
assessment. The socio-economic projection data were used to inform components of future risk 
scoring and evaluation. Area of Focus teams applied the socio-economic projection data to 
estimate the population, employment, or assets at risk for future time periods and across 
different regions of Ontario. 
More specifically, socio-economic data were used to adjust likelihood (of an impact occurring) 
and the severity (of a consequence should it occur) scores for a given Area of Focus, by region 
and in future time periods. The data helped reveal how changes to, for example, population 
size, could lead to more people exposed to climate change between different time periods and 
hence how relative individual risk scores would change over time. Table 4.2 provides an 
overview of the socio-economic indicators selected and applied to analysis and evaluation 
under each Area of Focus. Further information on how each Area of Focus applied these 
indicators to scoring processes can be found throughout Sections 5.0 to 9.0.

Business and Economy  
Socio-economic indicators assessed as part of this PCCIA did not 
warrant quantitative changes in risk scores at the firm level for 
the Business and Economy Area of Focus. Socio-economic 
changes and transitions relevant to several Business and 
Economy industries are characterized qualitatively in Section 9.  
 
Specific rationales and assumptions were developed and considered for each Area of Focus, 
and in some cases down to the Level 1 and 2 granularities. For example, where socio-economic 
changes constrain or put pressures on specific Natural Environment Level 2 categories, scores 
were changed to reflect worsening conditions or increased exposure. In other Areas of Focus, 
increased investment in some industries implied more capacity to respond and thus 
consequence scores were not changed. In some cases, socio-economic indictors provided 
information that shifted sector or system outcomes in opposing directions. In these cases, 
without knowing which of the two indicators could be more dominant, the presence of these 
counter-influential indictors implies that no influence will be experienced and thus scores 
remained unchanged. Figure 4.3 below demonstrates the logic applied to each Area of Focus a) 
if the socio-economic projection data could be used to update future scoring quantitatively; 
and b) the logic or rationale used to consider in making future scoring changes.

 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         80  
It is important to acknowledge that changes to the climate risk scores that were influenced by 
socio-economic indicator projections are not uniform across all of Ontario and were considered 
according to regional socio-economic projections. To supplement and/or justify the information 
provided in the socio-economic projections, literature review was undertaken to consider 
historical context in relation to future potential socio-economic changes. For example, 
increasing industry output associated with agriculture may be projected in Northeast and 
Northwest regions however, these regions have been characterized as having insufficient 
infrastructure to enable significant growth of the agriculture industry to date to support 
agricultural operations (Chapagain, 2017). In this case, the likelihood of a climate event 
impacting agriculture may increase, but not until sufficient infrastructure has been developed. 
On the other hand, increasing industry growth in more southern regions of Ontario may be 
constrained due to land use change and lead to intensification with more production on a 
similar proportion of agricultural lands (which may increase the financial consequences of a 
climate event occurring). In both cases, the future risk could be increasing – but for different 
reasons and over different time periods. 
The decision to adjust risk scores was Area of Focus-specific and all changes are noted in the 
PCCIA analysis, Sections 5.0 to 9.0. Risk results characterized under each Area of Focus have 
considered and incorporated socio-economic projection information where appropriate. The 
application of the socio-economic projections is only one supporting tool used to inform 
components of climate risk scoring and in some cases were used only qualitatively (e.g. not to 
adjust future scores) because socio-economic indicators that were available, including their 
resolution, did not reveal information useful to assessing the impact of individual climate 
events.

5.0  Food and Agriculture Area of Focus  
5.1 Overview 
Ontario’s agriculture and food sector is sensitive to regional climatic conditions, with 
changing temperature and precipitation patterns directly influencing productivity and other 
facets of the sector. While changing climate conditions may present potential opportunities for 
agriculture in Ontario (e.g. longer growing and grazing seasons), such benefits will likely be 
offset by negative impacts, resulting in declining productivity, crop failure, and livestock 
fatalities. Several field crop and fruit and vegetable commodities (e.g. corn, cereals, soybeans, 
grapes, field vegetables) are expected to face ‘very high’ climate risk by the end of the century 
(Table 5.1).  
While managing uncertainty is common within Ontario’s food and agricultural sector, climate 
change is expected to amplify existing current risks and introduce new risks for food producers 
across the province. If appropriate adaptation action is taken to limit the risks, and measures 
are put in place to support potential opportunities for Ontario’s food and agriculture sector, 
there could be some positive impacts experienced across the province.

5.2 Food and Agriculture in Ontario  
Ontario’s food and agriculture sector plays an important role in the province’s economy, 
landscape, and society. The sector employs over 700,000 people (approximately 10.3% of 
provincial employment) and contributes approximately $45 billion to the provincial GDP (6.4% 
of total GDP) (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2022c). Ontario is 
identified as Canada’s top agri-food exporting province, with $19.6 billion in agri-food exports 
recorded in 2021 (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2022c).  
The sector is multi-faceted, and includes primary agricultural producers, input and 
manufacturing providers, food and beverage processors, food distributers, food retailers and 
wholesalers, and food service providers (Statistics Canada, 2021h). Ontario’s agri-food sector is 
inextricably linked to systems within and outside of the sector, including infrastructure, 
economic, and natural systems (see Section 10.1 for a cross-sectoral analysis of Ontario’s food 
system and food security). For the purposes of the PCCIA, the Food and Agriculture Area of 
Focus is comprised of only primary agriculture production industries (e.g. crop and livestock 
production), with other supporting segments covered under Infrastructure (Section 6.0) and 
Business and Economy (Section 9.0).  
Primary agricultural production in Ontario is quite diverse, with the province producing over 
200 commodities on 11.76 million acres of agricultural land (Agricorp, 2019; Statistics Canada, 
2022a). Between 2016 and 2021 there was a 2.5% decline in total number of farms across 
Ontario (Statistics Canada, 2022a). However, total farm cash receipts and capital have 
continued to increase across the sector (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 
2022c). 
Grain and oilseed farms are the most common type of agricultural production in the province, 
followed by beef cattle and dairy production. Hog, poultry, fruits, and vegetable production 
make up a smaller proportion of farms across the province but remain as significant economic 
contributors to the sector (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2022c). 
Dairy, vegetable, and soybean production are the top earning commodities by farm receipts in 
Ontario (Statistics Canada, 2021h). Ontario is also the leading greenhouse vegetable producer 
in Canada, representing 71% of total national production in 2020 (Statistics Canada, 2022a).  
Prime agricultural areas are classified as lands with appropriate combinations of soil 
characteristics and climate suitability to support specialty and common primary agricultural 
operations. According to the Canada Land Inventory, only 0.5% of the Canada’s land is 
categorized as Class 1 farmland, and over half of this land is located in Ontario (Ontario Ministry 
of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2022d). The Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) and other 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        84  
provincial plans and guidance documents are used to help identify, designate, and protect 
these lands (Government of Ontario, 2017b; 2019; 2020f). 
Prime agricultural areas in the province are largely located south of the Canadian Shield 
(Central, Southwest, and Eastern regions). As a whole, Southwest and Central Ontario are 
amongst the richest agricultural regions in Canada, with Class 1 – 3 lands, favourable climate, 
access to fresh water and supporting needed agri-food infrastructure systems. Eastern Ontario 
also has large areas that contribute to agricultural production for the province. Ontario’s 
northern regions also include prime agricultural areas, supporting well-established dairy, beef, 
grain, oilseed, fruit, and vegetable industries (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural 
Affairs, 2021d; 2022d).  
5.3 Defining Food and Agriculture in the Context of the PCCIA 
Climate change impact assessment within the Food and Agriculture Area of Focus is 
concentrated on the direct and indirect impacts on primary agricultural production and 
considers the greatest drivers of future risk, the magnitude of consequence and impacts, and 
how impacts fluctuate by region of the province. 
The Food and Agriculture Area of Focus has been divided into three Level 1 categories to 
capture major primary agricultural production systems in Ontario. Figure 5.1 provides a 
summary of each Level 1 and 2 categories assessed as part of Food and Agriculture. Each of 
these categories were then further divided into several Level 2 categories to capture major 
commodities produced across the province. For additional details, Appendix 1 provides a 
characterization of the Level 1 and 2 categories assessed for this Area of Focus.  
Level 1 and 2 categories under this Area of Focus were developed by applying the following 
criteria:  
- 
Alignment with relevant North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes 
- 
Relevance as it relates to Ontario’s primary agricultural systems (e.g. major commodities 
produced)  
- 
Statistics Canada census information on agricultural production for provincial regions  
Level 2 categories were only assessed in regions with considerable coverage or where they have 
larger contribution to Ontario’s food and agriculture sector. In each region, several factors were 
considered to capture the most relevant production types. These included: 
- 
Significant portion of total farm cash receipts  
- 
Significant portion of farmable land  
- 
Significant contribution to regional employment or economic activity  
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        85  
- 
Available spatial data for assessment  
- 
The potential for shifts in a Level 2 category within a region 
- 
The ability to identify climate variable thresholds  
By applying these criteria, the Far North region was scoped out of this Area of Focus, as there is 
currently limited primary production within the region.

5.4 Food and Agriculture Risk Snapshot across Ontario 
Summary of Risks  
Changing climate is already impacting agricultural production across Ontario, with impacts 
expected to continue and amplify in the future. Across the three Level 1 categories under this 
Area of Focus, a total of 924 unique climate risk scenarios were identified and subjected to 
quantitative assessment.  
All commodities across each region are expected to experience some level of increased risk 
from current levels to the end of century, exacerbated or influenced by projected changes in 
climate variables, socio-economic projections, regional characteristics, production values, and 
exposed losses. As noted, the indirect impacts associated with climate change are not included 
in the quantitative risk analysis, indicating that some risk profiles may be underrepresented, 
from a holistic risk perspective. Considerations of indirect impacts are described throughout 
Section 5.7 for each Level 1 category.  
By mid-century, increases in climate risk are anticipated for several field crop and fruit and 
vegetable commodities, with the most immediate increase observed for certain species of 
apples. By the end of century, both the field crop and fruit and vegetable Level 1 categories are 
expected to see an increase in risk, with most Level 2 categories exhibiting ‘high’ and ‘very high’ 
risk profiles. This increase is largely driven by risk increases for corn, cereals, forages, soybeans 
field crop commodities, and apples, grapes, and field vegetable communities. Livestock 
commodities, such as dairy, beef, poultry and eggs, and swine, are also expected to see an 
increase in risk, but to a lesser extent compared to the other two Level 1 categories, with scores 
increasing from ‘medium’ and ‘high’ risk profiles by mid-century under a high emissions 
scenario (RCP8.5). 
Figure 5.2 illustrates risk scores for the Level 1 categories assessed, by region, under current, 
2050s and 2080s time periods. Future time periods illustrate risk results under RCP8.5 - a high 
GHG emission trajectory. Regionally, a greater increase in risk is observed for Southwest, 
Central and Eastern Ontario by mid-century across this Area of Focus, with Northeast and 
Northwest regions increasing in risk by the end-of-century across several Level 2 categories. 
The lag in increased risk scores across northern regions of the province is linked to exposure to 
climate variables (e.g. extreme heat) and the application of socio-economic indicators, 
projecting northern agricultural industry expansion in the latter half of the century. Once 
industry expands in these regions (e.g. investment in supporting infrastructure and agriculture 
production), it is anticipated that northern regions of the province will produce increased 
agricultural outputs, and consequently exhibit greater exposure to climate-related risks.  
 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        87  
Key Climate Drivers  
The Food and Agriculture Area of Focus is exposed to multiple climate variables that lead to 
climate-related risks for crop and livestock production. Climate variables interact with field 
crop, fruit, vegetable, and livestock production resulting in direct impacts to plants, yield losses, 
and compromised animal development and reproduction among other impacts. Indirect 
impacts stem from climate variables interacting with pests and diseases, soil, and water 
resources, as well as infrastructure and supporting systems critical for crop and livestock 
production.  
Key climate drivers to the risk scenarios assessed under this Area of Focus are listed in Table 
5.2. These include Extreme Hot Days, Degree Days <0°C, and Moisture Deficit (proxy for 
drought conditions), which are the main drivers of 24%, 19% and 17% of all risk scenarios, 
respectively. Additionally, growing season length and extreme precipitation climate variables 
were also impactful for risk scenarios assessed under Food and Agriculture. A full list of all 
major climate variables that are driving the highest risks to Ontario’s Food and Agriculture Area 
of Focus by Level 1 category and region is available in Appendix 8.

The total number of climate variables assessed in scenarios for different Level 1 categories 
ranged from four for Livestock, to eight for Field Crops, and 10 for Fruits and Vegetables. The 
types of hazards assessed for Level 2 categories depended on their sensitivity and geographic 
distribution. Importantly, the three climate variables in Table 5.2 are present across all Level 1 
categories: Field Crops, Fruit and Vegetables, and Livestock, while others (e.g. Growing Season 
Length, Extreme Precipitation, and Mean Spring Precipitation) were only assessed for Field 
Crops and Fruits and Vegetables. The Wildfire Return Period variable was assessed for Livestock 
and Field Crops, but not for Fruits and Vegetables, largely because it occurs predominantly in 
Northeast and Northwest regions where Fruit and Vegetable production is currently limited. 
Direct impacts associated with the main climate interactions include crop damage, poor 
nutrient uptake by crops, reduced crop quality and yield, reduced plant and animal 
productivity, greater livestock mortality and crop loss. See Section 5.7 for detailed descriptions 
of direct and indirect impacts and consequences.

5.5 Approach to Assessing Climate Impacts on Food and 
Agriculture 
As described in Section 2.0 of this report, Areas of Focus were used to assess climate impacts to 
systems and sectors in a systematic and scalable manner. In this regard, the impacts within the 
Food and Agriculture Area of Focus were quantitatively evaluated by the direct impacts 
identified to major commodities produced across Ontario. The magnitude of consequence for 
each interaction was assessed by financial losses associated with direct impacts to each Level 2 
category. Indirect impacts to this Area of Focus were not included in the quantitative portion of 
the assessment of risk, but qualitative characterization is provided based upon each Level 1 
category in Section 5.7. 
The magnitude of consequence under this Area of Focus was evaluated based on the financial 
loss associated with direct impacts to each assessed Level 2 category. Literature, historical 
production, yield and insurance claim data and socio-economic projections were used to 
support consequence scoring. The extent of yield loss for crop and livestock products (e.g. milk) 
sustained under each of the 924 scenarios was quantified, based on the ranges shown in Table 
5.3. 
Table 5.3: Consequence Criteria for the Food and Agriculture Area of Focus

The likelihood of impact for each scenario was assessed by considering the probability of 
impact associated with each risk scenario (e.g. likelihood of the described loss in a given year). 
Probability ranges for each score category is shown in Appendix 2. 
Generally, the strength of evidence for this Area of Focus ranged from medium to high, with the 
exception of a handful of interactions where research remains limited. For example, the risk 
scenarios for wildfire impacts on field crop and livestock production were rated low in strength 
of evidence, as even with evident impacts, there is limited research available on the magnitude 
and likelihood of the associated consequences for Ontario agriculture.  
Climate impacts were identified for each Level 1 category by assessing risk at the scale of each 
identified Level 2 commodity type and associated regions. For Level 2 categories that included 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       90 
several commodity types (e.g. cereals), a proxy commodity (e.g. winter wheat) was selected 
based on regional relevance and existing production data. In other words, certain Level 2 risk 
scores do not depict overall risk for all commodities within a Level 2 category, rather present a 
representation of risk for the category based on the selected proxy commodity.  
To update risk consequence scores for the 2050s and 2080s time periods, socio-economic 
projections were considered along with specific assumptions on agriculture development in 
different regions across Ontario, discussed in Box 3. 
 
5.6 Limitations of Food and Agriculture Area of Focus 
A more granular assessment of climate change was constrained by several factors and stand as 
valuable input for further specific assessments in the sector, or, as part of subsequent 
provincial-scale climate change impact assessment. These limitations are described briefly 
below. 
Non-Climatic Influences  
Climate change is considered one of many challenges facing agricultural production in Ontario, 
including land-use pressures, declining ecosystem and soil health, labour shortages, and shifting 
market conditions. Other non-climatic factors also influence agricultural productivity including 
geographic location and topography, soil type and quality, type of cultivars and species, and on-
farm management techniques and practices (Morand et al., 2017; Brklacich and Woodrow, 
Box 3: Application of Socio-Economic Projections to Food and Agriculture 
As described in Section 4.0, socio-economic projections were applied to risk evaluation based 
on the influence on likelihood of consequence and magnitude of impact for each risk 
scenario. For the Food and Agriculture Area of Focus, four socio-economic indicators were 
applied to the likelihood of consequence across each Level 1 category, these included: 
population growth, GDP and industry output, employment, and capital formation (indicating 
investment) for the sector. For example, the likelihood of consequence was raised by one 
level for the 2050s and 2080s across Southwest, Central and Eastern regions based on 
population growth and industry expansion and investment (increasing sensitivity and 
exposure). Whereas the likelihood of consequence was increased by one level for Northeast 
and Northwest regions of Ontario for the 2080s, but not the 2050s. This was due to longer-
term projected growth and industry expansion in the northern regions of the province and 
the requirement for significant infrastructure and development to enable growth of the 
agriculture industry and support agricultural operations. 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       91 
2016). When interpreting the quantitative risk scores under this Area of Focus, it is important to 
consider that scores reflect only direct climate impacts to Level 1 and 2 categories, and do not 
consider how non-climatic pressures and factors could influence current and future risk scores.  
Food System Interdependencies 
As noted, the Food and Agriculture Area of Focus is scoped to primary agriculture production 
industries (e.g. crop and livestock production). Food processing, manufacturing, retail, and 
related services are not covered under this Area of Focus. Instead, climate impacts to these 
subsectors have been grouped under the Business and Economy Area of Focus in Section 9.0. 
Cascading impacts and interdependencies (e.g. supporting infrastructure) within and outside of 
Ontario’s food and agriculture sector as they relate to food security, have been covered 
qualitatively under Cross-Sectoral Considerations in Section 10.1.  
Proxy Selection  
Defining commodity types to include in the assessment of the Food and Agriculture Area of 
Focus was an important step in the process and proved challenging. Based on the scope and 
scale of the PCCIA, specific proxy commodities were selected as representative commodities for 
certain Level 2 categories. The selection of proxy commodities was based on climate sensitivity 
and exposure identified through literature review, regional production and insurance claim 
data, and expert judgement. However, the application of proxy commodities does constrain risk 
scores for certain Level 2 categories to specific commodities (e.g. winter wheat was selected as 
a proxy commodity for the cereals Level 2 category for appropriate regions). The selection 
process may have been improved by (further) consultation with other subject-matter experts.  
5.7 Current and Future Climate Risks  
5.7.1 Field Crops 
Overview 
Ontario field crop production was assessed as a Level 1 category under the Food and 
Agriculture Area of Focus. Field crop production is the most common type of primary 
agriculture in Ontario. Major field crops (e.g. grain and oilseed commodities) grown in Ontario 
include soybeans, corn, wheat, canola, oats, and barley. The selection of commodities grown 
across the province varies depending on the climate and land suitability of each region, market 
drivers, and the needs of producers (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 
2017a).  
Field crops produced across the province are inherently vulnerable to weather and climate 
conditions, due to direct exposure and sensitivities. Research suggests that Ontario’s changing 
climate could present opportunities for field crop production driven by longer growing seasons, 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       92 
milder winters, and fewer frost days (Morand et al., 2017; Qian et al., 2019). However, this 
assessment found that the benefits are likely to be offset by the risks associated with increased 
frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, variability in seasonal temperatures, and 
changing precipitation patterns at critical crop development phases (Zaytseva, 2016; Apostoli, 
2021; Chapagain, 2017). 
The assessment results indicate that field crop risk profiles across all regions of the province will 
be ‘high’ or ‘very high’ by the end of century. A greater increase in risk is observed for 
Southwest, Central and Eastern Ontario by mid-century (2050s), with Northeast and Northwest 
regions increasing in risk by the 2080s. The lag in increased risk scores across northern regions 
of the province is linked to exposure to extreme climate conditions (e.g. extreme heat) and the 
application of socio-economic indicators, projecting northern agricultural industry expansion in 
the second half of the century. As industry further expands in these regions, it is anticipated 
that northern regions of the province will produce increased agricultural outputs and 
consequently, exhibit greater exposure to climate risks. The higher risk scores in Southwest, 
Central and Eastern Ontario are reflective of existing exposure and sensitivity to changing 
climate conditions. 
High temperatures, extreme precipitation events, and drought conditions were found to be the 
greatest drivers of future risk to Ontario’s field crop operations and production. The type and 
magnitude of risks are expected to vary across agricultural regions of the province, depending 
on regional acreage, commodities grown, intensification of production, and land, soil, and 
climate conditions. Additionally, indirect climate impacts to field crop production introduce 
another layer of complexity that influences how climate risks will materialize or cascade within 
and across crop regions of the province. As noted, the indirect impacts on Level 1 and 2 
categories are not included in the risk scores, and therefore individual scores may not provide a 
holistic representation of the impacts that climate change poses to field crop production. 
Qualitative descriptions of indirect impacts on field crop production are provided below, to 
accompany risk scores.  
Direct Impacts 
This section describes the quantitative scores for direct risks assessed for the Level 2 categories 
under Field Crops. Over 400 separate risk interactions were assessed for Field Crops, 
considering how changes in climate variables could lead to impacts on each commodity type. 
Each scenario was evaluated under current and future timeframes and for the relevant 
provincial regions. The assessment has drawn on research, provincial production and insurance 
data, socio-economic data, and literature to inform scenario development and consequence 
scoring related to direct climate impacts on field crop production. 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       93 
Table 5.4 provides example risk scenarios for this Level 1 category. Notably, these are meant to 
be illustrative examples of the types of scenarios assessed and are non-exhaustive. A more 
detailed risk characterization and a description of risk drivers are provided in the section below.  
Further detail on the risk profiles relevant to this category, with more information on how the 
magnitude of the risks vary by region and timeframe (operating under RCP8.5) is provided in 
Table 5.5, at the end of the section. Appendix 7 provides risk scores for both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 
emission scenarios.

Level 2 
Category 
Illustrative Risk Scenarios  
Strength of 
Evidence 
Soybeans 
 A short-term high intensity precipitation event occurring during 
the early growth stages (spring), leads to flooded fields, 
waterlogged soils and drowning of sensitive soybean varieties 
for over two days. Flood-sensitive soybean types have been 
shown to experience up to a 77% decline in yield under this 
scenario, mainly caused by limited plant survival and seed 
emergence. This event would result in significant financial 
consequences for farm-revenue and would require replanting. 
Medium  
Corn 
A sustained Moisture Deficit during pollination and fertilization 
periods, results in tassel and leaf damage, decreased pollen 
viability, poor silk development and insufficient ear size. 
Moisture stress will also increase risks related to developing 
stalk rot and exacerbate the feeding injury of corn leaf aphids. 
These impacts could lead to a yield reduction of 20 to 50% 
depending on the severity of the Moisture Deficits, ultimately 
reducing productivity and farm-revenue. 
High  
Cereals 
Changing winter precipitation patterns can cause widespread 
winterkill in sensitive winter wheat varieties. This scenario could 
result in poor emergence and considerable yield losses, 
resulting in the requirement for spring replanting (if conditions 
are adequate). 
Medium  
Forages 
An extreme heat event with temperatures reaching +34°C 
causes scorching of alfalfa and significant yield loss. These 
conditions also increase risks related to pest and disease 
outbreaks, such as the Potato Leafhopper, possibly exacerbating 
yield losses. This would result in significant revenue loss for 
farms and potential livestock feed shortages. 
Medium

Illustrative Risk Scenarios  
Strength of 
Evidence 
Canola 
A prolonged (minimum of three days) extreme heat event 
(+28°C during day and +16°C during nights) occurs during early 
flowering period, resulting in heat damage and abortion of 
flowers of spring canola varieties. This results in significant yield 
damage and ultimately loss of farm-revenue. 
Medium  
 
Soybeans 
Soybeans have become the largest row crop by acreage in the province and are Ontario’s 
greatest agricultural export commodity (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 
2017a). Soybeans grown in Ontario are used for specialty food grade markets, oil production 
and livestock feed. In recent years close to three million acres of soybeans have been grown 
annually across the province (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2021a).  
In recent years, approximately two million acres of land in Southwest Ontario have grown 
soybeans, comprising almost 70% of provincial harvest (Statistics Canada, 2017). Over 500,000 
acres of land harvest soybeans in Eastern Ontario, which comprises approximately 19% of all 
soybeans grown in the province. Central Ontario typically grows over 250,000 acres of soybeans 
annually, representing the top commodity grown in the region. Northern regions of the 
province are limited due to the amount of available crop heat units and land suitability, and 
therefore the commodity is less commonly grown in these regions (Ontario Ministry of 
Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2021d).  
The impact assessment found that extreme precipitation and extreme heat are key climate 
variables driving future risk to soybean production. Risk to soybean production is found to 
increase from a ‘high’ risk score to a ‘very high’ risk score by the 2080s (operating under 
RCP8.5), in Southwest, Central and Eastern regions, with extreme heat being less of a threat in 
Northeast Ontario. 
As noted, extreme precipitation was identified as one of the most relevant climate variables to 
soybean production, with short-duration extreme precipitation occurring in the spring season 
being particularly impactful. Soybeans are particularly sensitive to flooding in their early growth 
stages, which can directly reduce crop yields (Hatfield et al., 2011; Motha and Baier, 2005; 
Sullivan et al., 2001). For example, should short-duration extreme precipitation occur during 
the planting season, water logging of fields and complete submergence of the plant, can cause 
significant crop damage and yield losses, resulting in associated financial consequences. 
(Kucharik & Serbin, 2008; Bootsma et al., 2005). Where heavier clay soils with inadequate 
drainage are located across Ontario (e.g. Eastern region), crops are more vulnerable to impacts 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       95 
of flooding, waterlogging, and crusting, resulting in yield losses (Pearson et al., 2008; Linkemer 
et al., 1998; Morand et al., 2017).  
Corn 
Corn is the second largest field crop grown throughout Ontario, with 2.1 million acres of grain 
corn harvested in 2021 (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2021a). Corn is 
produced across the province for both feed (60% of production) and industrial (40% of 
production) uses. A significant acreage is also planted to corn silage to be used for livestock 
feed (0.25 million acres) (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2017a). For the 
purposes of this assessment, grain corn has been selected as the representative commodity.  
Grain corn is most widely grown in Southwest Ontario, with acreage in recent years totaling 
over 1.5 million acres. Eastern Ontario is also a large provincial producer of the commodity, 
with approximately 450,000 acres of corn grown annually. Central Ontario typically grows over 
200,000 acres of corn annually, representing the second highest commodity grown in the 
region (behind soybeans). The northern regions of the province are limited due to amount of 
available crop heat units and land suitability, and therefore is less commonly grown in these 
regions (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2021d). 
Climate risks to corn production in Ontario are expected to increase by the 2080s across 
Southwest, Central and Eastern Ontario. Several climate variables were identified as being 
impactful to corn yields, especially at critical stages of plant development (Cabas et al., 2010; 
Zaytseva, 2016; Gaudin et al., 2015). For example, Moisture Deficit was used as a climate 
indicator of drought conditions. The magnitude and duration of Moisture Deficits can lead to a 
lack of water for critical growth. Prolonged lack of water during the growing season can have 
serious impacts on corn production including limited growth and development, increased pest 
and disease outbreaks, and elevated exposure of plants to extreme heat (He et al., 2018; 
Zaytseva, 2016; Qian et al., 2013; 2019). Risks are often exacerbated for rainfed corn crops 
grown on soils with low water holding capacity (Hatfield et al., 2012; 2018). While Ontario’s 
agriculture is mainly rainfed and irrigation continues to be limited for common field crop 
production, producers, especially in the southern regions of the province (Southwest and 
Central), may be more likely to consider irrigation options for traditional field crop production, 
as growing season conditions become increasingly hot and dry. (Shifflett et al., 2014; Xu and 
Fox 2017; Xu et al.,2019; 2020).  
Cereals 
Cereal commodities make up a large portion of the cropping system in Ontario, grown on 
approximately 25% of the arable land (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 
2017a). Winter wheat is the most widely grown cereal crop in Ontario followed by spring 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       96 
barley, spring wheat, and oats. Cereals offer many benefits to producers, including improved 
soil structure and manure management options (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and 
Rural Affairs, 2017a). 
Winter wheat was selected as a proxy commodity for cereals in Southwest, Central, Eastern and 
Northeast Ontario, based on production in the regions and identified climate sensitivities. Oats 
were selected as a Level 2 proxy for Cereals in the Northwest region, based on acreage and 
production data, in comparison to other cereal crops produced in the region.  
As a Level 2 Field Crop category, winter wheat presented increasing future risk across all 
regions, with Southwest, Central, Eastern regional risk profiles increasing to ‘very high’ by the 
2080s. Extreme heat and winter precipitation are the main climate variables driving future risk 
to winter wheat productivity. For example, winter cereal production can be significantly 
impacted during the winter and early spring period by frost heaving, icing, low temperatures, 
and snow mould (Cabas et al., 2010; Moran et al., 2017). Icing and drowning conditions 
throughout the winter and early spring is one of the main reasons for winterkill in Ontario. For 
example, in 2019, winterkill from icing conditions in the spring led to the largest winterkill event 
in the history of Agricorp’s winter wheat plan (Agricorp, 2020).  
Regions with limited sub-surface drainage and heavy-textured soils are particularly sensitive to 
these impacts. For example, varieties grown in the Eastern Ontario tend to have greater icing 
tolerance; those grown in Central Ontario’s snow belt require snow-mould tolerance, and 
commodities grown in heavy clays of the Southwest region, require greater resistance to frost 
heaving (Moran et al., 2017). Under a changing climate, increased freeze-thaw cycles, rapid 
snowmelt, and warming shoulder season temperatures, may increase the likelihood of impacts 
associated with winterkill in winter cereal commodities (Bélanger et al., 2002; 2006).  
Forages 
Forages are another major Ontario crop, providing feed for Ontario’s livestock industry. Forage 
production is an important component of crop rotations on many farms. Forage crop rotations 
provide several environmental benefits, including reduced soil erosion, and improved soil 
health and organic matter (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2017a). Hay 
and haylage are grown on 831,000 ha (2,000,000 acres), while there are 239,000 ha (600,000 
acres) of seeded pasture and 415,000 ha (1,037,000 acres) of natural pasture. The value of 
forage production is estimated to be nearly 10% of Ontario’s agricultural production (Ontario 
Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2017a).  
Southwest and Eastern Ontario comprise the majority of forage acreage, reporting over 
600,000 acres and 520,000 acres in 2020, respectively. Central Ontario typically harvests over 
150,000 acres of forage crop annually. Over 120,000 acres was seeded in Northeast Ontario in 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       97 
2019, and over 50,000 acres in Northwest Ontario (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and 
Rural Affairs, 2021a). 
For the purposes of this assessment alfalfa was selected as a proxy commodity to represent 
forage crops. Alfalfa is the highest-yielding perennial forage crop grown in Ontario and the most 
frequently grown forage legume. It is higher yielding and produces more protein per unit area 
than other forage legumes. Alfalfa can be grown alone but is often grown in mixed stands with 
various grass species (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2017a; Moran et 
al., 2017). The risk profiles for forage crops in Southwest, Central, and Eastern regions increase 
from ‘medium’ to ‘high’ by the 2050s, and to ‘very high’ by the 2080s. In Northeast and 
Northwest Ontario, the risk profile increased from a ‘medium’ to a ‘high’ score by the 2050s 
and remains at this score for the 2080s. 
Similar to winter cereals, climate conditions that increase risks from winterkill are particularly 
impactful to alfalfa development. Warming fall temperatures and increased precipitation 
leading to wet saturated soils, can compromise winter hardening and contribute to winterkill 
risks (Belanger et al., 2006). Extreme heat is also likely to drive future risk to alfalfa production. 
The frequency, intensity and duration of heat waves can cause several impacts to forage 
production including, reduced photosynthesis, scorched leaves and stems, dead leaves and 
seeds, reduced pollen production and viability, and reduced grain number and weight (Moran 
et al., 2017; Jing et al., 2020). Impacts of extreme heat are exacerbated if coupled with 
prolonged drought conditions (Arshad et al., 2017). For example, 2020 was Agircorp’s highest 
payout year for their Forage Rainfall Plan, with $6.6 million in payouts due to insufficient 
rainfall, causing dry spring and early summer conditions (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food 
and Rural Affairs, 2020a; Argicorp, 2016).  
Additionally, it is important to recognize the cascading impacts of declining productivity and 
quality in forage crops and pastures to the livestock sector (characterized further in Section 
5.7.3). Climate-related impacts on forage crops can result feed shortages across the livestock 
sector (e.g. province-wide livestock feed shortages were experienced from the 2012 drought) 
(Tourangeau et al., 2019; Cordeiro et al., 2022). Declining feedstock quality and quantity could 
lead to animal health and welfare concerns and further financial losses for the sector (Moran et 
al., 2017; Reid et al., 2007).  
Canola  
Canola is a cool-season oilseed crop limited to temperate areas of Ontario. Canola is grown on 
approximately 45,000 acres across Southwest, Central and Northeast regions of the province 
(Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2017a). Both spring and winter canola 
varieties require well-drained soils. The commodity is a less commonly grown cash crop in 
Ontario, but winter canola specifically, has been on the rise in Southwest and Central Ontario in 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       98 
response to rising yields, linked to advancements in hybrid seeds and market drivers (Moran et 
al., 2017; Kamchen, 2021; Qian et al., 2018). Currently, risk to canola is scored as a ‘medium’ 
and increases to a ‘high’ score for the future time periods. The risk profile for canola could 
increase further with acreage rising over recent years, increasing exposure of the crop to 
climate conditions (Kamchen, 2021; Wu & Ma, 2018).  
In this assessment, heat stress associated with extreme temperatures, was identified as the 
greatest driver of future risk for canola production in Ontario. Canola plants can be damaged 
from extreme heat conditions and can result in ‘brown seed’ and ‘heat blast’ (Qian et al., 2013; 
2018; 2019; Moran et al., 2017). Brown seeds are produced when canola is subjected to 
extended periods of high temperatures and moisture stress due to dry conditions during the 
pod fill stage. Heat blast occurs in response to heat stress during the flowering period and the 
pod development period, the result is often abortion of flowers or pods. Both impacts can 
result in significant plant damage, yield losses and unmarketable products (Moran et al., 2017; 
Wu and Ma, 2018).

Indirect Impacts 
This section explores several indirect climate impacts that can compound the identified direct 
risks or introduce additional climate-related pressures to field crop production in Ontario. 
Drought and extreme heat conditions are expected to impact water availability and supply for 
field crop producers, resulting in increased demand, and requiring allocation restrictions. 
Ontario field crop producers could experience water use limitations (e.g. irrigation and field 
application constraints), causing disruptions to farming operations, impacts to productivity, and 
revenue losses for farms (Reid et al., 2007; Disch et al., 2012). This could be exacerbated based 
on the timing and magnitude of water use restrictions and associated drought conditions (De La 
Cueva Bueno et al., 2017). Water scarcity could be amplified by increased demand for water by 
other sectors, especially in regions of the province where access to water is already a constraint 
on agriculture production (e.g. Northwest region) (Reid et al., 2007; Disch et al., 2012). 
Both flooding and drought conditions have been found to have negative impacts on soil health, 
driven by increased soil erosion, degradation of organic matter, and accelerated sediment 
transport. This could result in a reduction of soil regulation and quality, declining productivity, 
increased disease outbreaks from pests and pathogens, and the requirement for additional 
inputs (e.g. pesticides) to offset impacts to soil fertility. The indirect impacts could result in 
overall farm revenue losses for producers (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural 
Affairs, 2018; McConkey et al., 2011; Moran et al., 2017). Additionally, the number of spring 
days where unfrozen ground is not protected by snow, crops or residue cover, is projected to 
extend with climate change and will contribute to soil erosion. The worsening conditions of soil 
erosion may have immediate and long-term impacts on field crop production in Ontario 
(McConkey et al., 2011). 
Flooding conditions are expected to impact nutrient export and leaching, causing input losses 
and declined productivity for producers. Saturated soils and flooding conditions can also cause 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       100 
implications for field applications of fertilizers and pesticides (Motha and Baier, 2005; Kling et 
al., 2003). Impacts may result in increasing inputs and nutrient management costs. With 
accelerated export of nutrients, producers may be required to adopt and implement new 
management practices (e.g. controlled tile drainage, conservation tillage, filter strips or cover 
crops) to mitigate risks to the surrounding watershed (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and 
Rural Affairs, 2018; Mervin and McLarty, 2017). 
There is increasing evidence that climate change will impact the distribution and prevalence of 
agricultural pests, diseases, and non-native species in Ontario. Milder winters and lengthened 
growing seasons result in a greater chance of over-wintering survival, increased cycles and 
northward expansion of pests and diseases, including invasive species (Baute, 2020; Reid et al., 
2007). Monitoring and surveillance programs have observed pests typically found in southern 
and central United Stated migrating to Southwest Ontario (Philip, 2015; Hatfield, 2012). 
Additionally, research has found that higher temperatures and drier conditions can be more 
impactful to natural enemies of pests, further increasing pest expansion and prevalence. Under 
a changing climate, it is becoming increasingly difficult and complex to model pest and disease 
ranges and prevalence, contributing to productivity losses and costs for field crop producers. 
Losses related to pest and disease include reduced crop yields and revenue, increased 
inputs/control costs, and contribute to access limitations to export or domestic markets 
(Boland et al., 2004; Philip, 2015; Hatfield, 2012).  
Changes in climate can also impact the role of pollinator species (pollination and dispersal of 
seeds) in plant reproduction and crop production, leading to productivity and economic losses 
(Section 5.7.2 further describes the indirect impacts associated with declining pollinator species 
to fruit and vegetable production) (Apostoli, 2021, Harris et al., 2016; Kling et al., 2003). 
Extreme weather events can result in cascading impacts related to electricity supply, agriculture 
infrastructure and transportation failures. The cascading impacts from infrastructure system 
failures are discussed in more detail under Food Security in Section 10.1.  
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        101  
5.7.2 Fruits and Vegetables 
Overview  
Fruits and vegetables across Ontario are produced under diverse soil and climatic conditions. 
Over 125 different fruit and vegetable crops are grown on 245,000 acres of land (Ontario Fruit 
& Vegetable Growers Association, 2022). As an economic contribution, fruits and vegetables 
contribute more than $4.2 billion in activity per year, employing over 30,000 people directly on-
farm (Ontario Fruit & Vegetable Growers Association, 2022). Approximately 43% of this value is 
field grown and 57% produced in greenhouse operations (OPMA, 2021).  
Fruit and vegetable production is critically important as part of Ontario’s import and export 
markets, with over two billion pounds of produce, both local and imported, distributed through 
the Ontario Food Terminal in Toronto. In 2019, total export values of fruits and vegetables 
exceeded two billion dollars (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2019). 
Commodity prices for fruits and vegetables differ based on consumer demand, international 
markets, crop yield, and the commodity itself. From 2000 to 2019, as an example, raspberry 
and strawberry farm gate prices ($/tonne) rose the largest, compared with other fruits such as 
peaches and apples (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2019). For the 
purposes of the PCCIA, six Level 2 categories were used to assess the risks associated with 
direct impacts to fruits and vegetable production. However, it is critical to recognize the 
diversity and extent of all fruit and vegetable production, and the unique growing conditions 
and sensitivities that exist. 
Numerous climate change impacts to fruit and vegetables can occur, and are highly dependent 
on the season, stage of growth of the crop, and the duration or extent of the climate event 
itself (e.g. drought within one year compared to a multi-year drought). Not all fruits and 
vegetable growers may experience impacts to the same extent. For example, if fruit trees are 
impacted or damaged to an extent where they are unable to produce fruit, impacts could be 
felt over several years, rather than only be reflective of financial loss within one year. Multi-
year and cascading impacts are particularly important for fruit and vegetable production, and 
these are described as indirect impacts below.  
The fruit and vegetable sector in Ontario could play an important role in advancing food system 
resiliency, such as reducing the significant reliance of Ontario on fruit and vegetable imports 
(approximately $7.3 billion in imports annually). For example, a report produced in 2020 by the 
Greenbelt Foundation (2020) found that expansion of certain crops could result in an increase 
of $135 million in farm-gate revenue and bolster local production (thereby food system 
resilience) by growing fresh grapes, pears, strawberries, garlic, eggplant, sweet potatoes, 
apples, snap peas, and cabbage, as well as technical advancements such as vertical farming 
(Greenbelt Foundation, 2020).

Direct Impacts 
The following provides brief characterizations of each Level 2 category assessed for fruits and 
vegetables across Ontario. Close to 300 separate risk interactions were assessed for the Fruit 
and Vegetables Level 2 category, considering how changes in climate variables could lead to 
impacts on each commodity. Risk scenarios were evaluated under current and future

Table 5.6 provides example risk scenarios for this Level 1 category. Notably, these are meant to

Apples 
The occurrence of spring frost conditions or temperatures 
dipping to below -2.2°C in the spring after apple flowers have 
budded can cause a 10% kill in apple production if apple buds 
have reached the first pink stage in the Springtime. A 
temperature dipping below -4.4°C at the same stage can 
result in a 90% kill in apple crops in a given year. Some 
cultivars do provide some level of protection against winter 
damage, such as McIntosh which is considered hardier. Gala 
is considered to be a moderately hardy cultivar against 
winter damage. For more cold tolerant species like apples, 
winter injury is more common at colder locations, or away 
from the influence of the Great Lakes – like Eastern Ontario.

Berries 
Temperatures around 22°C to 25°C, high relative humidity, 
and plant surface wetness caused by rain, overhead 
irrigation, fog, or dew provide an ideal environment for 
Botrytis. Raspberry plants are susceptible during bloom and 
again as the fruits ripen. The direct impacts of this scenario 
are that impacts such as brown or black sunken lesions 
develop on green or ripe fruit, daughter plants die, outer 
leaves die prematurely, or plant collapse occurs from crown

rot. Losses can exceed 50% when conditions are favorable, 
even on well-managed (actively managed) fields. 
Field 
Vegetables 
Extreme Hot Days can lead to yield losses for several field 
vegetable crops. Yields of five vegetables in the Brassicaceae 
family showed some damage due to hot weather in August. 
For cauliflower, cabbage, and rutabaga there was roughly a 
10% yield loss for every 10 days that the temperature 
reached 30°C or above during the growing season.  
High 
Grapes 
Increasing air temperatures and frequency of heat poses the 
highest risk to Vitis vinifera varieties of grapes – and 
specifically those used in the production of ice wines in 
Niagara such as Riesling and Vidal varieties. Ice wines require 
a hard freeze (-8C or colder) after ripening. If air 
temperatures warm to the point where this condition is not 
met or a freeze does not come quickly enough, rotting will 
occur, and the crop will be lost. This scenario will result in the 
rotting, reduction, and potential for total loss in icewine 
production in a given harvest. For non-ice wine grape 
varieties, extreme heat will change the aroma, size, alcohol, 
and sugar concentration and thus quality of non-ice-wine 
production resulting in declining yields and changing grape 
conditions. 
High 
Greenhouse 
Vegetables 
Lower greenhouse temperatures can increase production 
time and flowering time. Cold conditions slow the uptake of 
water and nutrients. As a result, the number of crops that 
can be produced in a given amount of space over the spring 
season decreases. Plants will take longer to flower and 
depending on the outdoor weather, more money could be 
spent heating each crop since it is in the greenhouse longer. 
Cold temperatures require a greater energy usage to heat 
greenhouses also requiring more investments.  
Low 
Tender Fruit 
Drought and dry conditions impact tender fruit several 
different ways. It can slow and/or kill tree growth required 
prior to fruit, decrease fruit juiciness, lead to fruit doubling, 
deep suture disorder, cause fruit shriveling or internal 
browning, lead to reduced root growth, decrease in pollen

viability and cause yield loss. Drought causing severe stress 
over 10 days particularly in the early season is problematic 
and can lead to reduced maturity and moderate yield loss. 
Drought occurring mid or late season has less impact on tree 
growth but may still lead to the same quality impacts 
described above. 
 
Apples 
There are 15 main varieties of apples grown on nearly 14,000 acres in Ontario, as of 2019. The 
province’s major apple-producing areas are along the shores of Lake Ontario, Lake Erie, Lake 
Huron, and Georgian Bay. In recent years, Ontario’s apple crop has averaged about 0.25 million 
metric tonnes or 13.7 million bushels (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 
2019; 2020c). Climate impacts on apple production were assessed across Southwest, Central 
and Eastern Ontario. Regionally, no significant variation was found between these three regions 
based on current or future risks to apples at the scale of the assessment. However, risks to 
apples are expected to rise across all regions. Under current climate conditions, risks were 
determined to be ‘high’. Regardless of how quickly greenhouse gas emissions are reduced (e.g. 
RCP4.5 or RCP8.5), risks to apples are expected to increase to ‘very high’ by the 2050s and stay 
‘very high’ out until end of the century.  
Based on the possible severity of consequences, current ‘high’ risks to apples are being driven 
by extreme heat, extreme precipitation, and springtime conditions, such as a late frost. These 
events can lead to numerous direct impacts on apples (Rochette et al., 2004). The occurrence of 
frost conditions or temperatures dipping to below -2.2°C after apple flowers have budded can 
cause a 10% kill in apple production, if apple buds have reached the first pink stage. If 
temperatures drop below -4.4°C at the same stage, it can result in a 90% kill in apple crops for a 
given growing season (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2013; 2017c). For 
many apple tree varieties, temperatures that exceed roughly 32°C can result in heat stress, 
reducing photosynthesis process and stunting growth (Beckerman, 2006). One adaptive 
measure being undertaken is the planting of new hybrid tree varieties in areas where older tree 
varieties could no longer withstand. Drought can also impact apples in several ways, slowing 
tree growth required prior to fruit, reduced root growth, fruit shriveling and ultimately yield 
loss. 
 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        105  
Berries 
Berries (e.g. strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries) are grown across the province, mostly 
around major urban centres. Other types of berries grown in the province include blackberries, 
currants, gooseberries and cranberries. Berry crops are generally grown on the best agricultural 
soils, requiring excellent drainage and high organic matter for optimum production. In 2019 
Ontario berry crops were grown on 3,400 acres of land and had annual farm gate value of over 
$44 million (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs 2017c; 2019). Climate risks 
were evaluated across all regions of Ontario except for the Far North. Strawberries, raspberries, 
blueberries, and blackberries were used to inform the characterization of possible climate risks 
to berry growers.  
The level of current risk (‘high’) is being driven, in part, by extreme heat conditions and dry 
conditions or drought. In the future, increasing air temperatures combined with wetter 
conditions pose ‘high’ risks associated with infections and disease, that may result in more 
chronic challenges for berry growers (Calleja, 2011). Extreme heat for example may lead to 
impacts in a raspberry field, with warm to hot air temperatures and high relative humidity 
leading to the development of anthracnose (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural 
Affairs, 2009). This disease could affect the fruit, flowers and petioles and cause daughter 
plants to die, outer leaves to die prematurely or the plant may collapse from crown rot. Risk of 
anthracnose may increase for berry produces, as the disease is favoured by warm temperatures 
(>18°C) and wet conditions. Yield losses due to the anthracnose can exceed 50% when 
conditions favour disease development, even in well-managed fields. 
Moisture conditions for berries is critical in production for berry size, and while excessive 
moisture must be avoided, periods of 20 to 30 days without significant precipitation during the 
growing season may result in catastrophic yield losses (Bushway et al., 2008). Springtime 
conditions will likely become increasingly variable over time, with late spring frosts continuing 
to pose high risks to berries. The extent of damage to berries highly depends on the type of 
cultivar. For example, a late spring frost on highbush blueberries may lead to freeze injury to 
the fruit, dieback, and winter injury to swollen flower buds, potentially leading to upwards of 
50% yield loss of crop production (Cline & Fernandez, 1998). 
Field Vegetables 
Field vegetables are grown on over 160,000 acres of Ontario farmland. Major field vegetables 
grown in Ontario include sweet corn, potatoes, green peas, tomatoes, green and wax beans, 
carrots, and pumpkins. Ontario field vegetables (excluding potatoes) gate value in 2019 was 
over $590 million (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2017c; 2019). Climate 
risks to field vegetables were evaluated across Southwest, Central and Eastern Ontario using 
representative commodities, where appropriate, such as cabbage, potatoes, and tomatoes. 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        106  
Significant regional differences were not found at the scale of assessment, and risks were 
estimated to be ‘high’ under current climate conditions and increase to ‘very high’ by the 
2080s. High risks now are being driven, in part, due to springtime conditions, as well as extreme 
precipitations and drought. 
Impacts to field vegetables are incredibly variable, and dependent on the crop grown, soil 
conditions and the intensity or duration of the climate event that occurs. Wetter conditions 
and/or extreme precipitation events (longer duration) may lead to proliferation of disease and 
would prevent growers from effectively distributing measures to fight those diseases (e.g. 
spraying). Too much rain, especially if delivered in frequent showers, causes several problems 
such as poor transplant conditions, increased seed and seedling disease, soil compaction, 
delayed or missed cultivation, and waterlogging. Extreme heat conditions may lead to reduced 
yield due to heat damage (Hatfield & Prueger, 2015) – with cabbage and some other crops (e.g. 
cauliflower, rutabaga) showing 10% yield loss for every 10 days temperatures exceeded 30°C 
during the growing season (Warland et al., 2006). Extreme heat can reduce fruit set of 
tomatoes or lessen plant development growth. Drought stress can also dominate or worsen 
heat stress to some field vegetables (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 
2021e). For example, leaf area and water content of tomato cultivars, dry weight and shoots all 
decreased when drought conditions occurred with yield declines of between 13 to 26%, 
depending on flowering and fruit development stage (Zhou et al., 2017; Cui et al., 2019). 
Similarly, potatoes are impacted by water stress and drought due to shallow root systems, with 
yield loss dependent on stage of growth (e.g. less than 5% loss during vegetative growth 
compared to over 65% yield loss if drought occurs during tuber maturation). 
Grapes  
The Niagara Peninsula is the province’s largest grape growing region, followed by Essex-Kent. 
Prince Edward County is an emerging area for grape production. Vitis vinifera types account for 
approximately 55% of Ontario’s production and the trend is increasing each year. Ontario 
produces over 85% of Canada’s domestic wines and the gate value of grapes in 2019 was over 
$112 million (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs2017c; 2019). Figure 5.3 
illustrates the regions where grapes are grown and aeras of emerging opportunity.  
Climate risks to grapes were evaluated in both Southwest and Central Ontario, recognizing that 
significant local areas are present within these regions, where impacts may be felt the most. 
Risks to grapes were determined to be ‘medium’ under current climate condition but rising in 
both regions to ‘high’ by the 2050s and to ‘very high’ by the end of the century. Depending on 
how quickly greenhouse gas emissions are mitigated, risks to grapes may not rise as 
substantially. For example, it is only under the high emissions scenario RCP8.5 in the 2080s that 
risks reach a ‘very high’ score (see Appendix 7).  
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        107  
Grape production is at risk from numerous climate drivers. For example, extreme heat in the 
growing season may lead to higher grape sugar concentrations or reduced acidity and higher 
pH; thereby increasing alcohol concentration, creating excessive bitterness and flabby tastes 
and likelihood of spoilage (Shaw, 2016). Rising temperatures can also reduce the grape harvest 
window, reduce berry size, and alter aromatics. Depending upon the grape variety grown, 
impacts may be particularly significant. Icewine production, for example, may experience total 
yield loss if a hard freeze (-8°C or colder) does not occur after ripening (Hewer, 2020). 
Winter injury to grapevines also poses risks to grapevines and is estimated to lead to 5 to 15% 
of crop loss globally each year. Spring frosts or other winter injuries can lead to extensive 
impacts, with single freeze events having historically caused total crop loss in some areas of 
Northeast U.S (Mosedale et al., 2016). Increases in seasonal precipitation or extreme 
precipitation, on the other hand, can lead to proliferation of diseases that prevent growers 
from distributing measures to fight diseases.

Greenhouse Vegetables 
Greenhouse vegetables in Ontario are grown on over 3,000 acres and include tomatoes, 
cucumbers and peppers. 2019 gate value for greenhouse vegetables was $376 million, $339 
million, and $301 million for tomatoes, cucumbers, and peppers, respectively (Ontario Ministry 
of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2014; 2019). Climate risks to greenhouse vegetables 
were assessed for Southwest, Central and Eastern Ontario given their prominence in these 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        108  
regions of the province. Assessment results indicate that risks to greenhouse vegetables and 
production now and under current climate conditions is considered ‘medium’. In the future, 
that score is expected to increase to ‘high’ by the 2050s and stay ‘high’ by the end of the 
century (2080s).  
Climate risks to greenhouse vegetables were driven by three major climate variable groups: 
extreme precipitation, high and extreme temperatures, low temperatures, as well as general 
growing-related conditions. These climate drivers can lead to yield and financial losses through 
1) increasing production time and flowering time such in the event of extreme cold (Ontario 
Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2014), 2) increased costs to heat greenhouses, 
3) increased need for temperature regulation particularly during extreme heat in the summer 
season (Hendricks, 2012), 4) impacts to growth and loss of vegetables in the event of extreme 
heat, and 5) disruption to sources and inputs required for productive growing conditions. 
Extreme heat, as an example, can lead to poor pollination and immature growth if 
temperatures are not regulated and rise above 32°C in the day or 24°C during the night (Dias et 
al., 2016). 
Tender Fruit 
Tender fruit production includes peaches and nectarines, pears, sweet and sour cherries, 
plums, and apricots. In 2019 tender fruit were grown on over 12,500 acres of land in Ontario. 
The most important tender fruit-growing area in Ontario is the Niagara Peninsula, followed by 
Essex and Kent counties and Lake Huron shoreline (Huron and Lambton counties). Ontario 
tender fruit gate value in 2019 was almost $83 million, the largest share ($27.5 million) 
attributed to peaches (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2019; Rochette 
et al., 2004). 
Climate risks to tender fruit were evaluated across Southwest, Central and Eastern Ontario – 
and no significant regional differences are expected in future risk results. Risks to tender fruit 
are currently rated as ‘high’ and expected to stay at ‘high’ risk in all future time periods. Risks 
are being driven, in part from winter injury, extreme cold and spring frost conditions. As 
temperatures rise and these impacts become less frequent, risks remain high due to the 
increasing frequency of extreme heat and extreme precipitation. Additionally, increasing 
unpredictability of low temperature (e.g. spring frosts) is expected under a changing climate, 
indicating sustained risk from low temperatures.  
Tender fruit production can be impacted in numerous ways (Rochette et al., 2004). A well-
characterized risk to tender fruit is the occurrence of late frost after Growing Degree Days have 
enabled fruit flower buds to form. A late spring frost that occurs when fruit trees are in full 
bloom can cause up to a 90% loss in yield when temperatures dip below -5°C, for less than 1-
hour in duration (SF Gates Contributor, 2021). Extreme Hot Days can cause stress to fruit trees, 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        109  
as well as workers, and make it challenging to complete orchard work on a timely basis (Ontario 
Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2021f). Peak injury is from noon until late 
afternoon each day, especially when skies are clear, although solar radiation can be high under 
cloudy conditions as well. Wetter conditions occurring into tender fruit harvest season have 
also been shown to decrease fruit sweetness. Extreme precipitation can cause physical damage 
to flowers, essential for pollination and the fruit formation process (Hunter & Slingerland, 
2008). Drought and dry conditions can slow or kill fruit tree growth, decrease fruit juiciness, 
lead to fruit doubling, cause shriveling, reduced root growth and decreased pollen viability. 
Drought causing severe stress over 10 days, particularly in the early season is problematic and 
can lead to reduced maturity and moderate yield loss.

Indirect Impacts 
The following section provides several indirect impacts specifically relevant to fruit and 
vegetable production; however, many of the indirect impacts already described for field crops 
(see Section 5.7.1) are also relevant to fruit and vegetable growers (e.g. soil health, nutrients 
management, invasive species and pests, and water supply). It is critical to acknowledge that 
just because risk scoring has not been assigned for indirect impacts, it does not imply they are 
less impactful. In many cases, insufficient quantitative data exists to evaluate quantitative risks 
based upon these indirect or cascading impacts to fruits and vegetables. 
Limits to water availability, notably in the context of areas that have high irrigation 
requirements, will lead to impacts on fruits and vegetable growers. This may be particularly 
exacerbated during hot summers where low flow conditions are observed, which can lead to 
increased proliferation or presence of pathogens after water contact and before consumption 
(FAO and WHO, 2021; US EPA, 2022). Climate change can affect waterborne pathogens through 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        111  
changes in precipitation and runoff, driving the transport of fecal waste and nutrients to 
waterbodies where irrigation may be sourced, as well as through changes in sunlight, air 
temperature and evaporation, moisture conditions, salinity, and other factors (US EPA, 2022). 
Historically from 1910 through 2010, climate events have been linked to the occurrence of 
numerous waterborne disease outbreaks – particularly due to heavy rainfall and flooding (US 
EPA, 2022). As an example, in Ontario, in 2000, heavy rainfall (134mm) between May 8 and 12 
resulted in surface runoff containing pathogens from manure to enter a well supplying drinking 
water and resulted in seven deaths and 2,300 ill residents (Salvadori et al., 2009).  
Not all fruit and vegetable growers may experience climate impacts to the same extent. For 
example, if fruit trees are impacted or damaged to the point where they are unable to produce 
fruit, impacts could be felt over several years rather than only be reflective of financial loss 
within one year. Similarly, combined weather events or prolonged drought (e.g. multi-year 
agricultural drought) could lead to impacts to soil quality and materials and reduce yields over a 
longer period of time.  
Indirect impacts are also important on greenhouse production. As described earlier, 
greenhouse production comprises a significant portion of vegetable production across Ontario. 
These systems rely on critical inputs such as power supply, water supply, nutrients, and 
cultivated varieties, among others. If infrastructure systems (e.g. electrical distribution lines) fail 
due to extreme weather events or overloading during summer months, producers may be 
unable to regulate temperatures and conditions inside the greenhouse. This is particularly 
problematic during extreme heat or summer months when temperature regulation is critical for 
growth. 
Climate change impacts on honeybee colonies and other pollinators include rising air 
temperatures, shifting growing seasons, extreme weather and drought which disrupt plant 
flowering (Cox-Foster, 2021). Increasing temperatures will create conditions when pollinator 
species’ thermal limits are exceeded and result in range and timing shifts (Soroye et al., 2020, 
Sirois-Delisle & Kerr, 2018; Kerr et al., 2015). Climate change may also compound other impacts 
on honeybees and other pollinators. Invasive pests will drive additional use of some pesticides 
which remove floral resources and result in reduced reproduction, impact memory and 
navigation and possibly death (Aoun, 2020). Pollination, as a regulating ecosystem service, is 
further described and characterized in the Natural Environment Area of Focus (Section 7.0).  
The noted impacts translate into significant risks for crops relying upon pollinators for healthy 
production. In Ontario, 32 crops such as field orchard fruit (apples, peaches, cherries), berries 
(blueberries, strawberries, cranberries), nuts, oilseed crops and some field crops (e.g. 
cucumber, tomato, pumpkin, squash, etc.) are pollinated by bees and other animals (Terpstra, 
2017). Fruit and seed yields increase, and in some cases the fruit is of higher quality, when 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        112  
many bee species are present, whether in undisturbed ecosystems or in managed production 
areas (Cox-Foster, 2021). A study completed in the western U.S. (Young, 2016) found that 
changing climate conditions between 2011 and 2015 resulted in a five-week shift for peak 
plant-pollinator interactions with the result being a drop in median flower abundance of 68%. 
These findings reinforce the importance of cultivating a diverse set of wild bee species for 
agriculture, as diversity helps build resiliency to climate impacts (Young, 2016). In Ontario, 
many growers invest in beehive rentals to achieve better pollination and work closely with 
beekeepers to keep pollinators healthy (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 
2014). 
5.7.3 Livestock  
Overview 
Livestock production in Ontario was assessed as a Level 1 category under the Food and 
Agriculture Area of Focus. Major types of livestock in the province include dairy and beef cattle, 
pigs, sheep, and poultry which are present in commercial farming operations in all regions of 
the province except the Far North (Statistics Canada, 2022a).  
Research suggests that warmer temperatures could be beneficial for livestock production in 
Ontario, resulting in longer growing and grazing seasons, increased availability of quality feed 
throughout the year, and lower energy costs (Morand et al., 2017). The changing climate may 
also introduce new or accentuate existing risks to livestock production, most importantly heat 
stress. Different types and breeds of livestock respond differently to temperature and 
precipitation conditions throughout their life cycles, some exhibiting higher sensitivity, and as a 
result greater mortality, decreased growth and reduced fertility (Bernabucci, 2019).  
This impact assessment has identified extreme temperatures, drought conditions and low 
temperatures as the main drivers of direct risks to livestock production, with regional 
differences contributing to the magnitude of risks. Risks for livestock that are predominantly 
raised indoors (poultry and swine) are largely driven by extreme heat and low temperatures 
that impact conditions in barns as well as during transportation between farms and to 
abattoirs. Importantly, livestock are also affected by the changing climate indirectly, through 
impacts on pasture, forages and water supply, as well as farm infrastructure.  
Direct Impacts 
The assessment has drawn on research, literature, and census data to inform scenario 
development and consequence scoring related to direct climate risks on livestock production. 
Quantitative risk scores for direct risks that were assessed for Level 2 livestock categories are 
discussed below for Beef, Dairy, Sheep, Swine, and Poultry and Eggs. In total, over 240 separate 
risk interactions were assessed, with each scenario considering how climate variables may lead 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        113  
to impacts on each Level 2 category. Every scenario was evaluated under current and future 
(2050s and 2080s) timeframes.  
For ruminant livestock (beef and dairy cattle, sheep) extreme heat, low temperatures and 
drought are important climate variable groups driving current and future risks across the 
province. Wildfire is a significant risk factor in Northeastern and Northwestern regions of the 
province, for current and, increasingly, future time frames. For future scenarios, risks attributed 
to low temperatures are expected to decrease, while risks driven by extreme heat and drought 
conditions are anticipated to increase. 
Table 5.8 provides example risk scenarios for this Level 1 category. Notably, these are meant to 
be illustrative examples of the types of scenarios assessed and are non-exhaustive. A more 
detailed risk characterization and a description of risk drivers are provided in the section below.  
Further detail on the risk profiles relevant to this category, with more information on how the 
magnitude of the risks vary by region and timeframe (operating under RCP8.5) is provided in 
Table 5.9, at the end of the section. Appendix 7 provides risk scores for both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 
emission scenarios.

heat stress in sows and finishers, reducing meat quality and 
causing animal losses on arrival and in transit. 
High 
Poultry 
and eggs 
High air temperatures (over 27°C), lasting three to seven days. 
Egg farmers can expect to see a one percent drop in production 
for every one-degree increase in temperature above the optimal 
temperature of 23°C. For every degree above 24°C a drop of one 
percentage point in production can be expected in breeders and 
the hens will never fully recover. Broilers, particularly older, 
heavier ones, will experience over 30% decreases in daily weight 
gain. Production will usually stay one or two per cent below 
normal after heat stress. Increases in susceptibility to disease will 
be present in all poultry types. 
Medium 
 
Dairy  
Dairy cattle in Ontario are raised on nearly 3,800 farms engaged in breeding, raising, and 
handling of dairy calves, heifers and cows (Statistics Canada, 2022b). The total number of dairy 
cattle in the province is over 485,000 animals (Statistics Canada, 2022b). Dairy products 
generate close to $2 billion in market receipts and are Ontario’s top agricultural commodity 
(Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2016d). Similar to beef cattle, the 
majority of beef farms are located in the Southwest region, followed by Eastern, Central, 
Northeast and Northwest regions (Statistics Canada, 2022b). 
Extreme heat has been identified as the most relevant climate variable for dairy cows in 
Ontario. Dairy cows are particularly sensitive to high air temperatures due to additional 
metabolic heat generated during lactation. Exposure to heat over 32°C results in heat stress 
causing impacts such as reduced feed intake, lower milk yields (12 kg/day per cow), and 
reproductive problems (e.g. 26% lower conception rate), impacting farm revenue and timing of 
operations such as calving (West et al., 2003; Campos and Schenkel, 2017). Additionally, heat 
stress compromises cows’ immune systems, making them vulnerable to disease, while extreme 
levels of heat stress result in an increased likelihood of mortality (27% greater mortality rate 
compared to a period with no heat stress) (Bishop-Williams et al., 2015). Carryover effects of 
stress are known to persist even after the heatwave ends.  
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        115  
Risk to dairy cattle is found to increase from ‘medium’ at present to ‘high’ by the 2050s and 
remain at that level in 2080s (operating under RCP8.5), in Southwest, Central and Eastern 
regions. In Northeast and Northwest Ontario risk to dairy cattle is ‘medium’ at present and in 
the middle of the century, increasing to ‘high’ by the 2080s. 
Beef 
Beef cattle in Ontario are raised on over 12,500 farms including nearly 8,000 cow-calf and 
feedlot operations engaged in breeding and handling of over 1.1 million beef cattle (Statistics 
Canada, 2022b). Farm gate sales revenue of Ontario’s beef industry is almost $1.4 billion, with 
processing and retail revenue of $3.5 and $9 billion, respectively (Beef Farmers of Ontario, 
2018). The majority of beef farms are located in the Southwestern region, followed by Eastern, 
Central, Northeastern and Northwestern regions (Statistics Canada, 2022b). 
In this assessment high and extreme temperatures have been identified as one of the key 
hazards for beef cattle. Extreme heat results in heat stress and leads to reduced feed intake and 
compromised weight gains, changes in grazing patterns, increased water intake, higher 
respiration and heart rates, and causes illness and, in severe cases, even death in beef cattle 
(Brown-Brandl, 2018). Other consequences of heat stress include reduced productivity and 
fertility, lower birth weight and compromised immune systems (Macey et al., 2009). Prolonged 
heatwaves, particularly early in the summer season, before cattle have had a chance to 
acclimate to hot conditions are especially impactful. Quantification of effects is complicated by 
breed differences and other factors, with calves, animals with dark hides (e.g. Angus cattle), 
compromised immune systems, more fat cover being the most vulnerable, especially in cases 
when adequate feeding, hygiene and housing requirements are not fully satisfied (National 
Farm Animal Care Council, 2013a). 
Overall risk to beef cattle is found to increase from ‘medium’ at present to ‘high’ by the 2050s 
and remain at that level in 2080s (operating under RCP8.5), in Southwest, Central and Eastern 
regions, with consistent ‘medium’ level of risk in Northeast and Northwest Ontario throughout 
the century. 
Sheep  
Ontario’s 322,000 sheep are raised on nearly 2,800 farms, representing sheep, lamb and wool 
industries (Statistics Canada, 2022c). The largest number of sheep farms are located in 
Southwestern Ontario (predominantly in Grey, Bruce, Huron and Wellington counties). Farm 
cash receipts for Ontario’s sheep sector were $73.7 million in 2016, coming from meat and 
wool sales (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2017b).  
In this assessment prolonged drought conditions over the growing season are the key climate 
driver for grazing sheep in Ontario. Dry spring and early summer conditions result in soil-
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        116  
Moisture Deficit, lower-quality feed and pasture losses (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food 
and Rural Affairs, 2016b). Drought-struck sheep face limited grazing opportunities, and develop 
abnormal eating habits, facing malnutrition, low immunity, germ recrudescence, and amplified 
effects of parasites and infectious diseases (Court, 2007). Inability to provide adequate feed and 
ample water to sheep can lead to buying over-priced feed or culling or prematurely selling 
livestock at low prices (Ding et al., 2011). Regions with low water-holding capacity soils are 
particularly vulnerable to drought, with long-lasting multi-year impacts and increased costs for 
sheep farmers.  
Sheep are very resilient and can thrive in different climate and weather conditions, provided 
adequate heat and cold abatement measures are in place (National Farm Animal Care Council, 
2013b). Climate-related risk for sheep is found to be ‘medium’ at present and expected to 
remain at that level in the 2050s and 2080s (operating under RCP8.5), in all regions. 
Swine  
The swine sector in Ontario includes farming operations engaged in breeding and handling of 
pigs. In 2021 there were over four million pigs managed on 2,437 farms, with the annual 
number of marketed pigs of over 5,400,000 (Statistics Canada, 2022d). Southwest Ontario 
(primarily Perth, Huron and Wellington/Dufferin and Oxford counties) is the center of Ontario’s 
swine industry, both in terms of the number of farms and the number of animals raised. Farm 
cash receipts for Ontario’s swine sector were $1.12 billion in 2016 (Ontario Ministry of 
Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2017b). 
In this assessment high and extreme temperatures have been identified as one of the key 
hazards for swine. Pigs have the lowest heat tolerance compared to other livestock (with 
comfortable range between 18°C and 24°C), therefore the impacts of high air temperatures are 
very pronounced, both in indoor and outdoor farming systems (Ross et al., 2015). Impacts of 
heat stress on pigs depend on their age, weight and genetics and include compromised 
production efficiency (especially in high-yielding breeds), reduced and inconsistent growth, 
decreased feed efficiency, poor sow performance, and increased mortality (Mayorga et al., 
2019). Most pigs in Ontario are raised in indoor operations and face adverse weather 
conditions directly during transportation to new facilities or for slaughter. Transportation on 
days with high air temperatures (over 26°C) can result in high levels of heat stress, animal 
fatigue, elevated heart rates, reduced meat quality, injuries and death (Brockhoff et al., 2018; 
Rioja-Lang et al., 2019).  
Risk to swine is found to increase from ‘medium’ at present to ‘high’ by the 2050s and remain 
at that level in 2080s (operating under RCP8.5), in Southwest, Central and Eastern regions. In 
Northeast and Northwest Ontario risk to swine is ‘medium’ at present and in the middle of the 
century, increasing to ‘high’ by the 2080s. 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        117  
Poultry and Eggs 
The poultry and eggs sector in Ontario includes farming operations engaged in breeding and 
handling of chickens, ducks, turkeys and gamebirds. Chickens and ducks can be a source of 
eggs, meat or both; turkeys and gamebirds are raised for meat. In 2021 there were over 
53,800,000 chickens (laying hens, pullets, broilers and roasters) and 2,453,000 turkeys managed 
on 8,051 and 1,816 farms, respectively (Statistics Canada, 2022e). Farm cash receipts for 
Ontario’s poultry sector (chicken, eggs and turkeys) were over $1.6 billion in 2019 (Ontario 
Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2017b). 
In this assessment high and extreme temperatures have been identified as one of the key 
hazards for poultry. Hot weather conditions have significant impacts on poultry, including 
reduced growth, egg production and size, and shell density (Saeed et al., 2019; Ward et al., 
2020). Birds experiencing heat stress have increased susceptibility to diseases, repressed 
reproduction, decreased hatchability of embryos, hormonal imbalance and tissue damage, with 
severe heat stress leading to high mortality rates (Kinsley, 2008). Temperatures over 27°C and 
especially 30°C are particularly harmful to poultry stock, with heat-related impacts exacerbated 
by high humidity and other environmental factors such as increased bird density, feed and/or 
water deprivation, inadequate ventilation, vaccine reaction and the presence of diseases or 
parasites (National Farm Animal Care Council, 2016; 2017). 
Risk to poultry and eggs is found to increase from ‘medium’ at present to ‘high’ by the 2050s 
and remain at that level in 2080s (operating under RCP8.5), in Southwest, Central and Eastern 
regions. In Northeast and Northwest Ontario risk to poultry and eggs is ‘medium’ at present 
and in the middle of the century, increasing to ‘high’ by the 2080s (see Table 5.9).

Indirect Impacts 
Risk scores in Table 5.9 are attributed to direct impacts discussed above and do not reflect 
indirect effects associated with climate change impacts on field crops, soil health, water quality 
and quantity, and damage to critical farm and rural infrastructure. Consequently, it is important 
to be aware of a certain degree of underestimation in Level 2 risks and consider additional 
climate-related pressures to livestock production, as discussed below. 
 
It is recognized that the impacts of climate change on water quality and supply will have distinct 
effects on livestock production through changes in water availability for livestock watering, 
evaporative cooling, and hygiene maintenance (Ding et al., 2011). Extreme rainfall events and 
terrestrial run-off from surrounding agricultural lands can increase sources of contamination in 
adjacent and downstream watersheds, including ones used by grazing livestock for drinking. 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        119  
Drought and extreme heat can contribute to decreased water availability, in part due to 
competition with other sector and industry uses (Thornton et al., 2009).  
Feedstock quality and quantity affected by extreme temperature and precipitation events, 
drought and wildfire can lead to animal health and welfare concerns for grazing animals as well 
as livestock housed indoors (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2016a; 
2016b). Declining pasture productivity as a result of drought conditions can lead to lowered 
immunity, ingestion of poisonous plants, dirt and sand by grazing animals (Rojas-Downing et al., 
2017). Extreme precipitation can result in overly wet pastures or flooding, impacting grass 
growth and available grazing areas for cattle and sheep (Kyle, 2016). Increased temperature 
and moisture availability can impact the quality of feed crops and forages through variations in 
concentrations of water-soluble carbohydrates and nitrogen (Rojas-Downing et al., 2017), 
reducing digestibility and decreased nutrient availability for livestock swine (Thornton et al., 
2009; Polley et al, 2013). This in turn would result in lower weight gains, decreased fertility and 
milk production in ruminants and.  
Climate change, particularly higher temperatures and increases in precipitation variability affect 
the distribution and amplify the effects of parasites and infectious diseases in livestock (Rojas-
Downing et al., 2017). Higher temperatures and increased humidity increase the rate of 
development of parasites and pathogens (e.g. listeria and salmonella), while flooding often 
provides favourable conditions for the development of water-borne diseases (CIAT, 2014). 
Changes in rainfall and temperature regimes as well as the frequency of extreme events may 
affect both the distribution and the abundance of disease vectors such as flies, ticks and 
mosquitoes (CIAT, 2014). Impacts to livestock health by spreading parasites, pathogens and 
diseases are particularly significant in extreme heat, drought and flooding conditions, all of 
which contribute to lowered immunity and increased susceptibility to disease (Martin and 
Noecker, 2006; Schoenian, 2018).  
Heavy precipitation and other extreme events cause concerns to the livestock sector due to 
their impacts on electricity supply and transportation infrastructure. Power outages are a 
serious issue due to disruptions in electricity supply for critical purposes such as maintaining 
temperature in barns, milking equipment operation and more (Chang et al., 2007). Additionally, 
the ability to transport livestock to farms, abattoirs and other facilities can be inhibited due to 
impacts of extreme weather events to transportation infrastructure, resulting in animal distress 
and financial losses to producers. 
5.8 Climate Change Opportunities 
Within this assessment, no Level 1 or 2 risk scores within Food and Agriculture decreased under 
a changing climate. In other words, climate interactions with increasing risk scores (e.g. 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        120  
extreme heat) outweighed any interaction that exhibited stable or declining risk scores (e.g. 
extreme cold) under this Area of Focus. In addition, the PCCIA Methodology Framework 
(External Resource – 1) adopts an approach of assessing the ‘Most-Probable Worst-Case Event’ 
for each interaction, meaning that potential opportunities or benefits within the sector may be 
understated within the quantitative assessment, as noted below.  
Research indicates that the influence of a changing climate may have certain benefits for 
agricultural production in Ontario. Increased growing season length and available heat units 
have been found to present opportunity for not only regional expansion, but also for 
commodity types grown across Ontario. Warming temperatures may enable new and higher-
yielding varieties to be grown across the province, where historical or current climate 
conditions have not been suitable (Qian et al., 2018; 2019; He et al., 2018). The caveat with 
earlier planting dates is that there may be an increased risk related to crop damage, failure and 
losses associated with unpredictable late frost events. As noted throughout Section 5.0, 
lengthened growing seasons and changing moisture patterns can increase the frequency and 
prevalence of pest and disease outbreaks for several commodity types (Baute, 2020; Ontario 
Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2020b). Therefore, the potential favourable 
conditions associated with extended growing seasons and available heat units in Ontario are 
accompanied by considerable risks and potential losses.  
Northern expansion of agricultural production is another potential opportunity associated with 
a warming climate and is well documented throughout literature (Ontario Ministry of 
Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs,2021d; Robinson et al., 2020; Morand et al., 2017). Several 
studies in Ontario have found that climate change could present opportunities for the sector 
through longer growing seasons, increasing Growing Degree Days and available crop heat units 
(Morand et al., 2017; Qian et al., 2019). Crop production in northern regions of the province has 
previously been constrained by land suitability, inadequate drainage, and climate conditions. 
With increasing annual temperatures and available crop heat units, some northern regions of 
the province may experience opportunities related to agricultural expansion. Specifically, 
warming climate conditions have been projected to increase agricultural productivity across the 
Great Clay Belt in the Northeast region of Ontario (Robinson et al., 2020; Apostoli, 2021; 
Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2021d). However, several socio-
economic related barriers (e.g. infrastructure requirements, market access, policy and financial 
support, labour supply, low diversity in commodities etc.) have been identified as impeding 
expected agricultural expansion in the northern regions of the province (Apostoli, 2021; 
Chapagain, 2017). If capacity increases across northern Ontario (e.g. investment in 
infrastructure, tile drainage etc.), existing barriers may be overcome, and northern regions may 
experience opportunities related to lengthened growing seasons and increased commodity 
diversity (Apostoli, 2021; Chapagain, 2017).

5.9 Adaptive Capacity 
5.9.1 Adaptive Capacity Summary  
While Ontario’s food and agricultural sector is intrinsically adaptive, changing climate 
conditions are challenging the sector’s ability to adapt to emerging and intensified climate 
impacts and risks. Adaptive Capacity for the Food and Agriculture Area of Focus was evaluated 
across four over-arching categories: 1) technology 2) availability of resources, 3) governance 
measures, and 4) sector complexity (see Section 2.4.4 for definitions).  
Overall, the Adaptive Capacity for each Level 1 category across the Food and Agriculture Area of 
Focus is rated as ‘medium’ (see Table 5.10). Building Adaptive Capacity across the four over-
arching categories will help to strengthen the sector’s ability to adjust and respond to changing 
conditions over time.

5.9.2 Technology  
Adaptive Capacity within the Technology category is rated as ‘high’ across all Level 1 categories. 
The agricultural sector is known for adopting new technologies to assist with production and 
productivity. For example, technological advancements in the sector include GPS guidance and 
drone technology, advanced drainage and irrigation systems, and precision machinery and 
technologies (Eyzaguirre and Warren, 2014; Dias et al., 2016). Additionally, crop and livestock 
genetic research and diversification is another technological advancement that can build 
significant capacity to address future climate-related impacts (Rojas-Downing et al., 2017; 
National Farm Animal Care Council, 2013a).  
 
6 Note these scores do not consider geographic location within the province. Please see Appendix 11 for 
regional Adaptive Capacity ratings. 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        122  
The technology category of Adaptive Capacity also includes sectoral best practices and 
planning. On-farm infrastructure, technology and best practices influence the capacity of 
individual operations a significant amount. Producers implement adaptive measures regularly 
and seek new technologies to better manage on-site climate risks. These include irrigation and 
drainage optimization systems, water metering, soil conservation practices (e.g. tillage 
practices, crop rotation, cover cropping etc.), pest management practices (fertilizer and 
pesticide applications, scouting etc.), adaptive management (e.g. adjusting the timing of 
cropping operations etc.), and the selection of resilient cultivars and species (e.g. considering 
potential changes in lodging, disease and pest resistance, drought tolerance etc.) (Reid et al., 
2007; Comer et al., 2017).  
It should be noted that some of the technological adaptations may require significant 
improvements of infrastructure, such as greenhouse facilities, water sourcing and energy 
systems. These improvements have time and cost implications for shared and province-wide 
delivery of key infrastructure and equipment. 
5.9.3 Resource Availability 
Human, financial, and natural resources available to Ontario’s agriculture producers are an 
important component of Adaptive Capacity. Resource Availability is ranked at a ‘medium’ 
Adaptive Capacity across this Area of Focus. From a financial resource perspective, the 
Canadian Agricultural Partnership (CAP) is a five-year (2018 – 2023), $3 billion investment 
program by federal, provincial, and territorial (FPT) governments that is a significant financial 
support mechanism used to strengthen and grow agricultural and agri-food sector. Although 
the CAP does not offer dedicated funding for adaptation actions, it includes climate change as 
one of its six priority areas at the national level, with opportunities of covering costs for 
research initiatives and programs around building climate resilience across the sector 
(Government of Canada, 2018; Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2022a). 
Additionally, Agricorp, an agency of the Government of Ontario, delivers several business risk 
management programs (e.g. AgriStability), to support Ontario’s agriculture producers by 
offsetting financial losses and protecting producers from large margin declines caused by any 
combination of production losses, adverse market conditions, or increased production costs 
(ArgiCorp, 2020).  
The Canada-Ontario Environmental Farm Plan program is another resource available to farmers 
to offer guidance (though no financial assistance) to complete risk assessments and develop 
and implement action plans for addressing environmental issues relevant to their farms 
(Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2022b).  
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        123  
On-farm financial adaptation strategies, to an extent, have been identified, such as carrying 
reserves (e.g. planning for bad years in advance by stocking away funds during good years), and 
diversifying revenues and taking advantage of on-farm tourism or farmer’s markets in urban 
and semi-urban communities (Brklacich & Woodrow, 2016; OCCIAR, 2011). Nevertheless, 
financial limitations have been cited as a barrier to adaptation in Ontario and the ability of 
farmers to Invest in new technology or to re-tool for switching production or commodities in 
support of adaptive efforts (Wall et al., 2007; Reid et al., 2007).  
From a human resources standpoint, the average number of farmers and labour supply has 
been declining in Ontario over recent years (Apostoli, 2021; Brklacich and Woodrow, 2016). 
Labour shortages, limited expertise, and low interest in agriculture education are cited as major 
social barriers for the sector (Apostoli, 2021; Chapagain, 2017). To support growth and build 
skills and expertise across the sector, OMAFRA offers workshops, resources, and e-Learning 
opportunities at no cost for the agri-food and agri-products sectors on a number of important 
best management practices and issues (e.g. growing farm profits, biosecurity, food safety) 
(Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2021b).  
Natural resources and related ecosystem services (e.g. flood and erosion control, water filtering 
etc.), play a vital role in agriculture operations and productivity. Increased protection and 
conservation of ecosystems, especially in southern regions of the province with increasing 
urban development pressures, is imperative for increasing capacity across farming 
infrastructure, technology, and operations to better cope with emerging climate risks (Ontario 
Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2021b; Harris et al., 2016).  
5.9.4 Governance 
Governance was rated at a ‘medium’ capacity level across the three Level 1 categories of this 
Area of Focus. Several governance mechanisms, policies and institutions exist to support 
agricultural production in Ontario. Climate adaptation activities include long-term planning for 
potential water shortages, monitoring and surveillance programs for emerging crop and animal 
diseases and pests, supporting research into business risk management approaches, and 
enabling demand-driven knowledge transformation and transfer (KTT) through synthesis, 
exchange, dissemination, dialogue, collaboration and brokering among researchers and farmers 
(Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2021c). 
Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food 
and Rural Affairs) has funded several climate change related research projects in Ontario and 
provides online resources on how climate change may impact the agricultural sector (Ontario 
Agri-Food Innovation Alliance, 2022). Additionally, the Ontario Federation of Agriculture (OFA) 
has taken an official position on climate change, recognizing its impacts and the urgency for 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        124  
policies and programs to enable effective adaptation (OFA, 2020). Depending upon the region, 
various policies and programs exist that could enable adaptation measures, such as 
Conservation Authorities’ rural water quality programs and land protection designations. 
However, competing land-use priorities, particularly in the high-density regions of the province 
(e.g. Central and Southwest regions) present capacity constraints for the agriculture sector. 
Other important actions under governance include conducting regional-wide risk and 
opportunity assessments and developing regional scale adaptation plans (Belliveau, et al., 
2006).  
It is important to acknowledge that further cooperation and coordination between levels of 
government and institutions is required to advance adaptation efforts from the planning phases 
to implementation. Increased uptake and support of adaptation measures is required to build 
widespread climate resilience across field crop, fruit and vegetable and livestock producers in 
Ontario. Advancing the understanding of farmers’ perceptions and integrating them in policy 
development could help to further improve widespread adaptation efforts across the sector. In 
addition, a comprehensive view of costs, time, and effort associated with adaptation required 
from the producer should be included to supportive policy frameworks to maintain sustainable 
production systems (Comer et al., 2017; Morand et al., 2017; Reid et al., 2007). 
5.9.5 Sector Complexity 
The final category of Adaptive Capacity assessed for this Area of Focus was Sector Complexity. 
This category was rated at a ‘low’ capacity level across all three Level 1 categories. Ontario’s 
agriculture sector involves several key players and is influenced by complex external and 
internal forces. Commodity prices, financial markets, available technologies, health and safety 
regulations and institutional support all contribute to adaptation decisions and affect overall 
Adaptive Capacity (ArgiCorp, 2019). There are different levels of control over certain 
adaptations with some available for implementation at the decision of a single operator, and 
others being shaped by multiple stakeholders in farming, government and elsewhere (Belliveau, 
et al., 2006; Red et al., 2007; Comer et al., 2017). The sector is highly complex, resulting in a 
‘low’ Adaptive Capacity ranking across all Level 1 categories under this Area of Focus.  
5.10 Climate Adaptation Priorities 
Within the PCCIA, current and emerging adaptation priorities with a relatively higher risk, and 
lower Adaptive Capacity were identified for each Area of Focus. In the context of the PCCIA, an 
adaptation priority is defined as any Level 1 or 2 category in a given region that has an Adaptive 
Capacity of ‘medium’ or lower and a risk score of ‘high’ or greater (see Appendix 12 for 
combined Level 1 and regional Adaptive Capacity ratings). 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        125  
Each of the three Level 1 categories included under this Area of Focus have a ‘medium’ 
Adaptive Capacity, based upon considerations for technology, resource availability, governance, 
and sector complexity. When combining this with the regional Adaptive Capacity ratings, 
Central, Northeast and Northwest regions are found to have the greatest capacity constraints. 
This section provides further details on current and emerging adaptation priorities for the Food 
and Agriculture Area of Focus, considering levels of capacity and current and future risk scores. 
Current Adaptation Priorities 
There are a number of adaptation priorities that emerged for the current timeframe that relate 
to Level 1 and 2 categories of ‘high risk’ with corresponding ‘medium’ levels of Adaptive 
Capacity. The regional priorities are driven mainly by variances in regional Adaptive Capacity 
and the existing coverage of Level 2 commodities relative to each region. The current climate 
resilience priorities are summarized in Table 5.11.

Based on the results of current risk and Adaptive Capacity (by Level 1 and region), several field 
crops and fruit and vegetable Level 2 commodities are identified as current resilience priorities. 
The high risk ranking across these Level 2 categories are driven by production losses associated 
with Extreme Hot Days, Degree Days <0°C (low temperature), Moisture Deficit and Extreme 
Precipitation Events (shorter term).

Emerging Adaptation Priorities 
Looking into the future, there are a number of emerging priorities under this Area of Focus by 
mid-century (see Table 5.12). These include the remaining field crop commodities (cereals, 
canola and forages) and greenhouse vegetables are considered to be emerging adaptation 
priorities for mid-century. In addition, livestock Level 2 categories, including beef, dairy, poultry 
and eggs, and swine are also emerging priorities in Central Ontario, with risk scores in 
Northeast and Northwest remaining as ‘medium’ in the 2050s. Grapes under the Fruit and 
Vegetables Level 1 category is not considered an emerging adaptation priority based on the 
capacity associated with the regions it was assessed for (Southwest and Eastern) (see Appendix 
11 and 12 for regional and combined Adaptive Capacity ratings). The final Level 2 category 
under this Area of Focus, that is not considered a current or emerging adaptation priority is 
sheep production. This Level 2 category is relatively resilient to current and changing climate 
conditions, resulting in lower associated risks.

Advancing Adaptation  
On-farm capacity plays a major role in the resilience of these field crop, fruit and vegetable and 
livestock Level 2 categories. The following on-farm practices can significantly increase on-farm 
capacity to respond to, and cope with climate-related risks:  
- 
Selection of cultivars with resistance and tolerance to extreme climate conditions (e.g. 
drought conditions) 
- 
Participating in production insurance programs where available (e.g. Agricorp) 
- 
Growing more than one variety to help spread crop failure risk 
- 
Disease and pest management practices (e.g. scouting; herbicide and fertilizer 
applications) 
- 
Covering crops and no-till for soil health and conservation practices 
- 
Tile drainage and controlled tile drainage 
- 
Crop and pasture rotation 
- 
Increase implementation of irrigation, fertilizer, pesticides, or fungicides 
- 
Physical barriers (e.g. wind breaks, buffer strips) 
- 
Retrofitting facilities and infrastructure (e.g. capacity of in barns, storage buildings) 
- 
Changes in planting or harvesting dates, and proper monitoring and adaptive 
management techniques  
With increasing climate risks to agriculture production, coupled with increased growth and 
intensification projected for Ontario, urban farming systems have been identified as an 
opportunity to increase productivity, support food security, minimize land requirements and 
increase climate resilience. Research on urban gardens (e.g. container, community, and 
rooftop) and vertical agricultural in southern Ontario has been advancing in recent years, where 
solutions for future food production can be demonstrated through utilizing urban spaces for 
producing various types of commodities (Durham Region, 2021; Waterloo Region, 2020; City of 
Toronto, 2012; TRCA, 2020).  
Vertical farming is on the rise in Ontario, with six vertical farms operating in the province, 
making up half of vertical farm operations in Canada (Greenbelt Foundation, 2020). Vertical 
farming offers controlled climate conditions, biosecurity, pest protection and reduced input 
requirements for food production in the future (Benke and Tomkins, 2017). However, it should 
be noted that greenhouse food production is still at risk from climate change (as described in 
Section 5.7.2). The energy supply required for vertical farming operations is significant and 
could have maladaptive outcomes if energy sources are carbon intensive (e.g. the expansion of 
operations could result in increased greenhouse gas emissions). Research is still emerging on 
vertical farming, with a better understanding of regulatory frameworks required to support 
expansion in Ontario (Greenbelt Foundation, 2020). Overall, the expansion of urban or vertical 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        128  
farming operations cannot begin to substitute existing agricultural production outputs across 
the province, highlighting the requirement for on-farm adaptation practices and supporting 
measures. 
The PCCIA Adaptation Best Practices (ABP) Report (External Resource – 2) includes adaptation 
options for food and agriculture, based on the identified adaptation priorities. A high-level 
summary is provided in Table 5.13. The PCCIA ABP Report provides more detail on specific

6.0 Infrastructure Area of Focus 
6.1 Overview  
In recent years, Ontario has experienced the impact of infrastructure failures 
related to extreme weather and changing climate conditions. It has become clear that climate-
related impacts on infrastructure are complex, with interdependencies existing between and 
across different infrastructure systems, including transportation, energy, water, and 
telecommunications.  
This impact assessment finds that all infrastructure across Ontario face climate risk. In fact, not 
a single asset included in this assessment is considered to have a risk less than ‘medium’ under 
current climate conditions. In many regions and for several Level 1 and 2 categories, the level of 
risk is expected to rise in the future (see Table 6.1). These results can be used as a foundation 
for informing adaptation efforts made to improve the resilience of infrastructure assets across 
Ontario and help mitigate the identified climate risks and the associated cascading impacts.

 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        131  
In addition, the interconnectedness of Ontario’s infrastructure sector with economic and social 
systems introduces a layer of complexity that was not quantitatively assessed or reflected in 
the risk profiles for infrastructure. This is crucial to consider when reviewing the results, as 
there are known interdependencies and numerous indirect and cascading impacts that can 
occur within, between and outside of Ontario’s infrastructure systems that exacerbate climate 
risks.  
6.2 Ontario’s Infrastructure 
Ontario’s infrastructure underpins people’s ability to live, work, play, and remain connected 
within and outside of the province. Ontario’s infrastructure is significant to both Ontario and 
Canada. According to the Financial Accountability Office of Ontario (FAO), the Government of 
Ontario owns an estimated 38% of public infrastructure across the province, municipalities own 
52%, and the Federal Government owns 10 % (Financial Accountability Office of Ontario, 2020). 
This report estimates that municipal-owned infrastructure has a current replacement value10 of 
$484.2 billion, with roads, bridges, water, storm and wastewater infrastructure accounting for 
approximately 82%. Provincial-owned infrastructure across Ontario has a current replacement 
value of $265.6 billion, with highways, bridges, schools, and hospitals accounting or 
approximately 80% (Financial Accountability Office of Ontario, 2020)11. 
Through an evaluation of the condition of close to 90% of assets in Ontario, it is estimated that 
approximately 34.7% of provincial assets and 45.3 % of municipal assets are not in a good state 
of repair (Financial Accountability Office of Ontario, 2020; 2021a). As such, the Financial 
Accountability Office of Ontario (FAO) estimated the cost to bring Ontario’s assets into a state 
of good repair (infrastructure backlog) to be $16.8 billion for provincial assets and $52.1 billion 
for municipal assets. However, there is uncertainty about the precise condition of many 
municipal assets. The FAO estimates that the municipal infrastructure backlog could range from 
$45 billion to $59 billion (Financial Accountability Office of Ontario, 2021a). 
In 2022, Statistics Canada estimated that Ontario holds approximately 33% of all of Canada’s 
infrastructure assets (Statistics Canada, 2022f). Of this amount, the top three largest industries 
in terms of asset dollars include Institutional Buildings, Transportation Infrastructure, and 
Electrical Power Infrastructure, together accounting for approximately 70% of the total assets 
(Statistics Canada, 2022f).  
 
10 A measure of the cost of rebuilding assets with an equivalent capacity, functionality, and 
performance. 
11 It should be noted that the FAO does not include details on infrastructure assets that are not entirely 
owned by the Province or municipalities and as such does not include certain assets, such as energy 
infrastructure. Consequently, the noted report does not include all critical infrastructure systems. 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        132  
Future investments in infrastructure are a key component of the Government of Ontario’s 2022 
Fall Economic Statement, with $159.3 billion in planned investments for the 2022-2032 Capital 
Plan (Government of Ontario, 2022a). Specific investments for specific infrastructure systems 
include: 
- 
Transportation: 
o $25.1 billion for highway expansion and rehabilitation 
o $61.6 billion for public transportation, including subway, train, streetcar travel 
- 
Buildings: 
o $40 billion for hospital infrastructure 
o $6 billion for postsecondary institutions (universities, colleges, Indigenous 
institutes) 
o $21 billion for school infrastructure and childcare facilities 
- 
Telecommunications: 
o $4 billion for high-speed internet infrastructure 
The quantity of built infrastructure in Ontario is largely driven by where Ontarians live. There 
are a few exceptions, such as, power generation infrastructure might be located where natural 
bodies of water present opportunity, rather than near a significant population. Consequently, 
much of Ontario’s infrastructure is concentrated within the most populous regions, such as the 
Southwest, Central, and Eastern regions of the province, where approximately 94% of the 
population of Ontario lives (Statistics Canada, 2016). In general, infrastructure assets are less 
concentrated and connected farther north (e.g. the Far North). 
6.3 Defining Infrastructure in the Context of the PCCIA 
For the purposes of this assessment, Ontario’s infrastructure was organized into key categories 
to support analysis. Level 1 and Level 2 categories were identified. A Level 1 category is defined 
as an overall ‘sector’, similar to how the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) 
defines sectors. Each Level 1 category was further broken down into ‘sub-sectors' to ensure 
that nuances within infrastructure sectors could be properly analysed.  
Figure 6.1 provides a summary of each the Level 1 and 2 categories assessed as part of the 
Infrastructure Area of Focus. Appendix 1 provides a full summary of the Level 1 and 2 
categories assessed as part of the Infrastructure Area of Focus, including a brief description of 
each.

6.4 Infrastructure Risk Snapshot across Ontario  
Summary of Risks 
Through this impact assessment, 690 unique risk scenarios were assessed under the 
Infrastructure Area of Focus and were evaluated quantitatively. At a regional level, 
infrastructure risk profiles are summarized in Figure 6.2, illustrating current risk, and the 
expected risks for the 2050s and 2080s, for each Level 1 category, operating under a high-
emissions scenario (RCP8.5). 
All infrastructure across Ontario faces climate risk. In fact, not a single asset included in this 
assessment is considered to have a risk less than ‘medium’ under current climate conditions. In 
many regions and for certain assets, this risk is expected to rise in the future. A significant 
portion of infrastructure across Ontario is not in a state of good repair, and the less investments 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        134  
made to improve assets that all Ontarian’s rely upon, the greater impacts climate change will 
have across the province. 
As an example of increasing risk profiles, several categories under Utilities increased from a 
current ‘medium’ risk profile to a ‘high’ risk profile in future time periods. The risk to Electrical 
Power Generation (Level 2 category under Utilities) is largely driven by rising temperatures 
which is more prevalent in the Central, Eastern and Southwest Regions, but present in all 
regions. High and extreme temperatures will accelerate the deterioration of equipment as it 
performs under higher heat conditions (United States Department of Energy, 2013). The 
physical risk to both Electrical Power Generation and Energy Transmission, Distribution Level 2 
categories is also driven by extreme precipitation events (short- and longer-term events). For 
Electrical Transmission, Control and Distribution, risk is largely driven by winter precipitation 
(specifically Rain:Snow Ratio, which can be a proxy for freezing rain). Freezing rain or ice 
accumulating on distribution lines is the most notable and the greatest contributing factor to 
physical damage to this infrastructure category.  
Under the Buildings Level 1 category, the Level 2 category of Housing in the Central, Eastern 
and Southwest regions exhibit the highest risk profiles. Risk to Housing is greatly driven by 
short-term extreme precipitation events, projected to increase over time. Risk to Waste 
Management is deemed to be ‘medium’ but increasing to ‘high’ for Central, Eastern and 
Southwest regions by mid-century (2050s). Stormwater management infrastructure across all 
regions of the province is evaluated as ‘high’ risk under current and remain ‘high’ across all 
future time periods.  
From a regional perspective, some regions have risk profiles that are rising faster compared to 
others across the Infrastructure Area of Focus. As noted in Section 6.2, the vast majority of 
infrastructure is concentrated within the most populous regions of Ontario: Southwest, Central, 
the Eastern regions. This is reflected as climate risks in these regions are increasing at an 
accelerated rate, compared to the northern regions of the province.  
Key Climate Drivers  
Risk scenarios assessed under the Infrastructure Area of Focus are driven by several climate 
variables selected for each of the Level 1 and 2 categories. Key climate drivers to the risk 
profiles under this Area of Focus are listed in Table 6.2 and include extreme precipitation 
events, Extreme Hot Days, and wildfire, which are the main drivers of 37%, 19% and 14% of all 
risk scenarios, respectively. A full list of all major climate variables that are driving the highest 
risks to Ontario’s Infrastructure Area of Focus by Level 1 category and region is available in 
Appendix 8.

While extreme precipitation, extreme heat and wildfire are driving the greatest amount of risk 
scenarios for this Area of Focus, other climate variables also pose threats to Ontario’s 
infrastructure systems. Winter precipitation is another climate variable group that is 
particularly impactful for the Infrastructure Area of Focus. Examples of direct impacts driven by 
climate variables across different Level 1 and 2 categories are captured below in Section 6.7

6.5 Approach to Assessing Climate Impacts on Infrastructure  
Climate change impact assessment for the Infrastructure Area of Focus considered only direct 
impacts at the asset level. Indirect and cascading impacts of infrastructure disruption and 
damage are not considered in this quantitative assessment, rather they are covered under 
other Areas of Focus and under the Cross-Sectoral Considerations (Section 10.0).  
Climate impacts on infrastructure were assessed for every region of Ontario. For each Level 2 
category, various interactions of how climate variables could lead to impacts were documented 
and used to quantify how likely it would be to occur and how severe the consequences would 
be if it did. For infrastructure, the assessment of consequences was scoped to the level of 
damage and extent of financial loss. To evaluate the severity of impact consequence for each 
risk scenario, the cost of asset damage or replacement was evaluated. The extent of financial 
loss sustained under each risk scenario was quantified based on the ranges shown in Table 6.3. 
A ‘very high’ consequence score reflected full failure or damage to the infrastructure asset 
whereas a ‘low’ score reflected increased maintenance. ‘Medium’ and ‘high’ consequence score 
reflected the range between increased maintenance and full failure of the asset.  
To provide additional context to how risks were quantified by Level 1 and Level 2 category. 
Table 6.4 presents examples of consequences and how they were assessed.  
The strength of evidence for this Area of Focus was generally ranked as medium, with the 
exception of a handful of Level 2 categories and scenarios where research on direct climate 
impacts remains limited. For instance, robust climate impact research and risk assessments 
exists for utility and transportation infrastructure systems in Ontario, with less available for 
specific pipeline transportation assets. In addition, most scenarios related to wildfire impacts 
on all types of infrastructure was rated low, as research available on the magnitude and 
likelihood of the associated consequences for Ontario infrastructure is limited.

The Infrastructure Area of Focus applied socio-economic projections to all future risk profiles 
(2050s and 2080s) to reflect projected regional population growth and increased density of 
physical infrastructure in certain regions of the province. Box 4 provides further details on how 
socio-economic indicators were used in the assessment of consequences associated with 
climate impacts on infrastructure. 
 
6.6 Limitations of the Infrastructure Assessment 
Scope of Infrastructure Area of Focus  
The inherent interdependence that exists for full functioning business and community creates 
complexity for specific lines of risk assessment of infrastructure. As such, the assessment of 
impacts is constrained to direct impacts to assets and does not include indirect impacts or 
assessment of the way impacts cascade through infrastructure systems and may be 
compounded or amplified. These impacts are described qualitatively within this section of the 
report. 
Interconnections and Interdependencies 
While there are examples of assessment of interdependent infrastructure systems (C40 Cities, 
2017), robust methods for assessing complex climate risks across systems are limited and were 
not part of the PCCIA scope. Therefore, associated indirect and cascading impacts with 
infrastructure damages and failures are reported in a narrative format throughout this section, 
and further assessed under other Areas of Focus (e.g. People and Communities or Business and 
Economy) and various themes under the Cross-Sectoral Considerations (Section 10.0) of this 
report (see Box 5). Further methodological and general limitations that apply to the impact 
assessment are covered in Sections 2.6.  
Box 4: Socio-economic Projections Applied to Infrastructure Area of Focus  
As described in Section 4.0, socio-economic projections were applied to risk evaluation 
based on the influence on likelihood of consequence and impact for PCCIA risk scenarios. 
For the Infrastructure Area of Focus, two socioeconomic indicators were applied to the 
likelihood of consequence across each Level 1 category, these included: population density 
and housing stock. To calculate the risk scores for the 2050s and 2080s, the two socio-
economic indicators were assessed to determine possible influence on future consequences 
of impact. For example, housing stock was used to adjust the consequence scoring of future 
climate impacts on Housing, based on elevated regional exposure and sensitivity.

6.7 Current and Future Climate Risks  
6.7.1 Buildings 
Overview  
Buildings are found across Ontario and provide a space sheltered from the outside environment 
and climate for people, public services, and businesses to function. In the Province, buildings 
are designed and constructed based on the Ontario Building Code, regulated under the Building 
Code Act (Government of Ontario, 2022b). Buildings were categorized into three sub-categories 
and evaluated as part of this assessment: 1) Housing, 2) Public buildings, and 3) Other buildings. 
The Housing Level 2 category refers to all privately owned residential buildings and public 
housing. When assessing Housing, the distribution of building types (e.g. single detached 
houses, and mid- and high-density buildings) for each geographic region was considered. In 
2018, Ontario owned 8,403 social and affordable housing assets, totaling 122,764 units were 
 
Box 5: Infrastructure Interdependencies in the PCCIA  
Previous impacts experienced across Ontario have highlighted the important of considering 
infrastructure interdependencies and how they interact with climate impacts. With this in 
mind, it is important to note that the Infrastructure Area of Focus concentrated on 
assessing the direct physical impact of climate change to infrastructure (both private and 
public sector) within Ontario. An example of how the PCCIA was limited in assessing 
infrastructure interdependencies can be illustrated with the Electrical Transmission, 
Control and Distribution Level 2 category. Risk to this category can be largely driven by 
winter precipitation (specifically Rain:Snow Ratio, which can be a proxy for freezing rain). 
The direct impacts of freezing rain or ice accumulating on distribution lines was assessed 
for the physical damage to this infrastructure category. However, it is recognized that the 
consequence of impacted electrical infrastructure would be felt by individuals, 
communities and businesses who rely on that infrastructure, making the consequential risk 
widespread and far reaching. Dependent on the severity and context of the event, there 
could also be cascading impacts across other infrastructure systems (e.g. water or 
telecommunication infrastructure). Some of these impacts are covered in other Areas of 
Focus. For example, direct impacts to services are covered under People and Communities 
(Section 8.0) and impacts to industry and business are covered under Business and 
Economy (Section 9.0). More discussion on cross-sectoral impacts can be found in Section 
10.0, while this Area of Focus concentrates on climate risks associated with the direct 
physical impacts and damages to infrastructure across Ontario. 
 
Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        141  
publicly owned across Ontario (total of provincial, regional, and municipal ownership) (Statistics 
Canada, 2020b, 2020d). Municipal ownership of social and affordable housing units represents 
the largest share, owning 68% of total structures (76% of units) (Statistics Canada, 2020b, 
2020d).  
Public Buildings as a Level 2 category are considered those owned or operated by a government 
entity and primarily engaged in providing educational services, community services, and 
activities of a government nature. Examples of Public Buildings included during the assessment 
period are City Halls, public office buildings and buildings at transportation hubs.  
The Other Buildings Level 2 category includes commercial, institutional and industrial properties 
such as hospitals, warehouses, factory buildings, office spaces and stores. In Ontario, buildings 
account for approximately a quarter of the province’s total emissions, making this area an 
important focus for climate action (Office of the Auditor General of Ontario, 2020a). The 
Government of Canada is investing in energy efficiency retrofits and net-zero new builds, taking 
climate change risks into consideration and making investments to reduce emissions from 
buildings (Natural Resources Canada, 2022b). 
Direct Impacts 
Climate change can impact buildings in many ways. Four climate variable groups were identified 
as being particularly impactful to Buildings: Extreme Precipitation Event (shorter term), High 
and Extreme Temperature (Extreme Hot Days), Low Temperature (Extreme Cold Days), and 
Wildfire (Eastern, Northeast, Northwest and Far North Regions only). 
In all three of the Building Level 2 categories, Extreme Precipitation and Wildfire resulted in the 
highest consequence scores. Both hazards have the potential to damage building 
foundations/frames, shortening the service life of the structure. For example, a short-duration 
high-intensity precipitation event can result in water damage to buildings and lead to concrete 
corrosion to foundations that can weaken the structure and reduce the building’s service life.  
Table 6.5 provides example risk scenarios for this Level 1 category. Notably, these are meant to 
be illustrative examples of the types of scenarios assessed and are non-exhaustive. A more 
detailed risk characterization and a description of risk drivers are provided in the section below.  
Further detail on the risk profiles relevant to this category, with more information on how the 
magnitude of the risks vary by region and timeframe (operating under RCP8.5) is provided in 
Table 6.6, at the end of the section. Appendix 7 provides risk scores for both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 
emission scenarios.

A short-term high-intensity precipitation event can 
result in water damage to buildings. This includes 
concrete corrosion to foundations that will weaken the 
structure and reduce the building’s service life.

Other Buildings 
Low temperatures resulting in an increase of Cooling 
Degree Days can result in the settlement of permafrost 
(Far North) or heaving under buildings which would 
result in damage to the building structure (e.g. cracks in 
the foundation or walls) and may result in the 
temporary closure of services. Damage to infrastructure 
will reduce the service life of the building. 
Low 
Public Buildings 
High temperatures can cause increased cooling loads on 
building cooling infrastructure, which may impact 
performance and strain equipment. This can shorten the 
life expectancy and require additional maintenance for 
buildings that are impacted.  
Low  
 
The risk profile for all three types of buildings (housing, public buildings and other buildings) is 
similar. It was determined to be currently ‘medium’ but rising to ‘high’ risk by the 2080s in most 
regions. Risks are rising faster in the Far North where the rate of climatic change is accelerated 
and where improvements to and additions of buildings face a more significant backlog. For 
instance, changes in low temperature for buildings in the Far North, can cause heaving under 
buildings resulting in damage to the building structure (e.g. cracks in the foundation or walls), 
and may result in the temporary closure of services.  
Table 6.6 provides the risk scores for each Level 2 category under Buildings, by region and 
timeframe. Risks to housing in Southwest Ontario are rising faster than in other regions, being 
largely driven by existing vulnerability to flooding (e.g. short-term extreme precipitation 
events).

Indirect Impacts 
Indirect impacts associated with building damage and failures (e.g. inability to occupy or use a 
building) were not quantitatively evaluated as part of the risk profiles but were noted 
throughout the assessment. 
One such example relates to the combination of poor drainage in the building footprint and 
building damage that would lead to water infiltration. Buildings can be indirectly impacted 
during extreme precipitation events if the environment around them has a decrease in 
permeability that may lead to increased infiltration of water into buildings causing physical 
damage to interior parts of a building. The trickle-down impact is reflected in damp conditions 
 
Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        144  
on the inside of the building and the potential for mould (Lacasse et al., 2020; Hallegatte & 
Corfee-Morlot, 2010; Chinowsky et al., 2014). 
Buildings may also be impacted indirectly through increased urban growth and housing 
development. This pressure can lead to development in high-risk areas such as floodplains and 
wetlands and in the context of climate change, lead to increased flood risk into the future 
(Lacasse et al., 2020; Hallegatte & Corfee-Morlot, 2010; Chinowsky et al., 2014). 
 
6.7.2 Pipeline Transportation  
Overview 
Pipelines and natural gas distribution form an essential component of Ontario’s energy 
distribution network, contributing $7.7B to the province’s GDP in 2017(Canadian Energy Centre, 
2021). For the purposes of this climate impact assessment, two Level 2 categories were 
evaluated within pipeline transportation: 1) natural gas distribution and 2) other pipelines. 
Natural gas distribution refers to the distribution of natural or synthetic gas to residents and 
businesses through mains. Pipelines refer to various types of pipelines and integrated systems 
that include pumping stations, storage facilities and other facilities. Table 6.7 illustrates the 
value of this infrastructure, by summarizing key pipeline infrastructure in Ontario.

Direct Impacts 
Climate change can impact natural gas distribution and pipelines in many ways. Extreme 
precipitation may lead to soil saturation, movement or undermining of pipes and buried assets, 
and increased maintenance requirements to ensure operational safety. Shifting seasonal 
precipitation and/or flooding could increase the exposure of infrastructure to hazardous 
conditions, leading to damage of assets. Increasing air temperature and extreme heat could 
shift soil conditions, leading to a higher likelihood of erosion, and instability, causing indirect 
impacts associated with sun exposure. The direct impacts identified have the potential to 
trigger geotechnical hazards such as landslides and river scouring, which may result in slope 
instability causing pipeline dislodgement and rupture.  
Table 6.8 provides example risk scenarios for this Level 1 category. Notably, these are meant to 
be illustrative examples of the types of scenarios assessed and are non-exhaustive. A more 
detailed risk characterization and a description of risk drivers are provided in the section below.

The risk profile for both natural gas distribution and pipelines were found to be similar across 
all regions of Ontario. Risks are considered to be ‘medium’ under current climate conditions 
and remain relatively similar in the future. This unchanging risk profile reflects, to an extent, the 
fact that large portions of these assets are buried, actively managed and monitored, and not 
directly exposed to extreme weather events.  
Further detail on the risk profiles relevant to this category, with more information on how the 
magnitude of the risks vary by region and timeframe (operating under RCP8.5) is provided in

Indirect Impacts 
While assessing direct impacts on physical infrastructure through risk scoring, some indirect 
impacts to Pipeline Transportation were identified. For example, extreme precipitation events 
coupled with high and extreme temperature events could lead to the long-term deterioration 
of soil conditions leading to erosion, instability, or increased exposure of pipes to atmospheric 
conditions. More generally, where climate-related impacts exist for pipeline transportation, 
cascading impacts can result in reputational issues for infrastructure owners and operators, 
increase the financial costs of managing assets safely, and reduce the serviceable lifespan of 
assets before they need replacement. 
6.7.3 Stormwater Management  
Overview 
Stormwater management broadly refers to reducing runoff of precipitation across surfaces and 
managing water systems to maintain the natural hydrologic cycle. The objective of stormwater 
management is to prevent increased risks from flooding and stream erosion, and improve 
water quality. Ontario owns and manages a significant amount of stormwater management 
infrastructure; however, it is aging, which presents an additional risk for climate change and 
flood risk.  
 
Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        148  
Flooding represents the costliest natural hazard in Ontario, exemplified by Hurricane Hazel in 
1954 with restoration costs estimated to be around $1 billion in current dollars, and more 
recent flooding disasters across Ontario, including the 2018 flood in Toronto with an $80 million 
in insured damage, and flooding of the Albany River in 2019 causing the evacuation of 2,500 
members of Kashechewan First Nation (Public Safety Canada, 2019). Flash flooding events, like 
the one in Toronto in 2018, occur during heavy rainstorms or may be caused by dam failure or 
the sudden release of significant ice jams, and can be exacerbated when stormwater 
management (SWM) infrastructure is not maintained (e.g. storm drains clogged by debris). 
Seasonal flooding is caused by accumulated spring melt, ice jams, and consistent rainfall. 
Based on the persistent risks from flooding, and significant flooding events in the spring of 
2019, a special advisory report, titled An Independent Review of the 2019 Flood Events in 
Ontario (Government of Ontario, 2021b) was prepared, detailing 66 recommendations to 
improve existing flood policy and pursue flood mitigation infrastructure investments and 
improvements (Government of Ontario, 2021b). Protecting People and Property: Ontario’s 
Flooding Strategy (Government of Ontario, 2020e) was built around many of the Special 
Advisor recommendations and provides further provincial policy directives in handling the risks 
from floods within the province. 
Ontario has 1,678 medium- and large-size dams on record, with the majority of dam 
infrastructure located in Southwestern, Central, and Eastern regions (Ontario GeoHub, 2022). 
Ontario Power Generation (OPG) operates 66 hydroelectric stations, generating one third of 
OPG’s total electricity production (Ontario Power Generation, 2022). Aging dam infrastructure 
presents additional vulnerability to climate change and increases flood risk. The Canadian Dam 
Association records indicate that there are 118 large dams13 in Ontario, all over 30 years old, 
and of which 105 (89%) are over 50 years old (Canadian Dam Association, 2019). 
Smaller scale, but still significant, SWM infrastructure is in place throughout municipalities, 
rural communities, and agricultural areas, contributing to water quality management and 
capacity management. Not to be neglected are conveyance systems including channels, ditches, 
culverts, and storm sewers, which convey water to larger holding and treatment areas. 
Pervious surfaces are those which allow water to infiltrate (softscape, parkland, permeable 
pavers, etc.), which reduce water volume from rainfall and flooding events, and also act as 
water filtration systems. Impervious surfaces do not allow for infiltration (asphalt, concrete, 
buildings, etc.), and contribute to higher runoff and flooding as water. The Ontario Ministry of 
Environment, Conservation and Parks considers impervious cover in the Stormwater 
 
13 A large dam is defined as a dam with a height of 15 m or more, or a dam between five and 15 meters 
in height which impounds (accumulates/retains) more than three million cubic meters of water. 
 
Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        149  
Management Planning and Design Manual, specifying water storage requirements based on the 
conversion of land from pervious to impervious surface (Ontario Ministry of the Environment, 
Conservation and Parks, 2019). The Greater Toronto Area (in the Central region) is heavily 
urbanized, with 73% impervious surface coverage (Monica, 2019). Dense urban areas with high 
levels of impervious surfaces experience ‘flashier’ runoff, characterized by rapidly accumulating 
water that increases river discharge over a short period of time. This leads to an increase in 
flooding conditions, as river systems are overwhelmed by the rapid influx of water. 
Wetlands provide natural flood and erosion control, among other benefits to water quality and 
habitat. Ontario is home to approximately 25% of Canada’s wetlands, with over 35 million 
hectares. The majority of Ontario wetlands are located in northern regions (Northeast, 
Northwest, Far North) (Government of Ontario, 2021e). Wetlands in southern regions (e.g. 
Southwest and Central) are being lost to alternative land uses (primarily urban development 
and agriculture). For example, over 13,000 hectares of wetland were lost at an increasing 
annual rate over the fifteen-year period of 2000 to 2015 (Government of Ontario, 2021e) (see 
Box 6 for further details on green infrastructure). 
 
In order to assess the impacts of climate change on stormwater management, three Level 2 
categories were used: 1) flood mitigation infrastructure, such as berms, dams, dikes, and 
wetlands; 2) urban stormwater management systems (SWM) such as storm sewers, culverts, 
storage structures and pump stations; and 3) rural stormwater management systems, such as 
tile drains, municipal drains and ditches.  
Direct Impacts 
Climate change is expected to have significant impacts on stormwater management (SWM) in 
Ontario. Extreme precipitation events, both accumulated precipitation over the longer term, 
and short-term events are found to be some of the most impactful conditions on SWM 
infrastructure in Ontario. Table 6.10 provides example risk scenarios for this Level 1 category.  
 
Box 6: Green Infrastructure in the PCCIA 
Accelerating the implementation of green infrastructure (e.g. low-impact developments) 
can help to slow runoff, store water, and increase infiltration. While green infrastructure 
was not included as a distinct category in this Area of Focus, it is highlighted as an 
adaptation solution, to improve stormwater management by increasing the resilience of 
infrastructure in Ontario’s communities. 
 
Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        150  
Extreme flooding presents risks related to dam washout and failure, or physical damage to 
dams and pump stations, which could be exacerbated by increased levels of debris in 
floodwater. Increases in damage incidents result in increased maintenance or 
replacement/reconstruction of this infrastructure, as well as required downtime or reduced 
capacity in the system while damage is being addressed. A full dam washout causing a release 
of water would result in infrastructure impacts beyond the SWM infrastructure itself and 
include damage to transportation infrastructure and to public and private property. Debris can 
block or impede the efficiency of urban and rural SWM infrastructure, reducing infiltration and 
flow capacity, and contributing to flooding and worsening water quality and environmental 
conditions. Flooding which exceeds design flows may result in sewer overflows with undersized 
systems for the scale of the flooding event, and residents may experience sewage backup in 
basements.

High 
 
The risk profiles of flood mitigation Infrastructure, as well as rural and urban stormwater 
management systems, are considered to be ‘high’ under current climate conditions and 
remains ‘high’ in the future (see Table 6.11 at the end of this section). This risk may be higher if 
development occurs in high-risk areas or where water is infiltrated or stored, like wetlands. 
Socio-economic indicators were used to reflect the changing density of populations and 
infrastructure needs in the future. However, the way in which Ontario develops and builds 
moving into the future may not be entirely reflected in future risk profiles especially if future 
 
Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        151  
climate conditions are not considered in infrastructure planning and design. If infrastructure is 
not properly planned, developed, maintained or replaced with future climate conditions in 
mind, the risk may be even greater for future time periods. 
Summarized in Table 6.11, all Level 2 categories considered under stormwater management are 
deemed to have ‘high’ risk profiles now and moving into the future. Risks were found to already 
be ‘high’ for both urban and rural stormwater management systems and flood mitigation 
infrastructure. Current risks are considered ‘high’ considering the extent and severity of 
consequences that can occur when stormwater management systems and flood mitigation 
infrastructure are impacted. Two main considerations for why risks may not be increasing in 
future time periods include:  
- 
Risks for these particular Level 2 categories are largely driven by extreme precipitation 
events (e.g. short and longer duration). The future frequency of these variables is 
projected to increase across Ontario, though not substantially until the end of century. 
Climate variable frequency scores reflect this and remain unchanging until the 2080s. 
This could imply that the extent of the likelihood increase may not be sufficient to 
elevate risks to ‘very high’ for both Level 2 categories in relation to all other risks across 
Ontario. 
- 
To calculate future risk scores, socio-economic indicators were applied to determine if 
there was an influence on the consequences of the impact. In some cases, consequence 
scoring was increased (e.g. housing stock is expected to increase the impermeable 
surfaces and increase surface runoff/water entering flood mitigation infrastructure). 
However, the degree of influence these projections had on future consequences scoring 
may not entirely reflect the influence that urban growth and development will have on 
future risk profiles for this Level 1 category. 
More broadly, to evaluate the extent of risk more locally, additional climate variables and/or 
public floodplain maps would be important to refine results.

Indirect Impacts 
Generally, the indirect impacts to stormwater management are widespread and far-reaching 
across other Areas of Focus. For example, when stormwater management infrastructure is sized 
inadequately to handle storm conveyance during extreme precipitation events, widespread 
flooding impacts occur. These capacity constraints may not cause physical damage to 
stormwater infrastructure (e.g. pipe damage) however the associated risks may be widespread 
and underrepresented under this Level 1 category.  
6.7.4  Waste Management  
Overview 
Waste management refers to infrastructure and establishments that provide waste 
management services, such as waste collection, treatment and disposal services; environmental 
remediation services; and septic tank pumping services. Material recovery facilities (recycling, 
composting) are also included in this category. 
Ontario’s population of 14.57 million people generated approximately 12 million tonnes of 
landfilled waste in 2019 (Ontario Waste Management Association, 2021). Ontario relies 
primarily on local landfills with 73% of waste landfilled within the province (8.7 million tonnes), 
while 27% is transported to the United States for disposal. Of the over 800 landfills within the 
province, Ontario depends heavily on seven primary landfills which accommodate 60% of 
landfilled waste in the province. Major landfills are located primarily in Southwest, Central, and 
Eastern Ontario, centered around major population centers and where consolidation and 
transportation of waste between municipal jurisdictions is facilitated by major highways. 
Northern regions of Ontario have a greater number of smaller landfills, dedicated to 
communities due to transportation limitations and the dispersed nature of the communities. 
With such an important percentage of waste managed at a limited number of landfill sites, 
climate-related impacts to these sites presents significant risks for waste management 
operations. 
 
Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        154  
In 2021, the waste management sector in Ontario employed 3,231 full-time and part-time 
employees in the public sector, with an estimated 17,393 full-time equivalent jobs inclusive of 
the private sector (Statistics Canada, 2021a; The Conference Board of Canada, 2021a). Well-
managed landfills are an essential component of the safety of workers, citizens, and the 
environment. Improperly managed landfills may cause unsafe environmental conditions and 
nuisance conditions (odour).  
Direct Impacts 
This impact assessment identified several ways that climate change can impact waste 
management. Extreme precipitation and extreme temperatures are anticipated to have the 
most significant impacts on waste management. Table 6.12 provides an example risk scenario 
for this category. Extreme precipitation events may cause increased leachate generation and 
ponding or flooding within a landfill. This may lead to slope instability of the waste at a landfill, 
with slope failure resulting in waste displacement and potential contamination of the 
surrounding environment. Extreme heat and high temperatures increase the likelihood of 
landfill fires under dry conditions.

Extreme precipitation can cause slope instability of the waste 
piled at a landfill. Slope failure could result in displacing waste 
on-site into the surrounding environment. Shorter, more 
intense storms will have a greater effect on slope stability.  
Medium  
 
As demonstrated in Table 6.13, the risk profile of waste management was determined to be 
‘medium’ under current climate conditions. This is expected to remain similar by mid-century 
and increase by the end of century. The increase in the latter half of the century is reflective of 
the increased frequency expected for extreme precipitation and temperatures by end of 
century. These risks are consistent across every region of Ontario except the Far North, 
reflecting less demand, density of landfills and waste management services. To calculate future 
risk profiles, socio-economic indicators had an influence on the consequences of the impact. 
For example, population density was used to adjust the scoring for Waste Management based 
on the required infrastructure to meet increased capacity needs.

Indirect Impacts 
Changing climate conditions can also indirectly impact waste management operations in 
various ways.  
- 
Warming climate conditions may lead to increased odour generation, thereby 
decreasing air quality. 
- 
Shifting species changes and temperature regimes can increase vermin, disease vectors 
and small animals, leading to higher risk to public health. 
- 
Impacts to water infrastructure and operations may include leachate generation causing 
soil and water contamination and exacerbate the likelihood of landfill fires.  
- 
Climate-related impacts could result in unsafe conditions for workers through unstable 
slope conditions within the work areas.  
- 
General increased landfill management requirements and associated costs with 
increased maintenance.  
6.7.5 Transportation 
Overview 
Ontario’s transportation network is significant, and connects residents and businesses within, 
across and external to the province, with important road, rail, water, and air transportation 
routes. There are over 4,300 km of 400-series highways in Ontario, serving as the primary road 
transportation network, connecting east-to-west and north-to-south (Government of Ontario, 
2020b; 2020c; 2022d). The 400-series highways are critical infrastructure supporting Ontario, 
 
Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        156  
Canadian, and international business with over 416,000 vehicles per day (including 41,000 
transport trucks transporting over $600 million in goods). Rail lines in Ontario are operated by 
Canadian National Railway (CN), Canadian Pacific Railroad (CP), and VIA Rail, providing freight 
and passenger transportation services. Additional operators such as GO Train service from 
Metrolinx are also provided on the rail infrastructure and represent an important element of 
passenger transportation across southern Ontario. Canada’s busiest airport, the Lester B. 
Pearson International Airport in Mississauga saw almost 50 million passengers in 2019 
(Statistics Canada, 2021b). 
Direct Impacts 
Strongly linked with results from the transportation economy assessment under Business and 
Economy (Section 9.7.10), this Level 1 category focuses on the assets themselves. Climate 
impacts were evaluated across several sub-categories: 1) air transportation, 2) deep sea, 
coastal and great lakes transportation, 3) rail transportation and 4) roads and bridges. Climate 
risks posed to each of these transportation systems vary significantly.  
Table 6.14 provides example risk scenarios for this Level 1 category. Notably, these are meant 
to be illustrative examples of the types of scenarios assessed and are non-exhaustive. A more 
detailed risk characterization and a description of risk drivers are provided in the section below.  
Further detail on the risk profiles relevant to this category, with more information on how the 
magnitude of the risks vary by region and timeframe (operating under RCP8.5) is provided in 
Table 6.15, at the end of the section. Appendix 7 provides risk scores for both RCP4.5 and 
RCP8.5 emission scenarios.

Air Transportation  
Air transportation includes airfields (runways, taxiways, aprons, and de-icing operations), 
terminals and landside infrastructure (buildings, parking lots, and groundside paving), and 
communications equipment. Risks associated with air transportation are deemed to be 
‘medium’ under existing conditions and increasing to ‘high’ for all future time periods. The 
increase in risk reflects the significant impacts anticipated from extreme heat. Extreme heat 
and high temperatures can lead to the bleeding of asphalt or buckling of concrete runways that 
can lead to closures of airport lanes due to the safety concerns. Extreme precipitation is also a 
key driver of risk for air transportation, causing localized standing water and flooding and 
associated physical damages and disruptions. The 2013 storm in the Toronto area caused 
significant flooding and led to considerable erosion and gravel spilling onto runways (Public 
Safety Canada, 2019). 
Deep Sea, Coastal and Great Lakes Infrastructure  
The deep sea, coastal and Great Lakes Level 2 category includes infrastructure associated with 
deep sea, coastal, and Great Lakes (Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario) water 
transportation of freight and passengers; including ports, marinas, harbours, canals, and 
waterways. The risks to deep sea, coastal and great lakes infrastructure were determined to be 
‘medium’ under the current timeframe and remain at this score in future time periods. This 
does not indicate that climate change will not impact this type of infrastructure. Instead, it may 
indicate that the scope of this impact assessment did not facilitate a comprehensive evaluation 
of impacts on deep sea, coastal and Great Lakes infrastructure. Through this assessment several 
impacts were identified that would cause physical damage and impacts on this type of 
infrastructure. For example, increased frequency of extreme precipitation events (short-term 
and longer-term) may lead to the formation of cracks due to weathering or the degradation of 
infrastructure. Flooding conditions may also cause locks to be closed for longer due to damages 
and the associated increase in maintenance. With anticipated greater year-to-year and multi-
 
Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        158  
year variability in water levels, docks may periodically be submerged or stranded due to higher 
and lower water levels compared to historical observations.  
Rail Transportation  
Rail transportation includes all rail lines, rail yards, as well as associated land, structures 
(culverts, tunnels, bridges, etc.), and buildings supporting rail operations Risks associated with 
rail transportation are considered ‘medium’ now and increase to ‘high’ for all future time 
periods. Extreme heat and precipitation are anticipated to be the most impactful on rail 
infrastructure. Extreme heat can lead to heat kinks or buckling during Extreme Hot Days of 
railways, resulting in increased maintenance, repairs and/or the need for complete 
replacement. Impacts are particularly pronounced when the rail infrastructure has exceeded its 
lifespan. In addition, extreme precipitation events may lead to washouts, damage to rail lines, 
and increased maintenance, repairs and/or complete replacement needs. 
Roads and Bridges  
The roads and bridges Level 2 category encompasses all roads (including ice and winter roads 
but excluding forestry roads) as well as associated earthwork, drainage, and structures 
incorporated into roadways (culverts, bridges, tunnels, etc.). The risks to roads and bridges 
across Ontario are considered to be ‘medium’ under current and mid-century (2050s) 
timeframes but increase to ‘high’ by the end of century. High temperatures and extreme 
precipitation events have a high likelihood of leading to weathering and premature 
deterioration of roadway infrastructure, increasing maintenance and repair requirements. In 
addition, a shortened asset life is expected due to increasing freeze-thaw cycles from warming 
winter temperatures and frequent washouts due to extreme precipitation. Regionally, risks are 
relatively higher in Central and Eastern Ontario. Wildfires have the potential to impact the 
Eastern, Northwest, Northeast, and Far North Regions, with the potential to destroy or damage 
wooden infrastructure (minor bridges), and otherwise degrade road surfaces and bridge 
cabling. 
Winter roads have a unique context and provide critical connections to many communities 
across the Far North of Ontario. As part of this assessment, winter roads were included within 
the roads and bridges Level 2 category. Due to increasing variability in conditions throughout 
shoulder seasons, and rapidly increasing air temperatures in the winter season, risks should be 
considered particularly elevated for these types of road systems (Hori et al, 2018a; 2018b). 
Summarized in Table 6.15, the Level 2 categories under Transportation are anticipated to 
experience varying levels of risk associated with climate change. All Level 2 categories had a risk 
score of ‘medium’ in the current timeframe. Air Transportation and Rail are deemed to have a 
‘high’ risk score in the 2050s and 2080s, while Roads and Bridges have a ‘medium’ risk score in 
 
Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        159  
the 2050s, increasing to ‘high’ by the 2080s. The only Level 2 category that does not increase in 
risk is deep sea, coastal and Great Lakes infrastructure.  
While socio-economic indicators related to population and infrastructure density play a role in 
the risk scores under the Infrastructure Area of Focus, the risk profiles for transportation are 
largely driven by changes in climate conditions.

Indirect Impacts 
For this Level 1 category particularly, it should be noted that indirect impacts associated with 
transportation infrastructure failure and disruptions were not quantitatively evaluated as part 
of the described risk profiles. The Business and Economy Area of Focus characterizes and 
evaluates climate risks for the transportation economy in Ontario (Section 9.7.10). In addition, 
the People and Communities Area of Focus covers impacts related to critical services and 
emergency response as they relate to transportation failure and disruptions.  
 
Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        161  
6.7.6 Utilities  
Overview 
Utilities as a Level 1 category includes infrastructure assets that are primarily engaged in 
operating electric, gas, and water utilities. Strongly linked with results from the utility services 
assessment under Business and Economy (Section 9.7.11), this category focused on the assets 
themselves and the direct impact of climate change on utility infrastructure systems. Climate 
impacts were evaluated across several sub-categories: 1) water supply and irrigation systems, 
2) sewage treatment facilities, 3) electrical power generation, 4) electrical transmission, control 
and distribution, and 5) telecommunications. 
Direct Impacts 
Table 6.16 provides example risk scenarios for this Level 1 category. Notably, these are meant 
to be illustrative examples of the types of scenarios assessed and are non-exhaustive. A more 
detailed risk characterization and a description of risk drivers are provided in the section below.  
Further detail on the risk profiles relevant to this category, with more information on how the 
magnitude of the risks vary by region and timeframe (operating under RCP8.5) is provided in 
Table 6.17, at the end of the section. Appendix 7 provides risk scores for both RCP4.5 and

The risk to utility services was assessed by Level 2 category across all regions of Ontario. There 
was variability in the Level 2 risk profiles under Utilities. All Level 2 categories have a risk score 
of ‘medium’ in the current timeframe, except Electrical power generation which has a current 
risk score of ‘high’. Risks to electrical transmission, control and distribution are anticipated to 
increase from a ‘medium’ to a ‘high’ risk score in the 2050s and maintained this score in the 
2080s. Level 2 categories including sewage treatment facilities, telecommunications and water 
supply and irrigation systems, remain at a ‘medium’ risk score throughout the 2050s and 2080s.  
Housing stock is a major socio-economic driver affecting future risk scores through utility Level 
2 categories. Housing stock projections influenced the scoring of sewage treatment facilities, 
based on the assumption of increased capacity requirements across each assessed region. 
Again, it is critical to recall that these scores only indicate direct impacts to the physical 
infrastructure, and do not reflect cascading impacts or failures to or from utility infrastructure 
systems.  
Electrical Power Generation  
Electrical Power Generation includes facilities primarily engaged in the generation of electric 
power, by hydraulic energy, fossil fuels, nuclear energy, or other processes (e.g. wind turbines). 
In Ontario, nuclear generated power was responsible for 56.8% of electricity generation in 2020 
 
Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        163  
and is produced at three facilities located in the Southwest and Central regions (OEB, 2021; 
Government of Ontario, 2022e). Natural gas and wind production are predominantly located in 
the Southwest region (producing 6.3% and 8.7% respectively), and hydroelectric power 
production (24.4%) is predominant in the remaining regions (IESO, 2022a; Canadian Nuclear 
Safety Commission, 2022; OEB, 2021). Solar electricity is a minimal contributor to Ontario’s 
grid, at 2.4% (OEB, 2021).  
Electrical power generation can be impacted by climate change in a variety of ways, and in part 
depends on energy sources. For example, low water flows due to drought conditions can 
reduce hydroelectricity generation. This Level 2 category was evaluated against high and 
extreme temperatures (e.g. Extreme Hot Days and Cooling Degree Days) and extreme 
precipitation events (e.g. longer term accumulated precipitation). Extreme precipitation was 
found to be the greatest driver of risk for this Level 2 category. Water damage and impacts 
from overland flows and flooding may cause severe damage to equipment and shorten the 
useful life of electrical power generation infrastructure.  
Electrical Transmission, Control and Distribution 
Electrical power, once generated, requires transmission and distribution to consumers and for 
end use. The Ontario electricity grid is made up of transmission lines delivering electricity from 
generators to communities. The Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) directs the 
flow of electricity over these lines, while transmission companies (e.g. Hydro One) own, 
operate, and maintain the lines and towers (IESO, 2022a). The Electrical transmission, control 
and distribution Level 2 category includes the transmission, distribution and control of electric 
power. Natural gas distribution is included in the Pipeline Transportation Level 1 category.  
Electrical transmission, control and distribution were evaluated against four climate variable 
groups: high and extreme temperatures (Extreme Hot Days), extreme precipitation events 
(short term), winter precipitation (Rain:Snow Ratio), and wildfire. Winter precipitation 
(Rain:Snow Ratio) is the greatest driver of risk for this Level 2 category. An increase in exposure 
(duration and intensity) or a shift to freezing rain or wet snow can have negative impacts on 
transmission and distribution infrastructure and cause significant equipment damage. Heavy 
loading on transmission lines or on adjacent tree branches can lead to contacts and outages. 
Impacts from extreme heat are also associated with some of the highest risk interactions for 
this Level 2 category. Extreme heat can reduce the carrying capacity of transmission and 
distribution lines and damage substations and transformers.  
Sewage Treatment Facilities  
Sewage treatment facilities include sewer systems and sewage treatment facilities that collect, 
treat, and dispose of wastewater. Combined sewer overflows were captured in this Level 2 
 
Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        164  
category instead of storm collection systems due to their primary purpose being low-flow 
sanitary loads. Sewage treatment facilities can be affected by several different climate 
variables, with extreme precipitation events (accumulated precipitation, longer-term), being 
particularly impactful. Extreme precipitation events may cause infiltration and leaks in sewage 
treatment infrastructure, like piping systems. This may result in significant physical damages to 
the infrastructure over time, with associated maintenance and replacement costs expected to 
increase.  
Telecommunications  
Telecommunications includes infrastructure primarily engaged in providing telecommunications 
(cell) and/or video entertainment services. Telecommunications infrastructure consists of both 
wired and wireless technologies as well as satellites, all of which are integral to supporting 
public, emergency, retail and commercial services.  
Telecommunications as a Level 2 category was evaluated against high and extreme 
precipitation events (accumulated precipitation, longer term), winter precipitation (Rain:Snow 
Ratio), and wildfire. The risk interactions related to wildfire (in Far North and Northeast regions) 
have the greatest level of consequence under this Level 2 category. In addition to the physical 
damage that fire can have on telecommunication infrastructure, heat from wildfire can cause 
damage to above-ground telecommunication lines causing loss/interruption of communication 
systems for entire communities. Flooding conditions caused by changes in precipitation 
patterns (e.g. rain in the winter season) and increased frequency of extreme precipitation 
events, may also cause ground movement due to erosion, resulting in the severing of fibre optic 
lines, leading to the disruption of internet and cable services for entire communities. Increases 
in precipitation, coupled with rising air temperatures (or humidity), may affect the radio 
spectrum which wireless communications rely upon. Extreme precipitation events may also 
disrupt transmitted signals or require increased transmission power to withstand challenging 
weather conditions. As a result, this may restrict the ability of customers who are supported 
within a given region or spectrum band (Adams and Steeves, 2014).  
Under this assessment, the risk profile for telecommunications was deemed as ‘medium’ under 
the current timeframe, did not increase into the future across most regions. The risk profile 
increases for Eastern Ontario by the end of century, reflecting increased likelihood of impact 
and severity of consequences. The relatively stable risk scores for telecommunication indicate 
the nature of physical damage to this type of infrastructure, as impacts tend to be contained 
and isolated to local areas. However, it should be noted that only direct physical impacts and 
damages are included in the quantitative risk scores and the indirect or cascading impacts of 
climate change are not reflected.  
 
Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        165  
Water Supply and Irrigation Systems  
Water supply and irrigation systems as a Level 2 category include potable and non-potable 
water supply sources and the distribution infrastructure of the water such as irrigation systems. 
Potable water systems also include surface and groundwater treatment facilities, and 
distribution includes buried pipes, disinfection & booster stations, reservoirs. In this 
assessment, truck fill and cistern, or fill up at a treatment plant are not included. Irrigation 
systems include sprinklers for agriculture, groundwater pumps, piping, and focused mostly on 
agricultural applications instead of urban irrigation (e.g. for lawns, golf courses, etc.).  
Several climate variables can impact the physical infrastructure of water supply and irrigation 
systems. Extreme precipitation events (accumulated precipitation, shorter term) can cause 
flooding which carries debris and, in some events, may cause slope failure. The risk profile for 
water supply and irrigation systems was assessed at a ‘medium’ and was not found to increase 
over time, considering only direct damage to the infrastructure assets.

Indirect Impacts 
Due to the interconnected nature of utilities, indirect and cascading impacts from climate 
change are anticipated to be significant. Cascading impacts related to failures and disruptions of 
utility infrastructure are covered under other Areas of Focus, and Cross-Sectoral Considerations 
section (Section 10.0). Examples of other indirect impacts posed by climate change include: 
- 
Extreme precipitation events may lead to electrical power generation station or station 
equipment breakdown or physical damage. This may lead to downtime or reduced 
capacity in the system and may result in increased O&M needs (Golder Associates, 
2015).  
- 
Areas impacted by wildfire may experience “flashy” runoff after a fire resulting in low 
ground absorption capacity and higher than average runoff. This can drastically affect 
the hydrology of a drainage basin and may impact hydroelectric plants storage and 
function (Fant et al., 2020; Sunrise Powerwalk Project, 2008; Smith, 2014).  
- 
Prolonged exposure to suboptimal temperature conditions may reduce the efficiency 
and function of wastewater treatment facilities, for example frozen service lines, frozen 
sewage lagoons, and microbial health and function. This could lead to partially treated 
or untreated water discharging to receiving water bodies (US EPA, 2022).  
- 
Regions where nuclear power generation occurs, will be impacted by high and extreme 
temperatures which may result in an increase to the baseline temperature in cooling 
water (lakes, rivers). As the cooling water temperature increases, it will require a larger 
volume of water or more time to cool. 
6.8 Climate Change Opportunities 
Opportunities resulting from direct physical climate change impacts on infrastructure are 
limited. As demonstrated throughout this assessment, changing climate conditions across 
different regions of the province can affect infrastructure in a variety of ways. Overall, the 
impact assessment found the risks that climate change has on Ontario’s infrastructure, 
 
Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        168  
outweigh any potential positive impacts. However, there are a select number of interactions 
that indicate a potential for minor positive impacts for areas of transportation infrastructure in 
Ontario. The interactions that exhibited the potential for positive impacts related to warming 
winter temperatures (Degree Days <0C°) and the Roads and Bridge Level 2 categories: 
- 
In the long term (e.g. 2080s), warmer winter temperatures may lead to a reduction of 
thermal cycling and cold weather-related damages, resulting in extended road lifespan 
and reduced costs.  
- 
Less ice accretion on roadways due to warmer winter temperatures may result in a 
reduced need for de-icing compounds, which may be beneficial for road and bridge 
surface longevity. 
6.9 Adaptive Capacity 
6.9.1 Adaptive Capacity Summary  
Adaptive Capacity within the Infrastructure Area of Focus was determined for each Level 1 
category and was based on the following components: Technology, Resource Availability, 
Governance and Sector Complexity. Select Level 1 categories, including Utilities, were more 
inherently complex when assigning Adaptive Capacity because there were multiple Level 2 
categories, spanning across diverse sectors (e.g. electrical power generation and transmission, 
telecommunications, water supply and irrigation, and sewage treatment). An Adaptive Capacity 
rating of ‘low’, ‘medium’ or ‘high’ is assigned for each Level 1 category assessed under the 
Infrastructure Area of Focus. A description and supporting rationale for the rating of each 
Adaptive Capacity component is provided below. 
The results from the Adaptive Capacity analysis are provided in Table 6.18. A regional analysis 
of Adaptive Capacity can be found in Appendix 11.

The results of the overall Adaptive Capacity ratings are ‘medium’ for all Level 1 categories. This 
is reflective of the individual components, which scored ‘medium’ for the majority of the Level 
1 categories. Note that a ‘high’ Technology rating does not reflect the state of the current 
infrastructure. 
Infrastructure impacts other Areas of Focus functionality and improvements to Adaptive 
Capacity would reduce climate risks for numerous indirect impacts identified throughout this 
assessment. A few examples of how higher Adaptive Capacity ratings would impact 
Infrastructure include: 
- 
Reduced downtime and less frequent maintenance 
- 
Longer useful life of infrastructure (less frequent replacement) 
- 
Reduced impacts on critical services that rely on infrastructure 
- 
Reduced environmental impacts in the event of a severe weather event  
One example of an improvement to Adaptive Capacity in this Area of Focus is the update and 
use of flood plain maps and associated mapping tools. This information and these tools are 
used by utility companies, Conservation Authorities and others to help determine areas under 
elevated flood risk. Where not already in place, updating these maps to include future climate 
 
14 Note these scores do not consider geographic location within the province. Please see Appendix 11 for 
regional Adaptive Capacity ratings. 
 
Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        170  
change would enable climate-sensitive growth and development, and protect people, 
infrastructure, and communities. 
6.9.2 Technology 
 A ‘high’ Adaptive Capacity rating for technology reflects existing technologies or evolving 
design parameter considerations that limit disturbances to infrastructure performance during 
extreme weather events or in response to changing climate conditions. Pipeline Transportation 
is considered to have a ‘high’ technology rating. This is reflective of the majority of pipeline 
transportation infrastructure being underground in Ontario which offers protection from many 
climate hazards (Swanson et al., 2021). Underground construction, paired with design code 
requirements that capture extreme events and low temperatures (> -40 °C), resulted in a ‘high’ 
technology rating (Bruschi et al., 2014; Canada’s Oil and Natural gas Producers, 2022). 
Stormwater management also has a ‘high’ technology rating, as stormwater infrastructure has 
advanced technology to support changing conditions and has several pilot projects underway to 
incorporate future climate conditions (Berggren, 2007; Andrey et al., 2014). The remaining 
Level 1 categories have a ‘medium’ technology rating, reflecting some evidence of technological 
advancements but the adoption of best practices could improve across all regions and sub-
components of the sector.  
6.9.3 Resource Availability 
Resource availability reflects the funding, capital, workforce and other tools available for each 
Level 1 category. Resource availability was rated ‘low’ for transportation due to limited funding 
available to build climate resilience into existing infrastructure (much of which is aging) 
(OCCIAR, 2019; Lemmen and Warren, 2014; Chattha, 2021). This category was also ranked ’low’ 
for buildings which reflects a lack of funding required to build climate resilience into existing 
(and aging) physical infrastructure. Land development and land use legislation can accomplish 
large-scale change (geographically and sector-wide) to support flood risk management which is 
one of the most significant risk factors for this category (Lacasse et al., 2020; Government of 
Ontario, 2020e; Chattha, 2021). The remaining Level 1 categories have a ‘medium’ rating, to 
reflect more available funding opportunities and tools (e.g. floodplain mapping) to manage and 
build resilient infrastructure, but are not yet widely shared or require more resources to 
complete. No Level 1 categories were assigned a ‘high’ rating under this Adaptive Capacity 
category. 
6.9.4 Governance 
Governance reflects any regulation or targets related to the climate impacts on infrastructure. 
Waste Management has a ‘low’ rating for Governance, indicative of the focus of governance on 
climate change mitigation, but little on climate change adaptation at this point (Government of 
 
Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        171  
Ontario, 2020e; 2021a). The remaining Level 1 categories have a ‘medium’ rating, reflecting a 
combination of governance support (including updating design guidelines). No Level 1 
categories were assigned a ‘high’ rating under this component of Adaptive Capacity. 
6.9.5 Sector Complexity 
High sector complexity is indicative of lower scores for Adaptive Capacity. Since utilities have a 
wide range of infrastructure included in this Level 1 category, it was considered to have high 
sector complexity and thus has a ‘low’ rating under Sector Complexity. This is driven by the 
numerous decision-makers and stakeholders that have roles to play in a complex decision-
making environment (Ontario Waste Management Association, 2021; CSA Group, 2019b). A 
‘high’ rating under this component reflects low complexity and a higher capacity to adapt. No 
Level 1 categories were assigned a ‘high’ rating under this component of Adaptive Capacity. 
6.10 Climate Adaptation Priorities 
The results of the PCCIA can shed light on current and emerging adaptation priorities for the 
province, based on the anticipated magnitude of risk, and associated capacity levels to respond 
and cope with climate change impacts. As described in Section 2.4.5, an adaptation priority is 
defined as any Level 1 or 2 category in a given region that has an Adaptive Capacity of ‘medium’ 
or lower and a risk score of ‘high’ or greater (see Appendix 12 for combined Level 1 and 
regional Adaptive Capacity ratings). 
Using the categories of Adaptive Capacity (technology, resource availability, governance, and 
sector complexity), each of the six Level 1 categories score a ‘medium’ Adaptive Capacity. When 
combining this with the regional Adaptive Capacity ratings, Central, Northeast and Northwest 
regions are found to have the lowest capacity rating. This section provides further detail on 
current and emerging adaptation priorities for the Infrastructure Area of Focus, considering 
existing levels of capacity and current and future risk scores. 
Current Adaptation Priorities 
There are a number of adaptation priorities that emerged for the current timeframe that 
correspond to Level 1 and 2 categories of ‘high risk’ with corresponding ‘medium’ levels of 
Adaptive Capacity. The current adaptation priorities are summarized in Table 6.19.

risk in Southwest and Eastern Ontario are not identified as current priorities based on the 
associated regional capacity (see Appendix 12). 
Emerging Adaptation Priorities 
By the mid-century, several additional ‘high’ risk categories will emerge for Ontario’s 
infrastructure, adding to those already identified for the current timeframe, all of which 
continue to persist. Emerging adaptation priorities for infrastructure by mid-century are 
summarized in Table 6.20.

Based on the results from Table 6.20, infrastructure themes that warrant priority for future 
(timeframe) adaptation include air transportation, electrical transmission, control and 
distribution, housing, other buildings, public buildings, and rail Level 2 categories. As the mid-
century approaches, the focus will remain in the same regions but with greater concentration 
on northern regions. For example, the Far North has more adaptation priorities for select 
categories, based on the accelerated rate of change in climate conditions and significant 
backlogs for building improvements. 
Extreme precipitation is the greatest driver of climate risk presented in all the identified priority 
areas, with high and extreme temperatures (Extreme Hot Days) being the second greatest. This 
commonality, along with the heightened vulnerability of northern regions, can be used to 
inform measures for building Adaptive Capacity across Ontario’s infrastructure systems.  
Advancing Adaptation  
Several adaptation measures can help to build resiliency and reduce risk to Ontario’s complex 
infrastructure systems. For example, integrating climate considerations into asset management 
is a cross-cutting adaptation option that builds climate resilience into infrastructure planning, 
design and maintenance (Lemmen and Warren, 2014).  
Climate change risk assessments at the infrastructure system or asset level are key for 
understanding vulnerability and identifying targeted options to enhance resilience. For 
example, the Public Infrastructure Engineering Vulnerability Committee (PIEVC) Protocol, can 
be applied to different sizes and types of infrastructure systems and assets. The Protocol 
supports users in identifying and assessing how different climate drivers affect infrastructure 
performance and life expectancy (Climate Risk Institute and Institute for Catastrophic Loss 
Reduction 2021).  
Infrastructure resiliency can also be improved through investments in proven and emerging 
technologies, integrating climate hazards into emergency response plan development, 
considering climate-focused recommendations in decision-making, and implementing updated 
climate-resilient design codes (Infrastructure Canada, 2022). Specific adaptation actions can 
include, improving tracking and monitoring technology, increasing the frequency of 
maintenance and inspections of infrastructure, locating new buildings outside of high-risk flood 
zones, increasing transmission tower height, burying distribution lines, increasing the 
 
Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        174  
temperature standard for the performance of railways, developing and practicing climate event 
(emergency) response plans, and valuing and protecting natural assets such as wetlands (OECD, 
2018; ONEIA, 2022; Nodelman et al., 2015; Fausto et al., 2016; Golder, 2021; TRCA, 2019; RVCA, 
2022). In addition, updating design standards regularly to meet future climate conditions can 
increase the climate resiliency of new infrastructure builds and developments (e.g. updating 
intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) parameters to reflect the change in duration and amount of 
rainfall of an extreme precipitation event) (Genivar, 2011; Chiotti, 2019; Fausto et al., 2016). 
Another opportunity for building climate resilience throughout Ontario’s infrastructure system 
is the development and posting of climate change datasets and associated tools for assessing 
climate impacts and risks. Natural Resources Canada’s Flood Hazard Identification Mapping 
Program (FHIMP) is designed to inform climate-smart land use decisions by making available 
floodplain mapping and related modeling and datasets (Natural Resources Canada, 2022a). 
Such tools and data that explicitly consider future climate conditions will support climate 
resilient infrastructure across Ontario. 
The PCCIA Adaptation Best Practices (ABP) Report (External Resource – 2) further references 
adaptation options for the Infrastructure Area of Focus. Ontario is equipped with adequate 
knowledge and existing practices to lessen and avoid many of the climate risks posed to 
infrastructure. A high-level summary is provided in Table 6.21, with asset-specific adaptation 
options are available in the ABP Report.

7.0 Natural Environment Area of Focus 
7.1 Overview  
Climate change is already a threat to Ontario’s natural environment, and is 
expected to drive risks to species, habitats, and ecosystem services even higher in the future. 
PCCIA climate change risk profiles are rising to ‘high’ by mid-century for almost all natural 
systems and species. By end of century, one quarter of risks under this Area of Focus are 
expected to be ‘very high’ (see Table 7.1). 
Regional differences are important to recognize, with human development compounding 
climate risks in regions further south. In northern regions, accelerated rates of climatic change 
are driving risks. Sustaining and amplifying existing natural features to be resilient to climate 
change provides support for ecosystem structure and function, contributes to carbon 
management in support of GHG reduction, provides core elements for cultural benefit and 
provides subsequent health benefits for the human population.

7.2 Ontario’s Natural Environment 
Ontario’s natural environment is comprised of a diversity of species, forests, wetlands, lakes, 
streams, and other natural features, with intrinsic, socio-economic, and cultural value due to 
the essential goods and services that it provides to Ontarians (Pascual et al., 2010; Office of the 
Auditor General of Ontario, 2021b). Ontario’s natural environment, including more than 30,000 
species, sustains the province’s biodiversity (Ontario Biodiversity Council, 2021). A healthy 
natural environment also sustains ecosystem functions and cycles that are essential lifelines, 
including the distribution of water, climate regulation and air filtration, and provide services like 
access to water, medicines, natural resources, and space for recreation (Haines-Young and 
Potschin, 2017). Recognizing the inherent value of the natural environment and of Ontarians’ 
right to a healthful environment, Ontario’s Environmental Bill of Rights (1993) outlines the 
shared goal and responsibility to protect, conserve and restore the natural environment for the 
benefit of current and future generations. Efforts to monetize the annual flows of ecosystem 
services in Ontario demonstrate the economic merits of protecting nature (Green Analytics, 
2017). 
Ontario’s natural environment consists of three distinct ecozones that are based on ecology, 
climate and geology: Hudson Bay Lowlands, Ontario Shield, and Mixedwood Plains. The six 
Ontario regions used in the PCCIA relate to these ecozones in various ways (see Figure 7.1). 
The Far North region encompasses the entirety of the Hudson Bay Lowlands and carries global 
significance for carbon storage. The vast peatland ecosystems also hold immense cultural value 
to 31 First Nations communities that inhabit the area (Harris et al, 2022; McLaughlin and 
Webster, 2014; Wilkinson and Shulz, 2012). A significant portion of the Far North is within the 
Ontario Shield ecozone comprised of the northwestern range of Ontario’s boreal forest which is 
home to northern species at risk such as wolverine (Gulo gulo) and boreal woodland caribou 
(Rangifer tarandus caribou). The significance of this region is encoded in the Far North Act 
which describes the region’s cultural value, ecological systems, and capacity for carbon storage 
and sequestration (Far North Act, 2010, S.O. 2010, c. 18, amended 2021).  
 
 
Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        179  
Figure 7.1: Map of PCCIA Regions and Ontario Ecozones (Hudson Bay Lowlands, Ontario 
Shield and Mixedwood Plains) 
 
The Northwest and Northeast PCCIA regions divide the Ontario Shield into two regions which 
are characterized by the presence of the boreal forest and mixed forests in the south, with 
forest fires as common natural disturbances (Crins et al., 2009). Black spruce and tamarack 
dominate in conifer swamps and peatlands in low-lying areas in the Northwest and Northeast 
regions, whereas mixed and deciduous forests dominate in southern part of the Ontario Shield.  
The Eastern region consists of the lower part of the Ontario Shield and the eastern portion of 
the Mixedwood Plains ecozone. The Central region is in the Mixedwood Plains ecozone and 
contains Lake Simcoe, an ecologically important body of water, significant for its lucrative 
recreational fishing industry, fresh drinking water provision, agricultural irrigation, and 
proximity to high-density human populations (North et al., 2013). The Southwest and Central 
regions are in the Mixedwood Plains ecozone and contain most of Carolinian forest zone in 
Canada. These two regions have the highest human population density in Ontario, yet contain 
 
Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        180  
one-third of the rare, threatened, and endangered species found in all of Canada (Centre for 
Land and Water Stewardship, 1994). 
Each of these regions face unique threats and challenges from the effects of climate change, 
including considerations of non-climatic pressures (e.g. human development) (Kraus and Hebb, 
2020). 
7.3 Defining Natural Environment in the Context of the PCCIA  
To assess the impacts of climate change on the natural environment, this Area of Focus was 
divided into seven Level 1 categories in such a way that it covered the intrinsic value of nature 
and biodiversity, natural resources, and values important to humans. This structure included 
Flora, Fauna, Aquatic Ecosystems, Terrestrial Ecosystems, Regulating Services, Provisioning 
Services, and Ecosystem Cultural Services. Flora and Fauna Level 1 categories comprised species 
illustrating climate change impacts on various taxonomic groups. Ecosystems are assemblages 
of living and non-living components of the environment linked together through nutrient cycles 
and energy flows and are represented in this assessment as land cover types. Ecosystem 
services are the benefits people derive from nature. Regulating services are required for the 
maintenance of Earth’s systems and comprise of ecosystem processes that moderate natural 
phenomena. These natural phenomena can affect human health, safety, and comfort. 
Provisioning services are flows of nutritional, non-nutritional, and energetic outputs from living 
and natural abiotic systems; cultural ecological services are non-material and generally non-
consumptive outputs of ecosystems that affect physical and mental states of people (Haines-
Young and Potschin, 2017). 
Each Level 1 category was broken down into multiple Level 2 categories, which were the focus 
of the impact assessment (see Figure 7.2). Specific species or species groupings, land cover 
types, and ecosystem services were selected for quantitative risk assessment based on their 
ecological significance and climate sensitivity, their distribution and abundance, importance to 
Ontario communities and information availability. The selection of Level 2 categories and 
associated details was also based on advice from environmental professionals working in 
Ontario, to represent a mix of species and systems that could reflect the effects of climate 
change on the broader level, to provide a clear picture of climate risks to the Natural 
Environment Area of Focus. The Level 2 categories for Flora, Fauna, and Ecosystems are 
supported by many indicator species defined in Ontario’s Significant Wildlife Habitat Mitigation 
Support Tool (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, 2014c). Figure 7.2 below, 
lists the Level 1 and Level 2 categories that were assessed and further information on each 
Level 2 component appears in Appendix 1.  
 
Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        181  
Examining climate change impacts at the species level was not possible due to the vast number 
of plants, animals, and lichen in Ontario. Instead, taxonomic groups include select, illustrative 
species which allows consideration of a mix of species with wide and limited distribution, 
varying levels of sensitivity to climate change, diversity in conservation status, information 
availability, and the inclusion of a few species of human interest (e.g. managed species). This 
ranking system indicates the relative rarity of a species sub-nationally and relative risk of 
disappearing from the province due to threats such as habitat loss, invasive species, pollution, 
and unsustainable use (Ontario Biodiversity Council, 2021). Values range from SH (possibly 
extirpated), S1 (critically imperilled), S2 (imperiled), S3 (vulnerable), S4 (apparently secure) to 
S5 (secure) (NatureServe, nd). Figure 7.3 shows the breakout of species included in the 
assessment by the numbers.

For ease of assessment, the Ontario Land Cover Compilation (2014a) was used to consider 
individual habitat types (e.g. land cover), as opposed to a mix that would be present in each 
ecozone. The nomenclature from the Ontario Land Cover Compilation was retained (e.g. using 
mudflats instead of coastal wetlands). The final selection comprised ten of 27 land cover types, 
including a mix of localized and widespread habitats, and considering the potential amount of 
literature on each habitat type and climate change in our selection. Land cover data from the 
NALCMS (North American Land Change Monitoring System) 2015 Land Cover project (Natural 
Resources Canada, 2015) was used to determine the extent of coniferous forest and deciduous 
forest in each PCCIA region and included these ecosystem types where land cover comprises 
two percent of land cover or more. 
For the assessment of ecosystem services, the Common International Classification for 
Ecosystem Services (CICES) was used as a point of departure. We selected seven ecosystem 
services, based on the potential amount of literature available and importance for the province, 
 
Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        184  
with a roughly even distribution among regulating services, provisioning, and cultural ecological 
services. 
Natural environments within Ontario’s regions are diverse and not all Level 2 categories of 
ecosystems were assessed for each PCCIA region, nor are all illustrative of Flora and Fauna 
present across PCCIA regions (as shown in Table 7.2). By design, a mixture of species and 
ecosystems were included that are localized and of specific significance to regions where they 
occur and those with a widespread distribution.

7.4 Natural Environment Risk Snapshot across Ontario 
Summary of Risks  
A changing climate is affecting and will continue to affect Ontario’s natural environment in 
multi-faceted ways (Douglas and Pearson, 2022). Climate change presents direct stressors to 
species, influences the timing of life stages and population dynamics, species distribution and 
abundance, as well as water quantity and quality, and frequencies and intensities of 
disturbances (e.g. wildfires and pest outbreaks). In turn, these changes influence each other 
causing cascading effects that can reduce or magnify the initial response. Climate change 
impacts exacerbate threats to biodiversity and ecosystem health caused by human-created 
stressors, such as habitat loss and fragmentation and pollution. The cascading interactions 
make isolating distinct risk scenarios driven by individual climate variables challenging. In 
addition, species and ecosystems have an inherent ability to adjust to or cope with biophysical 
change, although natural Adaptive Capacity is the least understood of the three dimensions of 
climate change vulnerability (Thurman et al., 2020). 
Changing climate is already a stressor or threat to Ontario’s natural systems and the benefits 
humans derive from them. The current risk profile indicates that about one in ten risks 
evaluated are currently “high”, with the majority rated as ‘medium’. Only a small number of 
specific risk scenarios are scored ‘low’ (at current) and all pertain to regulating services (carbon 
storage in southern Ontario). By mid-century, the risk profile shifts substantially, with most risks 
rated as ‘high’. By the end of the century about 25% of the risk scenarios are ‘very high’. At this 
aggregate level results are presented for a high-emissions scenario (RCP8.5). Differences in risk 
profiles between RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 are presented in Appendix 7. 
Risk levels differ by natural element (Level 1 and 2 categories) and across Ontario’s regions. 
Risks to fauna reach the highest levels by the end of century in the Eastern, Central, Southwest 
regions, with levels of expected development, economic and (human) population growth 
exacerbating climate stresses to individuals and populations in regions with high biodiversity 
(Kraus and Hebb, 2020) (see Figure 7.4). When considering risks to aquatic and terrestrial 
ecosystems, Ontario’s Central region and three northern regions stand out as having highest 
risk levels by the end of the century, with much of the risk driven by the impacts of climate 
change on northern wetlands ecosystems, including changes in community structure and 
matter and nutrient cycling, as well as risks from impacts to lake ecology (e.g. mixing and 
oxygenation). 
 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        189  
Key Climate Drivers  
Annual and seasonal increases in temperature represent the broadest climate variable group 
affecting elements of the natural environment. Mean annual temperature or mean seasonal 
temperature change were not among the main climate variables in the PCCIA (see Section 3.0), 
therefore Growing Degree Days generally is used as a proxy. Just over 40% of all natural 
environment risk scenarios relate to changes in Growing Degree Days (see Table 7.3). Examples 
of impacts in such risk scenarios include temperature-driven changes in species life-cycle 
events, mismatches in food web dynamics, habitat-related stress to species (e.g. climate 
suitability), redistribution of plants and animals, and changes to ecosystem processes (e.g. 
carbon and nutrient cycling). 
Changes in the nature and timing of precipitation also present significant stressors to elements 
of the natural environment, and are driven by species’ reliance on specific hydroperiods, 
community and ecosystem attributes adapted to specific hydrological conditions, snow, and ice 
regimes, among others. For example, Moisture Deficits causing fluctuations in water levels have 
the potential to change vegetation and nesting habitat in wetlands. Reduced snow cover can 
promote overwintering and expanded ranges among species with deep snow as a limiting 
factor on survival. A large portion of natural environment risk scenarios involve a precipitation-
related variable as a dominant driver of risk. A full list of all major climate variables that are 
driving the highest risks to Ontario’s Natural Environment Area of Focus by Level 1 category and 
region is available in Appendix 8.

appears empty for that region. 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        191  
Regional variation also exists for the concentration of risks evaluated as ‘very high’ and their 
relative change in number from mid-century to end of century. In the 2050s, Southwest and 
Central regions have the highest number of ‘very high’ risks, and this number doubles by the 
2080s. The number of ‘very high’ risks in the Far North also doubled from 2050s to 2080s. ‘Very 
high’ risks increase six-fold in Eastern Ontario. In southern Ontario, socio-economic factors 
prominently magnify risk levels, notably for the flow of ecosystem services and in relation to 
the fate of species at risk. The Far North contains vast swathes of ecosystems and related 
ecosystem processes of global significance (e.g. peatlands as natural carbon stores), with 
climate threats combined with potential development representing risks that are not only 
extensive, but also irreversible. 
7.5 Approach to Assessing Climate Impacts on the Natural 
Environment  
A total of 921 unique climate risk scenarios were identified across the seven Level 1 categories 
under this Area of Focus and were part of the quantitative assessment. Although the overall 
PCCIA methodology focused on assessing direct impacts (see Section 2.0), this restricted 
approach for the natural environment was not always appropriate. Climate change risks to 
flows of ecosystem services are mediated by the health and integrity of biotic and abiotic 
systems and their vulnerability to climate variables, therefore the assessment of climate risk to 
provisioning, regulating, and ecosystem cultural services require an understanding of climate-
driven impairments or enhancements of underlying natural assets. 
Climate risk was defined for each Natural Environment Level 1 category by assessing risk at the 
scale of selected Level 2 species, ecosystem, or ecosystem service present within regions. Thus, 
Level 1 category scores are representative of the selected proxies associated with each. For 
Level 2 categories pertaining to Flora and Fauna, illustrative species were selected based on 
information on climate change impact and vulnerability, regional relevance, and diversity in 
representation in conservation status, range, and human interest at the for each Level 1 
category. In other words, certain Level 2 risk scores do not depict overall risk for components 
within the category, but rather present an illustration of risk for the category and inform a fuller 
picture for the Level 1 categories.  
The total number of climate variables assessed in scenarios for different Level 1 categories 
ranged from four (for Flora, Aquatic Ecosystems, Provisioning Services, and Regulating Services) 
to seven (for Fauna). The types of climate variables assessed for Level 2 categories depended 
on evidence of an ecosystem or physical response in the literature (e.g. documented 
sensitivity), geographic location/distribution, and advice from expert stakeholders received 
through the PCCIA engagement process. Growing Degree Days, Degree Days <0˚C, and Cooling 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        192  
Degree Days all act as proxy climate variables for a warming climate or overall change in annual 
average temperature (see Section 3.0 for further information on the definition of climate 
variables used in the PCCIA). 
Within this Area of Focus, climate variables that can jointly influence impact pathways (e.g. 
interactive effects) and impact pathways unique to certain regions of Ontario are included. For 
example, the combined effect of changes in temperature, precipitation and frequency or 
intensity of extreme conditions is notable for freshwater fish. Warmer water temperatures 
affect the health, abundance, and persistence of species, with drought exacerbating 
vulnerability if species are forced into isolated pools and floods (and related sedimentation), 
causing negative or positive impacts depending on the timing of species reproductive cycle. 
Changes in temperature, precipitation, and intensity or frequency of drought conditions also 
shape wildfire (a natural disturbance), leading to complex impact pathways on terrestrial 
landscapes. Ontario’s Far North is underlain by continuous, discontinuous, and sporadic 
permafrost and contains marine coast, which are unique traits compared to other provincial 
regions, and highlight the interconnected nature of abiotic and biotic systems. For example, 
warming temperatures are accelerating permafrost degradation, which may lower the water 
table, cause slumping, and degrade water quality. In turn, these impacts can lead to loss of 
coastal wetlands including marshes and shoreline erosion, with cascading impacts on the 
region’s biodiversity, such as through degradation of habitat for several species at risk. 
As described in Section 2.0, a single risk scenario was selected for each unique risk interaction. 
The likelihood of a risk scenario occurrence and associated severity of consequence(s) for each 
selected component of the natural environment were assessed and combined to form a risk 
score. Subsequently, risk scores for individual scenarios were compiled to provide an overall 
risk score for each Level 1 and 2 category.  
Consequences for this Area of Focus were evaluated based on two sets of criteria pertaining to 
environmental damage:  
- 
Environmental loss and damage/ability to recover from impact (modified from Murray 
et al., 2016) 
- 
Disruption / enhancements to flows of ecosystem services 
The first criterion was applied to climate risks associated with species and ecosystems and the 
second was applied to climate risks for ecosystem services. Literature and expert judgment 
were used to support consequence scoring. Consequences in relation to environmental loss and 
damage were assessed qualitatively based on the magnitude of impact in space and time. 
Consequences in relation to service disruptions were assessed qualitatively based on the 
geographic reach of the impact, population affected and / or required human response. The 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        193  
consequence criteria applied to this Area of Focus can be found in Table 7.4. The first set of 
criteria focuses on the ability to recover from climate impacts and the other focuses on the 
ability of natural assets, such as wetlands and forests, to deliver ecosystem services despite 
climate threats. The first set of criteria was applied to climate change risks associated with 
species and ecosystems and the second for climate change risks for ecosystem services. 
Examples of consequences related to direct and indirect impacts on species and ecosystems 
include: 
- 
Change in abiotic conditions (e.g. freshwater hydrological regimes) 
- 
Direct stresses to individuals and populations (e.g. physiology and behaviour of 
individuals, population dynamics) 
- 
Habitat-related stresses to individuals and populations (e.g. change in habitat quality, 
loss of suitable habitat) 
- 
Change in synecological relations, specifically change in food web interactions 
- 
Change in community structure (e.g. relative abundances within a community, 
community composition) 
- 
Change in ecosystem processes and dynamics (e.g. energy flow and nutrient or matter 
cycle-related ecosystem processes) 
Examples of consequences related to direct and indirect impacts on ecosystem services include: 
- 
Change in abiotic conditions (e.g. freshwater hydrological regimes) 
- 
Direct stresses to individuals and populations (e.g. physiology and behaviour of 
individuals) 
- 
Change in community structure (e.g. relative abundances within a community) 
- 
Change in ecosystem processes and dynamics (e.g. energy flow and nutrient or matter 
cycle-related ecosystem processes) 
- 
Change in access to services  
- 
Change in availability of services 
- 
Change in quality of services

 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        195  
To update risk consequence scores for the 2050s and 2080s time periods, socio-economic 
projections were considered along with specific assumptions for natural environment elements 
in different regions across Ontario (see Box 7). 
 
7.6 Limitations of the Natural Environment Assessment 
The impacts of climate change on the natural environment are widespread, multi-faceted and 
inextricably linked to the well-being of human communities and regional economies. 
Additionally, impacts of climate change on living things (species and ecosystems) trigger 
adaptive responses that can be difficult to predict. These and other complexities limit the utility 
of generic climate change impact assessment methodologies at broad geographic scales. 
Box 7: Socio-economic Projections Applied to Natural Environment Area of Focus 
As noted, a changing climate is one stressor or type of threat facing Ontario’s natural 
environment. Impacts from other anthropogenic stressors linked to the loss of biodiversity 
and ecosystem services from development, economic and population growth include: 
habitat loss, loss of permeable surfaces, habitat fragmentation, increased pollution waste 
and pollution streams, and the introduction and movement of invasive species, among 
others. 
As described in Section 4.0, socio-economic projections were applied to risk evaluation 
based on the influence on likelihood of consequence and impact for future risk scenarios. 
This enabled the consideration of non-climate stressors in our calculation of natural 
environment risks. For the Natural Environment Area of Focus, we used projections of three 
socio-economic indices to “uprate” likelihood of impact or consequence scores as part of 
the risk calculation. The three indices include: Ontario Population Density Index by Region 
(Population / km2); Ontario Housing Stock Index by Region and Type of Housing; and 
Ontario GDP Index by Region and Industry (CDN $2020) (all industries). These three indices 
(and related sub-indicators) are proxies for non-climate drivers and stressors affecting 
water, land and resources, and wildlife. For species and ecosystems, it was assumed that 
significant increases in socio-economic factors from one period to another justified raising 
the likelihood of consequence score by one level due to exacerbated vulnerability 
associated with population growth and development. In addition, for ecosystem services, 
the consequences of impact scores were raised by one level, reflecting an increase in the 
demand for ecosystem services and, therefore, more severe consequences if service flows 
become impaired. 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        196  
Specific Area of Focus limitations within the PCCIA are related to the 1) scope and data inputs, 
2) mechanisms of climate impact, and 3) interdependencies and cascading impacts. 
Scope and Data Inputs 
Ontario’s natural environment is incredibly complex and diverse. Within the Ontario PCCIA, 
risks were evaluated based on illustrative species, habitats and ecosystem services. The 
assessment was necessarily constrained due to the magnitude and diversity of species and 
features. Local data, such as monitoring and GIS information that characterizes habitat or 
species-specific tolerance and response thresholds support the data-driven approach to this 
impact assessment. However, robust, spatially-explicit information on ecological or physical 
responses was not always available to complete an internally-focused (Area of Focus-specific) 
assessment. More detailed species or habitat-specific case studies could inform how climate 
impacts could change ecosystems in specific areas of Ontario. The final impact assessment 
scores are reliant on a combination of qualitative considerations from literature reviews and 
expert judgement of the consulting team and stakeholders. 
Mechanisms of Impact 
The interaction between climate variables and Level 2 categories are captured via the 
formulation and analysis of risk scenarios. Formulation of risk scenarios involved desk-based 
research and application of expert judgement. In developing the risk interactions and scenarios, 
several assumptions were made about the mechanisms of climate impact. Importantly, the 
scope of the PCCIA engagement process (see Appendix 3 for engagement details) precluded 
reviewing detailed interim products, such as the full list of risk interactions and scenarios. 
Future assessments should consider steps to bring together knowledge holders to conceptually 
map impact pathways and validate and adjust risk scenarios through a participatory process.  
Complex and Cascading Impacts 
The application of the ‘Most Probable Worst-Case Event’ for risk scenarios and assessment is a 
particularly challenging concept to apply to the Natural Environment Area of Focus. Many of 
the impacts to natural environment may be gradual and/or complex, rather than one single 
worst-case event causing significant impacts. Further, the indirect and cascading impacts of 
climate change defy quantitative and semi-quantitative impact assessments of the scope 
typically desired at the provincial level (e.g. breadth of climate variables, Level 1 and 2 
categories included). Raising the visibility of indirect and cascading impacts stemming from 
impairments to the natural environment is particularly important given, a) the heightened 
recognition of strategies to address the twin crises of climate change and biodiversity loss and 
b) the fundamental role played by ecosystem resilience in supporting resilience of other 
systems like natural resource industries, agriculture, human health, and wellness (CCA, 2019). 
This PCCIA demonstrates five broad types of cross-sectoral impacts that merit consideration in 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        197  
Ontario’s adaptation planning (see Section 10.0). In future assessments, further scenarios of 
cascading impacts should be explored and discussed, tailored to different environments and 
ecoregions.  
7.7 Current and Future Risks  
7.7.1 Fauna  
Overview 
Fauna refers to the animal life in a particular region. Fauna are the fish, mammals, birds, 
insects/spiders and other organisms that are present throughout all regions of Ontario, with 
their range depending on features such as climate, land-use patterns, physiographic regions, 
and forest types (Dobbyn, 1994). Ontario has high species diversity relative to other 
jurisdictions in Canada (Ontario Biodiversity Council, 2021), with Southwest, Central and 
Eastern regions ranking among the most biodiverse ecoregions in Canada (Kraus and Hebb, 
2020). Within the categories of fauna assessed for this report (fishes, mammals, birds, 
insects/spiders, molluscs, reptiles and amphibians), insects/spiders make up about 90% of the 
list of Ontario species maintained by the Natural Heritage Information Centre. Although most of 
these fauna species are secure, about one percent are species at risk – that is – species that are 
in danger of disappearing (Office of the Auditor General of Ontario, 2021a). Globally, key 
threats to species diversity include habitat loss/degradation, overexploitation, invasive species, 
climate change, and pollution (IPBES, 2019). Threats to biodiversity are similar for fauna in 
Ontario overall but differ by region and extent of development pressures. 
Fauna provides numerous social, economic, and cross-sectoral benefits to people and their 
well-being (Nantel et al., 2014). Important ecosystem services such as pollination, food 
provision, and nature-based recreation depend on healthy fauna, and the broader ecological 
communities and functions they support. Species, including fauna, have diverse value beyond 
their usefulness to humans as a resource or natural asset, including intrinsic values and 
intangible values tied to culture (e.g. Indigenous views of boreal woodland caribou as sacred 
gifts from the Creator) (Anderson et al., 2022; Assembly of First Nations and David Suzuki 
Foundation, 2013).  
The impacts of climate change on fauna occur at different levels, affecting individual species, 
populations, or communities of species (Geyer et al., 2011), with vulnerability to these impacts 
depending on capacity for dispersal or movement, sensitivity to temperature and precipitation 
change, reliance on particular physical features, synchrony with other species on which they 
depend, and genetic factors (NatureServe, 2016). Species’ vulnerability to climate change is 
often due to more than one of these factors. For example, species may be unable to shift their 
range to accommodate rising temperature because of natural or anthropogenic barriers, 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        198  
limited dispersal ability, or their reliance on a specialized habitat niche (Brinker et al., 2018). 
Further, one single climate variable, such as temperature rise can cause direct and cascading 
impacts for fauna. Temperatures exceeding species’ thermal tolerance force a shift to their 
ranges toward cooler environments (Brinker et al., 2018; Soroye et al., 2020; Dove-Thompson 
et al., 2011). Changing annual and seasonal temperatures provide additional challenges to 
native fauna by accommodating the spread of invasive and predatory species whose ranges 
may also shift to new environments favorable to their niches (Brinker et al., 2018, Mortsch et 
al., 2006). All of these stresses, combined with non-climate stresses, can lead to local or 
widespread declines in species populations and a loss of biodiversity.  
For the purposes of the PCCIA, seven Level 2 categories were used to assess the risks associated 
with the direct impacts to fauna: fishes, mammals, birds, insects/spiders, molluscs, reptiles, and 
amphibians. To make the assessment tractable, illustrative species were selected for 
quantitative risk assessment, but it is critical to recognize the regional diversity of fauna and the 
unique climate sensitivities of species (including conservation status) in extrapolating or 
generalizing risk results to the level of taxonomic groups. Nevertheless, patterns of climate 
change vulnerability across taxonomic groups have been illustrated by previous research. Most 
recently, a landmark Ontario study on the climate change vulnerability of species in the Great 
Lakes Basin shed light on high-level patterns of vulnerabilities across taxonomic groups. Brinker 
et al., (2018) found that birds, insects/spiders, and reptiles are generally found to be more 
resilient to climate change impact while species that depend heavily on water (e.g. fishes, 
amphibians, and molluscs) tend to be more vulnerable. Support for comprehensive and broad-
scale studies such as Brinker et al., (2018) is necessary to continue building Ontario’s knowledge 
base on climate change risks to the natural environment. 
Direct Impacts 
The following sections provide brief characterizations of each Level 2 category assessed for 
fauna across Ontario and related risk results. Risk scenarios for fauna were driven by climate 
variables related to temperature and precipitation, including average temperature, high and 
extreme temperature, Moisture Deficit, extreme precipitation events and winter precipitation. 
Changes in severity and occurrence of assessed climate variables could lead to environmental 
consequences of the following types: 
- 
Changes in the physiology and behaviour of individuals 
- 
Changes in population dynamics 
- 
Increases in habitat-related stresses 
- 
Changes in food web interactions

Suitable thermal habitat is significantly reduced in the 
summer for the cold-water fish brook trout, requiring the 
species to seek refuge. A lack of habitat connectivity 
prevents this and causes local extirpations and a loss in 
indigenous brook trout biodiversity.

Amphibians 
According to the Natural Heritage Information Centre, 34 species of amphibians are present in 
Ontario, with under 20% of those species threatened or of special conservation concern (Office 
of the Auditor General of Ontario, 2021a). Exposure to warmer seasonal air temperatures, 
spring temperatures in particular, is one mechanism of potential climate change impact for 
amphibians, with effects including changes in the rate and timing of lifecycle events (e.g. earlier 
breeding) and related implications on synecological relations (Blaustein et al., 2001). Due to 
their semi-permeable skin and high reliance on aquatic resources throughout their lifecycle, 
amphibians are also highly sensitive to climate-change induced shifts in aquatic resources and 
environments (Parmesan, 2007).  
Changing length in hydroperiods, seasonal shifts in freeze-thaw periods, and drought-prone 
summers pose significant threats to amphibian habitat and breeding grounds (Luymes and 
Chow-Fraser, 2022). Amphibians typically reproduce in ephemeral pools, which are influenced 
by the phenology of a wetland’s hydroperiod (Brinker et al., 2018). Forested ephemeral pools 
among unimpacted forest networks are thus integral to amphibian recruitment, but increasing 
habitat fragmentation and alterations from encroaching urban and agricultural sectors, 
particularly in Southwest and Central Ontario, have contributed to greater canopy openness 
and declines in wetland habitat (Luymes and Chow-Fraser, 2022).  
Projected changes in rates of precipitation and evaporation owing to higher temperatures can 
further decline their accessibility to these pools, resulting in cascading impacts on reproductive 
success, population sizes and overall health (Brinker et al., 2018). Among amphibian habitat 
types, large permanent wetlands are afforded more protection, while temporary wetlands such 
as ephemeral pools are underrepresented among management and conservation efforts 
(Luymes and Chow-Fraser, 2022). 
Climate risks to amphibians were assessed across the six PCCIA regions, with risk scenarios 
driven by a range of climate variables including, temperature changes (Growing Degree Days) 
and drought conditions (Moisture Deficit). Northern dusky salamander (Desmognathus fuscus) 
and spring peeper (Pseudacris crucifer) are the illustrative species used to highlight climate risks 
to both localized and endangered species as well as widespread and secure species, 
respectively (Box 8).

Northern dusky 
salamander (Credit: K. 
Ueda, CC BY NC 2.0) 
 
Northern dusky salamander is an amphibian with distribution in 
Ontario that is restricted to a single stream site in the Niagara 
Gorge (e.g. Southwest region) (COSEWIC,, 2012). Although 
globally listed as a secure species, it extremely rare and especially 
vulnerable to extirpation from the province, listed as an 
endangered species both provincially and federally (Brinker et al., 
2018, COSEWIC, 2012). Aside from limitations on suitable 
habitats, major threats to this salamander include environmental 
and demographic stochasticity, disruption or contamination of 
groundwater discharge sources, and streambank erosion. 
 
Spring peeper (Credit: P. 
Paplanus, CC BY 2.0) 
Spring peeper is a tiny frog with widespread distribution and 
abundance in Ontario. It is found in a wide range of non-urban 
habitats across Ontario’s regions, tending to breed in temporary 
woodland ponds, summer under leaf litter and hibernate under 
logs and loose bark. The spring peeper’s breeding call in the 
spring –a loud, high-pitched peep repeated over and over – is 
widely recognized by Ontarians and is one of the earliest frog 
breeding calls. Its blood chemistry allows it to withstand 
temperatures a few degrees below zero (Ontario Nature, nd). 
 
The current climate risk profile associated with the environmental consequences from climate 
change impacts to amphibians is rated as ‘medium’ in all regions, except in the Southwest 
region where current risk levels are ‘high’, influenced by the high vulnerability of the Northern 
dusky salamander. By mid-century risk levels are ‘high’ across southern Ontario (Central, 
Eastern and Southwest), whereas in northern Ontario risk levels stay at ‘medium’. By late 
century (2080s) risk levels are ‘high’ across the province. The risk results are consistent 
regardless of whether emissions follow a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5) or a moderate 
emissions scenario (RCP4.5), with socio-economic projections of population growth, urban and 
industrial development exacerbating risk in southern Ontario. Current risk levels are consistent 
with observed impacts of warming temperatures on reproductive processes within amphibian 
communities (Walpole et al., 2012; Klaus and Lougheed, 2013).  
Warmer springs alter breeding behaviour of amphibians, reducing the risks from reproductive 
failure but increasing the level of niche overlaps among species. Spring peepers demonstrate 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        202  
advancing phenology (e.g. earlier reproduction) in correlation with warmer spring temperatures 
(Blaustein et al., 2001; Klaus and Lougheed 2013; Gibbs and Breisch, 2001). Since spring 
peepers require ephemeral pools to reproduce successfully, breeding earlier in the spring 
reduces the risk from reproductive failure when vernal pools dry out later in the season 
(Walpole et al., 2012). However, if rising temperatures lead to ephemeral pool evaporation 
before breeding can occur, reproductive success could decline. Because amphibians are key 
components of many ecosystems, changing reproductive timing for spring breeding anurans 
(frogs and toads) like spring peepers has potential to affect other species within their 
communities, creating mismatches in food webs, and ultimately affecting population health 
(Walpole et al., 2012; Blaustein et al., 2001).  
More intense or frequent dry conditions have potentially profound implications for amphibian 
population and species persistence. For example, northern dusky salamanders rely on their 
moist skin for respiration (Markle et al., 2013), making drought a particularly impactful climate 
variable. Adult northern dusky salamanders require suitably moist habitat to ensure that they 
can effectively absorb oxygen through their skin and mucous membranes (Markle et al., 2013; 
CESCC, 2016). Larvae are reliant on access to slow-moving streams or seeps for eight months of 
the year before they metamorphose (Markle et al., 2013). A supraseasonal drought (hydrologic 
drought) of one year or more, results in quite a low probability of persistence of the species. 
Droughts would reduce water flow in the stream sites where northern dusky salamanders are 
found in Ontario. No other suitable habitat develops near their stream sites to serve as a refuge 
for temporary emigration during a drought. The probability of persistence after a four-year 
drought is almost zero (Price et al., 2012). Given that the northern dusky salamander is 
restricted to one site in Ontario, such climate conditions may cause extirpation from the 
province.  
Birds 
According to the Natural Heritage Information Centre, 511 species of birds inhabit Ontario’s 
forests, grasslands, fields, and shores, possessing diverse habitat requirements, diets, and 
periods of activity (González-Salazar et al., 2014; OMNR, 2011). Birds are less vulnerable to 
climate change relative to other assessed groups of Ontario fauna, due to their ability to 
disperse (Brinker et al., 2018). Nevertheless, risk factors to birds from climate change include 
gains or losses in habitat (for breeding, migration, and other purposes), degree of dependence 
on ecological synchronicities, degree of habitat specialization, and migration distances in the 
case of non-resident birds (Galbraith et al., 2014).  
Migratory birds are vulnerable to climate-induced changes in phenology, with large-scale shifts 
in spring migration times already observed in the range of two days per decade, or one day per 
degree Celsius of warming (Hurlbert and Liang, 2012; Usui et al., 2016). The long-term 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        203  
consequences of temperature-related shifts in migration timing on species and whole 
populations, such as range expansions along poleward margins (Coristine and Kerr, 2015), are 
uncertain but examples of shorter-term responses are available. For example, extended 
breeding seasons due to earlier spring arrivals of species can disrupt synchronicities in food or 
habitat resource availability and abundance (Hoover and Schelsky, 2020). Longer distance 
migratory birds, whose migration timing is primarily influenced by the length of daylight (e.g. 
photo period), face additional challenges with local changes along their migratory path, as they 
may be unable to adjust departure dates to conditions at stopover sites and in their arrival 
breeding grounds (Zaifman et al., 2017, Hoover and Schelsky, 2020).  
For waterfowl, local air temperatures and the amount of snow cover are influential factors in 
migration timing, and in general, northward shifts in wintering range have been observed 
(Thurber et al., 2020). 
Birds are sensitive to climate change impacts on breeding, wintering, and migration habitat. For 
waterfowl, spring-time water levels and wetland habitat are critical to breeding success, 
including pair density and quality of breeding (Dove-Thompson et al., 2011). Habitat quality, as 
determined by the network and permanence of wetland complexes, is important to waterfowl 
and shorebird breeding and influences annual population sizes. Periods of drought and 
variability in rainfall, combined with land-use/land-cover changes pose significant threats to 
populations in Ontario (Dove-Thompson et al., 2011, Galbraith et al., 2014). For coastal 
shorebirds, sea level rise and more intense storms will reduce wintering habitat, especially in 
areas affected by land surface subsidence (Galbraith et al., 2014). Climate change-induced 
losses in terrestrial ecosystems (see Section 7.7.4) will impact bird species associated with 
forested and vegetated habitats for breeding, food sources, and migratory stopover habitat, 
including migratory, perching songbirds and ground-dwelling birds.  
Climate risks to birds were assessed across the six PCCIA regions, with risk scenarios driven by a 
range of climate variables, including temperature changes (Growing Degree Days and Growing 
Season Length as proxies for changes in average annual temperatures), low temperature 
(Degree Days < 0˚C), winter precipitation (Rain to Snow Ratio), extreme precipitation, and 
drought (Moisture Deficit).  
Wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), prothonotary warbler (Protonotoria citrea), piping plover 
(Charadrius melodus), and American coot (Fulica americana) are the illustrative species used to 
highlight climate risks to land-based game birds, migratory songbirds, shorebirds, and 
waterfowl, respectively (Box 9). In addition, risk results include the generic assessment of 
climate risk to “migratory songbirds” and “waterfowl” overall.

Wild turkey is a large, gregarious, and omnivorous ground-
dwelling bird with distribution across Ontario, excluding the 
Northwest and Far North regions. It uses a mix of forest and 
open areas (e.g. agricultural fields). Unregulated hunting and 
habitat degradation led to its extirpation for almost a century, 
but the species was reintroduced and populations restored 
(OMNR, 2011). Wild turkey is harvested in the province as 
game and is growing in popularity (Tonelli, 2021). 
 
Prothonotary warbler

Prothonotary warbler is an endangered passerine bird species 
with a distribution in Ontario restricted to the Southwest 
region. The species is a charismatic, migratory, habitat 
specialist that nests in tree cavities in flooded woodlands and 
eats spiders and other small invertebrates (OMNR, 2011). 
Habitat loss and degradation, including in its wintering 
grounds, have driven population declines. 
 
Piping plover (Credit: G.

Piping plover is a small, endangered migratory shorebird, 
found to breed along the shores of the Great Lakes and 
northwestern Ontario. It eats insects and small crustaceans 
and nests on sandy or gravelly beaches above the high-water 
mark. Human disturbance to beaches, storm surges and severe 
weather are main threats to the species. 
 
American coot (Credit: C. 
Klebba, CC SA) 
American coot is a common waterfowl species found across 
the Northwest, Northeast, Eastern, Central, and Southwest 
provincial regions. It requires shallow freshwater and marsh 
vegetation for breeding. In non-breeding seasons the species 
can occupy diverse aquatic habitats, including ponds in city 
parks. Its diet is omnivorous. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        205  
The current climate risk profile associated with the environmental consequences from climate 
change impacts to birds is rated as ‘medium’ across all regions of Ontario, with risk levels 
increasing to ‘high’ by mid-century and stabilizing at that level across the province by late 
century.  
Current and future risk levels for waterfowl specifically, are ‘high’ and ‘very high’ in Southwest 
and Central Ontario, with the effect of exposure to climate conditions exacerbated by 
anthropogenic threats to species’ habitats. Current risk levels are consistent with observed bird 
responses to warming temperatures (Hurlbert and Liang, 2012; Usui et al., 2016), in some cases 
leading to northward range expansions due to milder winters (Nguyen et al., 2003, MacDonald, 
2018). Assessing climate change risks for migratory birds, both land and water-based, is 
complex due to the possibility of exposure to climate and non-climate related stressors to birds 
along their migratory routes. It is important to note that this assessment is limited to assessing 
climate impacts experienced only within Ontario. 
Warmer temperatures and extended growing seasons present direct stresses to the health of 
individuals and populations by creating mismatches in the timing of life cycle events and 
requirements for survival. For example, the migration and nesting timing of many songbirds is 
aligned to ensure maximum food availability for their young (Stanley et al., 2012). Changes to 
the growing season length in Ontario will result in a mismatch between the arrival of migratory 
songbirds and availability of foods such as insects. This de-synchronization threatens the 
survival and reproduction of migratory songbirds, which can lead to declining populations (King 
and Finch, 2013). A similar risk exists for waterfowl species, where an extended growing season 
in Ontario may create mismatches between the hatching of waterfowl chicks and availability of 
foods for some waterfowl species, in turn reducing waterfowl survival rates and abundance 
(Adde et al., 2020). 
Conversely, warmer winters and decreased snow depth creates favourable conditions for 
improved survival and range expansion of ground-dwelling species currently limited by low 
temperatures. Deep powdered snow and severe winter conditions are associated with reduced 
survival of wild turkey populations due to increasing food requirements to meet 
thermoregulatory demands (Haroldson et al., 1998), reduced availability of food and cover, and 
increased vulnerability to predation (Niedzielski and Bowman, 2014). Studies show that deep 
snow forces wild turkeys to travel further to find food when local resources are covered 
(Nguyen et al, 2003), delays nest establishment and poult development with a snow depth of 
greater than 30 cm for more than 10 days drastically decreasing odds of survival (Lavoie et al., 
2017). Therefore, interactions associated with milder winters and reduced snow cover (e.g. low 
temperature) revealed potential opportunities related to improved winter survival and 
northward range expansion. This expansion is already occurring in Ontario (Brinker et al., 2018). 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        206  
Climate-change induced fluctuations in water levels can degrade habitat quality and availability, 
influencing bird population dynamics. For example, the prothonotary warbler is vulnerable to 
extreme precipitation events, such as intense storms. More frequent and intense storms that 
cause loss or damage to the species’ wintering and breeding habitat pose a serious threat to 
the species due to its clumped and restricted distribution in Canada (Ontario Ministry of Natural 
Resources and Forestry, 2012). Similarly, fluctuations in water levels linked to extreme flooding 
events (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, 2012) can submerge or erode 
dunes and render this habitat insufficient for the piping plover to breed successfully (Gratto-
Trevor and Abbott, 2011). Despite several Ontario populations of piping plovers being found in 
a provincially protected areas (Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks, 
2019), events causing nesting habitat to become unreliable, increase the likelihood of 
extirpation (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, 2012).  
Marsh nesting obligate species, such as the American coot, are vulnerable to hydrological 
variability (Mortsch et al., 2006). Unless offset by increasing precipitation, increasing 
temperatures may lead to higher rates of evaporation thereby reducing water levels (Dove-
Thompson et al., 2011). Suboptimal water levels, decreasing wetland coverage for reasons 
unrelated to climate change, and temperature-induced expansions in invasive and predatory 
species taken together reduce habitat suitability for the American coot, with the potential of 
population declines and local extirpations (Mortsch et al., 2006). Climate vulnerability 
assessments for inland waters in the Great Lakes basin indicate that habitat suitability for the 
American Coot is likely to decrease by mid- and end of century in multiple climate scenarios 
(Chu, 2015). 
Fish 
145 species of fishes inhabit Ontario’s lakes and streams, distributed regionally following 
latitudinal gradients in climate, land use patterns and fish species richness (Smith et al., 2021). 
Cold-, cool-, and warm- water fishes – thermal guilds to study and manage fishes – are adapted 
to specific thermal niches. Thermal niches are influenced by channel flow rates and 
morphology, riparian vegetation, adjacent land use and land cover, ground water discharge, 
and air temperatures, that are likely to fluctuate in Ontario under climate change (Chu et al., 
2005). Timing of the spring freshet, groundwater discharge and temperature variability in 
particular can lead to thermal stratification and changes in fish habitat use, with potential 
habitat overlaps among previously niche-differentiated species (Chu et al., 2005; Brinker et al., 
2018). Habitat overlaps may lead to competition over resource use and space that can be 
further exacerbated by the introduction and expansions of invasive and predatory species (De 
Stasio Jr. et al., 1996, Chu et al., 2005).  
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        207  
Cold-water species may be most vulnerable to changing air temperatures and water 
temperatures, particularly determined by water depth since shallow water bodies (e.g. small 
lakes) may lose habitat space more quickly with increased warming (Brinker et al., 2018; Smith 
et al., 2021). Fish range dispersal is already limited to aquatic networks, which may be 
fragmented by the addition of anthropogenic barriers that restrict movement, including dams 
and culverts (Brinker et al., 2018).  
Climate risks to fishes were assessed across all six PCCIA regions, focusing on risk scenarios 
driven by temperature changes, specifically Growing Degree Days, which have been increasingly 
used to explain variation in fish growth and development, since air temperature was first used 
as a surrogate for water temperatures. Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), walleye (Sander 
vitreus) and smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) are the illustrative species used to 
highlight climate risks to cold water, cool water, and warm water fishes, respectively. In 
addition, risk results include the assessment of climate risks to redside dace (Clinostomus 
elongatus), a species at risk (see Box 10).  
The current climate risk profile associated with the environmental consequences from climate 
change impacts to fish is rated as ‘high’ in southern Ontario (Central, Eastern and Southwest) 
and ‘medium’ in northern Ontario (Northeast, Northwest and Far North), increasing to ‘high’ for 
future time periods. Current risk levels are consistent with observed impacts of warming 
temperatures on fish distributions, phenology, among other traits (Lynch et al., 2016, 
Krabbenhoft et al., 2020), as well as studies simulating changes in volumes of thermal lake 
habitat available to fishes (Smith et al., 2021).  
Risk profiles differ among cold-water, cool-water and warm-water fish species. Increases in 
average annual temperature (Growing Degree Days) in Ontario will alter the amount of suitable 
habitat for fishes, influencing their growth rate, abundance, and distribution. One simulation 
study based on long-term monitoring of lakes reported that the extent of thermal habitat 
available to cold-water fishes like brook trout, will decline by over 50% by the 2080s (under 
high emissions scenario, RCP 8.5) compared to current habitat, with larger habitat losses 
expected in Northwest and Northeast regions (Smith et al., 2021). Cool-water fishes like walleye 
may gain suitable habitat toward mid-century, but then suffer declines by the 2080s in a high 
emissions scenario (RCP8.5). The same study projects sizeable gains in suitable habitat for 
warm-water fishes like smallmouth bass under moderate and high emissions scenarios (RCP4.5 
and RCP8.5).

Brook trout (Credit: R. Hagerty, 
USFWS, public domain image) 
Brook trout is a cold-water fish species found in lakes 
and streams of Southwest, Eastern, Central, Northwest, 
and Northeast regions. They are indicative of healthy 
aquatic ecosystems and are adapted to cold, clean, well 
oxygenated waters, and require groundwater 
upwellings for spawning and thermal refuge. The 
species is commonly targeted for recreational fisheries. 
 
Walleye (Credit: E. Engbretson,

Walleye is a cool-water fish native to Ontario, with 
distribution across the province. Walleye are a 
preferred recreational fish for anglers in Ontario and 
are targeted in summer, fall, and winter. The popularity 
of fishing for walleye is on the rise (McGuigan, 2022).  
 
Redside dace (Credit: H. Zell, CC 
BY-SA 3.0) 
Redside dace a cool-water fish occurring in much of 
Ontario, except the Northwest and Far North. Most 
populations in Ontario are from streams in the Greater 
Toronto Area. The species is endangered in Ontario, 
with habitat loss and degradation from urbanization 
and agriculture as its most significant threats. 
 
Smallmouth bass (Credit: S. 
Stukel, USFWS, public domain 
image) 
Smallmouth bass is a common species of warm-water 
fish occurring throughout Ontario. The species is 
commonly targeted for recreational fisheries. 
 
As a cold-water fish, brook trout’s optimal water temperature range is between 13-17°C (Smith 
and Ridgway, 2019). Water temperatures exceeding 20°C cause stress and adverse 
physiological impacts (Dove-Thompson et al., 2011; Mackey et al., 2021). These impacts 
translate to a reduced ability to compete with other fish species like the non-native Brown 
trout, avoid predators, and capture prey (Di Rocco et al., 2015; Chetkiewicz et al., 2018). A 
response to significant reductions in suitable thermal habitat leads is to seek refuge, often in 
headwaters. However, this may be prevented by lack of habitat connectivity, which causes 
 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        209  
mortality, local extinctions, and loss of brook-trout biodiversity (Di Rocco et al., 2015). Die-offs 
are anticipated without adequate thermal refuge (Gunn and Snucins, 2010; Robinson et al., 
2010).  
In contrast, walleye’s thermal tolerance presents a mixed picture when comparing across 
regions. In southern regions of Ontario, warmer temperatures in summer and fall could well 
exceed the optimum performance range for walleye (24˚C), offsetting any benefits from 
increased recruitment due to warming temperatures in the spring. (Shuter et al., 2002). 
Warming in Northeast Ontario create more favourable conditions for walleye recruitment, 
growth, and survival, increasing the species’ abundance in this region (Shuter et al., 2002). 
Although walleye’s range is expected to expand northward, their overall occurrence in the 
province is likely to decline.  
As an endangered, small-bodied fish drawing attention to climate risks posed to redside dace is 
important. This fish prefers water temperatures below 20°C and spawn when temperatures 
reach ~18°C (COSEWIC, 2017). Laboratory studies suggest that this species is not currently at its 
thermal limit but is most sensitive to local temperature pulses in the summer (Leclair et al., 
2020). Growing Degree Days exceeding the optimal range may result in year-round fitness 
consequences as well. In combination with anthropogenic stressors (e.g. riparian vegetation 
removal), redside dace populations are likely to experience acute temperature increases that 
exceed their survival ability (Brinker et al., 2018).  
Warm-water fishes are likely to benefit from climate change. For example, the smallmouth bass 
can withstand temperatures between 15 and 27°C (Smith et al., 2021). Warmer temperatures 
will increase habitat for warm-water fishes in the Central, Northeast, Northwest, and Far North 
regions of Ontario. Assuming habitat connectivity or introductions by humans, new thermal 
habitats for warm-water fishes have resulted in range shifts of approximately 13 to 17.5 km per 
decade in the last 30 years in Ontario lakes (Alofs et al., 2014), and expanding northern range 
limits anticipated due to climate change (Chetkiewicz et al., 2018; Chu et al., 2005).  
The expansion of other warm-water fish species such as smallmouth bass into cold- and cool-
water fish habitat is a concern for some populations due to competition for food and space and 
predation on juveniles (Kerr and Grant 2000; Weidel et. al. 2000, Lynch et al., 2016). Increasing 
overlap in occurrence of smallmouth bass and walleye is anticipated for Ontario lakes, with this 
overlap happening despite shifting walleye distribution because smallmouth bass are invading 
lakes more quickly than walleye are becoming extirpated (Van Zuiden et al., 2016). This co-
occurrence of species may result in predation by smallmouth bass and competition for space 
and prey resources, leading to extirpations in southern and south-central lakes (e.g. Southwest 
and Central regions). 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        210  
Insects / Spiders 
According to the Natural Heritage Information Centre, 11,621 insect and spider species are 
present in Ontario, with less than 1% of species threatened or of special concern (Office of the 
Auditor General of Ontario, 2021a). In general, information is lacking on the distribution, life 
histories, diets, habitat requirements and dispersal capabilities of insects/spiders to determine 
species responses to climate change and shifts in range distributions, as most studies focus on 
Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) and Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) (Brinker et al., 
2018). Nevertheless, the climate change vulnerability assessment by Brinker et al., (2018) on 
Ontario species present in the Great Lakes Basin suggests that insect and spider species show 
climate resilience. Warming temperatures and corresponding decreases in frost period have 
already facilitated range expansions of several insect species within Ontario (Finkbeiner et al., 
2011). Other possible mechanisms of impact include physiological and behavioural responses as 
well as losses in climatically-suitable habitat. Physiological responses to shifting climate 
conditions by individuals include changes to reproduction cycles (e.g. diapause), and/or 
metabolism (Sgrò et al., 2016). Landscape level threats to habitat suitability include changes in 
hydrology and flow rates related to climate changes, as many aquatic insects have a narrow 
hydrologic niche (Brinker et al., 2018). 
Climate risks to insects and spiders were assessed across all six PCCIA regions, with risk 
scenarios driven temperature changes (Growing Degree Days) and dry conditions 
(Drought/Moisture Deficit). Lake Huron grasshopper (Trimerotropis huroniana) is the illustrative 
species used to highlight climate risks to insect/spiders. Endemic to the Great Lakes Basin, the 
Lake Huron grasshopper is a threatened species found in the Southwest, Central, and Northeast 
regions, its distribution restricted to the availability of dune habitats in which it lives (Brinker et 
al., 2018). In addition, risk results include the generic assessment of climate risk to 
insects/spiders overall, based on information in Brinker et al., (2018). 
The current climate risk profile associated with the environmental consequences from climate 
change impacts to insects/spiders is rated as ‘medium’ in all regions of Ontario. Risk levels 
remain ‘medium’ to the end of the century for the Northwest and Far North regions. Risk levels 
escalate to ‘high’ by mid-century for Southwest, Central, and Northeast regions, with scores 
driven by a combination of elevated risk for the Lake Huron grasshopper (e.g. a species at risk) 
and anthropogenic pressures that exacerbate climate change vulnerability, especially in 
southern Ontario. By late century risk levels reach ‘very high’ for Southwest and Central regions 
of Ontario and ‘high’ for Northeast and Eastern regions.  
Climate risks to insects/spiders stem from habitat-related stresses. In general terms, dryer and 
warmer conditions have the potential to reduce suitable habitat for native insects and spiders. 
Species with specialized habitats are most vulnerable. For example, species with narrow 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        211  
hydrological niches, such as those reliant on headwater streams, ephemeral ponds, or seepage 
slopes, are vulnerable to fluctuations in moisture levels and seasonal drying. Species reliant on 
specialized wetlands (e.g. mineral wetlands) are vulnerable to changes in plant communities, 
such as through temperature-driven increases in evapotranspiration and related effects on 
groundwater levels. Species with narrow thermal niches, such as those restricted to cool 
environments, could lose suitable habitat as temperatures rise.  
Warmer temperatures can amplify habitat-related impacts of stressors to insect/spider species 
that are already imperiled. For example, rising temperatures and increased evapotranspiration 
could lower lake water levels and favour vegetation succession over the creation of dune 
habitat, which is critical for the endangered Lake Huron grasshopper (COSEWIC, 2015). 
Mechanisms of impact in this case are complex, as other climatic variables aside from 
temperature, such as total precipitation and wind speed, affect the rate of vegetation 
succession and dune building. The variables would have to favour vegetation encroachment 
into dune habitats, and lake water levels would have to remain low for a long enough for dune 
habitat to be lost. Anthropogenic disturbances and temperature-induced expansions in invasive 
and predatory species further affect the Lake Huron grasshopper by limiting available habitat 
and displacing preferred food sources. 
Mammals 
According to the Natural Heritage Information Centre, 96 mammal species inhabit Ontario’s 
landscapes and waterscapes, with physiographic regions and forest types key in shaping 
mammal distribution (Dobbyn, 1994). The considerable variability and habitat requirements 
exhibited by mammal species, including the survival, distribution, and abundance of hibernating 
mammals, all likely to be influenced by climate-related changes (Rodenhouse et al., 2009, 
Brinker et al., 2018).  
Limited thermal tolerances, food availability, habitat structure, expanding range and 
populations of invasive species, parasites and diseases, and weather-related changes in snow 
depth/ice and heat stress pose significant threats to mammals overall (Rodenhouse et al., 2009, 
Brinker et al., 2018). Smaller-sized mammals such as bats have high energy demands to survive 
their hibernation period, which is threatened by changes in food supply (e.g. flying insects who 
are vulnerable to changes in stream flow and precipitation), resulting in changes to their 
hibernation periods (Rodenhouse et al., 2009). Larger mammals such as moose may be 
intolerant to increasing temperatures, pushing their ranges to higher latitudes (Rodenhouse et 
al., 2009, Brinker et al., 2018). Species with ability to disperse and generalist habitat and food 
requirements are more adaptable to changing conditions, than species with limited dispersal 
and specialist habitat requirements; these former species types have broader thermal 
thresholds and can colonize new areas and diversify food sources (Douglas and Pearson, 2022).  
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        212  
Climate-driven movements and other physiological, behavioural, and demographic responses 
have a range of ecological implications. Several mammals are keystone species in the 
environments where they occur, meaning that their presence keeps a balance on the 
ecosystem. For example, herbivorous mammals like voles, deer, and moose are important food 
web components in their terrestrial communities; large carnivores are top predators; and other 
mammals help sustain plant communities that are their food sources through seed dispersal 
and other mechanisms (Dobbyn, 1994). 
Climate risks to mammals were assessed across all six PCCIA regions, focusing on risk scenarios 
driven by temperature, specifically Growing Degree Days and Degree Days below 0˚C, and 
winter precipitation, specifically Rain:Snow Ratio.  
Moose (Alces americanus), white-tailed deer (Odocolieus virginianus), caribou – boreal 
population (Rangifer tarandus) and northern myotis (Myotis septentrionalis) are the illustrative 
species used to highlight climate risks to mammals (Box 11). 
The current climate risk profile associated with the environmental consequences from climate 
change impacts to mammals is rated as ‘medium’ in all regions, with risk levels increasing to 
‘high’ by mid-century. Risk scores are anticipated to stabilize at ‘high’ in northern regions 
(Northeast, Northwest and Far North) by late century, but increase further to ‘very high’ in 
southern regions (Central, Eastern and Southwest).  
Current risk levels are consistent with observed impacts of warming temperatures and changes 
in precipitation on mammal distribution (e.g. northward shift of white-tailed deer), 
demographic responses, and changes in species interactions (Dawe and Boutin, 2016; Priadka 
et al., 2022; Kennedy-Slaney et al., 2018; Nituch and Bowman, 2013). 
Warmer temperatures cause physiological stress that limits species’ reproductive success, 
threatening population health. Moose, for example, thrive under temperature thresholds 
between 14 and 24˚C, experiencing heat stress if those temperatures are exceeded (McCann et 
al., 2013). Heat stress alters their metabolic, heart, respiration rates, and their movement 
patterns; heat stress reduces their food intake and creates mismatches in the timing of winter 
coat growth. All these factors ultimately lead to lower body condition with negative effects on 
calf production (McCann et al., 2013; Broders et al., 2012; Weiskopf et al., 2019).

Moose is a large mammal with a wide distribution across 
Ontario. Moose hold substantial social, economic, and 
ecological value to the people of Ontario (Ontario Ministry of 
Natural Resources and Forestry, 2009). Moose is an 
important source of wild food for First Nations in northern 
Ontario regions (Douglas and Pearson, 2022).

Boreal caribou are an iconic, medium-sized forest-dwelling 
species with significant cultural and ecological importance in 
Canada (Assembly of First Nations and David Suzuki 
Foundation, 2013). The boreal population of caribou lives in 
the boreal forest all year, with its range restricted to the Far 
North and Northeast regions of Ontario. This species has 
suffered range-wide declines despite conservation efforts. 
 
 
Northern myotis (Credit: D.

Northern myotis commonly known as the northern long-
eared bat, is an endangered species of bat found throughout 
the boreal forest. This species roosts under loose bark, in the 
cavities of trees and in caves (Ontario Ministry of Natural 
Resources and Forestry, 2014c). 
 
 
 
 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        214  
Warmer temperatures can amplify the impacts of stressors to species that are already 
imperiled. Bats (particularly lactating females) are more susceptible to evaporative water loss 
than other mammals, with evidence indicating that little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), a 
species analogous to northern myotis, experience significant reproductive declines in years of 
reduced water availability linked to warmer winters and summers (Frick et al., 2010). Variations 
in climate leading to poor spring and summer foraging conditions reduce opportunities for 
juvenile bats to gain mass before hibernation and affect overwinter success, especially with the 
pressures of white-nose syndrome, an emergent disease in hibernating bats resulting in 
dehydration, starvation and often death (Balzer et al., 2022).  
Warming temperatures can also degrade habitat quality, influencing population dynamics. 
Increasing temperatures put boreal caribou at a high risk of extirpation under conservative 
emission scenarios. Climatically-suitable habitat for boreal caribou could decrease between 57 
and 99%with an increase in mean minimum winter temperature between 0.9 and 5.5˚C over 
pre-industrial temperatures (Masood et al., 2017). Increasing winter temperatures are linked to 
reduced ice thickness over water bodies, resulting in limited ability to browse for food and an 
increased risk of drowning (Masood et al., 2017). Regularly warmer winters and summers also 
present risks for poor body condition and population declines and local extirpation of the 
Boreal population of caribou due to lack of high-quality forage availability (Festa-Bianchet et al., 
2011). 
Warmer temperatures, shorter winters and decreased snow depth creates favourable 
conditions for range expansion and increased abundance of species currently limited by low 
temperatures. The northern distribution of white-tailed deer is in part limited by winter 
temperatures colder than -7˚ C, as cold temperatures increase metabolic costs for 
thermoregulation (Weiskopf et al., 2019). Deep snow is another limiting factor, since it 
increases movement costs, reduces forage availability, increases predation, and forces deer in 
some areas to be obligate migrators, which, taken together, decrease reproductive success 
(Kennedy-Slaney et al., 2018; Weiskopf et al., 2019). Reduced snow cover and warmer winters 
may mitigate some adverse climate impacts affecting deer condition and reproductive success. 
However, fluctuations in the severity of winter months may lead to pulses of expanding and 
contracting distribution of white-tailed deer (Kennedy-Slaney et al., 2018). Ultimately, it is 
expected that white-tailed deer will increase in abundance, retain their existing range, and 
expand northward, potentially as far as the modern-day treeline (Jenkins et al., 2007). 
Warming temperatures will change species interactions, including impacts from diseases, pests, 
and invasive species, and shifts in and predation (Douglas and Pearson, 2022). Regularly 
warmer winters and summers presents population risks to boreal caribou due to increasing 
frequency of interactions with parasites (e.g. meningeal worm carried by white-tailed deer) and 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        215  
predators (Vors and Boyce, 2009; Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2020; Masood et 
al., 2017). The earlier onset of spring is shifting the timing of vegetation green up and insect 
emergence, but caribou lag behind this phenological shift, resulting in higher disturbance by 
insect pests when females and calves are in their most vulnerable condition (Vors and Boyce, 
2009). Warming temperatures, manifested through later frost and earlier onset of spring, in 
combination with contractions in forest canopy, may result in increased spread of fatal 
parasites from white-tailed deer to moose, as well as increased rates of predation on moose 
(Weiskopf et al., 2019, Priadka et al., 2022).  
Molluscs 
According to the Natural Heritage Information Centre 312 mollusc species are present in 
Ontario, with close to 6% of species threatened or of special concern (Office of the Auditor 
General of Ontario, 2021a). Molluscs are aquatic bivalves that are sedentary in adult life stages, 
relying on other species to disperse larvae to new areas (Brinker et al., 2018). Therefore, 
climate change-induced shifts in species composition influence molluscs’ reproductive success 
(Brinker et al., 2018). Survival rates may be further impacted by changes to habitat quality 
(Brinker et al., 2018). Changes to aquatic habitats, including changes to water depths, current 
velocities, and increased turbidity, combined with their limited mobility, have the potential to 
detrimentally affect mollusc populations. Molluscs’ already restricted dispersal potential is 
further limited by anthropogenic barriers (e.g. dams), and existing habitat space and use may 
be threatened by invasive species who may colonize previously unsuitable habitat (Brinker et 
al., 2018). Losses in biodiversity of mollusc species, in turn, affect food webs and nutrient 
recycling (Spooner et al., 2011). 
Climate risk to molluscs was assessed in the Southwest region – with risk scenarios driven by 
temperature changes (Growing Degree Days) and extreme precipitation events. Salamander 
mussel (Simpsonaias ambigua) is the illustrative species used to highlight climate risks to 
mussels. This endangered freshwater mussel has a localized distribution and is found burrowed 
in sand or silt in the Sydenham River; it uses the Mudpuppy, a salamander, as its host 
(COSEWIC, 2001). Habitat quality for the Salamader mussel continues to decline from intense 
agriculture, urban development, and pollution from point and non-point sources. Although 
information on specific threats to this freshwater species is scarce, limiting factors likely include 
impoundments, siltation, channel modification and pollution (COSEWIC, 2011). Because of its 
localized occurrence and conservation status, risk results from the assessment of this 
illustrative species may be applicable to other endangered mollusc species in Ontario. 
The current climate risk profile associated with the environmental consequences from climate 
change impacts to endangered molluscs in Southwest Ontario is rated as ‘high’, with risk levels 
increasing to ‘very high’ by mid and end-of-century, regardless of emissions scenario. Impacts 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        216  
on the mollusc due to exposure to climate change are exacerbated by anthropogenic pressures 
in Southwest Ontario linked to projected population growth, urban and industrial development 
(e.g. road run off, pollution). 
Exposure to climate change, combined with pressures from human activities, put the 
salamander mussel at high risk of extirpation in Ontario. Rising temperatures and increased 
evapotranspiration can result in low water levels in streams (Spooner et al., 2011), which is 
problematic for the species due to its lack of mobility and niche habitat requirements (Lee et 
al., 2011). The species is indirectly vulnerable to extreme precipitation events, such as intense 
storms, since high flow scenarios can cause scouring and siltation, posing serious threats to 
species persistence (Spooner et al., 2011; COSEWIC, 2011). The loss of this species would result 
in decreased nutrient recycling efficiency in the river environment. 
Reptiles 
According to the Natural Heritage Information Centre, 50 reptile species are present in Ontario, 
with over 40% of species threatened or of special conservation concern (Office of the Auditor 
General of Ontario, 2021a). Relative to amphibians, reptiles may be more resilient to climate 
change on account of their preference for heat and a generalist diet (Winter et al., 2016, 
Brinker et al., 2018). However, reptile populations in Ontario may still be affected by climate 
change-induced habitat losses and expansions of invasive species. Reptiles reliant on 
freshwater habitats are vulnerable to hydrologic changes resulting from climatic shifts habitat 
may be more vulnerable to (Brinker et al., 2018). 
Climate risk to reptiles was assessed in four of the PCCIA regions – Southwest, Central, Eastern 
and Northeast Regions –with risk scenarios driven by temperature changes (Growing Degree 
Days). The common five lined skink (Plestiodon fasciatus) is the illustrative species used to 
highlight climate risks to reptiles (Box 12).

Box 12: Ontario’s Common Five Lined Skink, Illustrative Species of Climate Risks to Reptiles 
 
 
Common five lined skink 
(Credit: W.L. Farr, CC-SA-
4.0) 
 
Common five lined skink is a small lizard species common in 
North American, although in Canada on occurring in the 
Southwest, Central, Eastern, and the Northeast provincial 
regions (Seburn, 2010). It occurs in openings or edges of 
deciduous forests, in rocky (shield population) and sandy areas 
(Carolinian population). The Carolinian population is 
endangered, with major threats including habitat loss, 
fragmentation, and degradation from development. 
Information on the skink’s distribution and movements is 
limited, as are accurate population estimates. 
The current climate risk profile associated with the environmental consequences from climate 
change impacts to reptiles (as illustrated by the common five lined skink) in Southwest, Central, 
Eastern, and the Northeast regions is rated as ‘medium’, with risk levels staying at ‘medium’ 
levels by mid and end-of-century for Southwest and Central regions. For Eastern and the 
Northeast regions, risk levels are anticipated to rise to ‘high’ by mid-century and then fall again 
to ‘medium’ by late century. These counterintuitive results illustrate the challenges of analyzing 
potentially positive effects of climate change, with heightened risk in Eastern and Northeast 
regions in mid-century denoting a potential upside for the lizard. The potential advantages of 
warming temperatures for populations of common-five lined skinks counteract with 
anthropogenic pressures linked to projected population growth, urban and industrial 
development (e.g. road run off, pollution). 
Warmer temperatures can facilitate a range expansion of the common five-lined skink, 
increasing populations’ genetic diversity; however, the species’ occurrence in heavily modified 
landscapes and as small, localized populations counteract gains in thermally suitable habitat. As 
an ectotherm, the common five-lined skink relies on ambient air temperature to maintain its 
internal body temperature (Vincer, 2009). Evidence suggests that the species' distribution in 
Ontario is limited by thermal energy accumulation during the growing season, as cool 
environments limit embryo development and the ability of juveniles to reach adult stages 
(Ziebarth, 2021).  
Warming temperatures may be net-advantageous for the common five lined skink and may 
shift the peripheral population northward, potentially increasing genetic diversity in Ontario 
(Howes and Lougheed 2008; Feltham, 2020). However, changes in moisture availability, natural 
and anthropogenic barriers, as well as continued habitat loss and degradation unrelated to 
 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        218  
climate change render the species vulnerable and act to limit populations’ prevalence and 
expansion (Brinker et al., 2018). Populations of this species in protected areas (e.g. Point Pelee 
National Park, Rondeau Provincial Park, and Pinery Provincial Park) may be better able take 
advantage of the boost in Adaptive Capacity conferred by warming temperatures.

Indirect Impacts 
Warming temperature will indirectly impact fauna in Ontario by altering habitat and species’ 
ranges, encouraging the expansion of species, including invasive species that can outcompete 
native species, and increase the abundance of forest pests and/or pathogens.  
For certain species, such as brook trout, habitat is expected to become increasingly 
disconnected. This will indirectly impact gene flow by leading to genetically isolated populations 
(Argent and Kimmel, 2013). For other species, changes to historic weather patterns will modify 
habitat. One example is where changing weather patterns will negatively affect sand barren 
and dune habitats via increased erosion. This will have effects on several species at risk that 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        220  
depend on this habitat such as Fowler's toad, eastern prickly pear cactus, eastern hognose 
snake, dusted skipper butterfly, and the Lake Huron grasshopper.  
As indicated in the previous section, habitat alterations cause species declines. This is 
anticipated for the Lake Huron grasshopper which depends on dune habitats to survive. 
Decreasing Lake Huron grasshopper populations in conjunction with increasing temperatures 
may co-occur with improved conditions for invasive plant growth on dune habitat. In turn, this 
changing habitat may be more favourable for other grasshopper species such as the Mottled 
Sand Grasshopper, which has been shown to displace Lake Huron Grasshoppers in some 
circumstances (Jones, 2018). Similar scenarios occur in the aquatic environment where declines 
in Salamander Mussels due to changing temperatures may co-occur with improved conditions 
for invasive Zebra Mussels. This will further threaten Salamander Mussels by adhering to them 
and interfering with breathing, feeding, excretion, and movement (Ontario Ministry of the 
Environment, Conservation and Parks, 2014). The combined impact of these factors may result 
in range expansions or contractions in many species. The whitetail deer may undergo a range 
expansion, introducing wolves to caribou and moose habitat, resulting in increased predation 
(Barber et al., 2018; Rempel et al., 2021; Brown, 2011; Festa-Bianchet et al., 2011). Warming 
temperatures may cause declines in many species such as the northern myotis. This species of 
bat usually consumes large quantities of forest pest insects; therefore, decreasing abundance of 
northern myotis may increase forest pest abundance and take a toll on forest health 
(Ducummon, 2000). 
Drought, wildfire, and extreme precipitation will cause indirect impacts by reducing suitable 
habitat in Ontario. Drought may reduce insect and spider abundances and cause an indirect 
impact on terrestrial and freshwater food webs. Many species of birds, bats, reptiles, 
amphibians, small mammals, and fish rely on insects and spiders as food and will disappear 
without them. Further, a large portion of plant species rely on pollination by insects. Increased 
wildfire frequency will put pressures on species at risk in boreal forest such as woodland 
caribou and wolverine. Additionally, other charismatic species in northern regions, such as grey 
wolf, moose, Canada jay, and bald eagle may be negatively impacted by loss of habitat.  
Finally, if extreme precipitation forces Piping Plover breeding habitat further inland, there may 
be an increased likelihood of conflict between plover habitat protection and human recreation 
that takes place close to shorelines. Increased human disturbance has been shown to 
negatively impact chick survival, and increased plover-human interactions due to shifting 
habitats may further exacerbate population losses.

7.7.2 Flora 
Overview 
Flora refers to the plant life in a particular region. Flora covers most parts of the province and 
are essential for the planet and all living things. Within the categories of flora assessed for this 
report (vascular plants, bryophytes, and lichen), vascular plants make up about 70% of the list 
of Ontario species maintained by the Natural Heritage Information Centre. Although most of 
Ontario’s flora species are secure, just over 1% are species at risk – that is – species that are in 
danger of disappearing (Office of the Auditor General of Ontario, 2021a). As with fauna, threats 
to flora species diversity include habitat loss/degradation and fragmentation, overexploitation, 
invasive species, spread of disease, climate change, and pollution (IPBES, 2019). These are 
broadly similar to threats to flora species in Ontario overall, but differ by region and extent of 
development pressures. Compared to fauna, flora species are under-represented in land 
protection and habitat stewardship programs (McCune and Morrison, 2020). 
Flora provides numerous social, economic, and cross-sectoral benefits to people and their well-
being (Nantel et al., 2014). For instance, wild rice (Zizania palustris), a cold-water annual plant 
species that occurs in northern coastal wetlands and inland water bodies, has a modest 
commercial value, but is of great cultural and spiritual importance to Indigenous nations in the 
Great Lakes region (Sierszen et al., 2012). Sugar maple (Acer saccharam) is the species most 
tapped for maple syrup, which is an iconic Canadian non-timber forest product (Murphy et al., 
2012), and a source of employment and GDP in Ontario (EcoResources, 2013); its sap is also a 
traditional cleansing medicine for Indigenous Communities (Huron, 2014). Sphagnum mosses 
composing peatlands are harvested for horticultural purposes as a soil amendment.  
Understanding the climate change vulnerability of flora is a complex endeavor, as the effect of 
climate change occurs on a species, population and community level, and overall threats are 
regionally specific (Geyer et al., 2011; Young, 2016). Furthermore, many flora species depend 
on other organisms for critical functions including growth and/or dispersal (Brinker et al., 2018). 
Thus, impacts on one species, may have indirect effects on others. Indeed, thermal and 
hydrological niches and dispersal/movement capabilities stand out as key factors influencing 
the climate change vulnerability of flora species, with species restricted to cool, cold or moist 
environments, those in isolated locales (e.g. canyons) or requiring other specialized growing 
conditions, and those with limited dispersal adaptations most susceptible to changing climate 
conditions. 
For the purposes of the PCCIA, three Level 2 categories were used to assess the risks associated 
with direct impacts to flora: vascular plants, bryophytes, and lichens. To make the assessment 
tractable, illustrative species were selected for quantitative risk assessment. However, it is 
critical to recognize the regional diversity of flora and the unique climate sensitivities of species 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        222  
(including conservation status) in extrapolating or generalizing risk results to the level of 
taxonomic groups. Brinker et al.’s (2018) climate change vulnerability assessment of species in 
the Great Lakes Basin found lichens to be relatively more vulnerable than vascular plants and 
bryophytes. Support for comprehensive and broad-scale studies such as Brinker et al., (2018) is 
necessary to continue building Ontario’s knowledge base on climate change risks to the natural 
environment. 
Direct Impacts 
The following sections provide characterizations of each Level 2 category assessed for flora 
across Ontario and related risk results. Risk scenarios for flora were driven by climate variables 
related to temperature and precipitation: average temperatures, high and extreme 
temperature, drought, and extreme precipitation events and winter precipitation.  
The impact assessment highlights the following types of environmental responses resulting 
from changes in severity and occurrence of the assessed climate variables: 
- 
Changes in population dynamics 
- 
Increases in habitat-related stressors

Bryophytes 
According to the Natural Heritage Information Centre, 826 species of bryophytes are present in 
Ontario21, with 0.1% of those species threatened or of special conservation concern (Office of 
the Auditor General of Ontario, 2021a). Bryophytes are low-lying plants that consist of mosses, 
liverworts, and hornworts, found across several microhabitats, predominantly in the coniferous 
boreal forest (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2015; Barbé et al., 2018).  
In general, bryophytes exhibit delays in responding to rapid changes in climate despite their 
high dispersal capabilities via wind (Zanatta et al., 2020). Bryophytes are susceptible to changes 
in precipitation and temperatures. They rely on atmospheric precipitation for water intake, 
hence fluctuating periods of extreme drought and periods of intense rainfall can influence 
bryophyte survival rates (Vile et al., 2011; Zanatta et al., 2020). Arctic tundra and alpine 
bryophyte communities are particularly sensitive to warming (Alatalo et al., 2020). Despite their 
ecological importance in arctic and alpine environments where vascular plant biomass is 
significantly lower, bryophyte communities are understudied compared to vascular plants 
(Alatalo et al., 2014).  
Climate risk to bryophytes was assessed in the Northwest region –with risk scenarios driven by 
drought (Moisture Deficit / Drought). Alpine copper moss (Mielichhoferia mielichhoferiana) is 
the illustrative species used to highlight climate risks to bryophytes. This is a critically imperiled 
species with low migratory capabilities and restricted to a niche habitat consisting of near-
vertical rock faces with high iron levels and reduced sulphur content. These traits confer a high 
degree of sensitivity to climate change (Brinker et al., 2018). Because of its localized 
occurrence, substrate fidelity, and conservation status risk results from the assessment of this 
illustrative species may be applicable to other endangered bryophyte species in Ontario. 
The current climate risk profile associated with the environmental consequences from climate 
change impacts to endangered bryophytes in Northwest Ontario is rated as ‘medium’, with risk 
levels staying at ‘medium’ by mid-century and then increasing to ‘high’ by late century.  
Most bryophytes depend on a moist environment (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 
2015). The availability and timing of water is critical for their reproductive success and altered 
moisture patterns (e.g. drought) will alter growth rate (Vile et al., 2011; Brinker et al., 2018). 
Warmer temperatures also influence the maintenance and establishment of the alpine copper 
moss. With low migratory capabilities, the alpine copper moss is unlikely to adapt to these 
climatic changes by shifting its range (Brinker et al., 2018). Therefore, if moisture and 
temperature thresholds are exceeded, local extirpation is likely to occur. 
 
21 CESCC (2016) lists 608 wild species of bryophytes for Ontario.

Lichens 
According to the Natural Heritage Information Centre, 1,146 species of lichens are present in 
Ontario, with 0.2% of those species threatened or of special conservation concern (Office of the 
Auditor General of Ontario, 2021a). Lichens are widespread throughout Ontario, with new 
species increasingly documented in the province (Lewis and Brinker, 2017). Lichens are 
composed of a symbiosis between algae and fungi, found across a range of ecosystems 
supporting important functions such as rock weathering (Allen et al., 2019). As with bryophytes, 
lichen communities remain understudied and under protected (Allen et al., 2019). Among the 
impacts of climate change, changing air quality and air pollution are among the most widely 
recognized threats that disproportionately impact lichen populations and distribution 
compared to other taxonomic groups (Allen et al., 2019). Many lichens’ growth and survival 
rates are influenced by hydrological regimes, including extremes such as spring runoff and 
seasonal precipitation events (Brinker et al., 2018). These, coupled with the interactions of 
climate change impacts and barriers to ecological response with current levels of habitat 
fragmentation and increasing urbanization, limit their dispersal potential and adaptability to a 
changing environment (Ellis, 2019). 
Climate risk to lichens was assessed in two the Southwest and Northwest regions –with risk 
scenarios driven by temperature (Growing Degree Days) and winter precipitation (Rain to Snow 
Ratio). Alpine dot lichen (Arthrorhaphis alpina) is the illustrative species used to highlight 
climate risks to lichens. The alpine dot lichen is widespread, but in Ontario its range is limited to 
sheltered canyons and separated from its main range by 1,500 km (Lewis and Brinker 2017); it 
is also critically imperiled. Due to its limited range in the province, reliance on niche habitat, 
and conservation status the species is highly sensitive to climate change (Brinker et al., 2018). 
Risk results from the assessment of this illustrative species may be applicable to other 
endangered lichen species in Ontario. 
The current climate risk profile associated with the environmental consequences from climate 
change impacts to endangered lichens in Southwest and Northwest Ontario is rated as 
‘medium’, with risk levels increasing to ‘high’ by mid-century for both regions due to a 
combination of exposure to climate hazards and socio-economic pressures. By late century risk 
levels for Northwest Ontario remain at ‘high’ and increase to ‘very high’ for Southwest Ontario 
on account of elevated pressures from human activities.  
Climate risks to lichens stem from habitat-related stresses, where loss of suitable habitat linked 
to population contractions. For the alpine dot lichen, warming temperatures and related 
moisture shifts are harmful as they can affect critical processes, such as reproduction, 
photosynthesis, and cause dry out (Brinker et al., 2018). Given the lack of suitable nearby 
environments, it is unlikely that this species can accommodate climate change by shifting its 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        225  
range, and there is a high likelihood of population impacts by mid-century. Changing winter 
precipitation patterns can affect lichen if they experience excess snowpack, which would lead 
to species decline (Bidussi et al., 2016). Snow can shape the zonation of dominant terrestrial 
mat-forming lichens from ridge to snow bed habitats. An analogous species to the alpine dot 
lichen, F. nivalis, is a snow-avoidant species and demonstrates negative growth rates at snow 
depths of ≥120cm (Bidussi et al., 2016). Climate projections indicate an increase in rain to snow 
ratio in Ontario, potentially representing a decrease in exposure to this snow-related climate 
threat. However, warmer temperatures and changes in Arctic air circulation patterns create 
conditions favourable for more frequent heavy snowfall events at mid-latitudes, although this is 
an evolving research topic (Francis et al., 2017).  
Vascular Plants 
According to the Natural Heritage Information Centre, 4,322 species of vascular plants are 
present in Ontario22, with under 2% of those species threatened or of special conservation 
concern (Office of the Auditor General of Ontario, 2021a). Vascular plants are a broad group of 
flora with specialized vascular systems; the group comprises conifers, deciduous trees and 
other flowering plants, ferns, and horsetails. Ontario has the highest diversity of vascular plants 
in the country (Leslie, 2018), with a wide distribution throughout the province.  
Vascular plants have highly variable traits and habitat preferences, with climate change 
potentially favouring certain morphologies such as shrubs and grasses. Shrubification and tree 
line advances have already been observed in higher latitudes (Zhang et al., 2013). Vascular 
plant physiology has also been observed to change in response to a changing climate, 
influencing photosynthesis and transpiration, with broader effects on primary productivity if 
hydraulic efficiency is impaired under climatic stress (Qaderi et al., 2019).  
Additionally, climate warming may enhance the biomass of vascular plants such as shrubs and 
grasses in wetlands at the expense of other flora such as moss and lichens, which have 
divergent responses to lower water tables (Bao et al., 2022). Climate-related movements and 
range expansions represent another mechanism of possible impact. Limits to range expansions 
and dispersal of vascular plant species vary significantly and include natural and anthropogenic 
barriers, dispersal capacity (Brinker et al., 2018), habitat suitability to uncommon geological 
features (e.g. marble barrens and talus slopes), and microclimate preferences, which may 
change in response to climatic shifts (Zhang et al., 2013). 
 
22 There are contradictions on the number of species occurring in Ontario, as other accounts mention 
3,160 native and introduced species, increasing to 4,133 if including subspecies, varieties, and hybrids 
(Leslie 2018).  
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        226  
Climate risk to vascular plants was assessed in five PCCIA regions – Southwest, Central, Eastern, 
Northwest and Northeast regions – with risk scenarios driven by temperature changes (Growing 
Degree Days), drought (Moisture Deficit / Drought), extreme precipitation events (Extreme 
Precipitation Event-shorter term) and winter precipitation (Rain:Snow Ratio). Eastern white 
pine (Pinus strobus) and the horsetail spike rush (Eleocharis equisetoides) are the illustrative 
species used to highlight climate risks to vascular plants (Box 13).

Eastern white pine is a coniferous tree occurring in 
Southwest, Central, Eastern, Northwest and Northeast 
Regions of Ontario and is Ontario’s provincial tree. Despite 
being susceptible to the fungus White pine blister rust, the 
tree species is secure, meaning that it is common, 
widespread, and abundant in the province (NatureServe , 
2016). In 2016, the tree species made up around 2.5 percent 
of annual harvest and four percent of the total growing stock 
volume in Ontario (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources 
and Forestry, 2016). Human uses of the tree species include 
lumber, furniture, and trim. 
 
Horsetail spike rush (Credit: 
S. Brinker, public domain

Horsetail spike rush is a perennial sedge with restricted 
distribution in Ontario, occurring in a single site the 
Southwest region (Environment and Climate Change 
CanadaEnvironment and Climate Change Canada, 2006). The 
sedge is a wetland obligate that grows in water that is 4 to 
35 cm deep and is highly vulnerable to hydrologic alterations 
(Leslie, 2018). Although the species is globally ranked as 
apparently secure, it is ranked at the provincial level in 
Ontario as critically imperiled (Brinker et al., 2018) and as 
endangered under Canada's federal Species at Risk Act. Aside 
from climate change, threats to survival and recovery include 
habitat alterations caused by the invasive European common 
reed and loss of genetic diversity (Environment and Climate 
Change CanadaEnvironment and Climate Change Canada, 
2006). 
 
 
 
 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        227  
The current climate risk profile associated with the environmental consequences from climate 
change impacts to vascular plants is rated as ‘medium’ across all assessed regions, with risk 
levels increasing to ‘high’ by mid-century and stabilizing at that level across the province by late 
century. The risk results are consistent regardless of whether emissions follow a high emissions 
scenario (RCP8.5) or a moderate emissions scenario (RCP4.5).  
Warming temperatures and an extended growing season can increase tree productivity and 
growth, with species’ resilience also shaped by moisture shifts and climate-driven changes in 
the incidence and severity of pests and disease. For example, Eastern white pine grows 
optimally between 500 and 4,261 Growing Degree Days (GDDs) so warmer conditions projected 
to mid-century can result in increased biomass growth rates (Boulanger et al., 2017). However, 
coupled with changes in moisture, growing conditions become sub-optimal at temperatures 
exceeding these ranges, since the tree species presents low to moderate ability to tolerate 
drought (Aubin et al., 2018) and excessive hot days reduce trees’ capacity for photosynthesis 
and increase metabolic respiration (Boulanger et al., 2017). Therefore, exposure to increased 
occurrence of hot days and drought reduces growth rates and contributes to tree mortality. At 
the same time, the resilience of trees may be tested by climate-driven changes in the incidence 
and severity of pathogen infections, such as the white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola). 
This invasive pathogen alternates between five-needle pines and Ribes species (currants and 
gooseberries) as hosts; it causes branch die back, reproductive failure through the loss of large 
cone-producing trees and tree mortality. Wetter conditions increase the habitat quality for the 
pathogen, but the probability of tree infection sharply decreases with higher temperatures 
(Thoma et al., 2019). 
Warmer temperatures create conditions for range contraction of trees species whose southern 
edge lies within the Great Lakes Basin, with trees subject to reduced growth rates, reproductive 
failure, and increased disease and mortality (McDermin et al., 2015). It’s likely that eastern 
white pine (among many other vascular plant species in Ontario) will shift northward but it is 
uncertain whether temperatures will increase faster than they can migrate (McDermid et al., 
2015; Johnston et al., 2010). Suitable habitat for eastern white pine is likely to contract in the 
Southwest, Central and Eastern regions in the absence of substantial artificial reforestation 
efforts to keep pace with climate envelopes (Joyce and Rehfeldt, 2013). 
Climate risks to vascular plants also stem from shifting patterns of climate extremes, with 
species with specialized habitats being most vulnerable to impacts including extirpation. For 
example, the Horsetail spike rush is highly vulnerable to hydrologic alterations (Leslie, 2018). 
Although precipitation is expected to increase in Horsetail spike-rush's range in southwestern 
Ontario, summer droughts are also anticipated to occur more frequently. The low genetic 
diversity and narrow habitat requirements for the species will likely limit its ability to survive 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        228  
even if the climate becomes more favourable for it in southern Ontario (Lundy, 2008). Climate 
drying in the Holocene resulted in local extirpation of Horsetail spike-rush from Indiana 
(Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, 2011). By extension, if drought and 
Moisture Deficits reduce water levels and the specific biological requirements of the Horsetail 
spike rush cannot be met, the species may be extirpated from Ontario. Additionally, the 
increased incidence of extreme precipitation events over the shorter-term represents a hazard 
for the Horsetail spike rush. Since there is only one occurrence of the species in Ontario and it is 
small in size (5-10 square metres), the species is extremely vulnerable to losses from stochastic 
events such as an extreme precipitation event (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and 
Forestry, 2011).

Indirect Impacts 
Climate change will result in several indirect impacts to flora across the province. For example, 
species of vascular plants like the eastern white pine will experience an increase in the 
prevalence of pests and pathogens, as warmer winters increase survival rates (Rustad et al., 
2012; Candau and Fleming, 2011). The risks from pest and pathogen outbreaks are 
compounded by the increasing wildfire risk caused by increasing temperatures and lower 
precipitation (Colombo, 2008, Brandt et al., 2014), which will further stress flora species in the 
province. Rapid changes in vegetation succession due to climate change will also alter 
ecosystem functions, such as carbon sequestration and storage and other large-scale 
vegetation attributes (Price, 2013). Similarly, bryophytes are important for carbon storage and 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        229  
nitrogen fixing, and a major food source for various invertebrates and some vertebrate species 
(Shaw et al., 2018, Zuijlen et al., 2021), hence, climate-induced range shifts in bryophyte 
communities may alter community composition and the range of ecosystem functions present 
in the region (Alatalo et al., 2014, Zuijlen et al., 2021). Lichens also support a range of important 
functions such as rock weathering, nutrient cycling, soil formation, and regulating humidity 
(Allen et al., 2019), as well numerous species across trophic webs also use lichens for food, 
camouflage, and shelter. Therefore, climate change impacts on lichen populations and 
communities result in cascading ecosystem impacts. 
7.7.3 Aquatic Ecosystems 
Overview 
Aquatic ecosystems are habitat for animals, plants, microbes, and other living species that 
depend on water. Aquatic ecosystems include freshwater habitats, such as lakes, ponds, and 
rivers, as well as marine habitats, including oceans and intertidal zones. In Ontario, freshwater 
habitats predominate, including the Great Lakes basin, a region straddling Ontario and the U.S. 
that holds a fifth of the world’s fresh surface water, regulates seasonal weather, and provides 
freshwater resources for drinking, fishing, agriculture, shipping, and other important activities 
to surrounding communities (Douglas and Pearson, 2022).  
Within the categories of aquatic ecosystems assessed for the PCCIA (clear open water –lakes, 
rivers, and streams—bog, marsh, and mudflats), clear open water has the most extensive 
surface area (Miller et al., 2021). Freshwater fish and mussel species occur throughout Canada, 
but a particularly high diversity of freshwater mussels and fishes can be found in southern 
Ontario’s aquatic systems (Tognelli et al., 2017). Beyond freshwater fish and mussel 
populations, Ontario’s aquatic ecosystems support numerous reptile and amphibian species, 
waterfowl, mammals, rare vegetation communities, and support specialized habitats for a 
variety of species (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, 2014c). Threats to the 
health of Ontario’s aquatic ecosystems, as measured by biodiversity, include urbanization and 
habitat loss, invasive species, pollution and excessive nutrient flows, unsustainable use, and 
climate change, with relative improvements in some status indicators and deterioration in 
others (Ontario Biodiversity Council, 2021) (see Table 7.9).

Despite successful restoration efforts and

Mixed 
 
Aquatic ecosystems are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change because once degraded 
they can lose functionality and factors such an increased surface water temperature can have 
detrimental effects on aquatic biota such as fish (Poesch et al., 2016; Sutton and Jones, 2021; 
Smith et al., 2021). Direct climate change impacts to aquatic ecosystems include warmer 
temperatures, changes in precipitation, and shifting wind patterns affecting water budgets and 
thermal regimes; these have cascading effects, such as changes in hydrology, reduced ice cover 
on lakes, nutrient cycling, groundwater flow, sedimentation patterns, and mixing in lakes 
(Poesch et al., 2016; Woolway et al., 2020). These physical changes affect the quality and 
quantity of aquatic habitats and the health of ecological functions. Indeed, the combination of 
climate and non-climate stressors can diminish the health of aquatic ecosystems. For example, 
the impact of climate change on extreme precipitation events like intense downpours is related 
to runoff events, which, combined with nutrient and other pollution runoff can result in algae 
blooms, the loss of rare plant species, and reduction in wildlife diversity (Moore et al., 1989). 
For the purposes of the PCCIA, four Level 2 categories were used to assess the risks related to 
the direct impacts to aquatic ecosystems, referred to as focal ecosystems: clear open water 
(lakes, rivers, and streams), marshes, bogs, and mudflats. The selection of focal ecosystems 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        231  
considered representation of Ontario’s diverse ecoregions (hence, inclusion of mudflats as 
unique to the Far North), evidence base on climate change impacts, importance to humans 
(socio-culturally or economically), and importance to species (e.g. key nesting or breeding 
habitat).  
Direct Impacts 
The following sections provide brief characterizations of each Level 2 category assessed for 
aquatic ecosystems across Ontario and related risk results. Risk scenarios for aquatic 
ecosystems were driven by climate variables related to temperature and precipitation, 
including average temperature, high and extreme temperature, drought, extreme precipitation 
events, and winter precipitation. Changes in severity and occurrence of these climate variables 
could lead to environmental consequences of the following types: 
- 
Change in freshwater hydrological regimes 
- 
Increases in habitat-related stresses 
- 
Changes in food web interactions 
- 
Changes in relative abundance of a species within a community 
- 
Change in energy flows and nutrient or matter cycle-related ecosystem processes 
Table 7.10 includes example risk scenarios for each Level 2 category assessed under aquatic 
ecosystems. The climate risk profiles for each Level 2 category are presented by timeframe and 
region in Table 7.11 (operating under RCP8.5), found at the end of this section.

combined effect of climate change (e.g. high temperatures) 
and isostatic rebound resulting in long-term reductions of

Bog 
A bog is a type of peatland. Bogs are open, shrub, or treed communities in which the water 
table is seasonally or permanently at the substrate surface (Ontario Ministry of Natural 
Resources and Forestry, 2014c). They are distinguished from marshes in part by the 
accumulation of Sphagnum peat substrate and from fens by receiving all or most of their water 
from precipitation as opposed to runoff, groundwater, or streams (FGDC, 2013). Bog 
ecosystems are nutrient-poor and acidic, with trees and shrubs growing to less than two metres 
high and tree cover making up less than or around 25% of the area. Bogs occupy 157,933 ha 
(Miller et al., 2021).  
In Ontario’s Far North bogs contain permafrost (soil that remains below 0 °C for two or more 
consecutive years). Climate change concerns in peatlands, including bogs, relate to those 
ecosystems’ ability to conserve carbon sequestration and storage potential as temperatures 
rise, precipitation, and moisture balances shift in a changing climate (McLaughlin et al., 2018). 
Intensifying fire regimes and a longer fire season also pose a threat to peatland carbon stocks, 
increasing vulnerability to deep burns, especially in disturbed bogs that were drained for 
agriculture or mined (Granath et al., 2016).  
Climate risks to bogs were assessed across all six PCCIA regions, focusing on risk scenarios 
driven by temperature changes, specifically Cooling Degree Days, which is a proxy for annual 
average changes, and drought (Moisture Deficit). 
The current climate risk profile associated with the environmental consequences from climate 
change impacts to bogs is rated as ‘medium’ in southern regions of Ontario (Central. Eastern, 
Southwest) and ‘high’ in northern regions of Ontario (e.g. Northeast, Northwest, Far North), 
considering the consequences if risks were to occur. By mid-century risk levels increase to ‘high’ 
for all regions, except the Far North where the risk level is ‘very high’ (under RCP8.5). Risk 
profiles in the Far North and southern regions of Ontario stay ‘high’ and ‘very high’ by late 
century, with risk levels increasing to ‘very high’ in Northeast and Northwest regions, 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        233  
considering pressures from human activities and development. These results for end of century 
are consistent across both emissions concentration scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). 
Warming air temperatures have the potential to shift the composition of flora in bogs. In 
general, increased temperatures would promote vascular plant growth (initially increasing 
Sphagnum growth) and would also increase evaporative demand (ultimately leading to 
Sphagnum water stress) and increase rates of decomposition (Waddington et al., 2015). 
Vascular plants compete directly with Sphagnum and increase rates of evapotranspiration, 
which acts in a positive feedback loop to dry out the peat (Waddington et al., 2015). Evidence 
of mechanisms for Sphagnum decline include a site-level glasshouse experiment examining 
drivers of shifts in peatland ecosystem plant communities. This study observed that the sedge 
Carex disperma was found to displace Sphagnum in a single growing season at temperatures 
greater than 8˚C (Dieleman et al., 2015). The experimental mesocosms used to determine this 
limit were taken from a peatland in the northwest region of Ontario, a nutrient-poor fen 
ecosystem (Dieleman et al., 2015). This study is relevant to bogs since nutrient-poor fens share 
many similar characteristics to bogs and may react similarly to climactic changes however it 
should be noted that fens have higher resilience than bogs due to water table drawdown.  
Over the long term, shifts in air temperature and peatland moisture status would be expected 
to be accompanied by changes in carbon cycling processes linked to a loss of productivity of 
bog’s vegetation cover (Humphreys et al., 2014). For every degree Celsius increase in air 
temperature, there will be a loss in Sphagnum's net primary productivity of 13-29 g C/m2 
(Norby et al., 2019). Loss of productivity from declining Sphagnum cover will lead to reduced 
peat accumulation in bogs (Humphreys et al., 2014). Reduced net ecosystem production, in 
turn, has been shown through simulation studies to reduce the carbon sequestration capacity 
of northern bogs (Wu and Roulet, 2014).  
Fens, in contrast, could turn from carbon sinks to sources, as decomposition (from increased 
temperatures and lower water levels), or wildfire (for the same reasons) will cause emissions to 
outpace sequestration. More recently, a probabilistic modelling study of peat carbon sinks 
indicated that, in the study area (located within the Hudson Bay Lowlands, captured in the 
PCCIA Far North region), the peat carbon sink strength is expected to be moderately vulnerable 
to increasing mean annual air temperature (McLaughlin et al., 2018). Other studies indicate 
that peatlands may still function as carbon sinks to the end of the century even if the peatlands 
transform into a thawed bog; however, any carbon storage in peatlands in the North will be 
offset by methane emissions related to permafrost thaw (Webster et al., 2018). 
Clear Open Water 
Clear open water ecosystems in Ontario are water bodies that have minimal evidence of 
turbidity or suspended sediment and lack macrophyte vegetation, tree, or shrub cover (Ontario 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        234  
Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, 2014c). These ecosystems are distributed 
throughout all regions of Ontario as lakes, rivers, and streams, occupying 14,453,250 hectares 
(ha) (8,241,400 if which constitutes the Great Lakes’ Ontario extent), as delineated in the 
Ontario Land Cover Compilation (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, 2014a).  
The impacts of climate change on the Great Lakes are widely studied, and include decreased 
seasonal ice cover, increased surface water temperatures, lengthened periods between 
turnover of dissolved oxygen and nutrients (Douglas and Pearson, 2022). Other impacts on 
water bodies include enhanced sedimentation caused by more frequent heavy rainfall events 
(Goldsmith et al., 2021). These physical changes affect the functioning of aquatic ecosystems, 
such as nutrient cycles, phenology, and lake productivity (Douglas and Pearson, 2022). 
Streamflow influences the distribution and abundance of aquatic species (Poff et al., 1997) and 
more increased frequency and longer lasting extreme high and low streamflow events are likely 
to have significant consequences for stream populations (Nislow et al., 2004; Wenger et al., 
2011, Letcher et al., 2015).  
Climate risks to clear open water were assessed across all six PCCIA regions, focusing on risk 
scenarios driven by temperature changes, specifically Cooling Degree Days, which is a proxy for 
annual average changes, drought (Moisture Deficit / Drought), and extreme precipitation 
(shorter term). The current climate risk profile associated with the environmental 
consequences from climate change impacts to open clear water is rated as ‘medium’ across all 
regions of Ontario, increasing to ‘high’ by mid-century in southern regions of the province 
(Central, Southeast and Eastern), as socio-economic projections of population growth, urban 
and industrial development exacerbating risk here. By late century (2080s) risk levels are ‘high’ 
in all regions of the province, largely driven by increases in extreme precipitation events. 
Warmer temperatures and drought conditions influence dissolved organic content in lakes, 
with several ecological consequences. Dissolved organic content (DOC) controls several 
chemical, physical, and biological processes in water bodies, including thermal structure, light 
transmission for photosynthesis, attenuation of high levels of ultraviolent light, vertical 
distribution of plants and animals, the form and availability of toxic metals (Gunn et al., 2001). 
Warming temperatures lead to higher DOC levels in lakes and streams, resulting in 
“brownification” of waters and thermal stratification (Gaibisels, 2019, Gunn et al., 2001). These 
conditions favour the persistence of phytoplankton adapted to low light conditions, including 
noxious cyanobacteria. A study of Lake Michigan and Ontario indicated that thermal warming of 
lake surface water can lead to more frequent incomplete fall overturnings and partial winter 
stratifications, which can have significant consequences for the functioning of these ecosystems 
(Fichot et al., 2019). Drought events can, conversely, decrease the export of dissolved organic 
carbon from catchments into lakes, increasing water clarity and creating broader transition 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        235  
zone between surface and bottom water habitats, with biological consequences including shifts 
in predator-prey dynamics and expanded ranges of warmwater fishes (Gunn et al., 2001).  
Heavy rainfall events increase erosion, wash inorganic sediment, and increase limiting nutrients 
into water bodies, leading to changes in energy flows through the food web and shifts in 
community composition. Sedimentation caused by intense rain events will be particularly high 
in winter and spring when rain will fall on bare ground, which is more easily eroded than 
ground with vegetation cover (Assembly of First Nations, 2008).  
Turbid water alters fish predator-prey interactions for predators that rely on vision to detect 
and capture prey (e.g. salmonids). Turbidity will provide prey with a refuge from predation, 
which may alter recruitment rates for both predators and prey. In contrast, many cool (e.g. 
percids) and warm water species are adapted to turbid conditions, which will allow them to 
invade new freshwater areas that become accessible to them due to warming temperatures, 
despite projected reductions in water clarity. Increases in suspended solids can impact 
freshwater mussels by decreasing food availability, impeding filter feeding and respiration, and 
inhibiting aspects of the mussel-host relationship. Studies show that clearance rates, a measure 
of feeding for mussels, are negatively impacted by total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations > 
8 mg/L, and respiratory stress occurred at ~600 mg/L (Goldsmith et al, 2021). Increase in 
turbidity in clear open water systems can have negative impacts on species at risk mussels such 
as the salamander mussel (Simpsonaias ambigua) discussed in Section 7.7.1. Additionally, 
nutrient runoff will stimulate production of phytoplankton such as noxious cyanobacteria, 
resulting in creation of harmful algal blooms. 
Marsh 
Marshes make up 228,874 ha of the province and refer to open, shrub, and treed communities 
in which the water table is seasonally or permanently at the substrate surface (Ontario Ministry 
of Natural Resources and Forestry, 2014c). Marshes are dominated by aquatic plants, with trees 
and shrubs representing less than or around 25% of the vegetation. Marshes can be marine 
(intertidal and supratidal) and freshwater. Marshes are one of four types of wetlands, the other 
three being swamps, bogs, and fens. Freshwater marshes are highly productive ecosystems, 
sustaining diverse plant communities as well as wildlife (FGDC, 2013). Indeed, marshes provide 
staging areas for countless waterfowl species, are home to species at risk birds, fish, mammals, 
reptiles, and amphibians (Miller et al., 2021; Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and 
Forestry, 2014c). Aside from providing habitat, marshes help restore groundwater supplies, 
moderate streamflow, mitigate floods, filter excess nutrients, sediment, and pollutants from 
surface runoff, and contribute to climate regulation through carbon removal from the 
atmosphere and storage in plants and soils (FGDC, 2013; Richardson, 1994). The impacts of 
climate change on wetlands primarily relate to hydrological shifts, although temperature-
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        236  
related impacts are also significant. Climate change impacts combine with other human 
pressures to enhance ecosystem vulnerability (see Table 7.11). For example, loss of marshes in 
southern Ontario continues to occur due to drainage for agriculture and development (Byun et 
al., 2018).

Climate risks to marshes were assessed across Ontario’s six PCCIA regions, focusing on risk 
scenarios driven by drought (Moisture Deficit / Drought), and winter precipitation (Rain:Snow 
Ratio), and temperature changes, specifically Cooling Degree Days, which is a proxy for annual 
average changes. 
The current climate risk profile associated with the environmental consequences from climate 
change impacts to marshes is rated as ‘medium’ across Ontario, increasing to ‘high’ by mid-
century in all regions of Ontario except for the Northwest. By late century risk levels are ‘high’ 
in all regions of the province, except for the Central region, where risk levels are ‘very high’. 
These patterns are consistent across emissions concentration scenarios.  
 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        237  
Dry conditions present risks to freshwater marshes because of the potential to cause 
fluctuations in water levels, changing vegetation profiles and nesting habitat of freshwater 
marshes. Fluctuating water levels do not alter the overall extent of wetlands but do have the 
potential to alter the structure of marsh plant communities (Mortsch et al., 2006). For example, 
one study found water level fluctuations to account for 88% of the variation in cover of Typha 
latifolia, with less of the species occurring at low water levels (Wei and Chow-Fraser, 2005). In 
contrast, the study found that two invasive species (Glyceria and Phragmites) were more 
efficient colonizers of marsh habitats that are experiencing Moisture Deficits (Wei and Chow-
Fraser, 2005). A general response to declining water levels is for vegetation to shift to species 
that are more tolerant of dry conditions (particularly sedges and grasses), with patches of these 
species becoming more contiguous and elongated, wetlands became less fragmented but less 
complex (Mortsch et al., 2006).  
Changes in seasonal precipitation have the potential to affect freshwater marshes by shifting 
the amount and timing of flooding and spring freshets. Changes in flooding will have impacts on 
marsh water levels and hydrology, including a reduction or elimination of meltwater fed 
marshes, which in turn will alter the flora and fauna communities found within the marsh. 
High and extreme temperatures have the potential to contribute to the loss of coastal marsh in 
James Bay and Hudson Bay in the Far North region (Erwin, 2009; Lemmen et al., 2016). Elevated 
air temperatures accelerate permafrost degradation, which may lower the water table, cause 
slumping, and degrade water quality. These events could lead to degradation and loss of 
coastal wetlands, including marshes, and erosion of shorelines by the end of the century. 
Degradation and loss of marshlands in the Far North could lead to long-term reductions of 
wildlife habitat, particularly for shorebirds that rely on these wetlands for food during 
migrations. 
Mudflats 
Mudflats are unvegetated coastal areas of the Hudson Bay-James Bay Lowlands, which are 
partly submerged at high tide (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, 2014c). 
Found in the Far North region of Ontario, mudflats occupy 10,739 ha and are essential resting 
and feeding habitat for migratory shorebirds (Miller et al., 2021; Smit and Wandel, 2006). As 
with other aquatic ecosystems, mudflats also contribute to global carbon regulation through 
carbon sequestration and storage in their sediment and vegetation (Lovelock and Reef, 2020). A 
changing climate, including changes in temperature, precipitation, cryology, storms, and sea 
levels) affects the habitat area occupied by mudflats, sediment supply to them, erosion and 
accretion rates, as well as nutrient flows (Lovelock and Reef, 2020).  
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        238  
Climate risks to mudflats were assessed for the Far North region of Ontario, focusing on a risk 
scenario driven by temperature changes, specifically Cooling Degree Days, which is a proxy for 
annual average changes. 
The current climate risk profile associated with the environmental consequences from climate 
change impacts to mudflats is rated as ‘high’, with the risk staying at that level by mid-century. 
By late century, risk levels increase to ‘very high’, as the intensity of the climate hazard 
increases. These patterns are consistent across emissions concentration scenarios. 
Warmer temperatures combined with land uplift creates coastal squeeze of the intertidal 
mudflats. Elevated temperatures in Hudson Bay and James Bay are anticipated to result in a 
considerably shorter ice cover season, much warmer and longer summers, and warmer and 
shorter winters (Lemmen et al., 2016). Intertidal mudflats will be degraded or lost entirely, as 
land undergoes post-glacial coastal uplift, the tundra ecozone advances poleward and is 
replaced by forests (Smit and Wandel, 2006; Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2017).  
Degradation and loss of intertidal mudflats will reduce habitat available for migrating 
shorebirds and other species that live or spend part of their life cycle in the Far North of 
Ontario, commonly congregating on mudflats in the winter (Lemmen et al., 2016; Smith et al., 
2006). In Ontario, the James Bay shoreline is the most important staging area for migrant 
shorebirds, offering almost entirely undisturbed expanses of rich tidal mudflats and intertidal 
wetlands (Abraham and McKinnon, 2011). Degradation or disappearance of these mudflats due 
to the combined effect of climate change and isostatic rebound will result in long-term 
reductions of migrating shorebird habitat. This means that the availability of food resources will 
no longer coincide with migration timing and breeding events. For example, Hudsonian godwits 
require breeding ranges near tidal mudflats where the non-incubating member of the pair is 
able to feed (Abraham and McKinnon, 2011).

Indirect Impacts 
Degradation and loss of aquatic ecosystems will have significant impacts on the flow and 
reliable supply of ecosystem services, including reduced contributions to global climate 
regulation, the loss of nutrient filtering from agricultural runoff, loss of flood protection during 
major precipitation events putting more pressure on built infrastructure, and loss of 
recreational fishing and nature-based recreation resulting in economic losses for communities 
reliant on these industries (Garcia-Hernandez and Brouwer, 2020).  
Climate change impacts on aquatic ecosystems drive changes to species and create new 
opportunities for invasive species, in turn reducing habitat and resources for species at risk. For 
example, the most recent State of the Great Lakes report indicates that new populations of the 
invasive species Typha spp. have established populations in all the Great Lakes basins increasing 
overall impact on coastal wetlands (Environment and Climate Change Canada and US EPA, 
2022). The presence of Typha spp. and Phragmites australis in marsh ecosystems affects 
aquatic macroinvertebrate structure as well as physical habitat structure and food web 
dynamics (Environment and Climate Change Canada and US EPA, 2022). The persistence of 
Phragmites australis hinders conservation efforts, as its presence adversely affects the health of 
breeding marsh bird species of conservation concern and reduces habitat for endangered 
amphibians, such as the Blanding’s turtle (Tozer and Mackenzie, 2019; Markle and Chow‐Fraser, 
2018). 
7.7.4 Terrestrial Ecosystems 
Overview 
Terrestrial ecosystems are land-based communities of organisms and the interactions between 
them and abiotic components of the community in a given area. In addition to supporting 
biodiversity and providing habitat for wildlife, the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems like 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        241  
forests supply ecosystem services, such as water flow regulation (Rezanezhad et al., 2016), 
carbon sequestration and storage (Magnus et al., 2021; Kayranli et al., 2010; Sierszen et al., 
2012), nature-based recreation such as hiking.  
Within the categories of terrestrial ecosystems assessed for the PCCIA (heath, coniferous forest, 
deciduous forest, sand barren and dune, open tallgrass prairie, and tallgrass savannah), 
forested areas are most extensive (Miller et al., 2021). The extent and composition of terrestrial 
ecosystems is a function of climate, landscape attributes (e.g. geomorphology, topography, 
soil), and landscape history. For example, forests have been most altered in areas where soil 
and topography are suitable for agriculture and settlement, with their composition, age, and 
structure of forest stands also affected by disturbances (e.g. harvest, fires, insects, and disease) 
(Ontario Biodiversity Council, 2021). Threats to the health of Ontario’s terrestrial ecosystems, 
as measured by biodiversity, include habitat fragmentation, land-use pressures, pollution, 
invasive species, unsustainable use, and climate change, with relative improvements in some 
status indicators and deterioration in others (Ontario Biodiversity Council, 2021) (see Table 
7.13).

For the purposes of the PCCIA, six Level 2 categories were used to assess the direct impacts to 
terrestrial ecosystems, referred to as focal ecosystems: heath, coniferous forest, deciduous 
forest, sand barren and dune, open tallgrass prairie, and tallgrass savannah. The selection of 
focal ecosystems considered representation of Ontario’s diverse ecoregions (hence, inclusion of 
heath as unique to the Far North), evidence base on climate change impacts, importance to 
humans (socio-culturally or economically), and importance to species (e.g. key nesting or 
breeding habitat). Three of the six Level 2 categories of terrestrial ecosystems are rare 
vegetation communities (Tallgrass Savannahs, Open Tallgrass Prairie, Sand Barren and Dune) or 
habitats and breeding areas for migratory birds (Deciduous and Coniferous Forests) as defined 
in the province’s Significant Wildlife Habitat Technical Guide (Ontario Ministry of Natural 
Resources and Forestry, 2000) and related Significant Wildlife Habitat Criteria Schedules 
(Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, 2015). 
Direct Impacts 
This section describes the quantitative scores for direct risks assessed for the Level 2 Terrestrial 
Ecosystem categories. Over 100 separate interactions were assessed for Terrestrial Ecosystems, 
considering relevant climate variables to each Level 2 category and were evaluated under 
current and future timeframes. The assessment has drawn on research, provincial data, and 
literature to inform scenario development and consequence scoring related to direct climate 
risks on aquatic ecosystem types. 
Table 7.14 includes example risk scenarios for each Level 2 category assessed under terrestrial 
ecosystems. The climate risk profiles for each Level 2 category are presented by timeframe and 
region in Table 7.16 (operating under RCP8.5), at the end of this section.

Coniferous Forests 
Coniferous-dominated forests are continuous forests canopy composed mainly of coniferous 
species, primarily jack pine, black spruce, and white spruce. Vegetation cover tends to be closed 
and tall (60% closure and greater than 10 m), but can also be open and tall, and low 
communities. Coniferous-dominate forests make up 21.2 million ha of Ontario, with the 
majority of these ecosystems occurring in the northern regions of the province (Watkins, 2021; 
Miller et al., 2021). Studies indicate that the boreal forest is relatively sensitive to climate 
change, having already shown responses despite relatively small changes (Colombo, 2008). This 
is concerning since the projected comparatively large changes in climate may result in more 
substantial responses than previously projected (Colombo, 2008). Due to the long lifespan of 
tree species, rapid climate change is likely to have direct and indirect negative impacts on 
vegetation health, composition, structure, and productivity within half of many species' 
lifetimes (Puric-Mladenovic et al., 2011).  
The recent assessment of climate change impacts and adaptation knowledge for Ontario 
synthesizes the latest research on forests’ vulnerability to climate change and the benefits of 
sustaining resilient forested landscapes (Douglas and Pearson, 2022). Direct impacts for forests 
overall include i) increased survival rates of forest pests and diseases linked to warmer winters; 
ii) reduced tree resistance to cold linked to warming winters and abrupt transitions from warm 
to freezing in late fall, resulting in forest decline; iii) increased disturbance to forests due to the 
increased frequency, intensity, extent, timing, and duration of forest fires; iv) reduced 
productivity and growth of boreal species because of warming and drought-induced mortality 
and increased migration failure; v) a long term northward migration of tree species as climate 
suitability envelopes shift. Significant uncertainty remains regarding boreal and temperate trees 
species response to climate change, including limits of tree community recovery from 
disturbance (Park et al., 2014). 
Climate risks to coniferous-dominated forests were assessed across four PCCIA regions: Eastern, 
Northeastern, Northwestern, and Far North. Our decision criterion was to include PCCIA regions 
with over two percent of land cover dominated by coniferous forests (Table 7.15). We focused 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        244  
on risk scenarios driven by temperature changes, specifically Growing Season Length, and 
wildfires.

The current climate risk profile associated with the environmental consequences from climate 
change impacts to coniferous forests is rated as ‘medium’ across the four regions assessed, 
increasing to ‘high’ by mid-century. Risk stays at that level by the end of century for all assessed 
regions except for Eastern Ontario, where risk increases to ‘very high’. 
Warming contributes to the northward shift of coniferous forest ranges. Climate suitability, a 
combination of temperature and precipitation, for different tree species is shifting, affecting 
tree species’ productivity (and total biomass) and causing changes in forest composition. Trees 
species whose southern edge lies within the Great Lakes Basin, such as white pine, jack pine, 
and red pine will likely experience reduced growth rates, reproductive failure, and increased 
disease and mortality. The amount of suitable habitat is expected to increase for some 
deciduous species like sugar maple, red oak and deciduous Carolinian species. What had been 
considered boreal regions will undergo shifts to include species from ecosystems characterized 
by more southern ecoregions such as: boreal forest to wetland, boreal forest to Great Lakes- St. 
Lawrence forest, or boreal forest to aspen parkland. A study of changes to the parkland-boreal 
forest ecotone through sediment core analysis and pollen inferences indicates that the boreal 
forest will likely become more open and even with a projected increase in precipitation will see 
a decrease in effective moisture due to an overall increase in evaporation and 
evapotranspiration with future increased temperatures (Moos and Cumming, 2011).  
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        245  
The potential exists for the contraction of coniferous forest ecosystems due to increased 
disturbance rates and encroachment of deciduous southern tree species, with several cascading 
effects. With the increase of wildfire occurrence and area burned, pioneer species abundance 
will increase (Gauthier et al., 2014). An increase in area burned will hasten the establishment of 
young stands with low biomass. Young forests often have higher productivity in terms of annual 
growth but accumulate less biomass and carbon. Their total biomass and carbon storage will 
recover to mature forest levels as they age. Although several studies suggest that CO2 
fertilization can have a positive effect on net primary production in conifer-dominated forests, a 
study comparing model simulations to growth in Manitoba’s boreal forest indicates that these 
results cannot be directly extrapolated to large, forested areas without considering local growth 
constraints (Girardin et al., 2011).  
Increased wildfire occurrence in combination with rising temperatures could also result in 
degraded permafrost and therefore the replacement of black spruce by other species in 
northern regions (Gauthier et al., 2014). Temperature is directly related to the persistence and 
expansion of defoliation caused by spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) in Ontario 
(Candau and Fleming, 2011). This invasive species impacts coniferous forest species such as 
balsam fir (Abies balsamea) and white spruce (Picea glauca). The combination of climate 
change-induced shifts in fire, insect disturbances, and tree mortality is projected to reduce 
above-ground biomass in the boreal, with the most pronounced impacts occurring in Northwest 
Ontario along the southern part of the boreal (Brecka, 2018).  
Deciduous Forests 
Deciduous-dominated forests are continuous forests canopy composed mainly of deciduous 
(hardwood) species, primarily poplar and birch. Vegetation cover tends to be closed and tall (60 
percent closure and greater than 10 m), but can also be open and tall, and low communities 
(Watkins, 2021; Miller et al., 2021; Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, 2014a; 
Khan and Conway, 2020).  
Climate risks to deciduous-dominated forests were assessed across Ontario, except the Far 
North. Risk profiles are driven by temperature changes, specifically Growing Degree Days, and 
drought (Moisture Deficit). 
The current climate risk profile associated with the environmental consequences from climate 
change impacts to deciduous forests is rated as ‘medium’ across the five regions assessed, 
increasing to ‘high’ by mid-century. Shifts in dominant species are occurring in managed, 
deciduous forests in response to both active harvest management and no-harvest management 
systems, indicating that climate-influenced changes are occurring both with and without human 
intervention (Olson et al., 2017). Risk remains at this level by the end of century. The risk 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        246  
profiles for this category have a significant degree of uncertainty with regard to how pressures 
from socio-economic activities could interfere with conditions favouring migration. 
Warming temperatures have the potential to drive changes to the composition of deciduous 
forests, favouring warm-adapted species. Climate suitability – a combination of changes in 
temperature and precipitation— for different tree species is shifting, affecting tree species 
productivity (and total biomass) and causing changes in forest composition. Trees species 
whose southern edge lies within the Great Lakes Basin, such as trembling aspen and yellow 
birch will likely experience reduced growth rates, reproductive failure, and increased disease 
and mortality. As climate change progresses, suitable habitat for trembling aspen may be 
limited to the northern upper Great Lakes. The amount of suitable habitat is expected to 
increase for some species like sugar maple, red oak, and deciduous Carolinian species. Taylor et 
al., (2017) illustrated the effects of climate change on the composition of the Canadian Acadian 
Forest region using process-based modelling, projecting by end of century a persistent increase 
in relative abundance of temperate species (e.g. American beech, red maple, red oak, and 
white ash) and a decrease in cold-adapted species (eastern larch, trembling aspen, and white 
birch) over time. This modelling work highlighted the importance of interspecific competition as 
a key driver of forest community shifts, which is an indirect effect of warmer and drier 
conditions. 
Northward colonization of temperate species will not be able to keep pace with projected 
changes in climate envelopes, leaving less productive forests as a result. Both climatic and non-
climatic factors (stand attributes, biotic interactions, soil conditions, geographical barriers) 
influence colonization but these nuances are not typically accounted for in species distribution 
modelling. A recent study focused on 10 forest species common in eastern Canada highlights 
the likely inability of tree species to track climate suitability over time (Boisvert-Marsh- et al., 
2022). Species distribution modelling informed by species-specific data on dispersal abilities 
and regeneration time suggests a lag between simulated distribution limits and climatically-
suitable limits, particularly for temperate species (Boisvert‐Marsh et al., 2022). This lag 
increases over time. Exposure to soil moisture stress is one mechanism causing negative 
responses by temperate species (Taylor et al., 2017). Trees exposed to intermittent summer 
drought because they are in dry habitats may be more prone to disease if climate change 
further reduces soil moisture. In some cases, Moisture Deficits could promote a transition to 
patchy forest cover and grassland habitat (Khan and Conway, 2020).  
Heath 
Heath ecosystems are shrubland habitats found mainly on free-draining infertile, acidic soils 
deposited on raised beaches and ancient shorelines. Heaths in Ontario have greater than 25 
percent of vegetation cover, which is limited to low-growing woody vegetation, lichen, Arctic 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        247  
herb, and various acidic soil loving shrub species. These ecosystems are localized, occurring in 
Ontario’s Far North region and constituting 67,122 ha of Ontario (Miller et al., 2021), as 
delineated in the Ontario Land Cover Compilation (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and 
Forestry, 2014a). The impacts of climate change on heath ecosystems are understudied relative 
to other terrestrial ecosystems but their sensitivity to climate change stems from the specialist 
vegetation that grows in these complex habitats. Literature from outside Ontario highlights 
shifts toward shrub dominance and changes in nutrient fluxes as among the direct impacts of 
warmer temperatures in low arctic tundra and heathlands (Fagúndez, 2013; Dumais et al., 
2014; Alvarenga and Rousk, 2021). 
Climate risks to heath ecosystems were assessed for the Far North region, focusing on risk 
scenarios driven by change in precipitation (Mean Summer Precipitation) and wildfire.  
The current climate risk profile associated with the environmental consequences from climate 
change impacts to heath ecosystems is rated as ‘medium’, staying at that level by mid-century. 
By late century the risk level is ‘high’, mainly driven by assumptions around land use pressures 
in the northern Boreal (Lonsdale et al., 2017), which exacerbate the consequences of climate 
change impacts. 
Changes in summer water balance can affect net ecosystem carbon exchange in heath 
ecosystems. Experimental treatments on temperate heather indicate that warming enhances 
increases in plant productivity, photosynthesis, and respiration due to rising CO2 levels, but 
drought decreases these effects (Albert et al., 2011). Other studies, also suggest that 
differences in precipitation and moisture affect net ecosystem CO2 exchange in heath 
environments, with site-specific moisture regimes restricting respiratory activity at the heath 
and sedge systems when they are too dry or too wet (Nobrega and Grogan, 2008). Fluctuations 
in summer precipitation frequency and amount changes soil moisture and negatively impacts 
respiratory activity of heath systems, changing rates of plant carbon uptake (Nobrega and 
Grogan, 2008; Albert et al., 2011). 
The intensification of wildfire regimes has the potential to decrease plant richness in heaths, 
affecting ecosystem function. The severity and frequency of forest fires have powerful effects 
on regeneration dynamics of heath ecosystem species especially in those sites subject to 
warming and drying (St. James and Mallik, 2021; Fagúndez, 2013). Heath regeneration relies on 
resprouting and seed germination. Experimental research from heath ecosystems outside of 
Ontario links drought and warming to reduced seedling diversity (Fagúndez, 2013). Therefore, 
the combined effect of more frequent wildfires, warmer temperatures and dryer conditions can 
delay regeneration and result in vegetation communities that support less species diversity, 
with negative implications for ecosystem function. (St. James and Mallik, 2021). 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        248  
Sand Barren and Dune 
Sand barren and dune ecosystems are natural ecosystems not originating from anthropogenic 
or cultural disturbances with severe environmental limitations and tree cover of less than 60% 
(Lee et al., 1998). Sand barrens are not restricted to shorelines and are characterized by sand 
substrate, low and patchy vegetation cover, stunted trees and shrubs if present, with conditions 
maintained through environmental limiting factors such as drought or lack of nutrients (Lee et 
al., 1998). Sand dues are restricted to active shorelines or near lakes, rivers, streams, or ponds 
and are characterized by active hills of accumulated sand above the normal reach of waves and 
subject to erosion from wind (Lee et al., 1998). Dune ecosystems sustain rare vegetation 
communities and associated wildlife, with dune habitat supporting human recreation (e.g. 
Sandbanks Provincial Park). Sand dune and barren habitats combined cover 698 ha of Ontario, 
as delineated in the Ontario Land Cover Compilation (OMNRF 2014). Open sandy areas in 
eastern Ontario have declined to approximately 1% of their former range over the past 60 to 70 
years due to a variety of anthropogenic forces, heightening these systems’ vulnerability to the 
impacts of climate change (Catling et al., 2008). The 2022 State of the Great Lake report 
indicates that the overall 10-year assessment for Great Lake shorelines (excluding Lake 
Superior, which has insufficient data for Canada as of 2022) is deteriorating, as hardened 
shorelines have increased for all lakes. This increase in hardened shorelines is a concern as 
physical modifications to the shoreline have altered or eliminated connectivity to sand barren 
and dune habitats (Environment and Climate Change Canada and US EPA, 2022). 
Climate risks to sand barren and dune ecosystems were assessed for the southern regions of 
Ontario (Central, Southern, Eastern), focusing on risk scenarios driven by changes in 
temperature (Growing Season Length, as a proxy for average annual temperature change). 
The current climate risk profile associated with the environmental consequences from climate 
change impacts to sand barren and dune ecosystems is rated as ‘medium’. Risk levels across 
southern Ontario increase to ‘high’ by mid-century and are anticipated to remain at this level to 
the end of the century.  
Warming alters abiotic conditions that are important to the maintenance of sand barren and 
dune ecosystems. These ecosystems are vulnerable to degradation and erosion from high wave 
energy. Recent observations of ice duration on the Great Lakes and climate change projections 
indicate a trend of shorter ice durations and more frequent ice-free winters in Lake Erie 
(BaMasoud and Byrne, 2012). If warmer trends continue, areas of the Great Lakes shoreline will 
be exposed to winter storm wave action throughout the season (BaMasoud and Byrne, 2012). 
The loss of protective ice cover combined with increases in extreme weather events that may 
affect wave energy present risks to the integrity of sand barren and dune ecosystems 
(Environment and Climate Change Canada and US EPA, 2022). Warming also induces 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        249  
physiological stress to vegetation communities that sand barren and dunes support. For 
example, a 5˚C increase in temperature relative to current climate in northern Michigan 
reduced A. breviligulata (a foundational sand dune species) survival by 45% (Emery and 
Rudgers, 2013). Ultimately, warming and related loss of protective ice cover over the winter 
reduces the extent of sand barren and dune ecosystems in Ontario and reduces species 
richness. 
Open Tallgrass Prairie 
Open tallgrass prairie is a habitat dominated by grasses or grass-like plants (prairie graminoids); 
tree and shrub cover are less than 25% of the surface coverage, respectively. This focal 
ecosystem is proportionally the smallest of all terrestrial ecosystems assessed as Level 2 
categories for Ontario, consisting of 336 ha and is one of the rarest and most endangered 
ecosystems globally (Miller, 2021; Nemec, 2014). 
Climate risks to open tallgrass prairie were assessed for the southern regions of Ontario, 
(Central, Southwest and Eastern) focusing on risk scenarios driven by drought conditions and 
high temperatures.  
The current climate risk profile associated with the environmental consequences from climate 
change impacts to open tallgrass prairie is rated as ‘medium’, staying at that level until mid-
century. Risk levels across southern Ontario increase to ‘high’ by the end of the century.  
Repeated seasonal droughts combined with warming have the potential to reduce biodiversity 
of open tallgrass prairie ecosystems. Climate change is unlikely to unilaterally alter the 
functional composition of tallgrass prairie flora (Bachelet et al., 2011; Craine et al., 2011), as 
many functional traits including physiological drought tolerance have not been shown to be 
related to climate envelope parameters (Craine et al., 2011). In a changing climate, drier 
conditions could cause species losses, indirectly altering the productivity of the system. 
However, the system’s overall biodiversity should enable continued functioning in the face of 
climate change (Craine et al., 2011). Collins et al., (2012) found that a 19-year experiment of 
water addition during the growing season did not have a significant impact on community 
structure as opposed to other key drivers of change in this grassland. Overall, repeated 
seasonal droughts combined with warming could cause losses of some species within the open 
tallgrass prairie ecosystem although functionality would likely be retained.  
The co-occurrence of wildfire and extreme heat and water stress during growing seasons has 
the potential to lead to lasting shifts in community structure of tallgrass prairie ecosystems. Fire 
and nitrogen availability are key drivers of changes in community structure, diversity, and 
composition of this grassland ecosystem. The expectation exists that drought, heat, and fire 
favour maintenance of this tallgrass ecosystem. However, plot-based research comparing plots 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        250  
exposed to heat and water stress (high temperatures and low growing season precipitation) but 
not wildfire and plots exposed to both heat and water stress and wildfire counter this 
expectation (Ratajczak et al., 2019). Community structure, diversity, and composition showed 
minor to insignificant changes, such as a 20% reduction in grass cover and a slight increase in 
species diversity, in the former plots. Plots exposed to heat and water stress and wildfire 
underwent larger changes, including an 80% reduction in grass cover, 50 percent increase in 
forb cover, and increased plant diversity. Two years after exposure to heat and water stress, 
structural shifts in burned plots showed little sign of recovery, indicating a potentially lasting 
shift in plant community structure. 
Tallgrass Savannah 
Tallgrass savannah ecosystems are dominated by prairie grasses, with open tree cover between 
25 and 35%. They are some of the most endangered ecosystems in Canada and only consist of 
693 ha of the Ontario landscape (Rodger & Woodliffe, 2001; Miller, 2021).  
Climate risks to tallgrass savannah were assessed for the southern regions of Ontario (Central, 
Southwest, Eastern), focusing on risk scenarios driven by temperature change (Growing Degree 
Days) and drought (Moisture Deficit / Drought). Tallgrass savannahs and the vulnerable plant 
and animal species they support are currently assessed as having ‘medium’ climate risk scores, 
with scores increasing to ‘high’ by mid-century and staying at that level through to the end of 
the century. 
Repeated seasonal droughts have the potential to reduce biodiversity of tallgrass savannah 
ecosystems. Tallgrass savannahs are less vulnerable to the impacts of climate change than 
other terrestrial ecosystems. For example, many native prairie and savannah species are well 
adapted to drought during the summer season (Bachelet et al., 2011). These adaptations may 
provide an advantage to native species over invasives that may be introduced to tallgrass 
savannah systems that are not drought tolerant (Bachelet et al., 2011). If tallgrass savannah 
ecosystems are able to maintain high species richness levels, recovery from extreme drought 
events is likely (Dey and Kabrick, 2015). However, repeated seasonal droughts impacting 
tallgrass savannah systems with low species richness (degraded systems) may result in an 
inability to recover from extreme events.  
Degraded tallgrass savannah systems are likely to be resilient to environmental stress and biotic 
threats in the face of extended hot-weather seasons. Although many native prairie and 
savannah species are well adapted to high temperatures during the summer season and with 
these seasons extended, prairie and savannah species may in fact thrive (Bachelet et al., 2011). 
If tallgrass savannah ecosystems are able to maintain high species richness levels, they should 
be less vulnerable to environmental stress and biotic threats.

Indirect Impacts 
There are several indirect impacts that may occur due to the impacts of climate change on 
terrestrial ecosystems. Changes to carbon cycling in Heath ecosystems could indirectly impact 
adjacent but highly different hydrological systems (for example, aquatic systems) resulting in 
overall changes to CO2 cycling in the tundra and other northern ecosystems (Vile et al., 2011). In 
deciduous forest systems, increased temperatures and lower precipitation increases the 
likelihood of forest fires. This increase in temperature and change to precipitation makes 
forests vulnerable to pests and disease and also increase fuel loads, indirectly increasing the 
area burned by forest fires (Colombo, 2008; Brandt et al., 2014). This is especially of concern 
due to the high proportion of deciduous forests in close proximity to urban and highly 
populated areas, the current mapped wildland-urban interface (WUI) in Ontario that is 
categorized as having “High Interface”, “High fuels”, and “High structures” across three-way 
categorical maps can be found in the Great-St. Lawrence Forest region (captured in PCCIA 
Eastern region, the southern part of the Northeast region, the northwest part of Central region, 
and the northern tip of the Southwestern region), while there have not been many large fires 
that have occurred within this WUI area in the past few years, likely as a result of suppression 
activities, future housing development is likely to increase this area and more fire suppression 
measures may need to take place (Johnston and Flannigan, 2017; Johnston, 2010).  
Changes to the boreal ecosystem composition indirectly cause increasing detrimental effects on 
species that depend on mature and old-growth ecosystems, for example woodland caribou a 
SAR, when combining increased natural disturbance rate with harvesting (Gauthier et al., 2014). 
Changes to vegetation in the boreal forest will indirectly cause negative impacts on boreal 
carbon balance and other large-scale vegetation attributes (Price et al., 2013). 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        253  
Sand Barren and Dune habitats may continue to recede, resulting in wide areas of provincial 
and national parks' ecologically and economically viable spaces being lost to the lake as a result 
of enhanced erosion (BaMasoud and Byrne, 2012). The implications for the impact of low ice 
cover on coasts with similar conditions to sand barren and dune habitats indicate increased 
opportunities for shoreline erosion. Loss of dune vegetation species through increased 
temperature and changes to precipitation could result in reduction of carbon storage and 
organic matter build-up in early successional systems due to reduced plant survival and root 
growth (Emery and Rudgers, 2013). The erosion of sand barren and dune habitat and the 
beaches that go along with them will impact the tourism industries in Eastern, central, and 
southwest regions of Ontario where many tourist destinations are located along the shores of 
the Great Lakes where dune habitats are present (BaMasoud and Byrne, 2012). This erosion will 
also impact property owners that own property along the coasts of the Great Lakes. Numerous 
species at risk will be impacted by the loss of sand barren and dune habitats such as Fowler’s 
toad, eastern prickly pear cactus, eastern hognose snake, and dusted skipper butterfly 
(Carolinian Canada, 2009).  
7.7.5 Regulating Services  
Overview 
Regulating services refer to processes that are required for the maintenance of earth’s systems 
and moderate natural phenomena affecting human health, safety, or comfort (Haines-Young 
and Potschin, 2017). Categories of regulating services include water quality regulation, water 
flow regulation, waste treatment, erosion and flood control, decomposition, pest control, air 
filtration, local climate regulation (shade and evaporative cooling), natural carbon storage and 
sequestration, and pollination (CICES V5.1). These services are available across Ontario, 
although the capacity of natural features (living and non-living) to generate services differs 
regionally. For example, the supply of natural carbon storage services is concentrated in 
Hudson Bay Lowlands and boreal ecosystems (Mitchell et al., 2021). 
Although essential to human well-being, regulating services are not commonly traded in 
markets and their value is not always appreciated. Concepts such as natural capital and 
economic techniques help bring to light the monetary value of ecosystem service flows, 
providing evidence on nature’s benefits and the costs if an ecosystem service is impaired or 
lost. For example, the annual value of four regulating services supplied by terrestrial and 
aquatic ecosystems as well as farm fields in Lake Simcoe’s watershed is estimated to be $255 
million (in 2016$) (LSRCA, 2017). 
Land use change, habitat fragmentation, pollution, resource extraction activities, and other 
development pressures affect the flows of regulating services, with climate change as an 
additional stressor. As reviewed under this Area of Focus, changes in climate have direct and 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        254  
cascading effects on ecosystems, which, in turn, can compromise the reliability of ecosystem 
services. For example, warmer temperatures and drought play a particular role in carbon 
storage as the ecosystems acting as carbon sinks may lose their capacity to store carbon under 
these conditions (Grosse et al., 2011). 
For the purposes of the PCCIA, three Level 2 categories were used to assess the direct impacts 
to regulating services: natural carbon storage, pollination, and water flow regulation. The 
selection of Level 2 categories considered applicability across Ontario, information on climate 
change impacts, and management of the Government of Ontario.  
Direct Impacts 
The following sections provide brief characterizations of each Level 2 category assessed for 
regulating services across Ontario and related risk results. Risk scenarios for regulating services 
were driven by climate hazards related to temperature, precipitation, and drought. Changes in 
severity and occurrence of these climate hazards could lead to environmental consequences of 
the following types: 
- 
Change in availability of services 
- 
Change in quality of services 
- 
Change in abiotic conditions (freshwater hydrological regime) 
Table 7.17 includes illustrative risk scenarios for each Level 2 category assessed under 
regulating services. The climate risk profiles for each Level 2 category are presented by 
timeframe and region in Figure 7.18 (operating under RCP8.5), found at the end of this section.

Slow increases in temperature result in gradual shifts in

Loss of suitable habitat for Bombus pollinators at their

their northern range boundaries, and a mismatch in the 
timing of bee emergence and floral resource availability in

Water Flow 
Regulation 
Drought affects Ontario’s natural areas in a way that makes 
them less effective at regulating water flow. This occurs 
through direct losses of available water (reduced water 
flow) and reduced capacity of systems to take in, store, and 
slowly provide water over time (increased peak flows, 
reduced water availability over time). 
Medium 
 
Carbon Storage 
Natural carbon storage is an important aspect of global climate regulation, contributing to 
reduced atmospheric carbon levels or limiting further accumulation. Ontario's natural 
ecosystems play an important role in this service, with forests, wetlands, croplands, and 
rangelands storing carbon in soils and vegetation. Carbon storage provision and capacity is 
variable across the province and most significant in less developed areas with more natural 
vegetation, with northern Ontario's boreal forests and peatlands as a hotspot with high levels 
of stored carbon.  
Assessing the existing carbon storage regulating services provided by Ontario's ecosystems is 
important for current greenhouse gas inventories as well as for identifying key locations that 
may have the capacity to further contribute to carbon storage, or to be particularly sensitive to 
disruption by climate hazards. This information can influence management decisions and drive 
changes to global climate projections. 
Climate risks to natural carbon storage were assessed across all six PCCIA regions, focusing on 
risk scenarios driven by temperature changes, specifically Growing Degree Days, which is a 
proxy for annual average changes, and drought (Moisture Deficit). 
The current climate risk profile associated with the environmental consequences from climate 
change impacts to natural carbon storage is regionally variable, rated as ‘low’ in southern 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        256  
regions of Ontario, ‘medium’ in Northwest Ontario, and ‘high’ in the Northeast and Far North. 
By mid-century risk levels are ‘high’ in the Northeast, Northwest, Central, and Eastern region, 
increasing from ‘low’ to ‘medium’ in the Southwest region, and from ‘high’ to ‘very high’ in the 
Far North. By end of the century risk levels are ‘very high’ in northern regions of Ontario 
(Northeast, Northwest, Far North) and ‘high’ in southern regions (Central, Southwest, Eastern). 
These patterns are consistent across emissions concentration scenarios. Risk levels consider 
both increasing pressures by human activities and development and changes in global demand 
for this regulating service.  
Warmer air temperatures and drought conditions are the main climate drivers presenting risks 
to the supply of carbon storage ecosystem services. Forests (Magnus et al., 2021), wetlands 
(Kayranli et al., 2010; Sierszen et al., 2012), and peatlands (James, 2020; Helbig et al., 2019; 
McLaughin and Packalen, 2021) are some of the central carbon sinks in the province; however, 
their capacity to remove carbon from the atmosphere and store it is vulnerable to increasing 
temperatures. Temperature increases can result in gradual shifts in ecosystem composition and 
carbon cycling, leading to a net decrease in carbon sequestration (Saarikoski et al., 2015). In 
particular, the boreal forests and wetlands found in Ontario's Far North, Northeast, and 
Northwest regions could release substantial amounts of carbon and reduce their capacity to 
store additional carbon in the future as temperature rises (Grosse et al., 2011). Several 
researchers also project that peatlands will sequester less carbon over time due to rising 
temperature (James, 2020; Helbig et al., 2019; McLaughin and Packalen, 2021). If increasing 
temperatures cross environmental thresholds, they could trigger more acute stressors such as 
permafrost breakdown/landslides and the release of additional carbon sources (Grosse et al., 
2011).  
The impacts will vary by region, with the most significant consequences occurring from changes 
in the northern regions. Furthermore, drought conditions can affect wetlands in a way that 
makes them less effective at storing carbon, resulting in a slow shift away from being a carbon 
sink. Drought conditions also have the potential to alter the functioning of Ontario's forests, 
resulting in carbon release over time as well as rapidly from increased fire activity. The 
incidence of drought or Moisture Deficits, however, is not expected to increase by the end of 
the century. 
Pollination 
Pollination is an ecosystem process by which biota are involved in the transfer of pollen 
between male and female part of flowers, providing the service of fertilizing wild plant species 
and crops. Pollination provided by wild pollinators and their supporting habitat is essential for 
maintaining the abundance and diversity of plant species and for crop cultivation. Globally, 
about 75% of flowering plants rely on pollinators for fertilization and about 30% of food crops 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        257  
depend on pollinators (see Food and Agriculture Section 5.0 for indirect impacts linked to 
pollination) (CSPNA, 2007; Klein et al., 2007).  
Pollinators are mainly insects (typically bees) but also birds, bats, and several other animals that 
assist plants in producing fruit and seed (AAFC, 2014). Climate change is one of many factors 
contributing to the decline of wild and managed bees, affecting the supply of pollination 
services. Other factors include reduced diversity of flowering plants, habitat loss, degradation 
and fragmentation, the introduction of invasive plant species, toxicity and use of pesticides, 
diseases and parasites, and air pollution (AAFC, 2014). 
Climate risks to pollination services were assessed across all six PCCIA regions, focusing on risk 
scenarios driven by temperature changes, specifically Growing Degree Days, which is a proxy 
for annual average changes.  
The current climate risk profiles associated with the environmental consequences from climate 
change impacts to pollination services are rated as ‘medium’ across Ontario, increasing to ‘high’ 
by mid-century in all regions of Ontario except for the Southwest and Central regions, where 
risk levels are anticipated to be ‘very high’. By late century risk levels are ‘very high’ in southern 
regions of the province (Central, Southwest, Eastern) and ‘high’ in northern regions (Northeast, 
Northwest, Far North). These patterns are consistent across emissions concentration scenarios 
and take into account both enhanced pressures from human activities and development and 
the potential increase in demand for pollination services linked to food production. 
Temperature rise (Growing Degree Days) is the primary climate variable affecting pollination. 
The most significant impact occurs when increasing mean ambient air temperatures exceed 
pollinator species’ thermal limits (Soroye et al., 2020). Range shifts are almost certain to occur 
as a result, but there are concerns that pollinators will not shift their range quickly enough to 
keep up with climate change (Sirois-Delisle and Kerr, 2018; Kerr et al., 2015). One resulting 
consequence is a predicted range contraction across Bombus species in North America (Sirois-
Delisle and Kerr, 2018). The increasing temperature may also result in a loss of synchrony 
between pollinator species emergence and the availability of quality floral resources in the 
spring, causing additional stress (Pyke et al., 2016). As a result, widespread species richness 
declines are expected for Bombus species. 
These impacts are a concern in all provincial regions but are especially concerning in southern 
Ontario, where most agriculture occurs. Suitable habitat within species’ thermal limits is 
expected to be lost in these regions (Sirois-Delisle and Kerr, 2018). Local extirpation events will 
be most probable in areas where local temperatures exceed species’ historical thermal 
tolerances (Soroye et al., 2020). In addition to catastrophic ecological consequences, 
subsequent negative impacts on food yields and human welfare could occur.

Water Flow Regulation 
Water flow regulation involves the regulation of water flows by virtue of the chemical and 
physical properties or characteristics of ecosystems that assist people in managing and using 
hydrological systems. Water flow regulation mitigates risks associated with health and safety 
and maintains environmental flow needs for aquatic species. Water flow regulation provides 
multiple benefits, including flood prevention, drought mitigation, and flow stability. The timing 
and magnitude of runoff, flooding, and aquifer recharge can be strongly influenced by changes 
in landcover and by climate conditions directly, influencing service provision. 
Climate risks to water flow regulation were assessed across Ontario’s six PCCIA regions, 
focusing on risk scenarios driven by extreme precipitation (Extreme Precipitation Events – 
Shorter Term), winter precipitation (Mean Winter Precipitation), drought (Moisture Deficit / 
Drought). 
The current climate risk profile associated with the environmental consequences from climate 
change impacts to water flow regulation is rated as ‘medium’ across Ontario, increasing to 
‘high’ by mid-century in southern regions of the province (Central, Southwest, Eastern). By late 
century risk levels are ‘high’ across Ontario. These patterns are consistent across emissions 
concentration scenarios and consider both enhanced pressures from human activities and 
development and the potential increase in demand for water flow regulation for a range of 
outcomes (e.g. flood risk mitigation). 
Water flow regulation is relevant across all six provincial regions, given the vast hydrological 
network throughout Ontario. Drought and extreme precipitation are the primary climate 
hazard groups that will impact this regulating service. Drought can affect the function of 
ecosystems that provide the water flow regulation service by leading to changes in community 
composition, physical changes to hydraulic connectivity and routing, and reduced groundwater 
levels (Krantzberg and Boer, 2006). These changes will decrease water availability if water levels 
are too low. It can also result in reduced capacity to retain water and buffer against high flows if 
vegetation communities change or physical hydraulic properties are altered (Rezanezhad et al., 
2016).  
Extreme precipitation events have the potential to adversely affect the structure and function 
of wetlands and riparian areas that regulate water flow, increasing flashiness of water flows. 
Protecting forests and wetlands will be vital to maintaining water flow regulation services. 
Wetlands retain high volumes of water and slowly discharge into rivers over time, while forests 
reduce the speed and quantity of runoff (Kennedy and Wilson, 2009).  
Changes to winter precipitation can affect water flow regulation in terms of seasonality and 
timing of overall runoff magnitudes individual runoff events (Crossman et al., 2013). Winter 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        259  
precipitation is projected to increase, resulting in more winter flooding. Changes to flows can 
also affect timing and duration of lake ice cover, further affecting water flow regulation (Erler et 
al., 2019). Overall, increases in winter precipitation can lead to increased occurrence and 
changed timing of harmful flood events, which will require adjustments to flood protection 
strategies. 
Changes in flows (timing, duration, and magnitude) and in the quality of water flow regulation 
services caused by climate change and non-climate stressors influence the distribution and 
abundance of aquatic species. More frequent, longer duration, and/or more extreme high and 
low streamflow events are likely to have significant consequences for stream populations 
(Nislow et al., 2004; Wenger et al., 2011; Letcher et al., 2015) For example, extreme high 
stream flows in the winter and low stream flows in the fall can diminish the reduce 
reproductive success of Brook Trout (Blum et al., 2018).

Indirect Impacts 
The indirect impacts of climate change on regulating services have local, provincial, and global 
ramifications. The decreased capacity of Ontario’s terrestrial ecosystems to remove carbon 
from the atmosphere and store it can hamper efforts like natural climate mitigation solutions. 
In addition, depending on the magnitude of the stores, the shift of terrestrial ecosystems as 
sinks to sources of carbon can undermine government commitments to cut emissions of 
greenhouse gases, enhancing contributions to changes in the Earth’s climate system.  
Pollination relies on healthy insect populations; therefore, any decline in insect abundance, and 
especially the abundance of wild pollinators, will affect pollination rates throughout the 
province. In addition to catastrophic ecological consequences, impairments to wild pollination 
services can negatively affect plant cultivation (e.g. field crops and horticulture), increasing the 
need for alternative sources of pollination and therefore costs to growers and affecting food 
yields.  
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        261  
Since water flow regulation services support flood prevention, drought mitigation, and flow 
stability, which are essential to the well-being of people and the integrity and usefulness of 
physical infrastructure, impairment of these services will require adjustments to current 
strategies to manage the risks from water extremes, both excess moisture and drought. 
7.7.6 Provisioning Services  
Overview 
Provisioning services were assessed as a Level 1 category under the Natural Environment Area 
of Focus. Provisioning services are materials or energy harvested from the natural environment 
that can benefit humans in terms of use, consumption, or inherent value (Rolando et al., 2017). 
These services include freshwater, energy, wild foods, traditional medicines, oils, and wood 
supplies. For this risk assessment, freshwater and wood supplies were analyzed. 
Provisioning services are susceptible to climate change, but the associated impacts have high 
uncertainty. Potential opportunities exist in some cases, such as increased forest biomass in the 
northern regions for timber production with some uncertainty given stresses on the growth of 
coniferous tree species from insects and disease (McKenney et al., 2016) and possible increased 
groundwater recharge rates (Jyrkama and Sykes, 2007; Veettil and Mishra, 2018); however, 
there is a lack of consensus on groundwater predictions. The risks associated with climate 
change are generally significant and include increased temperature, drought, wildfire, and 
precipitation. 
The PCCIA aims to understand the climate change impact on provisioning services throughout 
the provincial regions. Temperature and drought present the most significant impacts in the 
province and lead to secondary impacts such as wildfire and changing precipitation patterns. 
And these risks have regional variations. For instance, warming temperature has a widespread 
impact across all regions, while drought primarily impacts the Northwest and Northeast 
regions. The impacts discussed below cover a wide range of hazards in the province, but other 
indirect effects may impact provisioning services that were not addressed in the risk 
assessment. 
Direct Impacts 
The following sections provide brief characterizations of each Level 2 category assessed for 
provisioning services across Ontario and related risk results. Risk scenarios for regulating 
services were driven by climate hazards related to temperature, precipitation, drought, and 
wildfires. Changes in severity and occurrence of these climate hazards could lead to 
environmental consequences of the following types: 
- 
Change in availability of services 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        262  
- 
Change in access to services 
- 
Change in quality of services 
Example risk scenarios for each Level 2 category can be found in Table 7.19. The climate risk 
profiles for each Level 2 category are presented by timeframe and region in Table 7.20 
(operating under RCP8.5), at the end of this section.

Provision 
Drought can reduce water availability and stresses the 
systems that provide freshwater. Freshwater is still 
available, but conflicts and restrictions are heightened, and 
timing of freshwater provision is altered. 
Medium  
Wood Supplies 
Intensification of forest fire regimes creates significant 
challenges in supplying mills with mature, harvestable

Low 
 
Freshwater Provision  
Ontario's natural and semi-natural systems include surface and ground water bodies and runoff 
that provide water for human consumption and for direct uses other than drinking (e.g. safe 
navigation, cooling, and materials), supporting human development and well-being. Areas with 
large areas of open water and high runoff potential (e.g. high capacity) that serve downstream 
areas with high demands are the most important for freshwater provision. Hotspots of 
freshwater provision in Ontario generally mirror population patterns and are most prevalent in 
the south of the province (Mitchell et al., 2021). Canada consumes vast amounts of water on an 
annual basis. In 2013, 37,892 million cubic meters of water were used across all sectors of the 
economy (Statistics Canada, 2013). In Ontario, use of water from lakes, rivers, streams, ponds 
and groundwater is regulated through the Ontario Water Resources Act, with industrial uses, 
power production, and potable water supply making up close to 98 percent of water takings in 
2019 (Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks, 2021). Climate impacts can 
affect the ability of natural systems to function properly and to provide freshwater for human 
use. 
Climate risks to freshwater provision were assessed across Ontario’s six PCCIA regions, focusing 
on risk scenarios driven by temperature changes (specifically Growing Degree Days, which is a 
proxy for annual average changes, and Extreme Hot Days), extreme precipitation (Extreme 
Precipitation Events) and drought (Moisture Deficit / Drought). 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        263  
The current climate risk profile associated with the environmental consequences from climate 
change impacts to freshwater provision is rated as ‘medium’ in all regions of Ontario. Although 
Ontario has abundant, clean water resources, freshwater provisioning services are already at 
risk locally. Seasonal water shortages do take place in some local watersheds and areas where 
groundwater supplies are naturally limited (Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation 
and Parks, 2021). In warm weather, reports of blue-green algal blooms occur across the 
province (Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks, 2022).  
Climate risk scores for the Central, Eastern, and Southwest regions increases from ‘medium’ to 
‘high’ by mid-century and to ‘very high’ by end of century. Climate risk scores for the Northeast, 
Northwest, and Far North regions increases from ‘medium’ to ‘high’ by mid-century and remain 
at that level by end of century. Aside from exposure to climate conditions, regional differences 
in risk scores reflect the combined effect of 1) non-climate pressures on the natural 
environment, which influences their vulnerability to climate change and affects the flows of 
provisioning services, and 2) assumptions on the increased future demand for freshwater 
provisioning, which generally increases with population density and the number and type of 
activities requiring water. 
Drought is the primary climate driver that affects freshwater provision in Ontario. Widespread 
and intense drought conditions lead to an overall loss of available freshwater for human use 
and affect the ecosystems that process freshwater throughout the year (Saarikoski et al., 2015; 
Harrison et al., 2014). As a result, drought could lead to heightened restrictions and increased 
conflict within the province. Drought may also lead to inter-annual patterns of water 
availability, affecting the timing of provision (Kaur et al., 2019; Veettil and Mishra, 2018). 
Temperature is a secondary climate hazard that will impact freshwater provision. As outlined in 
Sections 7.7.1 and 7.7.2, increasing temperatures change species compositions and alters long-
term ecosystem function, impacting the ecosystem’s ability to retain and provide freshwater 
(Saarikoski et al., 2015; Harrison et al., 2014). Sustained periods of increased temperature and 
Extreme Hot Days can increase the frequency and severity of nuisance and harmful algal 
blooms, with the effects being stronger in water bodies with existing elevated nutrient levels. 
Extreme Hot Days can also change lake water balances, as increased evaporation can cause 
reduced lake levels as well as reduced runoff, particularly in the spring. Warmer temperatures 
can also cause reduced summer flows, leading to increased nutrient loading and lack of diluting 
capacity with reduced water volumes (Paterson et al., 2017; Yao et al., 2009; Crossman et al., 
2013). 
The occurrence of extreme precipitation events has the potential to affect freshwater provision 
through direct impacts to water quality. Climate change is predicted to increase extreme flood 
events, which have been shown to result in increased turbidity in drinking water systems (De 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        264  
Loe and Plummer, 2010). Increased turbidity is associated with increased outbreaks of 
waterborne diseases. These effects have been shown to strongly affect small drinking water 
treatment systems for isolated communities in Ontario. 
Wood Supplies 
Wood supplies are biomass provided by forest ecosystems that can be harvested and used as 
raw material for non-nutritional purposes. Ontario's 71 million hectares of forests support the 
sustainable harvest of timber (and other forest products), which provides social, economic and 
environmental benefits to the province. The forest industry contributed $4 billion to real GDP in 
the province in 2019, with $15 billion in revenue from manufactured goods (Natural Resources 
Canada, 2022c).  
In northern Ontario, many communities rely on stable levels of harvesting and a healthy forest 
industry. Close to 90 percent of Ontario forests are publicly owned; the amount of area 
available for harvest in Ontario is regulated and planned for, while the actual volume harvested 
varies annually and over time. Less than 0.5% of the managed Crown Forest of 27.7 million 
hectares is harvested annually, with harvest levels decreasing since about 2004 and levelling off 
in 2010. (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, 2021a; Government of Ontario, 
2020g). As seen in Section 7.7.2 (Flora) and 7.7.4 (Terrestrial Ecosystems), select climate 
variables can affect the distribution, composition, and functioning of forests, affecting the flows 
of provisioning services.  
Climate risks to wood supplies were assessed for all regions in Ontario, except the Far North. 
Risk scenarios are driven by temperature changes (specifically Growing Degree Days, which is a 
proxy for annual average changes), drought (Moisture Deficit / Drought), and wildfire. 
The current climate risk profile associated with the environmental consequences from climate 
change impacts to wood supplies is rated as ‘medium’ across the assessed regions of Ontario, 
increasing to ‘high’ in southern regions of the province (Central, Southwest, Eastern). In 
Northeast and Northwest Ontario, risk levels are anticipated to remain at ‘medium’ levels. By 
late century risk levels are ‘high’ across all regions. These patterns consider both enhanced 
pressures from human activities and development and the potential increase in demand for 
wood supplies in response to increased economic activity. 
Drought-related tree mortality and a decline in abundance of conifer species can place the 
supply of softwood fibre to mills at risk of disruptions. Drought will impact wood supplies by 
exacerbating climate change-induced shifts in fire and insect disturbances and tree mortality 
(Brecka, 2018). The most pronounced impacts will occur in Northwest Ontario along the 
southern part of the boreal, with up to a 60% decline in above-ground biomass by the end of 
the century, with projected drops in conifer species (Brecka, 2018). Drought-related tree 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        265  
mortality removes biomass from the landscape, affecting boreal wood supply and harvestable 
volumes. 
In addition, increasing temperature and changes in precipitation patterns are altering the 
climate suitability for tree species, altering their productivity, and causing changes in forest 
composition (Brecka et al., 2020). As a result, many tree species whose southern edge lies 
within the Great Lakes Basin will likely experience reduced growth rates, reproductive failure, 
and increased disease and mortality (McDermid et al., 2015). A shift in the relative composition 
of forest species will shape the type and quality of wood products that companies can 
manufacture. 
A third climate risk relates to the intensification of fire regimes in the boreal forest, creating 
challenges in supplying mills with mature, harvestable wood. In the southern boreal, intensified 
fire regimes coupled with heat stress and drought conditions are projected to decrease 
aboveground biomass significantly. Under current harvesting regimes, timber supply harvest 
could decline by up to 38 percent by end of the century, due to fire (Dhital et al., 2015).  
The combined impact of fire and climate change-induced shifts in growth could cause a median 
period harvest loss of up to 44 to 79% (Dithal et al., 2015) and impact the type and quality of 
products that companies can manufacture (Gauthier et al., 2014). Ultimately, this may lead to 
significant consequences for timber production (Brecka et al., 2020; Dithal et al., 2015), with 
considerable uncertainty attached to these expected impacts. One national study suggests that 
mills in Ontario may see modest increases in wood supply costs, no projected softwood supply 
shortages, and relatively minor hardwood supply shortages in the 2050s and 2080s (McKenney, 
2016).

Indirect Impacts 
Climate change leads to increased temperature, drought, wildfire, and changing precipitation 
patterns in the province. This risk assessment addressed these hazards, but not the additional 
indirect impacts they cause. For instance, climate change can affect the abundance and 
distribution of forests pests and diseases (Price et al., 2013; Gauthier et al., 2014; Wang et al., 
2014; Terrier et al., 2013). The increasing prevalence of invasives may exacerbate other climate 
hazards, such as wildfire, and lead to forest loss, damage, reductions in wood supply provision, 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        267  
threats to public safety and regional economies (Price et al., 2013; Gauthier et al., 2014; Wang 
et al., 2014; Terrier et al., 2013). In addition, extreme precipitation events often result in 
changes to road conditions (washout of roadways), and warmer temperatures can cause 
ground thaw on logging roads, disrupting operational practices for access to timber supplies 
(Brecka, 2018; Brecka et al., 2018, McKenney et al., 2016). Lower than planned harvest levels 
can have negative effects on employment and local economies. In addition, environmental 
objectives may also be at risk, since failing to achieve planned levels of harvest affects the 
ability to achieve desired forest condition (area, type and age) and related habitat diversity 
(Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, 2021a). Conversely, warming 
temperatures can also result in faster tree growth, which may drive economic opportunities for 
communities currently at the northern limit of forest harvesting (Price et al., 2013; Gauthier et 
al., 2014; Brecka et al., 2018; McKenney et al., 2016). 
Section 10.3 on Water Security describes the indirect impacts of changes in freshwater 
provision, which include stress to existing water supply systems and increased risks to human 
health (Kaur et al., 2019). 
7.7.7 Ecosystems Cultural Services 
Overview 
Ecosystem cultural services refer to outputs of ecosystems (biotic and abiotic) that affect 
physical and mental states of people; they support people’s engagement with the natural 
environment in ways that are culturally enriching (Haines-Young and Potschin, 2017). 
Categories of ecosystem cultural services include nature-based recreation, educational value, 
aesthetic experience, physical and mental well-being, spiritual experience, culture heritage and 
sense of place associated with nature (TEEB, 2010), with these services available across all 
regions of Ontario. Spaces, such as shorelines and water of the Great Lakes, often supply 
multiple ecosystem cultural services at the same time, with the greatest delivery of services 
occurring near population centres or generally where people and supporting infrastructure are 
present to accrue benefits (Allan et al., 2015). Since Ontarians and people in Ontario derive the 
benefits from these ecosystem services directly, there is a direct link between investments in 
ecosystem quality and human activity and well-being. For example, improvements in water 
clarity in lakes generate additional visits, with people willing to travel further and spend more 
money to visit lakes with better water clarity (Keeler et al., 2015).  
Ecosystem cultural services, like recreation in the outdoors, are a key part of Canadian culture. 
There is robust evidence linking the importance of nature-based recreation and health and 
well-being, with ecological integrity playing a major role in the restorative outcomes (Reining et 
al., 2021). 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        268  
Current market trends indicate that travelers are interested in visiting wild and wide-open 
spaces in response to confinement experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic (Destination 
Canada, 2021). Ontarians’ participation in hiking or backpacking (+40%), visiting a national or 
provincial nature park (+39%), boating (+36%), canoeing or kayaking (+21%), going to a beach 
(+19%) and camping (+7%) in the third quarter of 2020 increased significantly compared to the 
same time in 2019 (Q3 2019: (Statistics Canada, 2021d)).  
Environmental stresses like coastal development and habitat modifications, non-point source 
pollution, and the spread of invasive species affect the enjoyment of ecosystem cultural 
services, such as recreational services, with climate change as an additional stressor (Allan et 
al., 2015). As reviewed in sections 7.7.3 to 7.7.4, change in climate have direct and cascading 
effects on ecosystems, which, in turn, can compromise people’s access to ecosystem services 
flows, either preventing a desired activity (like snowmobiling) or requiring a shift in timing, as 
well as the quality of these services. For example, warming temperatures are likely to affect 
recreational activities by shifting the timing of historical seasons (e.g.., fishing seasons, camping 
seasons), location of activity, and their associated regulations since recreationalists will have to 
change their behaviours to suit these changing conditions (Hestetune et al., 2018; Browne and 
Hunt, 2007; Wall et al., 1985).  
For the purposes of the PCCIA, two Level 2 categories were used to assess the direct impacts to 
ecosystem cultural services: recreational fishing and nature-based recreation (hiking, camping, 
skiing, and snowmobiling). The selection of Level 2 categories considered applicability across 
Ontario, evidence based on climate change impacts, and guidance from stakeholders. The lack 
of focus on less tangible services or those hard to measure using economics or visitation rates 
(e.g. spiritual experience and sense of place related to nature) does not diminish the 
importance of these types of ecosystem cultural services but is rather a call for more research 
on these topics (e.g. Knoll et al., 2019). 
Direct Impacts 
The following sections provide brief characterizations of each Level 2 category assessed for 
ecosystem cultural services across Ontario and related risk results. Risk scenarios for ecosystem 
cultural services were driven by climate hazards related to temperature, precipitation, and 
wildfire. Changes in severity and occurrence of these climate hazards could lead to 
environmental consequences of the following types: 
- 
Change in access to services  
- 
Change in availability of services 
- 
Change in quality of services 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        269  
Examples of risk scenarios assessed under this Level 1 category can be found in Table 7.21. Risk 
profiles for Level 2 categories by time period and region appear in Table 7.22, at the end of this 
section.

Medium  
 
Nature-Based Recreation 
In the context of the PCCIA, nature-based recreation refers to the active enjoyment of nature 
through warm-season (hiking and camping) and winter-season (skiing, snowmobiling) activities. 
Opportunities for nature-based recreation exist throughout the province, in high population 
and remote locations, with parks, protected areas, and other types of designated spaces in 
Ontario offering ample opportunities for these types of nature-based recreation (Douglas and 
Pearson, 2022).  
The COVID-19 pandemic heightened the positive health benefits of taking part in outdoor 
recreation and spending time in nature, with Public Health Units across the province often 
encouraging people to participate in activities such as camping, fishing, hiking, and other 
nature-based recreation activities.  
Nature-based recreation is highly sensitive to weather and climate variation, because of a 
reliance on the resilience of key ecological processes and natural features, as well as desirable 
physical conditions. Shifts in access to and quality of recreation opportunity influencing 
decisions on i) whether, how, and when to participate, as well as ii) what to offer and how to 
regulate the offering. 
Climate risks to nature-based recreation were assessed for five provincial regions, including 
Central, Southwest, Eastern, Northeast and Northwest regions. Risk scenarios under this Level 2 
category are driven by temperature changes, specifically Extreme Hot Days and Growing 
Degree Days, extreme precipitation, winter precipitation and wildfire occurrence. 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        270  
The current climate risk profile associated with the consequences from climate change impacts 
to nature-based recreation is rated ‘medium’ across Ontario, increasing to ‘high’ by mid-century 
in all regions of Ontario. By the end of the century, risk levels are anticipated to remain at ‘high’ 
in southern Ontario (Southwest, Central and Eastern), but increase to ‘very high’ in northern 
parts of the province (Northeast and Northwest). Risk profiles consider socio-economic 
projections and the assumed increase in demand for ecosystem cultural services.  
Warming winters may lead to a decrease in snow-based recreation due to unsuitable snow 
conditions. Climate change is projected to lead to substantial reductions in both depth and 
length of the snow cover season (Scott et al., 2006). Warmer winters reduce the seasonal 
availability and quality of snow-based recreation such as downhill and cross-country skiing and 
snowmobiling (Browne and Hunt, 2007). This is also expected to impact ice fishing, which is 
anticipated to decline due to climate change (Browne and Hunt, 2007). Ski areas in southern 
Ontario are expected to be more heavily impacted than those in northern regions, as it is 
possible that ski areas in Northeast and Northwest may benefit by attracting more southern 
residents whose local ski seasons have been reduced (Wall et al., 1985). In addition, the 
reliability of a snowmobile season occurrence in certain regions by mid-century is questionable 
(McBoyle et al., 2007).  
Warmer daytime temperatures and lengthened shoulder seasons have the potential to increase 
camping, hiking, canoeing, kayaking and overall visitation in parks, with cascading implications 
for biodiversity, human communities, and management effort. Daily maximum temperature is a 
predictor of park visitation in Ontario, with studies suggesting substantial increases in park 
visitation and changes in the timing of peak visitation with rising temperatures and warmer 
shoulder seasons (April-May; September-October) (Hewer et al., 2016). However, temperatures 
could increase beyond campers’ thermal comfort levels. Survey research suggests that the 
range of ideal daytime temperatures for campers is 24 to 31˚C, with daytime temperatures over 
34˚C unacceptably hot for at least 50% of the sample (Hewer, 2012).  
Thermal limits vary by activity, with groups of campers focused on canoeing/kayaking/fishing 
less sensitive to weather at large than those focused on swimming and wading. At the same 
time, warmer temperatures can alter water quality, including conditions contributing to algal 
blooms, reducing the potential enjoyment of parks and waterways. Climate-driven changes to 
visitation rates and patterns could increase park revenues and confer economic benefits to 
local operators and services but may strain conservation efforts (Hewer et al., 2016). 
Changes in the occurrence of extreme events can also influence participation patterns, with 
more frequent heavy rainfall events discouraging warm-weather recreation in parks or 
shortening trip length. Survey research in two Ontario Parks indicates that the absence of rain 
as one of top three weather factors contributing to visitor satisfaction, with the other two being 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        271  
sunshine and comfortable daytime temperatures (Hewer, 2012). Weekend campers and those 
engaged in beach-oriented activities (swimming / wading) place a greater level of importance 
on the absence of rain in relation to overall trip satisfaction than other types of campers (multi-
day, inland activities). This survey research highlighted the preference sensitivity to the 
occurrence of downpours, including 70% of campers stating their intent to leave the park early 
if they experienced conditions of rainfall over 16mm/hour. 
More intense forest fire regimes have the potential to limit access to parks or amenities within 
parks. Fire is essential in maintaining and enhancing ecosystems in many provincial parks and 
conservation reserves. Expected shifts in fire regimes in a changing climate will challenge parks 
and protected area managers’ ability to balance protection of socio-economic (e.g. human 
safety, asset integrity) and ecological values (e.g. endangered species) and use of controlled 
burns to restoring ecosystem health. In contrast to many parks and protected spaces in 
southern Ontario that consist of fragmented and relatively small patches of continuous fuels in 
forests, savannahs and prairies, parks located in boreal forest ecosystems in northern Ontario 
are continuous and much larger in size. Increased severity, frequency, and spatial extent of 
forest fires in and around parks in Ontario can result in park closures, travel restrictions, trail 
and canoe route closures, impair public safety and cause natural and physical asset losses. 
A longer-term risk to the quality and availability of opportunities for nature-based recreation in 
parks and other designated spaces relates to climate-driven displacements of ecosystems 
outside of stationary park boundaries (Suffling and Scott, 2002). Shifts in biomes within park 
boundaries create challenges for park managers and may result in "last chance" visits to parks, 
to witness changing landscapes or natural features in the near term with reductions in aesthetic 
appeal and decreased visitation in the longer term (Kovacs and Thistlethwaite, 2014). 
Recreational Fishing 
Recreational fishing is an important outdoor recreational activity in Ontario. In 2015, more than 
1.5 million anglers fished in Ontario and spent 1.75 billion dollars to fish (Ontario Ministry of 
Natural Resources and Forestry, 2020a). Although I majority of anglers fish in the Great Lakes 
and lakes and waterways in southern Ontario, many northern Ontarians view recreational 
fishing as an activity central to their way of life, an important part of many local economies and 
a driver of tourism (Wall, 1985). Climate-driven shifts in the distribution and abundance of 
target fishery species, fish habitats, as well as changes in the length and quality of recreational 
fishing seasons have direct impacts on angling opportunities (Hunt et al., 2016; Hunt and 
Moore, 2006). Recreational fishing is a regulated activity in Ontario (Ontario Ministry of Natural 
Resources and Forestry, 2022), with climate-driven shifts such as these requiring adaptation by 
management agencies, anglers, and operators alike. 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        272  
Climate risks to recreational fishing were assessed across Ontario’s six PCCIA regions, focusing 
on risk scenarios driven by temperature changes, specifically Extreme Hot Days and Growing 
Degree Days, as well as drought (Moisture Deficit). 
The current climate risk profile associated with the environmental consequences from climate 
change impacts to recreational fishing is rated ‘medium’ across Ontario, increasing to ‘high’ by 
mid-century in all regions of Ontario and staying at that level by the end of the century. The risk 
results consider socio-economic projections of population growth, urban and industrial 
development exacerbating both the likelihood of the environmental consequence and its 
likelihood over time since demand for the service is assumed to increase.  
The primary climate variable group identified as a control on sports fishing in Ontario was 
temperature, both average changes and occurrence of Extreme Hot Days. Increased 
temperatures are expected to impact sportfish species' distributions and abundance resulting in 
lowered or adjusted angling participation, reduced fishing success due to species changes, and 
losses of some important fisheries (Van Zuiden and Sharma, 2016; Hunt and Kolman, 2012). 
Additionally, increased air and surface water temperatures are associated with greater post-
release mortality in sportfish in both summer open water angling and winter ice fishing. 
Impacts on recreational fisheries will be regionally variable. In some cases, climate change may 
enhance angling opportunities in localized areas due to increases in abundance of highly 
desirable sport fish species like walleye, such as might occur in Northeast Ontario (Shuter et al., 
2002). Nevertheless, the co-occurrence of smallmouth bass and walleye in the same lakes can 
temper gains in walleye abundance and therefore the development of this recreational fishery 
(Van Zuiden and Sharma, 2016). 
Risks to recreational fisheries also relate to reduced access to fishing areas. In southern Ontario, 
the combined effects of warmer temperatures and drier conditions could reduce lake levels and 
opportunities for boat usage (e.g. reduced access to docks, inadequate channel depth for 
fishing watercraft). This will reduce lake access and therefore fishing opportunities (Jyrkama 
and Sykes, 2007). Shifting water levels can affect the quality of shoreline marshes that support 
fish production and recreational fishing (Wall, 1985). In addition, although not assessed 
quantitatively, warmer winter weather can compromise ice fishing viability and reduce the 
length of the ice fishing season. Accounting for these changes may require changes to fisheries 
including closures or shifting of fishing seasons.

Indirect Impacts 
The indirect impacts of climate change on ecosystem cultural services will impact communities 
that rely on recreational fishing for their economy and will face pressures and stresses due to 
changed fish species ranges, habitat disruptions, fish mortality increases, and seasonal timing 
changes (Wall, 1985). For example, there is a significant tourism industry in northern Ontario 
for walleye fishing catering to clients from the United States; if walleye (cool-water) fish 
populations decline US anglers may stop coming to Canada to fish since warm water fishing 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        274  
(bass) opportunities exist south of the border. Business in northern Ontario could incur losses 
as a result.  
Changes to nature-based recreation through alteration of temperatures, precipitation events 
and type (rain vs snow), and broad ecosystem shifts will also affect the business and economy 
Area of Focus through direct impacts on fishing, hunting, and recreation. Communities with 
strong cultural ties to these activities will also be impacted. Increased temperatures can lead to 
decreased ice coverage on lakes, which results in a change in recreational fishing strategies and 
creates potential safety issues and travel hazards for anglers' health and well-being. Finally 
increased temperatures and changes to snowpack lead to changes in snow-based recreation, 
causing users to change their habits and creating potential safety issues through thin ice 
conditions. 
7.8 Climate Change Opportunities  
In comparison to other Areas of Focus, the concept of opportunities from the impacts of 
climate change may be more complex for the Natural Environment. Climate-driven increases in 
range or abundance of select species or ecosystems are not automatically benefits, as these 
shifts also influence dynamics of ecological communities (e.g. food webs) and ecological 
function. Shifting thermal niches may contribute to availability of new climate refugia but may 
require human intervention to obtain such benefits.  
For managed species, identifying opportunities is more straightforward because we can assume 
that increased abundance translates to increased opportunities for recreation (e.g. fishing, 
hunting) and economic income for operators. Although it should be noted that seizing on these 
opportunities may not be cost free (e.g. new infrastructure may be necessary). Climate-driven 
increases in the capacity of ecosystems to supply flows of ecosystem services can be 
opportunities for human communities, in that this can help meet societal goals (e.g. increased 
freshwater provision contributing to water security). 
Within this assessment, risk scores across two Level 2 categories (under Fauna) decreased in 
risk under a changing climate. These were for reptiles in all regions, and warm-water fish in the 
Central region. Warmer temperatures can facilitate a range expansion of the common five-lined 
skink (reptile), increasing populations’ genetic diversity. However, the species’ occurrence in 
heavily modified landscapes and as small, localized populations counteract gains in thermally 
suitable habitat. For Eastern and the Northeast regions, declining risk in the 2080s denotes a 
potential upside for the lizard. But the potential advantages of warming temperatures for 
populations of common-five lined skinks may be counteracted with anthropogenic pressures 
linked to projected population growth, urban and industrial development (e.g. road run off, 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        275  
pollution). The opportunity here is to facilitate range expansions by preventing or reducing non-
climate stressors through improved land use planning and consideration of cumulative effects. 
Warm-water fishes may gain suitable habitat toward the latter half of the century. Warm-water 
fishes may benefit from climate change in Ontario. Specifically, the PCCIA supported the finding 
that warmer temperatures may increase habitat for warm-water fishes in Central Ontario. 
Research also states that warm-water habitat may increase across Northeast, Northwest, and 
Far North regions. Assuming habitat connectivity or introductions by humans, new thermal 
habitats for warm-water fishes may allow for range shifts greater than the approximately 13-
17.5 km per decade that already occurred over the last 30 years in Ontario lakes, expanding 
northern range limits further (Chetkiewicz et al., 2018; Chu et al., 2005; Alofs et al., 2014). 
There may be opportunities for recreational fisheries, although these will be regionally variable. 
Climate change may enhance angling opportunities in localized areas due to increases in 
abundance of highly desirable sport fish species. Nevertheless, the co-occurrence of 
smallmouth bass and cold- and cool- water fish species in the same lakes can temper gains in 
cold- and cold- water abundance due to predation by smallmouth bass and inter-specific 
competition. 
Other potential opportunities that may emerge for the Natural Environment Area of Focus, 
include: 
- 
Warmer temperatures, shorter winters and decreased snow depth create favourable 
conditions for range expansion and increased abundance of species currently limited by 
low temperatures. It is expected that white-tailed deer (Level 1 Fauna) will increase in 
abundance, retain their existing range and expand northward, potentially as far as the 
modern-day treeline. This may increase hunting opportunities for this cervid species. 
- 
Potential opportunities exist in some cases, such as increased forest biomass in the 
northern regions for timber production with uncertainty given stresses on the growth of 
coniferous tree species from disturbances. 
- 
Warmer daytime temperatures and lengthened shoulder seasons may create 
opportunities for more camping, hiking, canoeing, kayaking and overall visitation in 
parks, but this places strain on park management.  
- 
In northern regions of the province that are less densely populated, with less of a 
footprint of human activity, yet harbour significant biodiversity and ecosystem services 
(e.g. carbon sequestration and storage of peatlands), there is an unprecedented 
opportunity to create a protected area network that considers current and future 
climate change impacts and managed for a range of biodiversity and biocultural values.

7.9 Adaptive Capacity  
7.9.1 Adaptive Capacity Summary  
Ontario’s natural environment is intrinsically adaptive. However, the pace of climate change in 
Ontario, combined with local and regional development and economic pressures, may exceed 
the capacity and resilience of species and ecosystems, affecting the supply of critical ecosystem 
services (Nantel et al., 2014). Consistent with other Areas of Focus, Adaptive Capacity for the 
Natural Environment Area of Focus was evaluated across four over-arching categories: 1) 
technology 2) availability of resources, 3) governance measures, and 4) sector complexity (see 
Section 2.4.3 for definitions). 
Overall, the Adaptive Capacity for each Level 1 category across the Natural Environment Area of 
Focus is ranked as a ‘medium’ Adaptive Capacity (Table 7.23). Building Adaptive Capacity across 
these four categories will help to strengthen species’ and ecosystem’s ability to adjust and 
maintain resilience to changing conditions over time, protecting humans’ ability to benefit from 
the services the natural environment provides for free.

 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        277  
7.9.2 Technology 
Adaptive Capacity within the Technology category is ranked at a ‘medium’ capacity across all 
Level 1 categories, except for Ecosystem Cultural Services, for which the score is ‘low’. 
Technology to protect, conserve, restore, sustainably use, and manage species, ecosystems and 
ecosystem services includes, applications of genetic research in plant breeding to ensure the 
resilience of species; assisted migration trials targeting commercial tree species; 
implementation of nature-based solutions (NbS) – an umbrella concept inclusive of restoration, 
ecosystem-based management, ecosystem-based adaptation, area-based protection, natural 
infrastructure; and use of decision-support tools that incorporate climate change 
considerations to inform policy updates, planning, and siting decisions (e.g. the use of 
SeedWhere to update policies on tree seed transfer) (Dhital et al., 2015; Anderson and Song, 
2020; Douglas and Pearson, 2022; Williamson et al., 2019). Physical technologies for resilience 
include wildlife overpasses and infrastructure solutions for some recreational services (e.g. 
snowmaking machines for ski operations) (Lemieux et al., 2007; Browne and Hunt, 2007).  
Although technologies exist to support adaptation of species and ecosystems and, some 
application is occurring, the scale of implementation needed far exceeds resources currently 
allocated and available. An example of scaling can be seen in Ontario’s Forest Policy 
Framework, which includes provisions for seed transfer that integrate adaptive management 
(Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, 2020b). Implementation needs are highly 
variable across management contexts and can require more than enabling policy to result in 
tangible action. For example, species-based plans, such as species-at-risk-recovery plans, result 
in practices that are challenging and costly to implement, involving multi-year commitments 
and funding from several sources. When it comes to adapting to climate-driven shifts in 
ecological cultural services (e.g. nature-based recreation), opportunities to enhance Adaptive 
Capacity are available but decision-making is distributed and, in some cases, market-driven. 
Users of nature will need to alter their behaviour (type and timing of activities) and preferences 
(e.g. fishing in different streams and lakes). Financial incentives in the forest industry and 
statutory requirements to deliver public services such as access to clean freshwater, are drivers 
to initiate adaptation planning for provisioning services. Finally, current regimes may be limited 
in their adaptation potential. For some regulating services, specifically water flow regulation, 
technological interventions are already highly optimized with limited options to make major 
improvements in Adaptive Capacity.  
The Technology category of Adaptive Capacity also includes sectoral best practices and 
planning. Known strategies to address climate change adaptation of species, ecosystems and 
landscapes include maintaining intactness and connectivity, and expanding protected area 
networks (WCS Canada, 2017). Across all Level 1 and 2 categories, protected areas contribute 
to nature-based adaptation by providing protection of species, ecosystems, and ecosystem 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        278  
services from non-climatic pressures on the broader landscape, such as resource industries and 
urban development. The extent of protected areas across PCCIA regions varies significantly, 
with protected areas inversely proportional to population density and human activity (see Table 
7.24). The number and extent of protected areas and conserved land continues to fall below 
national and international targets (Ontario Biodiversity Council, 2021). Organizational 
deficiencies within management agencies (e.g. staff capacity levels), among other factors, limit 
the effectiveness of the management and expansion of the province’s protected areas network 
(Office of the Auditor General of Ontario, 2020b).

7.9.3 Resource Availability 
The availability of human and financial resources, as well as knowledge, skills and expertise on 
the natural environment and its management are essential components of Adaptive Capacity. 
Resource availability is ranked at a ‘medium’ Adaptive Capacity across this Area of Focus. With 
few exceptions, climate change adaptation of species, ecosystems and ecosystem services 
requires public-sector leadership. Within the provincial government, the Ministry of 
Environment, Conservation and Parks and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry have 
primary responsibility over adaptation in this Area of Focus, although other ministries are also 
implicated (e.g. the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing and provisions in the Provincial 
Policy Statement, a key land-use planning instrument), in addition to several other institutions 
operating regionally and locally (e.g. Conservation Authorities leading source water protection) 
(Government of Ontario, 2020f).  
 
24 The area of overlap of provincial and federal protected areas within each PCCIA region was used to 
determine total percentage coverage in each PCCIA region. Delineations of terrestrial provincial protected 
areas (provincial parks, conservation reserves, Far North protected areas) and terrestrial federal protected 
areas (national parks, national wildlife areas, migratory bird sanctuaries) were sourced from Ontario 
GeoHub. Other Effective Area-Based Conservation Measures are not included. 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        279  
Provincial environment and natural resource managers are engaged in adaptation planning for 
parks, forests, water resources and other natural resources and have begun to mainstream 
climate planning in decision making (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, 2011; 
Adaptation Platform - Forestry Adaptation Working Group, 2014). However, a lack of staff 
resources and capacity continues to limit the scope and scale of adaptation. Staff resources, in 
the way of science and planning staff, are already insufficient to deliver on core responsibilities 
for managing existing protected areas (Office of the Auditor General of Ontario, 2020b). Under 
these conditions, layering on responsibilities for integrating climate change considerations in 
strategic and operational decisions is understandably challenging even for a motivated and 
knowledgeable public service. The lack of succession planning in critical research and 
professional roles also hampers human resource availability (e.g. retirement of experts in 
southern forestry) (Johnston et al., 2010).  
Funding and prioritization of adaptation actions are key challenges in the implementation of 
practices to enhance Adaptive Capacity of Ontario’s natural environment. Currently, no 
provincial or cost-shared programs dedicated to adaptation in this Area of Focus exist, although 
practitioners, municipalities, and Indigenous Communities can compete for funding from 
federal programs such as the Nature Smart Climate Solutions Fund and the Natural 
Infrastructure Fund. Some financial markets support carbon storage (e.g. offsets) and public 
funds may help support water flow regulation, but additional financial resources would be 
beneficial to increase Adaptive Capacity for regulating services (Dhital et al., 2015). The 
Government of Canada, province of Ontario, Indigenous Communities, municipal governments, 
non-profit organizations, operators, and recreational users have interest in maintenance of 
ecological cultural services. Adaptive Capacity in this case could be increased by developing 
stronger coordination among user groups, decision makers, and funding bodies.  
Information and guidance to support climate change adaptation in environmental and natural 
resource management is available but its influence in improving adaptation decisions is 
uncertain. Notably, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry contributes to 
adaptation by, for example, undertaking and publishing ecosystem-focused climate change 
vulnerability assessment, modelling climate impacts on natural resources, and through focused 
research to support sustainable forest management in a changing climate, with topics including 
assisted migration, carbon storage pathways, genecology, and climate niches (Adaptation 
Platform - Forestry Adaptation Working Group, 2014). The effectiveness or impact of the 
Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry efforts has not been assessed, however 
(WCS Canada, 2017). Further, improvements in monitoring and data management could bolster 
Adaptive Capacity. Ontario’s formal biodiversity monitoring focuses on large, charismatic 
species, especially species that are harvested and thus provide economic benefit 
(Environmental Commissioner of Ontario, 2018). Monitoring of some less charismatic species 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        280  
does take place but not consistently at a large geographic scale (Environmental Commissioner 
of Ontario, 2018). The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry has reviewed its 
monitoring programs and identified gaps in climate change indicators, particularly for rivers, 
wetlands, and terrestrial wildlife (Furrer et al., 2014).  
Extensive knowledge and data about plant responses to climate change exist, but these data 
are not consolidated, limiting the application of these resources. Similarly, but on a larger scale, 
research and data on Great Lakes ecosystems is voluminous, but fragmented. Importantly, 
Indigenous and Traditional Ecological Knowledge is underutilized in informing adaptation in this 
Area of Focus, with protocols increasingly available to support co-application of different 
knowledge systems, while respecting principles of ownership, control, access, and possession. 
7.9.4 Governance 
Governance is rated as ‘medium’ overall, with differences across Level 1 categories in this Area 
of Focus. Governance for flora and fauna is rated as ‘low’ and for provisioning services as ‘high’. 
Several governance mechanisms, laws, policies, and planning frameworks exist to support 
management of species, ecosystems, and ecosystem services in Ontario. For example, 25 legal 
statutes directly consider biodiversity, including laws referencing special places (e.g. the 
Greenbelt Act, Far North Act, Niagara Escarpment Planning and Development Act); as 
elsewhere in Canada, biodiversity governance is shared between agencies primarily responsible 
for the environment or protected areas and those responsible for natural resource use (Ray et 
al., 2021).  
Institutional attributes that facilitate adaptation include those supporting cross-sectoral and 
forward-looking planning, adaptive management, and coordination to address shared priorities 
in complex socio-ecological systems (Douglas and Pearson, 2022). Fragmented governance such 
as that present for biodiversity is challenged to meet these institutional attributes. The 
potential may be greater for forests and freshwater management. Ontario Ministry of Natural 
Resources and Forestry makes leadership and governance decisions about forests in the 
province (Wyka et al., 2018; Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks, 2011). 
Over the past 20 years, the Ministry has actively pursued research, partnerships, monitoring, 
and issued guidance to support sustainable forest management in a changing climate 
(Williamson et al., 2019). However, transparency about the effectiveness of those actions could 
be improved.  
Policies for climate adaptation in freshwater systems are lacking, although multiple bilateral 
international agreements exist for water management in the Great Lakes region (Ontario 
Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks, 2011). The history of water resource planning 
facilitates adaptation governance, though decision-making and action is challenged by 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        281  
overlapping and disjointed authority, with coordination difficult to achieve in practice (Douglas 
and Pearson, 2022). 
Naturally Resilient, a strategic policy framework guiding natural resource adaptation in Ontario, 
deserves special mention (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, 2017). Issued by 
the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry in 2017, this strategic policy framework 
outlined five goals and actions to advance adaptation between 2017 and 2021, including those 
related to mainstreaming, building resilience, science and research, and outreach. It highlights 
actions such as the 50 million tree program, the Ontario Grasslands Stewardship Initiative, the 
Wetland Conservation Strategy, and the Far North Land Use Strategy as core instruments to 
deliver adaptation goals. This policy framework includes laudable goals, but some 
environmental non-governmental organizations have suggested it has limited actionable 
directives, lack of quantifiable targets for goals, lack of attention to cumulative effects of land 
use and climate change, the invisibility of ecosystem services, and actions to protect intact 
wetlands in the Far North as an approach to support both climate change adaptation and 
mitigation, among others (WCS Canada, 2017).  
New regulations requiring municipalities across Ontario to adopt an asset management plan 
hold promise in advancing the mapping, measurement, valuation, and management of 
ecosystem services. By 2023, according to O. Reg. 588/17: Asset Management Planning for 
Municipal Infrastructure, Ontario local governments are set to incorporate green infrastructure 
assets in their asset management plans. Capacity constraints within small and medium 
municipalities in Ontario will challenge compliance with this regulatory requirement difficult, 
but if supports are in place significant progress in recognizing nature’s value is possible, 
including evaluating southern Ontario’s remaining wetlands at risk of being lost (Office of the 
Auditor General of Ontario, 2022). 
7.9.5 Sector Complexity 
The final category of Adaptive Capacity assessed for this Area of Focus was Sector Complexity. 
From an ecological perspective, complexity is generally a positive attribute that contributes to 
resilience. In the context of this discussion the greater the complexity (as measured by, for 
example, the number of stakeholders, decision makers present, agile decision-making capacity), 
the lower the capacity to adapt. Problem complexity tends to be inversely proportional to 
effective policy delivery (Kirschke et al., 2017). The complexities of governing climate change 
adaptation (Baird et al., 2016) can make environmental decision-making and action challenging, 
and this is not unique to Ontario. As this Area of Focus is complex, Adaptive Capacity is rated 
‘low’ to ‘medium’ across Level 1 categories. 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        282  
Understanding, conserving, and managing Ontario’s natural environment involves numerous 
and diverse species, ecosystems, landscapes/waterscapes, stakeholders, rightsholder, and 
institutions, shaped by factors internal and external to Ontario. For terrestrial ecosystems, 
private actors, industry and provincial ministries have traditionally had jurisdiction or control 
over large land bases, streamlining decision-making. Freshwater systems also have complicated 
ownership structures, often intersecting jurisdictions, increasing complexity in decision-making. 
Each aquatic system is very different - from oligotrophic lakes to meadow marshes, rivers or 
flood lands and wetlands– increasing management complexity and resourcing required for 
assessment, intervention design, and performance monitoring. Ecosystems and habitats that 
cross national borders have even higher complexity (e.g. Carolinian forests, boundary waters).  
Regulating services involve active participation from multiple levels of government, Indigenous 
People, and stakeholders, with network sophistication and strength variable depending on the 
service. Established partnerships and division of responsibility exist for provisioning services 
that are traded in markets (e.g. timber and potable water). These partnerships can be leveraged 
for adaptation planning. Decision making related to cultural ecological services is decentralized, 
which complicates coordination and collective action.  
Meaningful collaboration with Indigenous governance systems is an evolving issue, adding to 
management challenges in the near term but with expected gains in Adaptive Capacity in the 
longer term. Indigenous Communities in Ontario have treaty rights over the species and 
ecosystem services that governments are mandated to conserve and manage (WCS Canada, 
2017). Ecosystem and natural resource adaptation in the province consistent with 
commitments under the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People and treaty rights 
(e.g. creating Indigenous Protected and Conserved Areas) presents socio-cultural and 
governance complexity but the outcomes more equitable and durable. 
7.10 Climate Adaptation Priorities 
In the context of the PCCIA, an adaptation priority is defined as any Level 1 or 2 category in a 
given region that has an Adaptive Capacity of ‘medium’ or lower and a risk score of ‘high’ or 
greater (see Appendix 12 for combined Level 1 and regional Adaptive Capacity ratings) 
Each of the seven Level 1 categories included under this Area of Focus have a ‘medium’ 
Adaptive Capacity, based upon considerations for technology, resource availability, governance, 
and sector complexity. When combining this with the regional Adaptive Capacity ratings, 
Central, Northeast, and Northwest regions are found to have the lowest capacity rating. This 
section provides further detail on current and emerging adaptation priorities for the Natural 
Environment Area of Focus, considering existing levels of capacity and current and future risk 
scores. 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        283  
The level of risk varies significantly depending on the Level 1 and 2 categories being assessed 
and which region of province is considered. These differences exist due to many reasons, 
including habitat-specific tolerance thresholds, the extent to which ecosystems are intact and 
continuous versus fragmented, and the level of consequences a particular impact may lead to. 
For example, risks to fauna reach the highest levels by the end of century in the Central region, 
in part because of higher levels of expected development, exacerbating climate stresses to 
individuals and populations with high biodiversity. When considering risks to aquatic and 
terrestrial ecosystems, Ontario’s Central region and all northern regions stand out as having 
highest risk levels by the end of the century, with much of the risk driven by the impacts of 
climate change on northern wetlands ecosystems, such as changes in community structure, 
matter, and nutrient cycling. Ontario’s Far North contains vast swathes of ecosystems and 
related ecosystem processes of global significance (e.g. peatlands as natural carbon stores), 
with climate threats (combined with potential development) leading to risks that are not only 
extensive but also irreversible. 
Current Adaptation Priorities  
Looking at Level 2 categories under exhibiting ‘high’ risk under existing conditions, and 
relatively lower capacity levels (‘medium’), the following adaptation priorities are identified in 
Table 7.25 for the current timeframe. Note that amphibian and mollusc Level 2 categories are 
currently scored as ‘high’ risk in the Southwest region. However, due to the capacity assessed 
for the Southwest region (see Appendix 12), these Level 2 categories are not listed as current 
adaptation priorities.

Emerging Adaptation Priorities  
Looking ahead to mid-century a number of additional areas of ‘high’ risk will emerge for 
Ontario’s natural environment, adding to those already identified for the current timeframe, all 
of which continue to persist and even increase in risk. For instance, Bogs, Fish and Waterfowl 
risk profiles are expected to increase to ‘very high’ by mid-century. Emerging adaptation 
priorities for Natural Environment are summarized in Table 7.26.

8.0 People and Communities Area of Focus 
8.1 Overview  
Climate change has already had significant impacts on the individuals, 
communities, and associated services in Ontario. These risks are expected to continue into the 
future. The assessment reveals that climate risks are highest among Ontario’s most vulnerable 
populations and exacerbate existing disparities and inequities (e.g. unhoused population, 
Indigenous population) (see Table 8.1). Climate risks to Indigenous Communities and associated 
systems are found to be significant based on the additional layers of sensitivity and exposure 
related to their close relationship with the environment and its natural resources, and based on 
the dispersed nature of their communities noted in the far north region of Ontario.  
The results of this impact assessment highlight the urgent need to limit key risks to Ontario’s 
people and communities. Intervention is needed to limit and avoid outcomes that can become 
inter-generational and further drive inequities for marginalized populations. Adaptation efforts 
to address the underlying health and well-being inequities are critical for reducing population 
vulnerability and building climate resilience across Ontario communities.

8.2 Ontario’s People and Communities  
Ontario’s rapidly changing climate both directly and indirectly threatens the health and well-
being, livelihoods, access to services, cultural practices, and ways of being for people and 
communities in a myriad of ways. In the recent past, the most acute climate events have 
garnered the widest coverage and attention, with flooding, heat waves and ice storms that 
have suspended societal activities and caused electrical and other critical infrastructure 
interruptions. While the physical impacts to property and infrastructure often receive the 
greatest focus and have consequential impacts for people, the direct impacts on human health 
and the systems that people rely on for their well-being have been significant.  
It is critical to evaluate climate change impacts and risks against the backdrop of equity in 
society. Vulnerable populations and those who experience inequity in society have low levels of 
Adaptive Capacity and face a larger uphill battle to adapt to climate risks. Systems of oppression 
influence an individual’s vulnerability to climate-related risks, with impacts being felt most by 
low-income residents, Indigenous Communities, and those with underlying health conditions. In 
undertaking an analysis of climate change risk to human health and well-being, the People and 
Communities Area of Focus provides a window into how climate change has and will continue 
to impact people as individuals, and the healthcare systems and social services relied upon by 
communities across the province.  
In order to evaluate climate change impacts into the future, it is important to understand how 
settlement and population patterns have and will continue to evolve over the coming decades. 
Ontario is home to some of the fastest growing communities in Canada and is projected to 
continue to grow at significant rates over the coming decades. Several of the Province’s rapidly 
growing municipalities are located in the Greater Toronto Area, including Milton, Oakville, 
Clarington, and Oshawa, as well as other communities further west in Kitchener-Cambridge-
Waterloo and London. There are a number of suburban municipalities that have also recorded 
significant growth, including East Gwillimbury, New Tecumseh, and Bradford West Gwillimbury. 
In northern Ontario, growth is projected to remain relatively stable, with an increase in 
population since 2016 most prominent in Greater Sudbury and North Bay, attributed to the 
growth in non-permanent residents living in the Region (Ontario’s Long-Term Report on the 
Economy, Ontario Ministry of Finance, 2020a; Stiebert Consulting, 2022). With differentiation in 
immigration patterns, there is a high degree of regional variability in population demographics 
and diversity, driven in large part by local job attraction and relative levels of housing 
affordability and supply. 
The current population of Ontario is approximately 14.8 million people, excluding Indigenous 
residents on reserves (Stiebert Consulting, 2022). Historical annual population growth rates in 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        290  
Ontario have ranged from between 0.75 to 2.75%, peaking in the late 1980’s and hovering 
around 1.75% over the past five years (Stiebert Consulting, 2022). 
Communities have grown significantly in Central, Eastern, and Southwest Ontario, where 
climate, economic conditions, cultural diversity, education and skills training, and healthcare 
investments are concentrated. While cultural enclaves have grown particularly in Toronto and 
surrounding communities, studies have shown that there is high diversity within these areas, 
and most are not dominated by a single ethnic community (Hiebert, 2015). However, rural 
populations have declined in many parts of the province, as urban areas have grown, resulting 
in a shifting urban-rural balance over the past 60 years (Ahmed, 2019). 
Patterns of population growth and degree of urbanization are critical to an assessment of 
climate change impacts and adaptation (see Figure 8.1). The differential vulnerability of 
populations to climate change, even within a small geographic range, has been well 
documented (Thomas et al., 2018). Regional variability in climate risk as well as specific 
conditions that manifest through particular outcomes for communities across Ontario are 
important to explore. This impact assessment considers the particular region-specific 
circumstances that play a role in climate impacts and Adaptive Capacity, including access to 
health care, availability of social services and providers, proximity to food sources, reach of 
emergency services, and existing levels of socio-economic inequality, all of which are 
intertwined with population density and level of urbanization. 
Current levels of regional population density vary considerably, as presented in Table 8.2. The 
Central region has by far the highest density, with approximately 625 people per square 
kilometre, compared to the Far North region with less than one person per square kilometre. 
This wide variability has distinct implications for how intensification of severe weather events 
and changing climate conditions manifest in different regions in the context of flooding due to 
limited permeable land surface, indirect impacts from infrastructure and building damage, 
urban heat island effect, and per capita availability of resources to support regional capacity 
(see Appendix 11).

Indigenous Peoples represent approximately 3% of the Ontario population, with over 406,000 
people spread across the province, living both on-reserve and in urban areas. The majority 
(78%) of Indigenous Communities are located in Northern Ontario, with on-reserve members 
comprised of Métis, Inuit, First Nation, other Indigenous, and some non-Indigenous residents 
(Ontario Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation, 2022). An oppressive history, (e.g. 
colonization), is a key influence on vulnerability of Indigenous People and communities, 
particularly in the context of climate change-related impacts and risks.

8.3 Defining People and Communities in the Context of the 
PCCIA  
The complexity and diversity associated with People and Communities, and its intimate 
connections to all other Areas of Focus for the PCCIA created challenges for its discrete analysis. 
As such, the climate change impacts were parsed to obtain direct impacts to people and 
systems. A total of four unique Level 1 categories were identified for the People and 
Communities Area of Focus, with the Population and the Indigenous Communities Level 1 
categories further subdivided to include Level 2 categories (Figure 8.2). Appendix 1 provides a 
full summary of the Level 1 and 2 categories assessed as part of this Area of Focus, including a 
brief description of each. 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        293  
Figure 8.2: Structure of the People and Communities Area of Focus in the Context of the 
PCCIA 
 
 
The Level 1 categories are intended to capture direct impacts to the health and well-being of 
people as individuals and communities in Ontario. They also account for the multiple levels at 
which climate risks interplay and affect Ontarian’s ability to meet their daily needs, and their 
capacity to adapt to acute and chronic climate change. The Level 1 and 2 categories are also 
designed to capture direct impacts to key services that are connected to the overall health and 
well-being of Ontarians. Indirect impacts that lead to damage to infrastructures, changes in 
natural ecosystems, infectious diseases and food and water-borne infections, worsening air 
pollution, disruptions to food and water supplies, and population displacement are also 
characterized throughout this Area of Focus. 
Limited data availability, notably those data that could fully characterize impacts to Indigenous 
culture, impacts to educational services and specific segments of the population most 
vulnerable (e.g. incarcerated populations, newcomers to Canada, outdoor workers, migrant 
workers, and those in long-term care facilities) proved to constrain the assessment. Given some 
of the gaps in data, the quantitative analysis of risk was limited to people and communities. A 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        294  
fulsome consideration of climate-related risk would require deeper analysis into specific 
segments leading to a more fulsome characterization of climate risks to population. Indirect 
and other cascading impacts are further elaborated on through qualitative narrative in Section 
8.7.  
The Level 1 categories that were identified for the general (non-Indigenous) component, 
include population, health care, and social services and public administration. Each component 
of this Area of Focus, as well as the other Areas of Focus are assessed for Indigenous 
Communities under the Indigenous Level 1 category.  
Population 
Within the population Level 1 category, two Level 2 categories were assessed: general 
population and unhoused population. The two categories were developed to recognize the 
specific vulnerability of people without access to safe, secure shelter to climate change. Priority 
populations who are disproportionately impacted by climate change (e.g. children and seniors, 
disabled individuals, newcomers to Ontario or Canada etc.) are considered as a percentage of 
the general population, as further described in Section 8.7.1. The general population Level 1 
category considered impacts to personal safety and well-being, integrating the influence social 
determinants have on health and well-being. Population vulnerability to the impacts of climate 
change considers the exposure and sensitivity to climate change impacts, and the existing 
capacity to respond to, or cope with them. The social determinants of health play a role in 
defining the way that individuals and communities respond to climate-related impacts, and the 
ways that their exposure and sensitivity to climate risks may be exacerbated based on their 
social, material and health conditions.  
The Financial Accountability Office of Ontario (FAO) estimated that in 2021, over 179,000 
households in Ontario live in housing that was “deeply unaffordable” and were at risk of 
homelessness (Financial Accountability Office of Ontario, 2021b). Disaggregated data from this 
work was not available for the inclusion in this impact assessment. Consequently, the analysis 
of the unhoused population Level 2 category primarily relied on a scan of municipal and 
regional data on homelessness counts. The connections between housing insecurity and 
insufficiency and vulnerability to climate change impacts are well documented, with several 
studies identifying homelessness, inadequate heating or cooling, and flood risk due to 
geographic location as key factors increasing exposure and vulnerability to multiple climate 
hazards (Bezgrebelna, 2021). 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        295  
Health Care 
The health care Level 1 category comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing 
health care by diagnosis and treatment and providing residential medical care. This includes 
ambulatory services, hospital care, nursing and residential care, and in-home health care.  
For the purposes of this assessment, data on Ontario’s health care sector were drawn from a 
number of sources, including the Local Health Integration Network (LHIN), comprised of 14 
regional LHINs and 78 sub-regional units (Public Health Ontario, 2016). The LHINs are 
responsible for planning, funding health service providers, and integrating services through a 
coordinated effort. As the LHINs are structured in a way that allows for a regional analysis, this 
point of reference was integrated into Ontario Marginalization Index (2016) data, developed by 
Public Health Ontario. These datasets provided insight into the population size, ethnic diversity, 
and level of material deprivation in the populations served by each health unit. 
Social Assistance and Public Administration 
The Social Assistance and Public Administration Level 1 category comprises establishments 
primarily engaged in providing social assistance and activities of a governmental nature. These 
include counselling, welfare, child protection, community housing and food services, vocational 
rehabilitation and childcare, legislative activities, taxation, national defense, public order and 
safety, immigration services, foreign affairs and international assistance, and the administration 
of government programs.  
Social and administrative services rendered by the Federal, Provincial, and Municipal 
governments are a key contributor to maintaining the health and well-being of Ontarians, 
including provision of support services for people with disabilities, food, housing, employment, 
family services, immigration and settlement, education, and various other essential services. 
The impact of closures of public administrative services can be difficult to quantify; however, 
close to 11% or over 1.5 million of Ontarians lived in poverty in 2019, and approximately 6.5%, 
or just under one million residents, received social assistance in 2019-2020 (Kapoor, 2022). 
These statistics provide some insight into the level of service provision necessary to maintain 
the basic necessities for a portion of the Ontario population and the consequences of service 
disruptions due to extreme climate-related events.  
Indigenous Communities 
The Indigenous Communities Level 2 category includes population, health care and social 
assistance and cultural services, in recognition of the integral aspect of cultural and spiritual 
practices on the land that is impacted by climate change. In addition, a set of Level 2 categories 
for each Area of Focus was assessed separately for Indigenous Communities, to capture the 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        296  
nuances climate impacts have on infrastructure, food and agriculture, business and economy, 
and natural environment, for Indigenous Communities. 
The assessment of climate impacts and capacity considered how environmental justice and 
equity issues are directly related to how climate change disproportionately impacts specific 
segments of the population (Morss et al., 2011). The delineation of vulnerable populations is 
further discussed in Section 8.5, detailing the methodology and approach taken for this Area of 
Focus assessment. 
8.4 Risk Snapshot across Ontario 
Summary of Risks  
Under the People and Communities Area of Focus, a total of 576 unique risk scenarios were 
evaluated through each of the Level 1 categories and climate variable interactions. Risk profiles 
for all Level 1 categories within the regions are summarized in Figure 8.3 illustrating current 
risk, and the expected risks for 2050 and 2080 under a high-emissions scenario (RCP8.5). 
Results from the PCCIA indicate that current risk profiles for this Area of Focus across all regions 
of Ontario range from ‘medium’ and ‘high’ risks, with no ‘very high’ risks reported. Population, 
health care, and Indigenous Communities Level 1 categories are found to have similar 
proportional distribution of ‘medium’ and ‘high’ risks, with social assistance and public 
administration risks assessed at the ‘medium’ level across the province. 
Looking into the future, several Level 1 and 2 risk profiles increase to ‘high’ and ‘very high’. The 
‘very high’ risks largely emanate from the population and Indigenous Communities Level 1 
categories, while health care risks average out to a ‘high’ level across most of the province. 
Social assistance and public administration risk profiles increase from ‘medium’ to ‘high’ risks 
across most regions of Ontario, with the Eastern region rising to ‘very high’.  
Generally, the PCCIA results indicate a considerable increase in risk across most categories and 
regions by mid-century (2050s). This increase is reflective of overall population growth and 
growth in vulnerable populations, in particular, increased unhoused populations, people with 
disabilities, and those in the low-income category. This shift towards ‘very high’ risks is further 
exacerbated by the 2080s for many Level 2 categories, reflecting considerable changes in the 
frequency of climate variables assessed under this Area of Focus (e.g. extreme precipitation and 
high temperatures).

 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        298  
The overall findings of the PCCIA suggest that some of the greatest climate risks across Ontario 
are for people and communities, both now and into the future. The highest risks for the 
population Level 1 category are present in the Central, Eastern, and Southwest regions, which 
are regions with the greatest population density and ethno-cultural concentration (Stiebert 
Consulting, 2022; Ontario Marginalization Index, 2016). Risks highlighted for health care, 
particularly in the Southwest and Central regions, also correspond to the extent of population 
density and exposure of hospitals and emergency services to potential flooding and extreme 
heat event, increasing risks related to electricity blackouts (Ness et al., 2021). The Southwest 
and Central regions of the province also exhibit existing strain on emergency services resulting 
in increased wait times for patients, caregiver and provider stress, which are exacerbated in a 
climate emergency, as well as the limited availability of per capita health resources to manage 
the demand (Ontario’s Premier's Council on Improving Healthcare and Ending Hallway 
Medicine, 2019). Risks to population and health care Level 1 categories are anticipated to rise in 
future time frames as current capacity constraints are accentuated into the future. 
Within the Indigenous Communities Level 1 category, the three main Level 2 categories with 
highest current risk exposure are Indigenous cultural services, Indigenous health care, and the 
general Indigenous population. The same categories also reflect the greatest risk by the end of 
century (2080s) time horizon, indicating that existing exposure of vulnerable populations will be 
exacerbated into the future. Currently the most densely populated regions (Southwest, Central 
and Eastern) exhibit the greatest risk across Indigenous Communities. By the end of century 
(2080s) risk profiles in Northeast, Northwest and Far North regions are anticipated to be ‘very 
high’, reflecting an accelerated rate of climate change and high rates of material deprivation in 
northern regions of the province.  
The results of the PCCIA highlight priority areas for equity-based adaptation planning and 
implementation across Ontario communities. The consequences associated with climate risks 
for Ontario’s most vulnerable populations are significant and present critical concerns, 
particularly in the context of rising income disparity and economic precarity.  
Key Climate Drivers  
The major climate variables impacting People and Communities are presented in Table 8.3. 
Extreme weather events are found to be the most impactful for this Area of Focus, including 
extreme temperatures and precipitation events. The greatest drivers of ‘high’ and ‘very high’ 
risks are extreme temperature climate variables (e.g. Extreme Cold and Extreme Hot Days) 
which accounted for half of all risk scenarios in this ranking. However, it should be noted that 
emerging research on the impacts of onset changes in average temperatures indicates that 
long-term, changes of 5°C can have equal or greater impacts on population health, compared to 
acute extreme temperature events (Chen et al., 2016). With this in mind, supporting adaptation 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        299  
interventions should address both acute and chronic temperature-related impacts, particularly 
for the unhoused population, who are most exposed and sensitive to smaller fluctuations in 
temperature. 
Extreme precipitation events followed closely behind extreme temperatures, representing 
nearly 20% of risk scenarios. Winter precipitation (e.g. freezing rain) represented over 10% of 
People and Communities risk scenarios (included under ‘other variables’). A full list of all major 
climate variables that are driving the highest risks to Ontario’s People and Communities Area of 
Focus by Level 1 category is available in Appendix 8.

8.5 Approach to Assessing Climate Impacts on People and 
Communities  
The assessment of climate impacts on the People and Communities Area of Focus considers 
both acute and chronic events associated with climate change, including extreme weather 
events and wildfire, as well as slow onset changes to climate conditions. As with other Areas of 
Focus, both direct and indirect impacts on the Leve 1 and 2 categories were explored, with only 
direct impacts being reflected in the risk scores. 
Based on data, research and literature, relevant climate variables were selected for each Level 2 
category. For instance, extreme heat and extreme cold were selected given the evidence for 
related mortality and morbidity risk. An Ontario-wide study found that for the period between 
1996 and 2010, each 5°C change in daily temperature was estimated to induce seven excess 
deaths per day in cold seasons and four excess deaths in warm seasons, with high-risk 
subgroups noted including unhoused populations and those with inadequate residential 
heating and cooling (Chen at el., 2016). 
Key climate variables assessed for the general population Level 2 category include, Extreme Hot 
Days, Extreme Cold Days, extreme precipitation events, winter precipitation, and in certain 
regions, wildfire. These climate variables have the potential to create adverse health impacts 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        300  
including temperature stress, respiratory impacts, and threats to physical safety, leading to 
situations where Ontarians may require medical attention, relocation to a site equipped with 
the infrastructure to support their well-being, such as heating or cooling centres, or short-term 
evacuation or long-term displacement.  
For People and Communities, the assessment of consequences was scoped to the portion (%) of 
population that is adversely impacted by the climate impact, where the higher the percentage 
of population affected, the greater the consequence score (see Table 8.4). A ‘very high’ 
consequence score reflected almost the entire population being affected by the impact, 
whereas a ‘low’ score reflected between 20 to 40% of the population affected. It should be 
noted that the percentage ranges provide a large band for each consequence score, potentially 
obscuring the changes from one time horizon to the next, especially when considering the 
projected increases in vulnerable populations from now until the end of century.

To update risk consequence scores for the 2050s and 2080s time periods, socio-economic 
projections were considered along with specific assumptions (see Box 14). In order to allow for 
a deeper analysis of each of the six provincial regions, a representative census area was 
selected that presented typical population characteristics for a given region, related to 
population size, growth, diversity, and density. The selected Census Subdivisions for each 
region are shown in Table 8.5.

Box 14: Socio-economic Analysis for People and Communities Area of Focus  
The socio-economic analysis conducted as part of this study was foundational to the review 
of climate variables for the People and Communities. In particular, the relationship between 
climate-related impacts and population density by income level clearly highlights the 
disproportionate exposure of low-income populations in more dense areas to a range of 
severe weather events and conditions, including droughts, floods, and landslides (see Figure 
below). Specific socio-economic indicators applied to this Area of Focus include population, 
population density, capital formation and low-income measure.

Approach to Assessing Risks to Vulnerable Populations 
There are significant segments of the Ontario population that are and will continue to be 
disproportionately impacted by climate change. Priority or vulnerable populations were 
identified based on a comprehensive review of provincial research and through consultations 
with subject matter experts over the course of the engagement process. In addition, the 
Ontario Marginalization Index (2016) and the Social Determinants of Health Map (2006, 2011, 
and 2016), both developed by Public Health Ontario were accessed to identify how severe 
weather events and conditions may overlap with materially deprived communities across the 
province (Public Health Ontario, 2022). Social determinants of health (SDOH) are social and 
economic factors that characterize and influence individual living conditions, such as income, 
education or employment, housing status, as well as the nature of the physical environment in 
which they reside. Experiences of discrimination, racism and historical trauma are important 
social determinants of health for certain groups including, Indigenous Peoples, people of colour 
and LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer).  
Given the broad nature of the PCCIA and the direction to take a data-oriented approach, the 
integration of an SDOH lens to understand how people and communities are impacted by 
climate change enables an intersectional approach to understand how intersecting layers of 
vulnerability can influence the proportion of the population that is disproportionately 
impacted, and therefore the overall level of climate risk to population groups across Ontario.  
The effects of climate change will not be felt uniformly across sub-populations, with certain 
groups anticipated to be disproportionately impacted. Examples of these groups include (Public 
Health Ontario, 2022): 
- 
Seniors 
- 
Infants and children 
- 
Socially disadvantaged people, including low-income populations 
- 
People with disabilities, including pre-existing illnesses or otherwise compromised 
health 
- 
People living in Northern communities 
- 
Emergency response workers 
Other factors also contribute to climate change vulnerability, and are difficult to quantify at the 
Ontario-wide population level. These include: 
- 
People living in areas with poor air quality 
- 
People working outdoors 
- 
People without access to air conditioning 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        303  
Socio-economic projections were applied and cross-referenced with the Ontario 
Marginalization Index to highlight vulnerable populations as part of this impact assessment. 
This approach allowed consideration of how segments of societal marginalization intersect with 
climate change impacts related to a given climate variable which ultimately informed the 
associated consequence rating. 
Three distinct (non-overlapping) segments of the population who would experience greater 
levels vulnerability were identified. From here proportions of the identified population groups 
were analyzed across the six representative regions based on the PCCIA socio-economic 
analysis (Stiebert Consulting, 2022). The three distinct population groups include:  
- 
Low Income (Prevalence of low income based on the Low-income measure, after tax 
(LIM-AT) (%), for the 18-64 age group) 
- 
Youth (Proportion of the population aged 0-14 years) 
- 
Older Adults (Proportion of the population aged over 65 years) 
Analysis of the proportions of each of the three population groups resulted in a ‘Total Base 
Vulnerable Population’ for each provincial region. To further advance an assessment of 
intersectionality, an added layer of analysis was applied to consider the following groups: 
- 
People with disabilities (Proportion averaged at 22% of the overall population over age 
14) 
- 
Women (averaged at 50.4% of the population) 
Proportions of the population representing people with disabilities and women were multiplied 
with the ‘Total Base Vulnerable Population’ for each representative regional census tract. The 
resulting ‘Total Vulnerable Population’ number was then matched against the population 
ranges, to inform the consequence scores for the impact assessment. By applying this 
approach, the multiplicative impacts and cumulative impacts of overlapping aspects of 
marginalized identities and climate change could be included in the assessment of people and 
communities. For more information, please refer to the PCCIA Methodology Framework 
(External Resource – 1).  
8.6 Limitations of the People and Communities Assessment 
Engagement Limitations  
Engagement is an important component of assessing climate change impacts on people and 
allows for the inclusion of experiences, risk tolerance and risk perception into the process. 
Engagement for the PCCIA were constrained due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Originally, in-
person engagement was planned for throughout the assessment process but had to be changed 
to a fully virtual approach. This resulted in engagement limitations across the project, including 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        304  
Indigenous engagement. Climate change knowledge and adaptation activity within Indigenous 
Communities, associations, and organizations is apparent and should be emphasized in future 
outcomes of this project and subsequent iterations of climate change assessment at a 
provincial scale.  
Data Input Limitations  
Within the People and Communities Area of Focus, certain impact elements could not be fully 
characterized due to lack of comprehensive province-wide data and information. For this 
reason, the strength of evidence for this Area of Focus was ranked mainly as low or medium. 
Examples of specific knowledge gaps include impacts on specific vulnerable segments of the 
population such as incarcerated populations, newcomers to Canada, outdoor workers, migrant 
workers, and those in long-term care facilities. Given some of these knowledge gaps, the 
quantitative analysis of risk to the People and Communities Area of Focus was limited for 
several categories.  
Another example is data availability on the unhoused population in Ontario. Data applied to 
this category were somewhat generalized across the province, recognizing that unhoused 
individual counts, and shelter service records are maintained at a municipal level, and was 
beyond the scope of this assessment. Instead, the representative Census Subdivisions identified 
in the previous section were used to guide research on the unhoused population. There are 
some limitations to this approach, as it does not capture the ‘hidden homeless’ – those who 
may be living with relatives or friends in the community, who may be precariously housed or in 
situations with low security of tenure, and those who have recently arrived in Ontario and are 
in the process of securing accommodations. 
Future more fulsome assessments of climate risk would require a deeper review of populations 
and vulnerable groups in Ontario. In addition, the quantitative data and robust methods to 
assess the cascading impacts for people and communities are limited. However, it is well known 
that cascading impacts from all sections stretch broadly across elements of health and well-
being, both at individual as well as community level. Cross-sectoral impacts are discussed 
further throughout Section 10.0, considering cascading impacts on food, energy and water 
security, health and well-being, and overall community function.  
 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        305  
8.7 Current and Future Risks 
8.7.1 Population 
Overview 
The Population Level 1 category refers to all people present across Ontario, except for the 
Indigenous Peoples living on First Nation reserves (covered under Indigenous Communities), 
and relates to all members of a community, including those who have been residing in the 
province over multiple generations, newcomers, international students, temporary foreign 
workers, and visitors.  
The two Level 2 categories identified within the Population Level 1 category are General 
Population and Unhoused Population, to recognize and capture the significant impacts of 
shelter on vulnerability to climate change as it relates to human health and wellness.  
The Population Level 1 category forms the basis of our understanding of how communities and 
individuals are potentially exposed to changing climate conditions, and the need for an 
intersectional approach to assessing the proportion of the population that is classified as 
vulnerable. In considering the types of climate-related impacts that inform the risk scenarios 
within the population Level 1 category, the consulting team drew upon available research, 
news sources, and socio-economic data. 
Direct Impacts 
This section describes quantitative scores for direct risks assessed for Level 2 categories under 
the Population Level 1 category. As noted, Representative Census Subdivisions were assessed, 
considering how climate variables could lead to impacts on each Level 2 category under current 
and future timeframes. The consequences of climate risks for the broader population, including 
the unhoused population, revolve around increased proportions of the population requiring 
access to medical intervention in times of high demand for services, with potential for 
increased mortality and morbidity as a result of medical and emergency service capacity 
constraints.  
Example risk scenarios are available in Table 8.6 for a fuller picture of the risk scenarios 
considered for the Population Level 1 category. Table 8.7 summarizes the risk profiles for each 
Level 2 category and region, operating under a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5).

Illustrative Risk Scenario 
Strength of 
Evidence  
General 
Population 
Extreme precipitation (shorter term) leads to widespread 
flooding. Due to the lack of permeable surfaces in Central 
Ontario and presence of aging infrastructure, stormwater 
drainage is overwhelmed in some areas. Recreational water 
or safe drinking water sources may be compromised due to 
runoff from heavy rainfall events. Vulnerable populations 
are exposed to mould especially in low-income housing. 
Food contamination and related illness can occur following 
flooding and associated power outages. Flooding worsens 
some physical health problems, personal loss, financial 
difficulty and mental health disorders among this group.  
High 
Unhoused 
Population 
Extreme heat and cold events associated with mortality and 
morbidity particularly for unhoused populations. Extreme 
precipitation (rainfall) and Winter precipitation result in 
shelter damage and loss of property, prompting the need 
for evacuation or relocation. 
High 
 
General Population 
The results of the impact assessment indicate that extreme heat and cold are key climate 
variables driving future risk for Ontario’s general population. Extreme precipitation (rainfall) 
and winter precipitation are also found to be impactful on the general population, with risks to 
shelter damage and loss of property. Risk to the general population is found to increase from 
‘medium’ to ‘high’ by the 2050s across all regions except the Far North where it remains 
‘medium’. By the 2080s, general population in all regions is expected to face ‘high’ risks, while 
those living in Southwest Ontario will experience ’very high' risks. 
Extreme heat and high temperature associated with climate change are expected to have 
implications for the general population related to heightened exposure to daily high 
temperature that exceed 30°C. Those who belong to particular demographic groups deemed to 
have a higher vulnerability (e.g. low-income households, outdoor workers, seniors, those with 
chronic diseases) may be disproportionately impacted, with more cases of heat related illnesses 
and fatalities. 
A previous study of four Canadian cities demonstrated that from 1954 to 2000, approximately 
120 people died each year due to heat-related causes in Toronto (Pengelly et al., 2007). 
Extreme heat impacts will be further exacerbated in the absence of natural assets and green 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        307  
spaces (e.g. trees for shade) in urban areas of the province (Mohajerani et al., 2017). The PCCIA 
assessed impacts associated with the Urban Heat Island Effect, finding that Central and 
Southwest regions of the province, with the highest population densities (Stiebert Consulting, 
2022) are more likely to be impacted than those in less densely populated regions (e.g. 
northern regions of the province) (Li et al., 2020).  
Extreme precipitation is another climate variable that is driving risk for the general population, 
with vulnerable populations being disproportionately impacted, particularly in urban areas at 
greater risk of flooding (Hemmati et al., 2022). Vulnerability to extreme precipitation events can 
also stem from a lack of warning systems, stormwater management, and adequate 
infrastructure in neighbourhoods with a larger proportion of underserved communities. The 
resulting psychosocial and health effects of flooding can be long lasting and exacerbate social, 
economic, health, and other disparities, making it difficult to recover and build resilience (Glenn 
and Myre, 2022). 
Impacts to the general population that relate to severe acute climate events, such as wildfire, 
are largely linked to community evacuation, food-, water- or vector-borne diseases, food or 
water shortages, exacerbation of cardiovascular and respiratory conditions, disruptions of 
health and emergency services, stress from community evacuations and population 
displacement and mental illness (Doyle et al., 2017).  
The cascading effects of evacuation to health and well-being as well as the healthcare and 
social services systems are significant and require coordination between multiple agencies 
including Emergency Management Ontario, the Provincial Emergency Operations Centre, Local 
Health Integration Networks, municipal governments, and First Nations. In the Far North region 
in particular, fly-in communities are at greater risk if timely evacuation is not planned and 
prepared for, and operational limitations continue to be a high point of stress (Rall, 2020).  
Unhoused Population 
The impact assessment found that the unhoused population is affected by climate change in 
similar ways as the general population, but to a greater extent given the high potential that 
their living conditions are not protected or resistant weather and climate conditions (e.g. poorly 
equipped shelter, limited access to heating and cooling systems), creating greater levels of 
exposure. Extreme temperature (heat and cold) are the key climate variables driving future risk 
for this population category across Ontario. 
Risk to the unhoused population is found to increase from a ‘high’ current risk score to a ‘very 
high’ risk score by the 2080s across all regions of Ontario. The southern regions of the province 
(Central Southwest and Eastern) are expected to see an increase in risk for the unhoused 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        308  
population by mid-century (2050s), reflecting increased exposure to extreme heat in the 
southern regions with greater population densities in urban areas. 
The Southwest and Central regions of the province have greater unhoused population, 
particularly in urban centres (e.g. the Greater Toronto Area). Many of these residents are more 
likely to have pre-existing, untreated, or undiagnosed health conditions (Gomez, 2010). In 
addition, lack of secure tenure is also linked to lower access to crisis communications, making 
unhoused populations less likely to be forewarned about inclement weather or have access to 
information on emergency procedures and supports (Ramin & Svoboda, 2019; Gomez, 2010; 
Feng et al., 2021). 
The risk results for the unhoused population in Ontario demonstrated the inherent vulnerability 
of this population. The intersectional approach applied to the assessment of this Area of Focus 
provides a clear picture of how additional health conditions within this population may further 
amplify climate vulnerability. For instance, in considering the risk scenario related to extreme 
precipitation, it was assumed that flash flooding would be localized within a particular 
geography. Due to the lack of permeable surfaces in some urbanized areas and presence of 
aging infrastructure, stormwater drainage may be overwhelmed (Kleerekoper et al., 2012). 
Recreational water or safe drinking water sources may be compromised due to run off from 
heavy rainfall events, creating limitations in access to potable water (Gomez, 2010). Unhoused 
populations who are exposed to these conditions are likely to experience increased mortality 
and morbidity, including the exacerbation of mental health issues and infectious diseases as a 
result of being forced to seek shelter in crowded facilities, and the stress accompanying the loss 
of personal belongings and displacement (Ramin & Svoboda, 2019; Pendrey et al., 2014).

Indirect Impacts  
Ontario’s general population may be indirectly impacted by climate change through macro-
level shifts such as economic downturns or losses in major local employment sectors. This 
would have cascading impacts related to the number of people experiencing housing insecurity, 
and who would therefore be more vulnerable to being exposed to severe weather as a result of 
potentially being rendered homeless or finding accommodations in poorly equipped shelter, 
such as housing with inadequate heating or cooling systems (Falvo, 2020). 
Climate change can also increase risks to mental health and well-being of Ontarians, with 
impacts being significant and long lasting. Mental health outcomes in relation to climate change 
can exacerbate existing conditions and introduce new illnesses, such as depression, post-
traumatic stress, anxiety and grief. Mental health impacts have been found to be particularly 
pronounced in individuals who have experienced displacement, loss of housing and/or 
livelihood from climate-related impacts (e.g. flooding, wildfire) (Copes, 2017). General distress 
from climate change and related environmental degradation can also worsen existing or 
introduce new mental illnesses (e.g. ecoanxiety) (Hayes et al., 2022).  
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        310  
Infectious diseases as well as water- and food- borne illnesses are associated with a number of 
climate variables that impact air and water quality and create conditions for pathogens to 
spread, including extreme heat and extreme precipitation (Copes, 2017; Eyquem and Feltmate, 
2022). Other indirect impacts of concern to the population include risk of injury or death from 
infrastructure damage, increase in insect and pest populations leading to potential exposure to 
new diseases and general discomfort outdoors, and quality of life and health impacts from 
increased exposure to solid waste and wastewater in the event of impacts to sanitation services 
(Eyquem and Feltmate, 2022). 
Further analysis on the indirect and cross-sectoral impacts on human health, well-being and 
safety can be found in Section 10.4.  
8.7.2 Health Care 
Overview 
The Health Care Level 1 category was designed to capture climate change impacts on the 
functioning and service delivery of health care services to Ontarians, including emergency 
services and hospital/clinic-based care. There is some disparity in the presence of and access to 
health care facilities across the province, particularly in growing communities and in less 
densely populated areas across northern Ontario. The types of care that are available and wait 
times to access urgent and emergent health care needs vary significantly across Ontario. In 
addition, access to timely and reliable health care is a key indicator of health and well-being, in 
particular for vulnerable populations who require more regular and consistent care.  
In the context of climate change, impacts to service delivery arising from increased demand, 
limitations in access to ambulance and emergency services, as well as caregiver constraints and 
burnout are all potential factors that would impact the provision of healthcare during a climate 
emergency.  
The risk scenario in Table 8.8 provides a description of the risk scenario considered for the 
under the Health Care Level 1 category. A summary of the risk profiles for health care across 
each region can be found in Table 8.9.

extreme climate related events (heat waves, extreme

caregiver/provider stress and potential burnout, leading 
to shortfalls in service provision. 
High 
 
Direct Impacts  
The assessment of direct impacts to Ontario health care systems revealed that extreme climate 
related events (heat waves, extreme cold, extreme precipitation) are driving future risk. 
Increased demand for health care services as a result of acute climate events may result in 
longer wait times, caregiver/provider stress and potential burnout, and reduced quality of care 
and attentiveness, particularly to people with disabilities and with chronic illness. For instance, 
a study of Toronto neighbourhoods found that heat-related ambulance calls were 12.3% higher 
during extreme heat events than in the preceding or the following week (Graham et al., 2016). 
Health care employees at all levels are vulnerable to extreme weather conditions that could 
impact their ability to be available and overcome challenges related to increased service 
demands during emergency situations.  
Risk to health care is found to maintain a ‘high’ score from the current timeframe to the 2080s, 
in Central and Eastern regions. In the Southwest region, the risk is found to increase to a ‘very 
high’ risk score by the 2080s. For the northern regions of the province (Northeast, Northwest 
and Far North), the current risk profile for health care is deemed to have ‘medium’ score and is 
anticipated to increase to ‘high’ in the 2050s and 2080s. 
Winter precipitation, with rain and freezing rain falling during winter months may cause 
hazardous travel conditions and infrastructure damages, creating risk for a number of health 
care services, including for health care providers attempting to reach their place of work, 
emergency vehicles attempting to reach those in need, and potential for collisions and road 
accidents that create additional stress on the transportation and emergency services systems 
(Tsang and Scott, 2020). In this risk scenario, emergency and health care wait times would 
increase by as much as three times, with greater consequences in more densely populated and 
underserved communities (Coles et al., 2017; Tsang and Scott, 2020).

Indirect Impacts  
There are several indirect impacts that can compound the identified direct risks or introduce 
additional climate-related pressures to health care services in Ontario. Infrastructure is a critical 
aspect of climate resilience for health care, as it is crucial for emergency services to be able to 
reach people in need or for them to be able to reach medical care. Climate impacts leading to 
power outages, road access disruptions, and damage to potable water systems can all have 
significant consequences for health that would result in greater numbers of people requiring 
emergency services care (Coles et al., 2017; Ramgopal et al., 2019; Tsang and Scott, 2020). As 
populations grow and population density increases over time, these impacts are likely to be 
further exacerbated.  
In addition, impacts related to disruptions of supply chains and production systems for 
equipment, materials, medications, and supplies can be significant, as experienced throughout 
the COVID-19 pandemic. Impacts causing supply chain disruptions can have significant 
cascading impacts, particularly for quality of care and access to services which 
disproportionately impact people with disabilities or long-term conditions, as well as 
Indigenous Communities (Hahmann and Kumar, 2022). 
8.7.3 Social Assistance and Public Administration  
Overview 
The Social Assistance and Public Administration Level 1 category is linked to, but distinct from 
the health care Level 1 category. While the health care category identifies impacts on the 
health care sector primarily in emergency situations, the Social Assistance and Public 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        313  
Administration category considers both emergency as well as long term consequences of 
climate change on the population. This includes the need for ongoing, as well as acute situation 
supports, considering populations reliant on home care assistance, mental health supports, 
occupational therapy, family and child services, and employment services. These services are 
fundamental to health and well-being and are called into high demand as a result of both acute 
and chronic climate related events. The impacts on service providers and community-based 
organizations are considered under this category.  
Direct Impacts  
Similar to health care services, the assessment of social assistance and public administration 
services revealed that acute climate events (e.g. extreme temperatures and precipitation) are 
driving current and future risk. These types of events and conditions cause increased demands 
for services and for higher proportions of the population that are unable to access social 
supports. Impacts include increased demand for social worker assistance, emergency shelter 
space, and wellness check-ins on the most vulnerable in a community. Vulnerable groups 
include people with disabilities, seniors, and newcomers who may be experiencing 
communication barriers or lack of information on where to access services in a time of crisis.  
Table 8.10 provides an example risk scenario for this Level 1 category. Notably, these are meant 
to be illustrative examples of the types of scenarios assessed and are non-exhaustive. A more 
detailed risk characterization and a description of risk drivers are provided in the section below.  
Further details on the risk profiles relevant to this category, with more information on how the

The risk profile for social assistance and public administration is found to increase from a 
current risk score of ‘medium’ to a ‘high’ risk score by the 2050s and remain there, in the 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        314  
Southwest, Central, Northeast, Northwest, and Far North regions. For Eastern Ontario, risk is 
expected to increase further, to a ‘very high’ score by the 2080s.  
An additional aspect of climate impacts for social assistance and public administration services 
relates to the increased demand for services during extreme climate related events. With a 
series of hot days, certain populations, particularly the most vulnerable, but also relatively 
healthy adults, could experience the physical and mental health strain of coping with extreme 
heat (Smoyer-Tomic et al., 2003; Paterson et al., 2014; Gough et al., 2016). Longer durations of 
heat waves would also have corresponding rates of increased mortality if wellness check-ins 
and home care visits are not possible due to the strain on the system and lack of resources, 
placing a sense of urgency in the system with respect to reaching community members who 
may be more isolated (Paterson et al., 2014).  
Administrative as well as care workers involved in delivering social assistance are more likely to 
experience high stress and increased demand during prolonged extreme weather events, 
potentially leading to a reduction in availability of service providers and increased wait times in 
the system overall (Morss et al., 2011). Limitations in social assistance support for example 
through welfare programs including the Ontario Disability Support Program may result in 
reduced capacity for low-income residents to be able to afford shelter with adequate 
temperature controls, or to be able to afford the cost of regular use of heating and cooling. 
These impacts may lead to greater risk of temperature stress and mortality risk, which in turn 
impacts the demand for and availability of those tasked with providing care in emergency 
situations.  
In a study on extreme heat impacts to workers in Ontario between 2004 and 2010, workers in 
government services accounted for nearly 15% of all heat illnesses, more than twice their share 
of all injuries. The ratio of heat illnesses to workers was the highest for government workers, 
including those providing essential services such as park maintenance, fighting forest fires, and 
sanitation (Fortune et al., 2013).

Indirect Impacts 
The longer-term implications of recurrent extreme events and greater climate variability can 
cause several indirect impacts. Indirect impacts of climate change on social assistance and 
public administrative services include impacts to overall mental health of service providers, 
greater demand for supports beyond the emergent care needs described above, and greater 
demand for long-term social supports (e.g. occupational therapy and physical care to manage 
the physical impacts of climate-related health outcomes).  
Food insecurity is another indirect impact that would influence the need for social assistance, 
which may be impacted by changes in the Food and Agriculture sector, as well as overall 
increased cost of living as a result of impacts in the Business and Economy Area of Focus (Morss 
et al., 2011; Rosenthal et al., 2021).

8.7.4 Indigenous Communities  
Overview 
The Indigenous Communities Level 1 category includes all First Nation, Inuit and Metis living 
across Ontario. There is significant research to indicate that Indigenous Communities are 
disproportionately impacted by climate change, due to impacts that affect the natural 
environment, existing socio-economic disparities, remoteness of many community reserves, 
and lack of adequate infrastructure (water, wastewater, roads, etc.) (Centre for Indigenous 
Environmental Resources, 2006; Furgal and Seguin, 2006; Smith, 2016; Laduzinsky, 2019). As 
part of the People and Communities Area of Focus, it was important to therefore separate the 
assessment of climate risk and Adaptive Capacity between Indigenous and non-Indigenous 
Populations in Ontario, particularly in the context of supporting and respecting Indigenous 
rights to self-determination. 
There are 215 Indigenous Reserves/Settlement/Villages in Ontario as identified by Crown-
Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada, held by approximately 133 First Nations in 
Ontario. A large number of communities are located around or in close proximity to the Great 
Lakes throughout southern Ontario. Northern Ontario is home to 106 First Nations (Ontario 
Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, 2019), many located adjacent to lakes and rivers. 
Over 30 First Nations communities in Ontario are located in remote areas of the Far North, 
accessible only by air or by winter roads (Hori et al., 2018a). There are several urban centers 
with considerable Indigenous Populations as well, particularly in Northern Ontario (Thunder 
Bay, Sudbury, Sault Ste. Marie, Timmins) and in Ottawa and Toronto. The total on-reserve 
population is estimated at approximately 57,700, noting that the statistics are dependent on 
self-reporting, and may represent an undercount (Stiebert Consulting, 2022). 
Climate impacts on Indigenous Communities were assessed across several Level 2 categories, 
including, 1) Population, 2) Health Care, 3) Cultural Services and 4) Social Assistance. In 
addition, an assessment of the other Areas of Focus, 5) Infrastructure, 6) Food and Agriculture, 
7) Business and Economy, and 8) Natural Environment.  
The direct and indirect impacts of climate change on Indigenous Communities in Ontario are 
far-reaching and complex, from increased populations with a need for relocation or evacuation 
during extreme weather events, to disruptions in cultural and community land-based practices, 
and reductions in access to health care and social services during extreme events. 
In comparison to the assessment of similar non-Indigenous sub-categories, the assessment of 
this Level 1 categories considers the additional layers of vulnerability and potential for 
increased risk for Indigenous Communities. 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        317  
Direct Impacts 
All of the aforementioned events, conditions and impacts to health and well-being are 
applicable to the Indigenous Level 2 categories, albeit in more acute ways given existing 
constraints in service provision and vulnerability. Climate change impacts on Indigenous 
Communities were assessed, with attention to how changes in magnitude and frequency of 
climate variables could lead to impacts on each Level 2 category. Each Level 2 category was 
evaluated under current and future timeframes, as described in the following sections.  
Example risk scenarios are available in Table 8.12 for a fuller picture of the risk scenarios 
considered for the Indigenous Communities Level 1 category. Table 8.13 summarizes the risk 
profiles for each Level 2 category and region, operating under a high emissions scenario 
(RCP8.5).

Indigenous Population 
Changing climate conditions present a range of direct and indirect health and well-being 
impacts on Indigenous Populations, threating their personal safety, water and food security, 
mental well-being, knowledge systems, ways of life and cultural cohesion. The impact 
assessment found that extreme heat and cold events, extreme precipitation (and associated 
flooding), and wildfire climate variables are driving the highest risks for Indigenous Populations. 
Specific vulnerability considerations for Indigenous Populations were applied to the assessment 
of climate impacts, including socio-economic disparities, social gradients in health, close 
relationships to sometimes rapidly changing environments, and other systemic barriers. 
Barriers to building resiliency to a changing climate and capacity constraints, as a result of 
colonial legacies are also important when considering climate impacts on Indigenous 
Populations. 
Under current conditions, the risk profile for Indigenous population was determined to be ‘high’ 
for Southwest, Eastern and Northeast regions, and ‘medium’ for Central, Northwest and the Far 
North. The difference in current risk levels reflects differences in current climate hazard 
exposure (e.g. extreme heat and wildfire) and the distribution of Indigenous Communities. Risk 
to Indigenous Populations is anticipated to increase across all regions by mid-century (2050s), 
with Southwest and Eastern Ontario experiencing ‘very high’ risk (reflective of extreme heat 
related risks). Risk profiles increase to “very high’ by the 2080s, across all regions of the 
province. 
The direct health and well-being impacts to Indigenous Communities as a result of climate 
change have been well documented, including in a recent study from Health Canada which 
identified the exacerbation of existing health and socio-economic inequalities; air quality health 
impacts, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases; mental health impacts including 
stress, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder; increased injuries and deaths from extreme 
weather related accidents; and evacuation or displacement from traditional territories, 
disrupting lives, creating financial hardship and affecting mental well-being (National 
Collaborating Centre for Indigenous Health, 2022).  
Extreme temperature (e.g. extreme heat and cold) is currently driving the greatest risks to 
Indigenous Populations. Extreme heat and cold events are associated with higher mortality and 
morbidity rates, particularly for vulnerable populations which includes Indigenous 
Communities. For instance, Indigenous urban residents are more than twice as likely to have 
experienced hidden homelessness as their non-Indigenous counterparts, increasing exposure to 
extreme temperature (Advocacy Centre for Tenants in Ontario, 2017). 
 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        319  
Flooding conditions from extreme precipitation events is greater for Indigenous Communities 
compared to non-Indigenous Populations. Flooding is already creating significant impacts for 
Indigenous Communities (e.g. property damage and evacuation), with an estimated 27% of 
Indigenous residents in Ontario facing heightened exposure to residential flood risk, compared 
to 16% of non-Indigenous residents (Chakraborty et al., 2021).  
Wildfire risk to Indigenous Populations creates deep emotional and psychological impacts for 
communities, not only from the loss of property but also from damage to sacred lands and loss 
of cultural heritage (Centre for Indigenous Environmental Resources, 2006; Furgal and Seguin, 
2006; Smith, 2016; Laduzinsky, 2019; Graham, 2020; Belanger, 2021). Wildfire also has 
cascading mental health impacts, as events may leave residents feeling uneasy about future 
wildfire risk (Furgal and Seguin, 2006). Indigenous Communities located in areas of high wildfire 
risk (e.g. northern regions) may experience more frequent community evacuations under a 
changing climate. 
Indigenous Health Care 
Increased demand for health care services as a result of extreme climate related events (heat 
waves, extreme cold, extreme precipitation) may result in longer wait times, caregiver/provider 
stress and potential burnout, leading to shortfalls in service provision and inaccessibility to 
services. The implications of limited access to remote Indigenous Communities in northern 
regions (Northeast, Northwest and the Far North) may result in long delays of emergency 
service delivery and could have severe consequences for health in emergency situations. 
Impacts to critical transportation and communication infrastructure may also impact access to 
food, medication supplies, and other daily necessities. Extreme weather events may lead to 
restricted or delayed travel for health and emergency services and compromise patient safety 
in northern communities (National Collaborating Centre for Indigenous Health, 2022).  
Risks to Indigenous health care are assessed at a ‘high’ score under current conditions, in all 
regions except the Far North. By the end of century (2080s), this risk profile is expected to 
increase to ‘very high’ across all provincial regions. Risk is anticipated to increase at an 
accelerated rate in the Southwest region as a result of extreme heat and high temperature 
exposure.  
Indigenous Social Assistance 
The direct impacts to Indigenous social services including employment, family and community 
services, education, housing, and supports for people with disabilities, are similar to those 
described for the health care sector. These include increased needs for social services as a 
result of extreme climate related events (heat waves, extreme cold, extreme precipitation) 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        320  
resulting in longer wait times, caregiver/provider stress and potential burnout, shortfalls in 
service provision and inaccessibility to services for remote communities particularly.  
Climate impacts are expected to be felt differently across segments of the Indigenous 
population, with women, children, Elders, people with disabilities, and those living off-reserve 
experiencing a range of consequences that may be short or long term in duration (Warren et 
al., 2021). Existing social services to Indigenous Communities are already limited by availability 
of trained professionals, with knowledge of culturally appropriate practices (e.g. integrating 
Indigenous ways of being into their work) and understanding of the disproportionate socio-
economic inequities and harms from colonization (Canadian Association of Social Workers, 
2020).  
Risk profiles for Indigenous social services are currently deemed as ‘medium’ across all regions 
of the province. However, future risk is anticipated to increase considerably to ‘very high’ by 
mid-century for southern regions of Ontario (Southwest, Central and Eastern). Northern regions 
(Northeast, Northwest) also see an increase in risk, with scores ‘very high’ by the 2080s. The Far 
North also is expected to experience ‘high’ risk under this sector for both future time periods 
(2050s and 2080s). 
Indigenous Cultural Services 
Indigenous culture, language, and livelihoods are tightly intertwined with the land, with deep 
investment in the well-being of all aspects of the natural world (NCCIH, 2022). Climate change 
has resulted in significant losses for Indigenous Peoples, including cultural practices and 
heritage, traditions and social fabric, as well as physical and mental health, identity and dignity, 
among others (Pearson et al., 2021).  
Indigenous cultural services are currently assessed as ‘high’ risk across all provincial regions. 
Climate-related impacts are anticipated to compound risks to this category, with southern 
regions of the province (Southwest, Central, Eastern) experiencing an accelerated increase in 
risk by mid-century (2050s), and the northern regions (Northeast, Northwest and Far North) 
experiencing an increase by end of century (2080s). 
This assessment found that extreme climate-related events (heat waves, extreme cold, extreme 
precipitation) are associated with loss of resources for cultural services, resulting in declining 
harvests, medicines, and hunting activities. Impacts from climate change have also resulted in 
decreased opportunities for transmission of Indigenous knowledges and land skills, particularly 
among youth, affecting sense of identity, mental well-being, and cultures (National 
Collaborating Centre for Indigenous Health, 2022). The risks extend to how Traditional 
Ecological Knowledge (TEK) is developed and shared, as climate change impacts have shifted 
the ways that communities interact with nature and create new concerns with the safety of 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        321  
past practices given the changing ecological conditions seen across the province (e.g. increased 
unpredictability of ice conditions for winter travel and hunting) (Charles-Norris, 2020). 
However, TEK remains one of the most crucial elements in understanding climate change 
impacts and advancing adaptation mechanisms for Indigenous Communities, further 
highlighting its value and cause for critical concern (Thomas et al., 2018). 
Another key impact to Indigenous culture is the loss of archaeological and built heritage as a 
result of major climate events (e.g. wildfire, flooding etc.). Climate-related impacts, coupled 
with human activity, such as extractive industries and development can have devastating 
impacts to Indigenous culture and well-being (Pearson et al., 2021). Increasing occurrences of 
extreme weather events such as flooding and tornados, combined with gradual climate impacts 
such as erosion and rising water levels coastal sites present risks to these irreplaceable sites 
and non-renewable resources (Pearson et al., 2021; Sesana et al., 2021). These losses are 
difficult to quantify in the context of Indigenous knowledge and cultural values, with impacts 
cascading to the health and well-being of Indigenous People and communities in Ontario (CAA, 
2022). 
Indigenous Infrastructure  
Indigenous Communities across Ontario face varying forms and degrees of infrastructure 
limitations, with historic underdevelopment. Infrastructure in Indigenous Communities is often 
multifunctional and integral to sustaining healthy community life, providing a range of services. 
The infrastructure gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities across Canada is 
significant, with an estimated $30 billion in investment needed to close gap (Baird and Podlasly, 
2020). These gaps include critical infrastructure, such as water, wastewater, waste 
management, roads, and stormwater management systems. As of October 2022, there are 22 
boil water advisories in 19 communities across Ontario, the highest number in Canada 
(Indigenous Services Canada, October 17, 2022). Several First Nations have taken leadership to 
undertake infrastructure projects and programs, supporting self-determination and growing the 
capacity on Indigenous reserves (Indigenous Services Canada, 2022). 
In addition to the deficits in critical infrastructure, climate change presents an additional 
dimension of capacity and servicing challenges. These include similar impacts facing off-reserve 
infrastructure, including risks from flooding causing damage to infrastructure assets, reduced 
efficiency during extreme heat or cold events, failure or impassability of transportation routes, 
and damage to buildings (see Section 6.0).  
Damage to physical infrastructure in Indigenous Communities across the province can be 
impacted by several climate variables. This Level 2 category has been designed to encompass all 
relevant systems covered under the Infrastructure Area of Focus that Indigenous Communities 
rely upon. This includes but is not limited to buildings, waste management, stormwater 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        322  
management, utilities, and transportation infrastructure. Winter roads are an example of 
critical infrastructure that northern Indigenous Communities rely on and are particularly 
vulnerable to climate change. Warming winters and temperature variability are shortening the 
winter road season, resulting in construction and maintenance challenges and safety concerns 
related to road stability. Increasing unpredictability of winter road conditions is impacting the 
supply of critical supplies and emergency services for Indigenous Communities in northern 
Ontario. (Hori et al., 2018a; 2018b). The potential for increased exposure to water-borne 
illnesses as a result of changing temperatures and extreme heat is also a concern with 
inadequate water treatment infrastructure in place.  
Risk profiles were derived from the Infrastructure Area of Focus and scores were increased for 
this Level 2 category, to reflect the increased susceptibility and disproportionate impacts on 
Indigenous community infrastructure. Levels of risk to Indigenous infrastructure are anticipated 
to increase from ‘high’ to ‘very high’ by mid-century across all provincial regions.  
Indigenous Food and Agriculture  
Many Indigenous Communities rely on the land and water for sustenance and food security. 
Under a changing climate, traditional food sources are being threatened as the distribution and 
abundance of species changes. Indigenous Communities who rely on harvesting traditional 
foods as their main food source will be greatly impacted, as access to certain plant, fish (e.g. 
walleye and brook trout) and mammal species (e.g. moose) from their traditional territories 
may be limited or entirely lost in some areas. These expected ecological changes compound 
risks to food security, resulting in declines to diet quality and nutrient access and accompanying 
impacts to mental health, cultural well-being and social cohesion (Harper and Schnitter, 2022). 
In addition, safety associated with winter hunting and fishing is increasingly compromised by 
thin ice during warmer winter weather, further exacerbating climate risks to indigenous food 
security (Hori et al., 2018a; 2018b).  
Under the quantitative assessment of this Level 2 category, only Level 1 and 2 categories 
covered under the Food and Agriculture Area of Focus that Indigenous Communities rely upon 
were assessed (note that this Area of Focus does not includes hunting and gathering practices). 
However, climate-related impacts to primary food production can have cascading impacts for 
Indigenous Communities with pre-existing food security and access challenges (see Section 10.1 
for further details) but is not included in the quantitative risk scoring of this Level 2 category 
(Harper and Schnitter, 2022).  
With this in mind, the risk scenarios and profiles for this Level 2 category were derived from the 
Food and Agriculture Area of Focus but remain in line with the calculated risk scores under this 
Area of Focus.  
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        323  
Indigenous Business and Economy  
As explored throughout Section 9.0, changes in frequency and magnitude of climate variables 
can cause several impacts and disruptions to business and economies across the province. This 
Level 2 category encompasses all relevant Level 1 and 2 categories under the Business and 
Economy Area of Focus that could impact Indigenous Communities directly. Due to the 
dependence on natural resource sectors under this Area of Focus for Indigenous livelihoods, 
current and future risk profiles were extracted and increased by one level from Business and 
Economy for this Level 2 category. 
Indigenous People in Canada have tended to pursue a strategy of economic development with 
social entrepreneurship at its core. Examples of Indigenous socio-economic objectives include 
(i) greater control of activities on their traditional lands, (ii) self-determination and an end to 
dependency through economic self-sufficiency, (iii) the preservation and strengthening of 
traditional values and their application in economic development and business activities, and 
(iv) improved socioeconomic circumstance for individuals, families, and communities through 
social entrepreneurship (Anderson et al., 2006). 
Ensuring Indigenous People are able to pursue economic development is inextricably tied to 
ensuring the land on which they live is not ravaged by the effects of climate change. From an 
Indigenous perspective, land is important for several reasons. First, traditional lands are the 
‘place’ of the nation and are inseparable from the people, their culture, and their identity as a 
nation. Additionally, land and resources are the foundation upon which Indigenous 
Communities intend to rebuild the economies of their nations and so improve the socio-
economic circumstance of their people (Anderson et al., 2006; Ford et al., 2020).  
Indigenous Natural Environment  
Natural systems are tightly linked to Indigenous culture, language, and livelihoods. Under the 
Natural Environment Area of Focus, several risk interactions found that the distribution and 
abundance of certain species will vary under a changing climate. Indigenous Communities will 
be greatly impacted by these changes, as access to certain plant, fish (e.g. walleye and brook 
trout) and mammal species (e.g. moose) from their traditional territories may be limited or 
entirely lost in some areas.  
Overall research points to the devastating effects of forest fires, droughts, and permafrost, lake 
and sea-ice melt on the lives of Indigenous Peoples and communities across Ontario. These 
experiences support findings regarding the disproportionate impacts of climate change on 
Indigenous Peoples, including losses of biodiversity predicted to severely disrupt the traditional 
hunting, fishing and gathering practices (Indigenous Circle of Experts, 2018).  
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        324  
Water is also of utmost importance to Indigenous Populations, not only for physical need but 
also spiritual. Within many traditional belief systems among Indigenous Communities, water 
and the subsequent aspects are of paramount importance. Research from the Ontario 
Indigenous Women’s Water Commission highlights that water in Ontario is threatened by 
hydro-fracking, deforestation around watershed areas, the emission of pollutants into the air, 
and the shipment of toxins across the Great Lakes (Indigenous Circle of Experts, 2018). 
Underpinning their work is the philosophy of honouring obligations to the seven generations to 
come, honouring teachings of women and Elders, and ensuring that all the information 
provided is respectful of Indigenous Knowledge. Now, these features are changing, becoming 
less predictable, and resources are at greater risk today from changing conditions, despite 
modern weather prediction methods, improved communication, and enhanced technologies 
(Mustonen et al, 2022). 
Climatic changes compound risks to food security, mental health, cultural well-being, and social 
cohesion for Indigenous Communities. Risk scenarios and profiles, reflecting direct impacts, 
were extracted from the Natural Environment Area of Focus, with scores increased by one level 
to reflect deep alignment of Indigenous Peoples with the natural world.

Indirect Impacts 
The indirect impacts to Indigenous Peoples across Ontario stem from a number of factors, 
including existing infrastructure deficits and socio-economic inequality that is further 
exacerbated by climate related risk. The inadequacy of current infrastructure is systemic, 
including drinking and boil water advisories, limited transportation infrastructure, and homes 
and dwellings that are three times more likely to need repairs than non-Indigenous 
communities (Chakraborty, et al., 2021; Ness et al., 2021). The disproportionate and significant 
impacts that Indigenous Communities face include financial, psychological, and social burdens 
associated with flooding and displacement (Chakraborty et al., 2021). Indigenous Communities 
have worked to adapt their activities and practices in response to changing climate conditions, 
and exhibit resiliency in face of structural and systemic inequities (Laduzinsky, 2019).  
Additional indirect impacts can have long-term consequences for health, well-being, and 
resilience of Indigenous Communities including food and water insecurity due to decreased 
access to and quality of land, waters, and natural resources; spread of infectious diseases and 
water-borne illnesses (National Collaborating Centre for Indigenous Health, 2022). For northern 
Ontario communities in particular, transportation access is critical to the provision of services, 
food, products, and maintenance of livelihoods, and any restrictions or damage to road and rail 
networks can have significant implications (Belanger, 2021). 
8.8 Climate Change Opportunities 
Opportunities resulting from direct physical climate change impacts on people and 
communities are limited. As demonstrated throughout this assessment, changing climate 
conditions across different regions of the province can impact Ontarians and their communities 
in a variety of ways. Overall, the impact assessment found the risks climate change poses to the 
Level 1 and 2 categories assessed under this Area of Focus, significantly outweigh any potential 
positive impacts. In other words, climate interactions with increasing risk scores (e.g. extreme 
heat) outweighed any interaction that exhibited stable or even slightly declining risk scores (e.g. 
extreme cold) for all Level 1 and 2 categories under this Area of Focus 
Specific interactions related to low temperatures (Extreme Cold Days) and general population 
indicate that in the long-term (2080s), Extreme Cold Days will decrease and in turn, population 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        327  
risks related to extreme cold exposure decline. With that said, the assessment finds that 
increasing temperatures and extreme heat exposure will lead to increased mortality and 
morbidity for general, unhoused, and Indigenous Populations across the province.  
8.9 Adaptive Capacity  
8.9.1 Adaptive Capacity Summary  
Adaptive Capacity in the context of the People and Communities Area of Focus refers to the 
ways in which individuals and communities are able to address and withstand the impacts of 
climate change, both acute and chronic. As part of this assessment, consideration was given to 
capacity across a range of levels, taking an intersectional approach to considering how climate 
change plays out in the daily lives of Ontarians. This included housing affordability, accessibility 
for people with disabilities, communications, and other technologies to manage and anticipate 
impacts and protect the most vulnerable, and governance potential to institute actions needed 
to address climate risks.  
The five key indicators of Technology, Equity, Resource Availability, Governance, and Sector 
Complexity were appraised with the regional demographic and socio-economic diversity in 
mind, as well as the unique context that applies to Indigenous Communities. In addition, it is 
important to recognize that the general population is highly reliant on the provision of services 
and resources from the government, and that income is a key indicator of ability to adapt, 
independent of government support.  
Fundamentally, the People and Communities Area of Focus assessment provides a more 
generalized overview of the dynamics that may play out in unique and specific ways in different 
communities. This approach highlights the need for evidence-based, collaborative planning 
around equity-based adaptation, that centers those most vulnerable and therefore most 
impacted. 
Furthermore, it is important that the voices of Indigenous knowledge-holders are centered in 
the effort to develop meaningful and effective climate adaptation programs for all Ontarians, 
and not only when focused on Indigenous Communities. This is particularly important given the 
need to apply an environmental and social justice-oriented approach to climate adaptation 
(Thomas et al., 2018). 
The results from the Adaptive Capacity analysis are provided in Table 8.14. A regional analysis 
of Adaptive Capacity can be found in Appendix 11.  
 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        328  
There are both specific and general elements to improving Adaptive Capacity that would have 
an immediate and lasting effect on protecting human health and well-being. Several capacity-
building measures can help to address not only climate impacts to people and communities, but 
also strengthen the determinants of good health across priority populations. It is important the 
capacity-building efforts are inclusive of those who are experiencing climate impacts on health 
and safety disproportionately. As the understanding of health vulnerability under a changing 
climate evolves, the intersections of health inequities across Ontario are crucial to integrate 
into adaptation and response planning. For example, investments in housing and health care 
are important to prioritize as climate change is anticipated to worsen existing conditions and 
inequities.

8.9.2 Technology  
Technology was given a ‘medium’ rating for the population Level 1 category. Opportunities 
related to technology and capacity building for the general population overlap with 
governance. Examples include:  
- 
Access to and availability of communications and warning systems 
- 
Artificial intelligence to support modelling and identification of risk and vulnerability, 
- 
Access to affordable residential heating and cooling systems 
 
29Note these scores do not consider geographic location within the province. Please see Appendix 11 for 
regional Adaptive Capacity ratings. 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        329  
- 
Green infrastructure systems to support mitigation of Heat Island Effects and provide 
comfortable outdoor spaces in hotter and wetter weather 
Similarly, Technology was scored at a ‘medium’ level for the Health Care Level 1 category. An 
example of capacity under this category is advancements in telemedicine and increased 
accessibility to services to support longer-term management of the mental and physical health 
impacts associated with climate change.  
With respect to social assistance and public administration Level 1 category, Technology was 
rated as ‘low’. Digital equity has been identified as a key gap and area for improvement in order 
to support greater access to social services for marginalized communities. The methods and 
technology to support social assistance expansion and equity exist and can be further refined 
through enhanced planning and implementation. Technology was also rated as ‘low’ for the 
Indigenous Communities Level 1 category. Improving infrastructure and monitoring systems, 
particularly for water, wastewater, and road access improves ability to adapt to changing 
conditions and quality of life. Communications infrastructure enhances resiliency during 
emergency scenarios and supports social assistance and health care needs remotely.  
8.9.3 Equity  
Equity was rated as ‘low’ for the population Level 1 category and remains a critical concern for 
climate change adaptation planning, particularly with rapid urbanization. Over 85% of Ontario’s 
population lives in an urban context. The disparities of climate change impacts that exist in 
cities today disproportionately affect Indigenous Peoples, people of colour, and low-income 
residents, particularly those with disabilities, youth, and older adults, who lack access to green 
space, cooling shelters, and resources to respond during and after extreme weather events. 
Ontario also has one of Canada’s largest populations of migrant workers, who are particularly 
vulnerable to heat stress and infectious disease due to the nature of their work and precarity of 
employment. There is also a significant population of nearly 600,000 non-permanent residents 
overall (students, foreign workers, etc.) who lack capacity to respond to climate impacts and 
would benefit from additional supports to successfully adapt to climate-related 
risks. Additionally, projections indicate future instability of Ontario’s housing stock, with the 
number of unhoused residents in Ontario increasing, along with their vulnerability to climate 
change due to lack of supports.  
Equity was also scored at a ‘low’ level for health care, and social services and public 
administration Level 1 categories. A chronic lack of quality and availability in long-term care 
facilities indicates inadequate levels of capacity to build resilience and be better equipped to 
respond to the associated impacts. Some public health units, research institutions, and 
government are investing in planning and research, but overall funding and supports for 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        330  
vulnerable communities and further research to support climate vulnerability assessments for 
at-risk populations in Ontario appear to be limited. 
For the Indigenous Communities Level 1 category, Equity was also scored as ‘low’ and is closely 
linked to Resources Availability, which received the same score. This rating was assigned due to 
the understanding that Adaptive Capacity is a significant challenge for the majority of 
Indigenous Communities which are deeply underfunded and where risks to population well-
being from climate change are compounded due to existing socio-economic conditions. 
Indigenous Communities continue to have higher rates of unemployment, lower infrastructure 
quality, limited access to social supports, poorer health outcomes, and higher rates of exposure 
to environmental pollution, indicating severe equity challenges.  
8.9.4 Resource Availability  
Resource Availability was rated to be ‘low’ for the population Level 1 category, influenced by 
the evidence of growing social inequality fueled by education cuts, lack of healthcare equity (Xi 
et al., 2005), employment disparities, and a general uneven distribution of resources to support 
population health and well-being. Current wait times for subsidized housing in Ontario are as 
long as 7-10 years in larger municipalities, with the situation forecasted to worsen (Gibson, 
2021).  
While funding and data resources for climate change adaptation planning have been made 
broadly available at the municipal level through Provincial and Federal programs, funding for 
implementation can be a key constraint particularly in smaller communities and more remote 
areas of the province. At a granular level, the uneven distribution of wealth and income results 
in differential levels of access to the resources that can support Adaptive Capacity; thus, even 
when the technology, housing, food stores, relocation support, are generally available, they are 
not equitably shared, and more vulnerable segments of the population are less likely to be able 
to access them (Thomas et al., 2018). A study of health impacts from extreme heat in Toronto 
found that air conditioning access is directly correlated with income level, with higher annual 
income households over $80,000 being 25% more likely to have air conditioning compared to 
lower annual income households below $20,000 (Thomas et al., 2018). However, in-home air 
cooling is not a definite guarantee of indoor comfort during extreme heat events, and even 
those with residential air conditioning reported heat-related discomfort. The cost of energy to 
maintain air conditioning creates an additional barrier for low-income households, as well as 
other aspects such as the level of shading and tree canopy in low-income neighbourhoods and 
structure orientation to support passive cooling (Thomas et al., 2018). 
Adaptive housing, modular housing, and sustainable construction methods to support 
increased diversity of housing stock, climate resilience, and accessibility for affordable options, 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        331  
have been proven in North America, and in Ontario specifically. Improvements to the supply of 
housing stock and adequate, safe, accessible shelters should remain a critical priority. As 
demonstrated within this assessment, unhoused populations are highly vulnerable to climate 
change, and do not have the capacity to cope with extreme weather or even moderate changes 
in temperature which can cause heat/cold stress. While many municipalities have undertaken 
housing strategies, funding for social housing remains low and wait lists for supportive and 
social housing continue to grow across the province.  
With respect to health care and social services and public administration Level 1 categories, 
Resource Availability was also rated low, as planning and funding for the health care sector in 
Ontario has experienced significant instability, with funding cuts and a projected deficit that 
does not meet the needs of Ontario’s growing population.  
 For many of the reasons noted above, Indigenous Communities was also assigned a ‘low’ rating 
for Resource Availability. In addition, lack of dedicated long-term funding for mental health 
services are additional complicating factors that further constrain the provision of health care 
and social service supports in Indigenous Communities (National Collaborating Centre for 
Indigenous Health, 2022). 
8.9.5 Governance  
Governance was rated as ‘low’ for the population Level 1 category. Public health and planning 
departments across Ontario municipalities are integrating a climate change lens to mitigate 
climate risk, however, political will to take action is not consistent across Ontario. Attention 
should be given to deeper systemic inequities around environmental racism, ableism, and 
income inequality that are linked to and exacerbate climate-related risks.  
There are broad municipal coalition networks and spaces that enable knowledge transfer and 
training to advance climate action. Further investment in these networks can support shared 
capacity across regions and create resources that help to balance out the disparities in funding 
and access across regions.  
Emergency response and institutional capacity to support unhoused populations in dealing with 
the impacts of climate change vary across the province, based on regional distributions of 
unhoused populations, local political conditions, and availability of resources. Overall, 
unhoused populations are particularly vulnerable to funding cuts and lack of economic stability, 
which continues to be a critical challenge in Ontario.  
Governance for health care was scored as ‘medium’, given the strong academic, practitioner, 
not for profit, and research knowledge base to support climate change adaptation. For 
example, several Public Health Units have undertaken regional and local assessments of climate 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        332  
change vulnerability that include consideration of health equity provide a foundation for 
stronger and more widespread adaptation action (e.g. Peel Region, London Middlesex, Simcoe 
Muskoka and Grey-Bruce). Additional toolkits have been developed are established forums for 
discussion, networking, knowledge sharing, and capacity building.  
Governance was scored as ‘low’ for social assistance and public administration. Poverty 
reduction, social inclusion and human rights are key areas that need to be improved upon to 
build capacity in this area. Approximately eight percent of Ontarians under the age of 65 rely on 
social assistance for their primary source of income, either through Ontario Works or the 
Ontario Disability Support Benefit (Maytree, 2022). Deep barriers exist to accessing needed 
services due to complexities in navigating different levels of social assistance, as well as lack of 
supports for single people and people with disabilities.  
8.9.6 Sector Complexity  
Sector complexity was rated as ‘low’ for the population Level 1 category, as planning for climate 
adaptation that directly impacts health and well-being of populations, entails a fair degree of 
complexity, with the requisite engagement of audiences and stakeholders. Capacity building is 
supported at the municipal level and is critical for building community-based response plans 
and undertaking meaningful engagement with vulnerable populations to inform adaptation 
strategies. The knowledge of how to conduct this engagement and create meaningful strategies 
exists and has been documented in the literature (Bednar et al., 2018; Eyquem and Feltmate, 
2022).  
Complexity also arises at the intersection of governance, resources, equity, and technology, 
such as in planning for long term adaptation responses. These include developing infrastructure 
to support timely evacuation in the event of wildfire or flooding, and in some cases relocation 
for communities that are in physically flood prone areas, such as in the case of Kashechewan 
First Nation in northern Ontario (CBC, 2022).  
Complexity was rated ‘low’ for health care, recognizing the wide variability in conditions facing 
the LHIN units across the province, disparities in funding, and specific political and socio-
economic conditions that impact how health care planning is undertaken. In contrast, social 
assistance and public administration received a ‘medium’ Complexity rating, considering how 
the social assistance sector is well connected with policy think tanks, academia, and 
practitioner knowledge. Sector complexity also stems from the wide range of needs of people 
who require social assistance, and the growing gap in funding.  
For the Indigenous Communities Level 1 category, Complexity was scored as ‘medium’. Climate 
change adaptation planning must be undertaken by Indigenous Peoples in an autonomous way, 
guided by local and traditional knowledge and community needs. There is a range of variability 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        333  
in institutional capacity to support implementation of adaptation plans and community-based 
engagement across Indigenous Communities in Ontario. However, there is shared institutional 
capacity in the form of the Indigenous Climate Hub and federally funded programs to support 
climate change adaptation across Indigenous Communities. There is also a deep commitment to 
climate change adaptation in Indigenous Communities that builds on traditional knowledge 
systems and practices. 
8.10 Climate Adaptation Priorities 
Results from the PCCIA can help to shed light on current and emerging adaptation priorities for 
the province, based on the anticipated magnitude of risk, and associated capacity levels to 
respond and cope with climate change impacts. As described in Section 2.4.5, an adaptation 
priority is defined as any Level 1 or 2 category in a given region that has an Adaptive Capacity of 
‘medium’ or lower and a risk score of ‘high’ or greater (see Appendix 12 for combined Level 1 
and regional Adaptive Capacity ratings) 
As described in Section 8.9, the Population and Heath Care Level 1 categories included under 
this Area of Focus have a ‘medium’ Adaptive Capacity, and Social Assistance and Public 
Administration and Indigenous Level 2 categories have a ‘low’ Adaptive Capacity rating. When 
combining this with the regional Adaptive Capacity ratings, only Health Care in Southwest and 
Eastern regions are found to have a capacity rating greater than ‘medium’ (see Appendix 12). 
This section provides further detail on current and emerging adaptation priorities for the 
People and Communities Area of Focus, considering existing levels of capacity and current and 
future risk scores. 
Current Adaptation Priorities  
There were a number of priorities that emerged for the current timeframe with respect to Level 
1 and 2 categories that are deemed to be ‘high risk’, with a corresponding ‘lower’ or ‘medium’ 
level of Adaptive Capacity. A summary of current adaptation priorities is provided in Table 8.15. 
The first of these is health care, particularly in the southern regions (Central, Southwest and 
Eastern), where the population is growing at high rates. In the current timeframe, the health 
care risk in southern regions is high compared to more northern regions, largely due to the 
relative population density within this region and frequency of severe weather events and 
conditions including extreme heat and flooding, leading to higher rates of consequence and 
likelihood scores. The corresponding level of Adaptive Capacity was assessed as ‘medium’, 
given the clear potential to directly address population risks through improved funding and 
resources for emergency services and expansion of overall services, including mental health.  
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        334  
As noted, unhoused populations represent one of the most climate vulnerable groups in the 
province, with high-risk exposure highlighted in every region. Capacity limitations are attributed 
to the lack of significant action on housing programs from a governance and resource 
perspective, and the rising housing insecurity across the province.  
Indigenous Communities were assessed to have a number of high risks across Level 2 
categories, including cultural services, and health care. Adaptive Capacity across all categories 
was assessed to be relatively low, given the lack of funding and resources, existing 
environmental injustices, and lack of adequate existing infrastructure to combat the impacts of 
climate change. The Adaptive Capacity of Indigenous Communities, particularly in northern 
regions, is hindered by remote geographic conditions, food insecurity, and limited financial and 
technical resources (Human Rights Watch, 2020).

Emerging Adaptation Priorities  
By the mid-century, a number of additional areas of high risk will manifest, adding to several of 
those already identified in the current timeframe, most of which continue to persist. A 
summary of emerging adaptation priorities is provided in Table 8.16. 
The general population Level 1 category in all regions except the Far North emerges as a ‘high’ 
risk moving into the 2050s. The Adaptive Capacity for this category could be built through 
 
30 See Appendix 12 for combined Adaptive Capacity rating and associated scoring matrix. 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        335  
interventions in the form of universal residential cooling, emergency warning systems, and 
improved collaborative planning to center the needs of marginalized populations. However, the 
socio-economic disparities and projected increase in vulnerable populations indicate that 
significant investments would be needed to build up Adaptive Capacity, 
Risks to health care in the Northeast, Northwest, and Far North also emerged as a priority, 
indicating an increase in the proportion of the population most vulnerable to climate change in 
these regions. The existing strain on medical institutions and health care providers in these 
regions is anticipated to increase, affecting response times, delays in providing critical services, 
and longer wait times for specialized and mental health supports. The Adaptive Capacity in this 
category and throughout these regions could be strengthened through technological supports 
in telehealth and rural healthcare service provision, as well as decentralized emergency services 
and improved communications infrastructure.  
Corresponding to the spike in health care risks, in the 2050s the risks to social assistance and 
public administration are also predicted to increase in all regions, owing to similar factors as the 
health care category around population change from rural to urban areas and an increase in 
vulnerable populations. In particular, support for people with disabilities, newcomers, and low-
income populations are vital to improving Adaptive Capacity in these regions.  
By the 2050s all categories of Indigenous Communities are labelled as adaptation priorities. 
Indigenous Communities were assessed to have a number of high-risk categories including, 
cultural services, and health care. This level of risk coupled with a relatively low Adaptive 
Capacity, given the lack of funding and resources and existing environmental injustices, 
highlights the requirement for urgent adaptation action.

Advancing Adaptation  
Climate change has already had significant impacts on the individuals, communities, and 
associated services in Ontario. Without coordinated and inclusive adaptation efforts, climate 
change will continue to drive risks into the future. This assessment demonstrates that climate 
risks are highest among Ontario’s most vulnerable populations, exacerbating existing disparities 
and inequities. Climate risks to Indigenous Communities and associated systems are significant 
based on the additional layers of sensitivity and exposure.  
There is an urgent need to limit key risks to Ontario’s people and communities, in order to 
avoid outcomes that can become inter-generational and further exacerbate inequities for 
marginalized populations. Adaptation efforts to address the underlying health and well-being 
inequities are critical for reducing population vulnerability and building climate resilience.

The PCCIA Adaptation Best Practices (ABP) Report (External Resource – 2) includes measures 
that are applicable to people and communities across Ontario. The province has the solutions 
and knowledge to act to lessen and avoid many of the climate risks Ontario’s people and 
communities are facing. A high-level summary is provided in Table 8.17, with more specific 
adaptation options available in the ABP Report.

9.0 Business and Economy Area of Focus 
9.1 Overview  
Climate change is fueling more extreme weather, impacting local economies, 
driving up costs, and challenging economic growth. These impacts and the associated economic 
shocks will not be uniform across Ontario. The PCCIA finds that most Ontario businesses will 
face increased risks due to climate change, with the largest increases expected for businesses 
dependent on natural production systems and where historical infrastructure deficits exist (e.g. 
fishing, hunting and trapping industries, forestry and logging) (see Table 9.1). Local economies 
and businesses that subscribe to resilience as well as the transition to a low carbon future will 
have increased growth, prosperity and thrive in the context of climate change.

9.2 Ontario’s Business and Economy  
Economic vitality is closely linked to managing climate risks and achieving resilience across 
communities (Bush, 2022). Through a solid understanding of climate-related risks and action on 
adaptation, Ontario has enormous opportunity to build strong local, resilient economies and to 
support in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and innovating more efficient business practices. 
A resilient Ontario economy has a competitive advantage and can enable businesses at all 
scales and across industries to thrive in the face of an uncertain and extreme future.  
In the Canadian context, Ontario’s economy is significant. As of July 2021, Ontario’s economy 
contributed almost 39% of Canada’s overall GDP (Government of Ontario, 2022f), which can be 
broadly understood as the value of goods produced and services provided throughout the year. 
Ontario’s GDP can be further distributed into services (78%) and goods (22%), of which 
manufacturing contributes just over 10% of Ontario’s GDP (Government of Ontario, 2022f). 
Other goods-producing industries include construction, utilities, and primary industries. 
Services-producing industry shares include real estate, rental and leasing, health and education, 
wholesale and retail trade, finance and insurance, public administration, transportation and 
warehousing, information and culture, and other services (Government of Ontario, 2021d).  
With a population of over 14.8 million (Government of Ontario, 2022f), Ontario is the most 
populous province in Canada. Businesses and their economic operating conditions are 
undergoing a period of rapid change (OCC, 2019). In 2019, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce 
(OCC) identified that globalization, urbanization, and technological transformation are all 
challenging the status quo and particularly redefining what it means for Ontario businesses to 
be competitive. Climate change, both the pace at which greenhouse gas emissions are 
mitigated and the ability to adapt and foster resilient businesses and industries, is a crucial 
factor in the coming decades. 
Ontario’s economy does not exist in isolation. Economic success is contingent on businesses 
and industries remaining competitive in the international market. Evolving global conditions 
can impact businesses and the economy in Ontario through important external factors such as 
the Canadian Dollar exchange rate, the price of oil, and interest rates (Ontario Ministry of 
Finance, 2020b). Ontario relies upon imports, and benefits from importing and exporting goods 
to international markets, with the latter predominantly going to the United States. Significant 
Ontario exports include motor vehicles and parts, precious metals and stones, mechanical 
equipment, plastic products, and iron and steel. Significant imports to Ontario (largely from the 
United States, followed by China) include motor vehicles and parts, mechanical equipment, 
electrical machinery, precious metals and stones, and pharmaceutical products. 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        341  
Given current and emerging pressures, Ontario’s overall prosperity increasingly depends on the 
strength of its regional and local economies. However, regional economic and population 
growth have been remarkably imbalanced in recent decades (OCC, 2019). As an example, 
growth in Ontario’s Greater Golden Horseshoe and Ottawa have far surpassed other areas in 
the province. In other words, Ontario’s economy is composed of a multitude of smaller 
economies, such as rural and remote areas, small and large cities, Indigenous Communities, and 
border towns, each of which poses unique strengths, opportunities, and challenges. Regionally, 
these also differ significantly. For instance, Northern Ontario (Northeast, Northwest, Far North 
regions) encompasses nearly 88% of Ontario’s land but only about five percent of its 
population, with an economy largely driven by natural resource industries such as forestry, 
fishing, mining, oil and gas. Tourism is also a significant contributor in Tourism Region 13 
(covers Northeast, Northwest and Far North regions), with visitor spending in 2019 totaling $1.5 
billion and generating $1 billion for the region’s total GDP (Statistics Canada, 2021d) and in 
comprising seven percent of all businesses in the region in 2021 (Statistics Canada, 2021f). Rural 
areas in Ontario stretch across the province, with urbanization and consolidation in certain 
industries leading to workers and jobs leaving more rural communities that also pay more for 
energy than urban areas (OCC, 2019). 
Economic shocks and stresses, including the climate impacts described in this report, are not 
(and will not be) felt uniformly across Ontario. This holds true for both climatic and non-climatic 
impacts. For example, the 2008 recession led to vastly different impacts across Ontario, with 
the Southwest region experiencing the largest impact and areas of Eastern Ontario the least 
impact. Regional variation in employment also indicates that employment growth has been 
concentrated in the Greater Toronto, Ottawa, and Greater Golden Horseshoe Areas, with little 
or declining employment in Northern regions (OCC, 2019). These differences indicate that non-
climatic and indeed climatic impacts will not be uniformly experienced across the province. 
Similarly, the ability to recover from impacts is also not expected to be uniform by sector, by 
size of business, nor by region of Ontario.  
9.3 Defining Business and Economy in the Context of the PCCIA 
Ontario’s Business and Economy Area of Focus is characterized as complex considering its 
diversity in size, location, industry, and relative contribution towards GDP. In scoping the PCCIA, 
numerous “categories” were defined to consider and were defined based upon national 
reporting standards and based on data availability. In some cases, certain types of businesses 
(e.g. healthcare and social assistance) were considered and included in other Areas of Focus 
contained in this report.  
For the purposes of the assessment, the Business and Economy Area of Focus has been sub-
divided into 11 Level 1 categories (see Figure 9.1), of which three were broken down into 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        342  
multiple Level 2 Categories (specifically, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting Economies; Utility 
Services; Transportation Economy). For additional details, Appendix 1 provides a 
characterization of the Level 1 and 2 categories for this Area of Focus. 
Figure 9.1: Structure of the Business and Economy Area of Focus in the Context of the PCCIA 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        343  
Each of these categories was identified with consideration given to relevant criteria and 
rationale, aligned with the scoping of the PCCIA. The following criteria were used in identifying 
the Level 1 and 2 categories:  
- 
Alignment with relevant North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes  
- 
Relevance as it relates to Ontario’s economic structure (e.g. major industry coverage, 
where possible)  
- 
Consideration of other PCCIA Area of Focus categories where physical impacts on 
systems may be linked with inputs or supplies for businesses 
- 
The ability to identify an appropriate “firm” representing a particular industry to be used 
as a proxy for quantitative risk evaluation  
One notable industry in Ontario – real estate, rental, and leasing – was also considered in the 
development of Level 1 industries for quantitative evaluation. However, in the context of how 
the PCCIA has been scoped, real estate (e.g. buildings and assets themselves) has been included 
as part of risk evaluation for construction (see Section 9.7.4), whereas real estate investment 
trusts (REITs) or companies that own or finance income-producing real estate are included 
under the Finance and Insurance Level 1 category (see Section 9.7.5). Additional relevant 
content associated with real estate can also be found in the Infrastructure Area of Focus, in the 
characterization of buildings and other infrastructure components (see Section 6.0). 
The Business and Economy Area of Focus is unique within the PCCIA as it links or plays a strong 
role in other Areas of Focus. As described in Section 2.0, Areas of Focus were identified as a 
means to assess the impacts and risks to systems and sectors in a systematic and scalable 
manner. In this regard, all other Areas of Focus quantitatively evaluated risks associated with 
direct impacts on the systems, commodities, or components themselves (e.g. the impact of 
extreme heat on an asset within the Infrastructure Area of Focus, or the impact of drought on 
commodity yield in the Food and Agriculture Area of Focus). To robustly evaluate risks within 
the Business and Economy Area of Focus, risk scenarios were developed and assessed based on 
the impact to service delivery associated with specific Level 1 or 2 category and financial loss 
based on annual revenue. In other words, risk scores reflect the ability of services to be 
continued or maintained in the event of a climate variable occurring, not the physical impact of 
the climate variable on the Level 1 or Level 2 category itself. 
In many cases the impacts and risks characterized in other Areas of Focus may lead to cascading 
or indirect risks on Business and the Economy. For example, direct climate impacts on 
commodity yields (Food and Agriculture) may disrupt the supply chain for which manufacturing 
(e.g. food processing and manufacturers) relies upon. In another example, physical impacts to 
infrastructure assets may lead to asset failure or downtime that could cascade throughout the 
infrastructure system (e.g. if a culvert is blocked, leading to a road washout and exposed buried 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        344  
infrastructure) that could impact the transportation economy and the ability for local and long-
distance freight to transport goods (Business and Economy). There are a significant number of 
these cross-sectoral impacts across Areas of Focus, and these have been qualitatively 
characterized across different themes under Cross-Sectoral Considerations (Section 10.0). 
For the purpose of this section, however, these interdependencies were not distinctly 
quantitatively evaluated as part of Business and Economy, though some characterization is 
provided based upon each Level 1 category below.  
9.4 Business and Economy Risk Snapshot across Ontario  
Summary of Risks  
Changes in physical climate risks are already impacting Ontario firms of all sizes, and these 
impacts are expected to continue (and potentially be exacerbated) into the future. The 
significance of climate risks to business performance and sustainability are anticipated to vary 
widely, depending on factors such as firm size, geographic location of business assets and 
activities (including supply chain relationships), and complexity of business arrangements (e.g. 
partnerships). 
Climate risks and opportunities are numerous. Across the 11 Ontario business industries (Level 
1 categories), many climate risk scenarios were identified – of these, a total of 350 unique 
climate risk scenarios were deemed potentially significant and subjected to assessment.  
Most Ontario businesses are expected to experience increased levels of risk from current levels, 
exacerbated or influenced by projected changes in climate variables. However, these results are 
not homogeneous, and are highly influenced by the magnitude and intensity of change in 
climate variables, the size and unique details of specific firms, and the geographic location of 
business assets, activities, and supply chains. Additionally, Level 2 industry categories 
encompass a broader range of sub-industries that were not examined discreetly, and whose 
risk profiles may vary from that of the overall Level 2 category.  
The most significant changes in risk profile are anticipated to belong to firms whose business 
models, services, markets, and products are dependent on natural production systems that are 
directly affected by severe weather events and changes in climate regime: 1) Arts, 
Entertainment and Recreation; 2) Forestry, Fishing and Hunting Economies. Public and private 
infrastructure system impacts are also a significant contributor to business risk, with firms in 
industries within Transportation Economy and Utility Services, anticipated to experience 
elevated risk over the coming decades.  
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        345  
Figure 9.2 illustrates risk scores for all Level 1 categories assessed, by region of Ontario under 
current, 2050s and 2080s time periods. Future time periods illustrate risk results associated 
with RCP8.5, a high emissions scenario.  
The PCCIA methodology and assumptions made at the firm level were developed to represent 
industry risk and significant differences are not anticipated in the distribution of climate risk on 
a region-by-region basis. Additional investigation at the regional and local level could identify 
important regional differences, such as within the arts, entertainment and recreation industry 
where a broad range of summer and winter outdoor recreational activities are grouped 
together for the scale of this assessment. In this example, different climate variables may 
impact different outdoor activities in both positive and negative ways. More detailed 
characterizations and a description of risk drivers and risks for each industry are provided in 
Section 9.7. 
Key Climate Drivers 
The most prominent climate variables that drive risk in this Area of Focus are listed in Table 9.2, 
Extreme Precipitation Events, Extreme Hot Days, and Wildfire drive risks in 49%, 34%, and 7% of 
all risk scenarios, respectively.

A full list of all major climate variables that are driving the highest risks to Ontario’s Business 
and Economy Area of Focus by Level 1 category is available in Appendix 8.  
It must be noted that there are numerous other climate variables that were assessed and that 
impact Ontario’s Businesses and Economy (e.g. changes in mean precipitation). The four 
identified above simply represent the greatest number of risk scenarios under this Area of 
Focus. One can consider these results in the context of managing and reducing risks from these 
climate variables. For example, where possible, reducing impacts associated with extreme 
precipitation (e.g. flooding) can be considered one effective adaptation option to reduce higher 
risks – particularly where Adaptive Capacity is limited.

9.5 Approach to Assessing Climate Impacts to Business and 
Economy  
Business climate risk was defined for each industry by assessing risk at the scale of an individual 
firm operating within the province, and then using an individual firm risk score as a proxy for 
industry risk. Industry risk scores do not depict overall industry, sector, or economy-wide 
climate risk, but rather present a view as to the nature of risk that an individual industry firm 
may face in a more extreme climate future. To describe with an example, a risk score for 
Utilities – Local Distribution represents the risk that a single Local Distribution Company (LDC) 
may be expected to face in relation to a single risk scenario (e.g. Most Probable Worst-Case 
Event). Thus, risk scores presented for the Business and Economy Area of Focus should not be 
interpreted as presenting the level of climate risk that the entire LDC industry or electrical 
system as a whole may experience.   
Given the vast range of Ontario firm sizes (e.g. revenues, number of employees, number and 
range of products produced, and services delivered), geographic locations of assets and 
business activities, and value chain relationships, various assumptions regarding business 
resilience were used in this assessment in order to derive individual business risk scores. These 
assumptions are derived from the assessment scope, expert judgment and based upon 
available data to illustrate an “archetype” or “average” firm size. However, it is important that 
risks may differ significantly for varying sizes of business. For example, quarry operations are 
run by firms that vary greatly in terms of size. Many operations are small scale with very few 
employees and owned by a small business owner while others are larger, more sophisticated 
and owned by a large company. The smaller the firm's size and/or reserve funds, the greater 
the impact could be on service delivery and finances, thus varying risk levels. Additional 
assessments that dive deeper into these industries could produce more granular results.  
The likelihood of a risk scenario and the associated consequence(s) for an individual firm were 
assessed for various climate variables and combined to form a risk score. Subsequently, each 
risk score was then combined to provide a risk score representing a firm as a proxy for its 
relevant industry. 
Consequences were evaluated based on two criteria: 1) financial business loss, and 2) 
operational and service disruptions. These are summarized alongside all consequence criteria 
used in the PCCIA in Appendix 2.  
  
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 348  
Financial consequences were assessed based on the amount of business loss that a single firm 
might be expected to experience in relation to a single risk scenario (assessed as a % of annual 
company revenue). The Financial Consequences scale is presented in Table 9.3.

(assessed as a % of loss of function of asset or service). The Operational and Services Disruption 
consequence criteria is presented in Table 9.4.

Ontario businesses are susceptible to both direct and indirect climate impacts – direct impacts 
being those that result when climate variables interact with a businesses’ assets, operations, 
and service delivery, whereas indirect impacts are those that result when climate variables 
interact with systems (e.g. infrastructure, food, financial) that a business’ assets, operations, 
and service delivery are dependent upon. Illustrative consequences for Ontario firms are 
provided in Table 9.5. 
To robustly evaluate risks within the Business and Economy Area of Focus, direct and indirect 
impacts fall under the same type of evaluation based on the nature of evaluating impacts to 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 349  
industry, compared to other Areas of Focus assessing only direct physical impacts. In other 
words, risk scores reflect the ability of services to be continued or maintained in the event of a 
climate variable occurring, not the physical impact of the climate variable on the Level 1 or 2 
category itself. Consequently, the characterization of direct and indirect impacts is presented 
together for this Area of Focus. In addition, this approach has resulted in a low strength of 
evidence ranking for all climate scenarios, given the methods and available data to illustrate an 
“archetype” or “average” firm size to represent each Level 1 or 2 category.

9.6 Limitations of the Business and Economy Assessment 
Considerations and constraints for assessment of the Business and Economy Area of Focus are 
described briefly below. 
Interconnections and Interdependencies 
While there are examples in Ontario of interdependency mapping being conducted to advance 
understanding of the complexity of sectoral and industry interdependencies (e.g. electricity 
system; food system), there is little publicly available information about specific climate 
variables thresholds, and how these relationships translate into financial impacts at the firm-
level. In many cases, this information is jurisdictional or context-dependent and may not 
translate into a province-wide assessment. To acknowledge the importance of the 
interconnections between Areas of Focus, cross-sectoral impacts are described and mapped 
across various themes in Section 10.0. 
Socio-Economic Changes 
Ontario’s economy will evolve significantly over the mid to end of century. Demographic, 
technological, land-use, employment and other variables will change the socio-economic fabric 
of the province. Independent of climate change, these variables will undoubtedly shape the 
evolution of industries and the growth trajectory and risk profile of individual firms. Socio-
economic projections and indicators assessed as part of this PCCIA (described in Section 4.0 of 
this report) did not warrant quantitative changes in risk scores at the firm level for the Business 
and Economy Area of Focus. More specifically, all socio-economic categories and indicators 
were reviewed for possible alignment to a firm-level risk evaluation, but it was ultimately 
determined that insufficient alignment existed at the appropriate scale to warrant increasing 
future scores from a quantitative perspective. However, socio-economic changes and 
transitions relevant to several Business and Economy industries are described qualitatively in 
Section 10.0 (cross-sectoral impacts) and later in this section regarding adaptation priorities.

9.7 Current and Future Risks 
9.7.1 Accommodation and Food Services 
Overview 
Across Canada, there are over 117,000 establishments providing accommodation services 
and/or food services and drinking places, over 28,000 of which are based in Ontario and off 
employment. The vast majority of these businesses (e.g. 98.7% across Canada) have fewer than 
100 employees (Government of Canada, 2022a). The labour productivity index, an indicator of 
labour trends and the extent to which labour is “efficiently used” within the sector compared to 
the Canadian economy overall, decreased 16.6% between 2019 and 2020, compared to a 
decline of 7.5% for the Canadian economy (Government of Canada, 2022b). This could be 
indicative of relative decreases in real income and/or standard of living in relation to inflation 
and other economic sectors.  
Businesses involved in accommodation and food services are on the front lines, and this 
industry was one of the hardest hit by public safety measures put in place throughout the 
COVID-19 pandemic (Sood, 2021). For example, employment across Canada in this sector 
dropped over 55% from pre-pandemic levels and real GDP fell almost 40%. Over 85% of food 
services and drinking places experienced decreases in revenue in 2020 compared with 2019, 
with declines of 40% or more observed in Ontario, Quebec and Manitoba (Sood, 2021). Based 
on surveys conducted by Statistics Canada, the majority of businesses in this industry struggled 
to survive pandemic impacts and could not take on additional debt to stay solvent.  
Accommodation and Food Services are also intrinsically linked to tourism, which employs a 
large number of workers, with many often required to work long shifts that require physical 
exertion. Many jobs in the sector also require employees to provide heightened customer 
service standards to ensure that consumers (tourists) have a positive experience. A key 
challenge faced by the industry is the shortage of labour, including difficulties in recruiting. In 
Ontario, job vacancies remain high for Accommodation and Food Service (and Arts, 
Entertainment and Recreation – see Section 9.7.2) businesses.  
While total employment in Ontario has recovered to pre-pandemic levels, employment in 
Ontario’s tourism‐related industries remains well below 2019 levels. From January through 
December of 2022, employment in Ontario’s tourism‐related industries remained below 2019 
levels (down 9% or 71,000 jobs compared to Jan-December 2019) (Statistics Canada, 2022i). 
Employees of tourism-related businesses in Ontario are diverse. In addition to being a top 
employer of youth and students, tourism businesses also employ a larger proportion of women, 
part-time workers, Indigenous Peoples, visible minorities, non-permanent residents, and 
persons with difficulties or long-term conditions. As the tourism industry changes and responds 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 352  
to more extreme weather and climate change, this could deter future travel and impact the 
Accommodation and Food Services industry. Similarly, it is possible that consumer patterns may 
shift based on the idea of “responsible travel” to lighten carbon footprints, support local 
economies and engage in activities enabling environmental conservation (Destination Canada, 
2021).  
Direct and Indirect Impacts 
Accommodation and Food Service activities could be impacted by changes in extreme heat, 
higher average temperatures, drought, extreme precipitation, and wildfire. These weather 
events could lead to impacts in a variety of ways (Lucon et al., 2014; Zeuli et al., 2018a). 
Financial impacts to Accommodation and Food Service industries could lead to: 
- 
Loss & damage and decreased serviceable life to assets or infrastructure, materials and 
equipment businesses rely upon 
- 
Disruption and/or impairment to service productivity  
- 
Supply chain and logistics delays 
- 
Increased variability or reduction of key inputs and costs (e.g. materials, commodities, 
water, electricity, insurance) that can lead to higher operating costs or increased debt  
- 
Changes and/or variability in consumer demand for indoor/outdoor accommodation 
and food services 
- 
Health & safety impacts to staff and customers  
An example risk scenario for accommodation and food services is presented in Table 9.6, to 
provide a fuller picture of the risk scenarios considered for this Level 1 category. Risk profiles 
for this Level 1 category can be found in Table 9.7.

Impact to complex supply chain results in reduced 
availability of food commodities and financial effects for 
food service (quick serve and dine-in restaurants) 
companies. Interruption or failure of external power 
supply results in financial effects for both food service and 
accommodation industries, depending on duration of 
power interruption and existence of on-site back-up 
power generation capacity. 
Low 
 
Risk Results  
The risk profile associated with the financial impact to Accommodation and Food Services is 
rated ‘medium’, and not anticipated to significantly increase or decrease over time. These 
results (‘medium’ risk) are consistent regardless of whether emissions follow a high emissions 
scenario (RCP8.5) or a moderate emissions scenario (RCP4.5). However, the cascading risk of 
loss of commodities (e.g. food) or physical loss of infrastructure (e.g. inability to access/occupy 
or use infrastructure) were not quantitatively evaluated as part of this risk rating. Food and 
Agriculture risks are described in Section 5.0 of this report, and Infrastructure risks are 
described in Section 6.0. Therefore, these results can be considered the risk profile of a typical 
business within Ontario, which does not lose total access to the building in which services are 
provided nor total ability to provide their services. In reality, financial implications may increase 
in the future for accommodation and food services businesses, but in the quantitative 
assessment completed as part of the PCCIA, this was not considered to exceed 50% of annual 
business revenue (recall the consequence criteria used in evaluation, identified in Section 9.5 
and Appendix 2).  
If a total supply chain disruption were to occur, or infrastructure completely failed, risks could 
be much more significant or amplified with recovery taking several years, particularly in the 
future. These cross-sectoral and cascading impacts are characterized qualitatively in Section 
10.0 in the context of food security and impacts across the food system.

9.7.2 Arts, Entertainment and Recreation 
Overview 
The Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation sector is one of the smaller services-producing 
industries in the Ontario economy. It is comprised of businesses and services related to: 
performing arts, spectator sports and related industries; heritage institutions (e.g. museums, 
art galleries); and amusement, gambling and recreation industries. The latter (amusement, 
gambling, and recreation) is the largest within this sector, accounting for 61.5% of employment 
in 2017 (LMSID, 2022). This sector employed 172,100 people, or approximately 2.4% of the 
provincial workforce in 2017 (LMSID, 2022). Businesses and services provided in this industry 
contributed 0.8% to Ontario's gross domestic product (GDP) in the same year. Across Canada, 
the vast majority of arts, entertainment and recreation sector businesses employed under 100 
employees (96.9%) within 2021, bringing in an average annual revenue of $444,000 CAD 
(Government of Canada, 2022a).  
The labour productivity index, an indicator of labour trends and the extent to which labour is 
“efficiently used” within the sector compared to the Canadian economy overall, decreased 
12.5% between 2019 and 2020, compared to a decline of 7.5% for the Canadian economy 
(Government of Canada, 2022b). This could be indicative of relative decreases in real income 
and/or standard of living in relation to inflation and other economic sectors.  
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Ontario’s performing arts sector was among the first and 
hardest hit by public health restrictions. For example, GDP for live performance in Canada fell 
66.2% by quarter two of 2020 compared to quarter four of 2019, when it was $664 million. 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report

Similarly, employment in the live performance sector in Canada declined through to mid-2021. 
In 2021 it increased to 37.7% of pre-pandemic levels, however, these gains were wiped out by 
the measures implemented to contain a wave of the pandemic. Ontario is home to 66,000 
artists who live in all regions of the province, and this is an industry that is on the front lines in 
terms experiencing climate risks. Climate impacts in all regions of the province can impact 
Ontario’s Arts, Entertainment and Recreation industry.  
The Arts, Entertainment and Recreation sector has a higher ratio of employees who work part 
time compared to the Ontario average and is relatively unique in comparison to other 
industries. It has several types of businesses that are highly seasonal, such as amusement parks 
and golf clubs during the summer months, and ski resorts in the winter months. Tourism from 
within Canada and the United States also plays a significant role in its success and economic 
contribution to Ontario’s overall economy. For instance, the strength of the U.S. economy and 
the exchange rate between the Canadian and the American dollar may help or hinder tourist 
expenditures, particularly due to U.S.'s proximity to Ontario (LMSID, 2022). Average household 
debt and disposable income, in many cases tied to the success of Ontario and Canada’s 
economy more broadly, also influences the extent to which residents and tourists may be 
willing to spend on Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation-related activities.  
Ontario is home to the largest volume of sport and recreation facilities in Canada (Canada Parks 
and Recreation Association, 2020) and extreme weather and climate impacts such as flooding 
(paired with aging building infrastructure) could result in damage to the interiors of a significant 
number of community sport and recreation facilities impacting the delivery of, and access to, 
sport and recreation services.  
Regionally, certain areas of Ontario contribute particularly strongly to the Arts, Entertainment, 
and Recreation industry. For example, Southwest Ontario (e.g. Niagara) and central Ontario 
(e.g. Toronto) attract significant numbers of tourists due to cultural and heritage institutions, 
sporting events and casinos. Central Ontario also depends on business-related travel to a 
greater degree than other regions across the province, with 29% of visitor spending in Tourism 
Region 5 (Greater Toronto Area) in 2019 being generated by business travel compared to 19% 
in Ontario as a whole) (Statistics Canada, 2021d, Statistics Canada, 2022h). Eastern Ontario (e.g. 
Ottawa) attracts international visitors and tourists related to seeing Canada’s capital and the 
parliament buildings. Northern Ontario tends to attract tourists from Ontario and the United 
States, with American visitors particularly important to businesses in the Northwest region (e.g. 
in 2019, US visitor spending accounted for 42% of total visitor spending in Northwest Ontario, 
compared to 17% in Ontario as a whole) (Statistics Canada, 2021d; 2022h). Key resource-based 
attractions in the North include boating, fishing, hunting, and camping. Resource-based tourism

is described in further detail in Section 9.7.6 under the Forestry, Fishing and Hunting Economies 
for northern Ontario.  
Direct and Indirect Impacts 
Indoor and outdoor Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation could be impacted by changes in 
extreme and mean temperatures, Growing Degree Days, mean and extreme precipitation, 
Moisture Deficit or drought, and wildfire. These events and conditions directly and/or indirectly 
could lead to financial impacts in the Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation industries in 
numerous ways (Scott, 2003; Bruce, 2009):  
- 
Loss & damage and decreased serviceable life to assets or infrastructure, materials and 
equipment businesses rely upon 
- 
Disruption and/or impairment to service productivity  
- 
Supply chain and logistics delays 
- 
Increased variability or reduction of key inputs and costs (e.g. materials, commodities, 
water, electricity, insurance) that can lead to higher operating costs or increased debt  
- 
Changes and/or variability in consumer demand for indoor/outdoor accommodation 
and food services 
- 
Health & safety impacts staff, customers, sport and recreation participants.  
These impacts may be particularly pronounced in certain regions of Ontario, or even occur in a 
different region of the province but lead to indirect impacts on Arts, Entertainment, and 
Recreational services. For example, increasing extreme heat may lead to a more difficult (and 
costly) process to create snow for ski hills in certain areas in Ontario, particularly in the mid to 
late Century. This warming may deter tourists and residents traveling to other regions of the 
province to enjoy recreational activities. Similarly, and as observed through the COVID19 
pandemic, Ontario and/or Canadian-specific policies or health measures impact certain sectors 
more than others. Arts, entertainment, and recreation services may be particularly impacted 
given the importance of expenditures from tourists and consumers.  
Climate change may also create additional pressures to maintain facilities resulting in increased 
costs, especially for outdoor fields. As climate change worsens and threatens to disrupt sports 
competitions, the suitability of regions to host large sport/recreation events may decrease 
further impacting tourism and the economy. 
An illustrative risk scenario for arts, entertainment and recreation is presented in Table 9.8, to 
provide a picture of the type of scenarios assessed for this Level 1 category. Risk profiles for this 
Level 1 category can be found in Table 9.9.

recreation resulting from climate hazards can also reduce 
annual revenue for sport and recreation entities and 
organizations as they would no longer be functioning at 
normal levels. 
Low 
 
Risk Results  
The Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation services category has current climate risks rated 
‘medium’ in most regions of Ontario and these are expected to increase to ‘high’ by mid-
century (2050s) and end of century (2080s). These increases in risk occur regardless of how fast 
greenhouse gas emissions are mitigated (e.g. RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 both indicate increasing risks 
for this industry). Regionally, a slight difference was determined for Central Ontario, which is 
already rated a ‘high’ risk. This elevated risk currently in Central Ontario may be indicative of 
the significant contribution that the Greater Golden Horseshoe and Greater Toronto Area has in 
relation to this industry (e.g. sporting events, concerts, amusement services, gambling 
institutions and racetracks, etc.). In other words, if a weather event or a change in a climate 
variable were to lead to an impact in Central Ontario in the short term (e.g. in Toronto), the 
financial consequence of that impact may be greater than if it were to occur in Eastern Ontario 
due to the increased density of Arts, Entertainment and Recreational services.

9.7.3 Information and Cultural Industries 
Overview 
Information and Cultural Industries comprise establishments primarily engaged in producing or 
distributing information and cultural products, the value of which is contained in their 
information, educational entertainment, or cultural content (Statistics Canada, 2021g). Major 
components of these industries include publishing, motion picture and sound recording, 
broadcasting, telecommunications and data processing and hosting services. In 2021, there 
were over 48,000 businesses across Canada considered a part of these industries, with an 
average revenue of $389,000 CAD (Government of Canada, 2022c).  
In 2020, these industries saw a decline in growth by 3.5% over the previous year, in comparison 
to the Canadian economy which decreased 1.8%. Notably, these numbers, in part, reflect the 
impact of COVID-19, which was particularly significant on information, culture, arts, 
entertainment and recreational activities in 2020 (Bernard and McMaster, 2021). As an 
example, motion picture and video exhibition businesses lost 69% of their operating revenue in 
2020 due to restrictions from COVID-19, one of the most significant losses across all industries 
in Canada at that time. Similarly, book publishing in Ontario lost 5.7% of their operating 
revenue, though this impact was much more significant in other provinces and territories of 
Canada.  
Ontario has the largest cultural industries sector in the country, accounting for almost half of all 
cultural industries GDP in Canada (Ontario Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport, 2022a). 
Ontario is also among North America’s top entertainment and media economies, ranking third 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 359  
in employment (behind only California and New York) (Ontario Ministry of Tourism, Culture and 
Sport, 2010).  
The economic activity generated by the cultural industries reflects the shift from industrial-
based to knowledge-based economies in Ontario. The majority of Information and Cultural 
Industries are small enterprises, many of which lack access to capital to grow their businesses.  
Direct and Indirect Impacts  
From a climate change perspective, information and cultural activities could be impacted from 
various climate hazards, including changes in extreme temperatures, extreme precipitation, and 
wildfire. These changes could lead to financial impacts on the Information and Cultural 
Industries in several ways:  
- 
Loss and damage and decreased serviceable life to assets/infrastructure that is used by 
businesses within the industry – particularly if those are unique (e.g. movie film sets) 
that could be challenging to find alternatives for  
- 
Changes to availability or decreased lifespan of materials and equipment and disruption 
or impairment to service productivity  
- 
Supply chain and/or logistics delays in support of Information and Cultural Industries  
- 
Reduction or increased variability of key inputs and costs (e.g. materials, commodities, 
water, electricity, insurance) that Information and Cultural Industries rely upon  
- 
Increased variability in consumer demand for indoor/outdoor cultural services and 
entertainment, which in turn could cause financial impacts (e.g. music venue revenue 
loss in the event of shutdowns due to extreme weather or need for infrastructure 
repair) 
- 
Health and safety impacts to staff and customers  
An illustrative risk scenario for information and cultural industries is presented in Table 9.10. 
Further detail on the risk profiles relevant to this category, with more information on how the 
magnitude of the risks vary by region and timeframe (operating under RCP8.5) is provided in 
Table 9.11, at the end of the section. Appendix 7 provides risk scores for both RCP4.5 and 
RCP8.5 emission scenarios.

Low  
 
Risk Results  
Climate change risks to Information and Cultural Industries were evaluated from the 
perspectives of a) financial loss and b) disruption to businesses continuity. In many cases, 
businesses within this sector rely on infrastructure, buildings, venues, studios, and numerous 
other assets to sustain operation. For example, if an extreme precipitation event (short or one 
of longer duration) were to occur in the spring season and lead to flooding and subsequent 
infiltration of water into the industrial building, the risk scenario would also include loss of all 
basement and ground-level contents. Under a scenario with significant loss of contents and 
access/ function disruption (but not failure), disruption to services will be significant for a 
period of time – potentially for weeks to a month - to allow for drying, mould treatment and 
repairs where needed. Some important assumptions were made in scenario evaluations. For 
instance, it was assumed that most buildings in use by Information and Cultural Industries are 
not located within a floodplain or have implemented maintenance and condition assessments, 
and that municipal sewer infrastructure is designed to withstand significant precipitation 
events.   
Under current conditions, climate risks have been evaluated as ‘low’ for these industries, 
regardless of region of Ontario. In the future, it is expected that climate risks will increase to 
‘medium’ across all regions of the province – regardless of how quickly greenhouse gas 
emissions are mitigated. This increasing risk profile reflects extreme weather events and/or 
impacts to businesses within this sector where financial losses or service disruption may 
become more frequent due to climate change.

9.7.4 Construction  
Overview 
Construction is a pivotal industry across Canada, employing more than 1.4 million people 
nationwide, and contributing 7.5% of Canada’s GDP. As defined by NAICS, Ontario’s 
construction industry comprises any establishment primarily engaged in constructing, repairing, 
and renovating buildings, including engineering works and developing land. There are three 
subsectors, including 1) construction of buildings, 2) heavy and civil engineering construction, 
and 3) specialty trade contractors. A significant number of construction work is performed by 
enterprises primarily engaged in businesses other than construction – and these are not 
typically considered or reported upon in statistics surrounding this industry (Statistics Canada, 
2021g).  
As economic conditions were challenged in 2020, the construction industry was one of the few 
in Ontario that continued to grow. Ontario’s construction industry grew by 0.3% compared to 
2019, which represents approximately $50.9 billion or 7.2% of the province’s GDP in 2020 
(Building, 2021). As of 2021, construction employment was comprised of 29% residential 
renovations and maintenance, 26% new housing, 17% engineering, 16% industrial, commercial, 
and institutional (ICI) construction, and 11% non-residential maintenance (Build Force Canada, 
2021). However, as recovery is ongoing, the construction industry is still hampered by the rising 
costs of raw materials, labour shortages, and schedule and price increases brought on by the 
widespread disruption to global supply chains (Dentons, 2021).  
Following a modest decline in 2020 (e.g. due to supply chain and COVID-19 impacts), 
construction is expected to recover and continue growing in Ontario. The disruptions brought 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 362  
on by the COVID-19 pandemic have moderated the anticipated rapid rise in construction 
demand over the short term, but it did not reduce labour market challenges, which are a 
material risk moving forward for this industry. Driven by significant demand for infrastructure, 
housing, public transit, utility, mining, and ICI construction is expected to continue to grow and 
peak in 2026. Associated with this demand, employment is Ontario’s construction industry is 
expected to rise by almost 24,000 workers (up 6%) over 2020 levels (Build Force, 2021). An 
aging labour force is also important to note, as over the next decade Ontario is expected to see 
more than 92,500 workers retire, representing 21% of the current labour force. 
Regionally, Southwest Ontario is facing increasing recruitment challenges, due in part to large 
infrastructure projects underway such as refurbishment work at the Bruce Power nuclear plant, 
upgrades to the Gordie Howe International Bridge in Windsor, and the Nova Chemicals plant in 
Sarnia. Central Ontario is expected to grow significantly to meet residential and non-residential 
construction demands such as transit projects and work at the Ontario Power Generation 
Darlington nuclear refurbishment project. Construction activity in Eastern Ontario is expected 
to pick up pace due to the second phase of Ottawa’s light rail transit (LRT) project and the 
redevelopment of Parliament Hill’s Centre Block. In Northern Ontario, major mining and utility 
construction projects and a moderate increase in residential construction indicate a rising 
employment peaking in 2023, then declining as projects reach completion and weaker 
renovation demands drive residential activities lower. All together across Ontario, competing 
demands for construction are expected to limit potential for intra-provincial labour mobility to 
meet peak requirements in the short term (Build Force, 2021). An example risk scenario for 
construction is presented in Table 9.12. Risk profiles for this Level 1 category can be found in 
Table 9.13, at the end of this section.

Direct and Indirect Impacts 
Ontario’s construction industry is confronted with several challenges. There is a need to rapidly 
decrease greenhouse emissions on a global and local scale which has translated into increased 
pressure on this sector to adopt low carbon resilience principles. At the same time, the 
construction industry is exposed to climate hazards leading to physical impacts– such as 
extreme weather impacting construction sites, water shortages, and deteriorating 
environmental conditions with increasing temperatures (Muller et al., 2020). Construction 
activities can also be impacted by changes in extreme heat, mean and extreme precipitation, 
drought, and wildfire (CMIC, 2017; Naude, 2020). 
These changes which could lead to financial impacts in the construction industry in the 
following ways:  
- 
Loss and damage to materials and equipment or rising prices for materials 
- 
Supply chain and logistics delays 
- 
Disruption and/or impairment to service productivity and schedule delays  
- 
Changes, reduction or variability of key industrial inputs and costs (e.g. materials, water, 
electricity, insurance) 
- 
Health & safety impacts on staff 
Supply chains are complex and climate-related impacts to one or more chain components could 
result in reduced availability of construction inputs or materials and small to moderate short-
term financial effects for construction and engineering companies. Interruption or failure of 
external power supply could also result in small to moderate short-term financial effects for 
construction industries, depending on duration of power interruption and existence of on-site 
back-up power generation capacity.  
Risk Results  
Based upon the PCCIA methodology, financial consequences were evaluated within the risk 
scores (described previously in Section 9.5). For example, in the event of a climate variable’s 
magnitude or frequency leading to an impact, business service could be impaired for a short 
period of time and consequently lost revenue. This example and these results reflect the level 
of risk associated with one firm in the construction industry, and do not incorporate 
quantitative considerations associated with cascading impacts across supply chains. In other 
words, these can be considered a baseline risk for companies that could be exacerbating by 
systems-level impacts and interdependencies. Thus, it would be beneficial to undertake a 
systems-level assessment focused on the amplification of risks to Ontario’s construction 
industry, and other businesses described in this Area of Focus. 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 364  
Risk results for construction across Ontario are currently rated as ‘low’ across every region. In 
the future, it is anticipated that these risks will increase in every region of the province except 
the Far North where risks remain consistent (e.g. reflecting limited construction activities in 
that region and differing rates of change in climatic conditions). In every other region, climate 
risks are expected to increase to ‘medium’ by the end of century under a high emissions 
scenario (RCP8.5). In contrast, if greenhouse gas emissions are able to be mitigated to be in line 
with the RCP4.5 scenario (moderate emissions), climate risks are expected to remain somewhat 
similar to their current levels for companies in Ontario’s construction industry. See Appendix 7 
for risk scores under RCP4.5

9.7.5 Financial and Insurance  
Overview 
Financial and Insurance Level 1 category broadly covers any establishment primarily engaging in 
financial intermediation. NAICS describes these activities as raising funds by taking deposits 
and/or issuing securities, and, in the process, incurring liabilities, which they use to acquire 
financial assets by making loans and/or purchasing securities. In this case, financial 
establishments expose themselves to risk, and channel funds from lenders to borrowers and 
transform or repackage the funds with respect to maturity, scale, and risk (Government of 
Canada, 2022a). Finance and Insurance also include establishments involved in pooling risk by 
underwriting annuities and insurance, and those charged with monetary control (e.g. monetary 
authorities). 
Across Canada, the Finance and Insurance sector has outpaced growth averages in all other 
industries between 2011 and 2020 (The Conference Board of Canada, 2021b). A report released 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 365  
by the Conference Board of Canada identifies that the 10-year average GDP growth rate was 
roughly 3.6% for Finance and Insurance, compared to about 1.5% for other industries, and that 
the City of Toronto is leading in this industry across the country (The Conference Board of 
Canada, 2021b). In 2020, Finance and Insurance was the third largest contributor to Canada’s 
GDP, after real estate and manufacturing. 
In Ontario, the financial services industry generates approximately $63 billion in GDP and 
employs roughly 365,000 people (Invest Ontario, 2022). Concentrated in the City of Toronto, 
North America’s second largest financial services hub, financial services are provided by 12,000 
financial services firms. Canada’s four largest banks, three of the top five largest Canadian 
insurers, two of the top 20 global pension funds, eight of the 10 largest Canadian asset 
managers, and the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) are all located within Toronto and represents 
the significance this industry to Ontario and across Canada.  
From an insurance perspective, property and casualty insurance is particularly relevant 
considering their exposure to physical climate risks. Over 192 private property and casualty 
insurers compete across Canada. The Insurance Bureau of Canada identified that property 
insurance claims have risen over the last decade, as a percentage of total claims (from 28% in 
2010 to almost 34% in 2020) (IBC, 2021a). Home insurance rates have also grown more than 
the rate of inflation, with Ontario home insurance premiums rising 64%, possibly tied to 
increasing extreme weather events and climate change (Berkow, 2021).  
In Central Ontario, Toronto accounts for the most significant share (68%) of employment in 
Ontario’s Finance and Insurance industry, driven by growing technology clusters and 
subsequent employment needs. In Southwest Ontario, Kitchener-Waterloo also has high 
employment in this sector due to high presence of large insurance companies. However, some 
indications suggest that restructuring and consolidation of large financial institutions may lead 
to weakening employment or a somewhat smaller footprint in this region (LMSID, 2022). 
Illustrative risk scenarios for finance and insurance industries are presented in Table 9.14. Risk 
profiles for Level 2 categories assessed under finance and insurance can be found in Table 9.15, 
at the end of this section.

resulting from risk sharing/transfer contracts in place 
between insurers and re-insurers.

Low 
 
Direct and Indirect Impacts 
The impacts associated with climate change are particularly nuanced and complex in the 
Finance and Insurance industry, in part because companies consider, model and price risk as 
part of their products. The extent to which current physical climate risks have been factored 
into financial products, markets, and financial portfolios varies. An international survey 
conducted in October 2019, focused on integrating climate risk into institutional portfolio 
management, identified that only 38% of respondents had translated climate risk impacts into 
financial valuation of assets, and those that undertook a materiality analysis to determine if 
climate risk influences asset performance largely identified flooding, sea level rise, drought, 
wildfire, and windstorms as key hazards (Moudrak et al., 2020). A study focused on U.S. real 
estate identified that future perception of risk has a major role in determining the extent to 
which climate risk will influence real estate pricing, depending on belief systems (Baldauf et al., 
2020). 
What is clear, however, is that companies spanning most financial industry sectors will 
experience disruptions to the continuity of their operations due to physical climate impacts 
(Feltmate et al., 2020). For example, extreme precipitation resulting in flooding and cascading 
impacts to the supply chain could subsequently impact a company’s cash flow, and the 
disclosure of this information would be required as part of a company’s fiduciary duty. While 
best practices to integrate climate risk into investment management are not yet well 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 367  
established, some studies are beginning to identify the direct financial impacts of extreme 
weather on valuation. Addoum et al., (2019) have shown that extreme temperatures can 
adversely affect corporate earnings, and Kruttli et al., (2019) document that extreme weather 
can be reflected in stock and option market prices. 
From a residential real estate perspective, impacts of flooding on housing were evaluated 
across several Canadian municipalities by the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation (Bakos et al., 
2022). The authors found that, on average, sales prices dropped by 8.2%, days on the market 
increased by 19.8% and 44.3% fewer houses were listed for sale comparing those impacted by a 
flood to those not impacted. As a practical example, a house that would sell at a price of 
$713,500 would be sold for $55,507 less at $654,993 if it were to be catastrophically flooded. 
Mortgages, on the other hand, are more complex and no material or consistent impacts were 
found comparing pre- and post-flood impacts on arrears and deferrals (Bakos et al., 2022). 
Evidence also suggests that borrowers (e.g. municipalities in Ontario) likely to be impacted by 
climate change are going to be paying more in underwriting fees and initial yields in issuing 
long-term municipal bonds (Painter, 2018). This is particularly important for issuing long-term 
securities, rather than short-term bonds, implying that future climate risks have not factored 
into pricing, products, and other services. This is particularly important for Ontario 
municipalities as there will be higher issuance costs for bonds with lower credit ratings, and 
credit ratings are increasingly being tied to risk disclosure and demonstration of resilient 
investments.  
Insurance Carriers and Related Activities 
Insurance carrier activities could be impacted by changes in climate variables (e.g. extreme 
events and mean conditions) that directly affect financial counterparties (insurance 
policyholders). These changes could lead to financial impacts on the insurance industry in the 
following ways (Kovacs, 2020):  
- 
reduced financial institution returns and underwriting performance due to counterparty 
climate -related risk and loss (e.g. increasing insurance claims paid out which is expected 
to double over the next 10 years from $2.1 billion to $5 billion) 
- 
loss and damage associated with physical impacts to infrastructure 
- 
increased costs and decreased serviceable/economic life of owned assets (e.g. office 
buildings) 
- 
health & safety impacts to staff and customers 
Indirect financial risks from single extreme event basis may apply to a relatively small 
proportion of a single insurer/’e-insurer's overall financial exposures, though this amount of 
exposure will vary significantly depending on the type of financial peril, geographic 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 368  
concentration of policy holders relative to spatial location of the single climate risk event, and 
the degree of final exposure resulting from risk sharing/transfer contracts in place between 
insurers and re-insurers.  
The ability of insurance providers to change coverage, underwriting policy and pricing based 
upon their exposure (now and in the future) enables a higher degree of flexibility to recover 
financially from climate impacts. For example, the Insurance Institute of Canada identify that 
the property and casualty insurance industry has already adapted its underwriting practices and 
response to sustained high severe weather damage claims, as well as lower interest rates, and 
now consistently reports a modest overall underwriting profit (Kovacs, 2020). The industry has 
also adapted to the sustained increase in the volume of claims by increasing its response 
capacity.  
Monetary, Credit, Securities, Funds and Other Financial Vehicles 
Monetary, credit, securities, funds and other financial vehicle activities can be impacted by 
changes in various climate variables (e.g. extreme events and mean conditions) that could 
directly affect financial counterparties (credit, equity, debt). These changes could lead to 
financial impacts in the monetary, credit, securities, funds & other financial vehicle industry in 
the following ways:  
- 
Reduced financial institution returns and credit performance due to counterparty 
climate-related risk and loss 
- 
Loss & damage associated with physical damage to buildings and infrastructure  
- 
Increased utility and insurance costs  
- 
Decreased serviceable life to owned assets (e.g. office buildings)  
- 
Health & safety impacts to staff and customers 
The complexity of risk sharing and transfer arrangements in place with financial counterparties 
also suggests that flow-through of financial risk exposure to banking and fund managers could 
be lower than in an unmitigated exposure scenario. To an extent, the ability of financial 
institutions to change, update and increase pricing and products based upon their exposure 
(now and in the future) enables the ability for this industry to recover from climate impacts. 
Risk Results  
Based upon the PCCIA methodology, risks were quantitatively evaluated for a single climate 
event or scenario leading to financial loss for one typical firm. The results of this analysis 
indicate ‘medium’ risk now and increase to ‘high’ in future time periods across all regions. It is 
critical that these results not be interpreted that the finance and insurance sector will not be 
facing increasing physical risks. This is because quantitative scoring in this case do not reflect 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 369  
increasingly impactful tipping points, cascading impacts, and systemic risks posed to the 
Finance and Insurance industry.  
It is very plausible that in the future, increasing frequency and continued exposure of the 
Finance and Insurance industry results in year-over-year losses that continue to mount resulting 
in a loss of confidence, devaluation, or other financial implications. This may lead to shifting 
product pricing or coverage in certain geographic regions or depending upon the policy context. 
In an Insurance Regulator State of Climate Risks Survey conducted by Deloitte, more than half 
of the United States insurance regulators indicate that climate change is likely to have a high or 
extremely high impact on coverage availability and underwriting assumptions, and that risks 
will likely increase over time due to liability risks, transition risks and physical risks (Deloitte, 
2019).  
An industry-wide systemic risk assessment would evaluate other categories of consequence as 
well as the interdependences between the Finance and Insurance industry and other sectors in 
the face of a climate change (e.g. coverage, policy assumptions, equitable coverage, and pricing 
of premiums).

9.7.6 Forestry, Fishing and Hunting Economies 
Overview 
Forestry, Fishing, and Hunting Economies is comprised of two distinct sub-sectors and will be 
described separately for the purpose of this report. 
Fishing, Hunting and Trapping 
The Fishing and Hunting Economy is comprised of activities and establishments primarily 
involved in hunting, trapping, fishing, and sport-shooting. These activities are an important part 
of culture, tradition, and personal identity for many residents and Indigenous Communities 
across Ontario and Canada, as well as provide a source of sustenance. A recent survey and 
report by the Conference Board of Canada quantified the economic footprint of fishing, 
hunting, trapping and sport-shooting activities. Their analysis estimated that these contributed 
$4.7 billion to Ontario’s GDP in 2018 and supported 36,900 jobs (Lombardo, 2020; The 
Conference Board of Canada, 2019). It should be acknowledged that the values from this study 
have been suggested to be overestimated as a result of study design and methods applied.  
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 371  
Based on 2018 data for Ontario, Fishing and Hunting expenditures account for almost 90% of 
total spending across the four activities. Ontario also has 37% of all anglers in Canada, 33% of 
the country’s hunters, 21% of the country’s trappers and 26% of all Canadian recreational sport 
shooters (Conference Board of Canada., 2019).  
Fishing, Hunting, and Trapping activities were all impacted by COVID-19 restrictions and were 
exhibited by the closure of access to natural areas and provincial parks as well as loss of non-
resident licence fees border restrictions between Canada and the U.S. The Ontario Federation 
of Anglers and Hunters identifies that it will be a long road to recovery for this industry, and 
that there continues to be a need for promotion of fishing and hunting to encourage domestic 
participation and tourism, investments in natural and green infrastructure to support 
sustainable activities and removal of regulatory barriers for sustainable fishing and hunting 
opportunities to maximize participation and support conservation-related jobs (Lombardo, 
2020). 
Forestry, Fishing and Hunting Economies play a key role in tourism across Ontario, and 
particularly in northern regions. Resource-based tourism relies upon crown lands, waters, and 
natural resources to attract domestic and international visitors to enjoy activities such as 
hunting, fishing, camping, hiking, visiting reserves and parks, and viewing wildlife (Ontario 
Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport, 2022b). In northern Ontario, tourism generates 
approximately $1.6 billion annually and the region welcomes approximately 9.2 million visitors 
each year (Destination Northern Ontario, 2022). Sustainable and continued access to these 
resources is critical for the success of resource-based tourism. However, climate change is 
expected to impact terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and thereby lead to cascading impacts 
on the resource-based tourism sector. Risks are characterized in further detail in the Natural 
Environment section of this report. For example, if wildfire were to impact significant areas of 
crown lands where camping, hiking and other activities occur, revenue would be reduced or 
lost if access and safety concerns lead to closure of natural areas. Similarly, climate change 
could lead to changes in distribution and ranges of species, which may change the ability of 
visitors to participate in hunting or enjoy other resource-based activities in northern Ontario.  
Recreational Fishing and Hunting are discussed more in depth in the Natural Environment 
section of this report (Section 7.7.7) as part of ecosystem cultural services and nature-based 
recreation. Indigenous food and agriculture, including fishing, hunting and trapping, is further 
described in the People and Communities Area of Focus (Section 8.7.4) of this report.  
Forestry and Logging 
This subsector comprises establishments primarily engaged in managing and harvesting timber 
on a long production cycle (generally 60-90 years). Long production cycles use different 
production processes than short production cycles and are much more dependent on long-term 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 372  
planning and multi-purpose investments in infrastructure. Ontario’s forests consist of a variety 
of species such as spruce, pine, poplar, birch, oak and maple that support a broad range of in-
demand products such as lumber, pulp, furniture, flooring, oriented strand board, plywood, 
veneer and wood pellets (Invest Ontario, 2019).  
In 2021, over 12,000 establishments were primarily engaged in Forestry and Logging activities, 
bringing in an average revenue of $490,000 CAD, but ranging from $30,000 to $5 million CAD 
(Government of Canada, 2022a). The Forestry and Logging industry also contributed 
significantly to Canadian exports. On average over the past five years, Ontario exported almost 
$6.5 billion (CAD) in forest products around the world, accounting for over 96% of the 
province’s total wood product exports (Invest Ontario, 2019; Watkins, 2022). Between 2019 
and 2020 in Ontario; however, the gross domestic product (GDP) associated with Forestry and 
Logging declined by 2.7% (Government of Canada, 2022a). Approximately 20,000 kilometres of 
primary and secondary forest roads are maintained, and approximately 4,000 kilometres of 
new road systems (mainly operational roads) are constructed each year to provide access to 
the province’s forest resources. 
Forestry road infrastructure (e.g. roads, bridges, and culverts on Crown land) plays a critical role 
in the forestry and logging industry, with primary roads, branch roads and operational road 
access providing critical access and enabling economic development in Ontario’s forests 
(Ontario Ministry of Northern Development, 2022b). While primarily used by industrial vehicles 
engaged in forestry, mining, oil and gas or agriculture operations, these infrastructure systems 
also provide a portion of rural infrastructure across Ontario that can be used in emergency 
preparedness and response. Other uses can also include tourism operators, utility and railway 
companies, Indigenous Communities, hunters, anglers, campers, trappers, cottagers, and the 
general public (Ontario Ministry of Northern Development, 2022b). Typically, forest roads are 
maintained by Sustainable Forest Licence Holders through obligations set out in Forest 
Management Plans (FMPs).  
Forestry road infrastructure not only enables the transportation of harvested trees but also 
provides for forestry renewal – replacing forests after they have been harvested with new 
species, maintaining and caring for forests and planted species, and enabling adaptive 
management (Ontario Ministry of Northern Development, 2022c). For example, forest roads 
are used for technicians to assess newly planted trees and to move in tending crews to enable 
species diversity, health, and success in a changing climate (Steer, 2021).

Illustrative risk scenarios that were assessed for this Level 1 category can be found in Table 
9.16. Table 9.17 provides the risk profiles for each Level 2 category assessed under Forestry, 
Fishing and Hunting Economies, at the end of this section.

Fishing,

Changes in climate regime lead to changes in terrestrial and 
freshwater species distribution and also timing of biological 
events (spawning, larval life cycles, zooplankton availability) 
that impact commercial fishing, hunting and trapping 
companies (e.g. introduction of new species, disease 
proliferation, non-native species displacement of native 
species). Extent of an individual business’ financial exposure 
may depend on the nature of ecosystem changes, 
geographic location of changes, timing (annual, seasonal) 
and duration/persistence (temporary/permanent). 
Low 
Forestry and 
Logging 
Changes in climate regime can impact forestry and logging 
companies due to changes in the abundance and 
distribution of coniferous and deciduous tree species (forest 
extent) resulting in increase/decrease in volume and quality 
of potential supply of timber products (impacts to tree 
health). Wildfire could result in stoppage of 
industrial/commercial logging operations, and potential loss 
of merchantable timber.  
Low 
 
Direct and Indirect Impacts 
Ontario’s forestry, fishing and hunting economies have significant exposure to climate hazards, 
and the impacts from climate change on these economies will be wide-ranging. In some cases 
other Areas of Focus (e.g. Natural Environment, Infrastructure) have assessed physical impacts 
and risks that are relevant to this industry. For example, climate risks to cold water fish are 
evaluated to be currently high and rising to very high by mid-century. Likewise, risks to wood 
supplies are rated medium currently but rising to high risks by 2050. Coniferous and deciduous 
forest risks are also characterized in the Natural Environment Area of Focus, and additional 
details are provided in Section 7.7.4 of this report. For the purposes of Business and Economy 
risk characterization, risks are evaluated based upon possible financial loss associated with the 
economies of forestry, fishing, and hunting. 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 374  
In many cases, these economies produce goods upstream of other businesses that then 
develop or manufacture products for consumer use downstream (e.g. pulp and paper 
manufacturing rely upon raw materials provided through forest harvesting).  
Climate change is anticipated to lead to changes to businesses in these industries in the 
following ways:  
- 
loss and damage to assets, infrastructure, materials, and equipment  
- 
disrupt or impair companies’ ability to produce goods or services and schedule delays,  
- 
create supply chain or logistics delays 
- 
reduction or change key industrial inputs and costs (e.g. materials, commodities, water, 
electricity, insurance) 
- 
cause health and safety impacts to staff 
Climate impacts are characterized briefly for each of the Level 2 industries below.  
Fishing, Hunting and Trapping 
Changes in climate could lead to changes in terrestrial and freshwater species distribution and 
shifts to the timing of biological events (spawning, larval life cycles, zooplankton availability) 
that could affect the commercial fishing, hunting, and trapping industries (Browne and Hunt, 
2007). These changes could include, for example, the introduction of new species, disease 
proliferation, non-native or invasive species and displacement of native species). The extent of 
financial exposure would be dependent on the nature of ecosystem changes, geographic 
location of changes, timing (annual, seasonal) and duration or persistence of the impacts 
(temporary/permanent).  
Forestry and Logging 
Changes in climate may have a highly uncertain impact on the abundance and distribution of 
coniferous and deciduous tree species (e.g. forest extent) resulting in increase/decrease in 
volume and quality of potential supply of timber products (impacts to tree health) (Goetz et al., 
2015; Natural Resources Canada, 2020b). Each of these are further described and characterized 
as part of the Natural Environment Area of Focus in Section 7.7.4. Warmer temperatures 
(including increase in average winter temperature) could lead to reductions in cold-associated 
mortality of insect and other pest populations and increase in damaging effects of pests and 
disease (tree damage and mortality, loss of timber quantity and quality). Warmer temperatures 
could also lead to an increase in invasive flora and fauna, resulting in threats to native 
woodland and forest ecosystem. Drought could affect tree health, growth, and productivity - 
potentially further exacerbated by pest and pathogen stresses. Lastly, change in wildfire extent 
or the frequency of forest fires could affect volume of supply of timber products. In both cases, 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 375  
impacts may slow the growth rate of timber products, reduce supply across Ontario’s forests 
and elevate prices based on rising demand for domestic and international exports.  
Climate impacts can also impact forestry road systems that underpin the ability for companies 
to harvest, transport, plant, maintain and manage forests across Ontario. Forest roads are not 
built or maintained to the same level of service or standard as paved public roads (e.g. gravel 
surfaces, only one lane wide, brush limiting visibility, tight curves, etc.). For example, extreme 
precipitation can lead to flooding of forest roads, resulting in undermining surfaces, erosion or 
washouts and the inability to access certain forest management units (Government of British 
Columbia, 2021). Wildfires can prevent visibility of forest roads if smoke is heavy or may pose 
hazardous conditions for operations if nearby. In these cases, impacts may result in a delayed 
access, or total loss of access to certain areas of forests for harvesting and management 
activities, which can result in a loss of revenue for businesses, as well as cascading impacts to 
businesses downstream and reliant upon forest products.  
Forestry management practices and risks to Ontario’s terrestrial ecosystems are described in 
more detail in Section 7.7.4 of this report.  
Risk Results  
The risk profile associated with financial impacts to forestry, fishing, and hunting economies 
both for Forestry and Logging, and Fishing, Hunting and Trapping, are rated ‘high’. Risks are 
already considered ‘high’ across every region of the province, in light of the exposure these 
industries have to climate conditions and the possible proliferation of widespread or 
particularly significant impacts. Risks are anticipated to remain ‘high’ regardless of how quickly 
greenhouse gas emissions are mitigated, and this is reflected in these industries having ‘high’ 
risk under RCP8.5 (high emissions) and RCP4.5 (moderate emissions) scenarios in future time 
periods.  
A ‘high’ risk is associated with climate impacts that drive significant loss and/or impairment of 
business activity in these sectors for an extended period of time (e.g. months or seasonal 
implications). Furthermore, impacts may lead to a medium to high proportion of annual 
revenue loss, especially if impacts to the species for which these economies rely upon are 
impacted (e.g. availability or distribution). The forestry, fishing, and hunting economies are 
strongly dependent on the state of Ontario’s natural environment as well as built 
infrastructure, which are addressed in Sections 6.0 and 7.0, and provide additional information 
about types and scale of risks these industries will face.

9.7.7 Manufacturing  
Overview 
Manufacturing in Ontario refers to any establishment primarily involved in the physical or 
chemical transformation of materials or substances into products, which may be finished for 
consumption or semi-finished for use in further manufacturing (Government of Canada, 2022a). 
Manufacturing in Ontario is vital to the economy and provides significant employment for 
residents in the province. The Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters identified in 2018 that 
this sector contributed more than 12% of provincial GDP and accounted for more than 80% of 
Ontario’s exports to other markets (Wilson and Greco, 2018). Manufacturing businesses 
employ more than 770,000 Ontarians, which indirectly supports another 1.5 million residents 
working in subsequent industries and services. Relative to the rest of Canada, Ontario employs 
roughly half of the country’s manufacturing workers and generates about half of the country’s 
total value of production.  
Ontario’s manufacturing industry has been facing intense global competition, decreasing 
investment, and stagnant output and exports (Wilson and Greco, 2018). In the last decades of 
the of 20th century, for example, an increasing number of manufacturing firms moved 
operations offshore or to locations with cheaper labour or more lax regulation (e.g. textiles and 
clothing experienced significant declines in activity and employment in Ontario) (Ontario 360, 
2021). As some more labor-intensive manufacturing plants moved offshore, others have 
remained competitive such as those involved in providing transportation equipment, fabricated 
metals and other high value manufacturing industries. 
As it relates to Ontario’s economy, manufacturing also plays a critical role regionally and is a 
source of economic growth in small to mid-sized communities. Regionally, economic growth 
has been uneven across Ontario, with areas around Central Ontario (Toronto) and Eastern 
Ontario (Ottawa) growing quite quickly, and Southwest Ontario and Northern Ontario 
experiencing slow growth (Ontario 360, 2021). For example, roughly 55% of all employed 
residents in Ontario live in the Toronto or Ottawa areas, and many of the jobs in these cities are 
professional, scientific, and technical services (74.5%), or associated with finance and real 
estate (69.5%). Only 45% of the province’s manufacturing workers live in the Ottawa and 
Toronto area, with the remaining majority living across the rest of the province.  
Major manufacturing industries in Ontario include (Wilson and Greco, 2018): 
- 
Motor vehicles and parts 
- 
Food and beverage products  
- 
Chemical products  
- 
Machinery  
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 378  
- 
Plastics and rubber products 
- 
Fabricated metal products 
- 
Petroleum and coal refining 
- 
Computers and electronics 
- 
Paper products 
- 
Other non-durables and miscellaneous goods 
The Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters (CME) undertook a survey to identify challenges 
faced by companies within this industry. The top three challenges identified by businesses 
included 1) skilled labour shortages; 2) uncertainty in international trade agreements; and 3) 
cost increases imposed by government policies such as energy prices or minimum wage 
increases. Companies also identified that to foster growth in manufacturing in Ontario, the top 
factor in determining investment location is the availability of skilled labour and proximity to 
markets (Wilson and Greco, 2018). In 2022, CME released its net zero industrial strategy 
(Wilson and Arcand, 2022), indicating that many Canadian manufacturers have already made 
commitments to be net zero, but that transitioning toward those commitments will be very 
expensive. The strategy identifies that trends in the manufacturing industry continue to shift 
and transform due to geopolitical pressures, COVID-19, and is expected to lead to more 
localized production and supply chains to improve resilience and flexibility. Moving forward, 
there is a need to support small to medium enterprises with net zero transition, to develop 
effective energy solutions that recognize existing supply needs and the reality that supplies 
need to vastly increase while investing in new, low carbon resilient technologies (Wilson and 
Arcand, 2022). CME emphasizes the importance of consistency among climate policies and 
collaboration to ensure manufacturers remain competitive globally as businesses respond to 
climate change. 
An illustrative risk scenario for manufacturing is presented in Table 9.18. Risk profiles for this 
Level 1 category can be found in Table 9.19, at the end of this section.

Direct and Indirect Impacts 
Climate change can lead to several impacts to manufacturing, both direct and indirect. 
Manufacturing companies can be impacted by increases in extreme heat, extreme precipitation 
and dry conditions or drought. This led to financial impacts to manufacturers in the following 
ways: 
- 
Loss and damage to assets/infrastructure, materials, and equipment  
- 
Disruption/impairment to service productivity and schedule delays  
- 
Supply chain or logistics delays  
- 
Timing, reduction or changes in variability of key industrial inputs and costs (e.g. 
materials, commodities, water, electricity, insurance)  
- 
Health & safety impacts to staff 
The manufacturing industry is organized around a complex system of interdependent supply 
chains, which facilitate input materials (e.g. commodities such as crops) and products that are 
manufactured (e.g. food products). Severe weather events and climate change are already 
posing risks to global supply chains and are likely to evolve over the coming decades (McKinsey 
Global Institute, 2020). However, not all supply chains are the same. For example, the more 
specialized the supply chain, the more severe a climate impact could be for a downstream 
organization (e.g. if only one source supplies a critical input and has been disrupted). On the 
other hand, climate impacts on supply chains that have become highly commoditized may 
affect a larger number of downstream organizations (e.g. by increased prices due to supply 
shortages) (McKinsey Global Institute, 2020). 
Climate impacts could also limit key inputs to manufacturing such as water, timber, or energy, 
which could negatively impact production. The industry may face additional challenges due to 
disruptions in supply chains or impacts to supporting infrastructure and services such as energy 
or communications. For example, the Thailand floods and Japanese tsunami in 2011 resulted in 
significant losses for Ontario automobile manufacturers due to part shortages and delivery 
delays (DFAIT, 2012). Supply chain disruptions due to COVID-19 impacted the movement of 
several products such as lumber and steel, which led to cascading impacts and delays in real 
estate construction and other sectors (Ontario Construction, 2021).  
Extreme weather may further disrupt operations by creating unsafe work environments for 
employees. Rapid changes in consumer demand could occur with significant changes in climate 
(e.g. increases in energy demand during extreme heat events) (OCCIAR, 2015).  
Risk Results  
Manufacturing risks were evaluated based on financial loss and possible disruption to the 
ability of businesses to continue to deliver the services they provide. The risks that were

assessed can be considered as those that affect continued operation, rather than an evaluation 
of the tactical capacity of manufacturing to absorb climate impacts or adopt technologies and 
automation designed to improve process efficiency and climate impacts. Manufacturing inputs 
and outputs could be quantified based on possible financial loss if that information were 
available and as part of a more detailed risk assessment. For the purposes of the PCCIA, it is 
important to recognize this dimension of manufacturing, and the fact that processes tend to be 
more energy-intensive and waste intensive (and therefore costly) compared to building 
materials and the building envelope. In other words, risk scores should be considered a 
minimum amount of risk that businesses may face particularly in light of mounting financial 
costs.  
In most cases, businesses within this sector rely on critical inputs from other systems and the 
supply chain to deliver and manufacture products. For example, in an extreme heat event, a 
worst possible scenario would be increased heat loading strain, which could exceed a building’s 
HVAC system climatic design values (e.g. envelope component thermal glazing units, thermal 
breaks and seals; cooling loads of mechanical cooling equipment). This could then lead to 
cooling system underperformance or failure. The more strain, the higher chance of complete 
failure. The result would be potential closure of the facility, interruption of business services, 
and costs of equipment repair and/or replacement. Based on the PCCIA Methodology 
Framework (External Resource – 1), impacts were evaluated for the most probable worst-case 
event, which is considered to be the underperformance of a building’s HVAC systems in the 
event of extreme heat, such as a 10% decrease in system efficiency resulting in increasing 
volume/cost of energy consumption. 
Similarly, in the event of a drought, an example risk scenario could be a time-limited (e.g. 
several days) stoppage of manufacturing activity in the event that the water supply is disrupted. 
In this case, depending on the volume required, water from another source could be used but 
at the cost of its purchase and transportation.  
Climate risk, or the risk profile for a typical manufacturer in Ontario, was determined to be 
currently ‘low’. However, risk is expected to rise to ‘medium’ by the end of century under the 
high emissions scenario, RCP8.5. In this case, the extent and pace at which we reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions matters in the context of how impacted manufacturers in Ontario 
will be. If emissions are mitigated and a more moderate emissions scenario (RCP4.5) is 
achieved, climate risk is expected to remain lower for this industry (see Appendix 7).  
Interdependencies with the global supply chain will likely have significant future risks to 
manufacturing in Ontario (e.g. climate impacts to sources and supplies elsewhere in the world 
leading to disruptions or shortages). These cascading impacts are not quantitatively factored 
into these scores. Furthermore, the manufacturing industry is uniquely positioned in the 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 381  
context of climate resilience such that companies with emissions-intensive operations have an 
opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions though the adoption of skills and tools linked 
first to efficiency and automation, but also to the potential for circular recovery of waste or 
underutilized resources. In doing so they may reduce the climate impacts experienced in the 
future. Essentially, a global operation could ensure resilience to their own supply chain by 
considering sources and supplies they rely upon and reducing the carbon-intensity of their 
operations. In so doing, future significant disruptions to their manufacturing business may be 
mitigated.

9.7.8 Mining, Quarrying and Oil/Gas Extraction 
Overview 
This industry refers to establishments primarily engaged in extracting naturally occurring 
minerals, whether they are solids (e.g. coal, ores), liquids (e.g. crude petroleum) or gases (e.g. 
natural gas). This industry also includes businesses involved in quarrying, aggregate extraction, 
well operations, milling and exploration of minerals (Government of Canada, 2022a). Ontario is 
one of Canada’s largest mineral producers, generating $11.1 billion worth of minerals in 2021 
and representing 20% of the country’s total mineral production value. As of December 31, 
2021, there were 317,426 active mining claims in Ontario that include those for gold, copper, 
nickel, zinc, platinum group metals, salt, and structural materials (LMSID, 2018). In 2021, mining 
in Ontario contributed an estimated annual total of $8.0 billion to GDP (Ontario Mining 
Association, 2021), with a large presence of mining companies publicly listed on the Toronto 
Stock Exchange (TSX) resulting in equity capital to be financed within Ontario and having a 
spillover effect on the province’s financial sector (see Section 9.7.5). 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report

Production in the non-metal industry largely includes stone, sand, gravel, and diamonds and 
was valued at $2.3 billion in 2017, lagging behind metallic production valued at almost $7.5 
billion. This is an industry that also relies upon external and international market pricing for 
commodities like oil, copper, nickel, and gold, all of which are important to employment in 
Ontario. Evidence suggests that movements in nickel and copper prices are most dependent on 
demand and business cycles, but supply levels are challenging to predict in part because of their 
dependence on government policy and the world economy. Oil and gas extraction is a relatively 
small subsector in Ontario and thus a decline in oil prices and investment has had minimal 
employment impact in the overall industry (LMSID, 2018). 
Like the construction industry (see Section 9.7.4), the Mining, Quarrying, Oil and Gas Extraction 
Industry also faces significant challenges in the near future with an aging labour market and 
subsequent need to replace retiring workers and transfer specialized skills to different 
generations of staff. These challenges are particularly pronounced in the north where the 
activities are concentrated and where recruitment can be challenging.  
Regionally, Northeast Ontario employs the greatest numbers of workers in this sector – almost 
50% of employment, with concentration around Sudbury and Timmins. Central Ontario, namely 
the Toronto region, employs the second greatest number of workers at just over 15% of the 
industry. These companies largely support mining operations and employ workers in 
management, financial auditing, and geology. In Northwest and the Far North, gold production 
dominates the industry in this region, with just over 10% of industry employment. These 
regions are broadly considered the key to future Ontario mining due to economic potential 
based on significant critical mineral deposits including nickel, copper, platinum and chromite 
(LMSID, 2018). 
Ontario has identified several pillars in developing and expanding this industry (Ontario 
Ministry of Northern Development, 2022a):  
- 
Enhance geoscience information and supporting critical minerals exploration 
- 
Grow domestic processing and create resilient local supply chains  
- 
Improve Ontario’s regulatory framework  
- 
Invest in critical minerals innovation, research and development  
- 
Build economic development opportunities with Indigenous partners 
- 
Grow the labour supply and develop a skilled labour force.  
Illustrative risk scenarios for this Level 1 category are presented in Table 9.20. Risk profiles for 
Level 2 categories assessed under mining, quarrying and oil/gas extraction can be found in 
Table 9.21, at the end of this section.

Direct and Indirect Impacts 
The Mining, Quarrying and Oil/Gas Extraction Industry have unique context in that there is a 
need to reduce the carbon intensity and/or emissions associated with activities to mitigate 
climate change, as well as reduce the impacts and risks to businesses and their operations at 
the same time. Furthermore, activities in these industries typically result in changing land use 
and tend to leave lasting remediation works or sites with tailings present that require long-term 
management, containment, and treatment to avoid health and environmental impacts adjacent 
to sites and/or downstream (Rodgers and Douglas, 2015). Approaches and frameworks to 
manage risks related to mining activities have been developed and these provide an excellent 
opportunity to consider climate change impacts and risks at the site level. The National 
Orphaned/Abandoned Mines Initiative (NOAMI) also provides a suite of resources where sites 
have been orphaned or abandoned, often with decades-long implications.  
This section describes impacts and risks to mining businesses themselves and their activities. 
Mining, Quarrying and Oil and Gas Extraction businesses could be impacted by changes in 
extreme heat, mean and extreme precipitation, and drought conditions. This could lead to 
financial impacts in Mining, Quarrying and Oil & Gas Extraction Industries in the following ways: 
asset/infrastructure loss & damage, disruption/interruption of key business processes, 
changes/ reduction/variability of availability of key industrial inputs and costs (e.g. materials, 
water, energy, insurance), decrease in asset serviceable lifespan, and health and safety impacts 
to staff. 
Risk Results  
Based on the identified risk scenarios for this Level 1 category, risk scores for a typical company 
in this industry are expected to be ‘medium’, and do not increase or decrease significantly in 
the future. The illustrative examples above indicate some of the rationale behind this risk level, 
which represents a single event occurring and the impacts to annual revenue and service 
disruptions.  
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 384  
If a wildfire event were to occur, this could result in the stoppage of Mining, Quarrying and 
Oil/Gas Extraction operations. There would be clear and direct health and safety impact to 
company staff, possible disruptions to electricity supply and transportation or supply chain 
networks (e.g. shipment of commodities). Based upon the assumption that commercial and 
provincial government wildfire suppression and abatement practices are in place, a risk 
scenario could be a stoppage in industry functions lasting up to one week. Financial implications 
of this scenario would be expected for a short duration of time, representing a low proportion 
of annual revenue.  
As a second illustrative example: drought conditions are driven by a decrease in water (both 
groundwater and surface water) availability for mining and quarrying (which would be used in 
production such as in mineral dissolution in brining processes, dust suppression, mine drainage 
and tailings covering). This decreased availability of water could lead to insufficient process 
water for operations as well as water resources abstraction or discharge licenses being reduced 
or revoked, with companies unable to meet dust emissions or suppression requirements. Under 
this risk scenario, shut down of company operations could occur for weeks to months during a 
hot, dry summer season. Financial impacts would be expected to be significant, but for a short 
period of time resulting in a moderate proportion of annual revenue loss. 
A third example of a scenario evaluated for this industry includes extreme precipitation 
conditions. Extreme precipitation or changes in groundwater flow regimes could lead to 
increased contaminant transport (e.g. acid mine drainage) due to increased runoff of untreated 
water to adjacent watercourses to mine sites. Changing precipitation conditions could also 
reduce the number of options available for hazardous chemicals and pollutant disposal. For Oil 
and Gas infrastructure specifically, extreme precipitation conditions could lead to soil 
saturation, movement or undermining of pipes and buried assets, and increased maintenance 
requirements to ensure operational safety. All of these risk scenarios could result in 
reputational issues, regulatory non-compliance, and legal liability for businesses in this industry. 
A risk scenario could be a time -limited overtopping of a retention pond prior to applying 
mitigation measures, leading to discharge of contaminants in excess of permitted approval 
levels. The financial impacts associated with this scenario, for a single discharge of 
contaminants, could be up to three million dollars based on historical precedent and “typical” 
fines levied for similar effluent discharge.

9.7.9 Retail Trade  
Overview 
The retail trade sector broadly refers to businesses primarily engaged in retailing merchandise 
and rendering services associated with the sale of merchandise. This sector includes both store 
and non-store retailers. Store retailers operate fixed point-of-sale locations, designed to attract 
walk-in customers. Non-store retailers are organized to serve the public but use different 
methods such as publishing of infomercials, direct-response advertising, electronic catalogues, 
door-to-door sales and distribution by vending machines (Government of Canada, 2022a). 
Retail Trade can include various types of stores, such as motor vehicle dealers, furniture stores, 
electronics and appliance stores, food and beverage stores, gas stations, clothing stores, 
sporting goods, bookstores, among others. 
Spending within the retail sector is broadly used as one indicator of economic growth and 
activity, particularly on a monthly or quarterly basis (Sondhi, 2022). In so doing, retail sales are 
often used as a narrative of disposable income and the ability of residents across Ontario to 
afford products and consumer goods. For example, in May of 2022, a report by TD bank states 
“higher prices and interest rates will begin to weigh on household budgets in the second half of 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 386  
the year, prompting consumers to tighten their purse strings.” (Sondhi, 2022). However, this is 
a sector that was significantly impacted due to COVID-19 restrictions and public health 
measures. The Ontario Chamber of Commerce identifies that Retail Trade revenues remain well 
below pre-pandemic levels due to labour shortages and is one of the most pessimistic sectors 
within Ontario for confidence (OCC, 2021).  
Retail Trade across Canada represents just under 11% of Canada’s entire workforce, with about 
66% of jobs in the sector being full-time as of 2019 (Retail Council of Canada, 2019). It is a 
significant part of the Canadian economy, with revenues exceeding $636 billion (Sarra, 2022).  
In 2020, wholesale and Retail Trade made up just over 10% of Ontario’s nominal GDP 
(Government of Ontario, 2021d). In a similar manner to some other industries described in this 
Area of Focus (e.g. manufacturing in Section 9.7.7), the presence or types of retail sales can vary 
widely depending on the size and location of municipalities. The Retail Council of Canada 
identifies that while municipalities may differ as agricultural hubs, mining towns, manufacturing 
centres, among others, retail is the critical link in the supply chain process and connects 
producers to households (Retail Council of Canada, 2019). 
Regionally, in Central Ontario, retail and wholesale trade remain significant components of 
Toronto’s economy with the sector employing over 400,000 individuals (TWIG, 2021). The 
Ontario Chamber of Commerce reported on regional employment changes (%) in 2021 and 
2022 more generally in their 2022 Economic Report (OCC, 2022). The authors indicate that all 
regions, except Northeast Ontario, saw positive employment growth in 2021 and moderate to 
strong rebound from the pandemic in Windsor-Sarnia and Kingston-Pembroke, with Northwest 
Ontario seeing a milder rebound (OCC, 2022). As regional employment and economic activity 
continues to rebound, spending and growth in Retail Trade has a more positive outlook, 
recognizing that inflation and interest prices may impact consumer spending in the future.  
An illustrative risk scenario for retail trade is presented in Table 9.22. Risk profiles for this Level 
1 category can be found in Table 9.23, at the end of this section.

Direct and Indirect Impacts 
Climate change poses a variety of risks to retailers across Ontario and includes direct physical 
risks, transition risks and systemic risks. The increasing frequency and intensity of acute events 
such as flooding and wildfires are destroying retail assets, disrupting supply chains and 
distribution channels, creating uncertainty in availability and pricing of raw materials, and 
increasing insurance costs (Sarra, 2022). Furthermore, retailers are increasingly experiencing 
rising litigation related to companies failing to mitigate the impacts of climate change, failure to 
adapt, insufficiency of disclosure regarding material financial risks, and ‘greenwashing’ with 
substantial fines being levied for retail misrepresentation. 
Extreme temperature changes can damage retail, storage, and distribution premises and 
prevent access. Extreme weather events can disrupt operations and supply chains and create 
employee safety concerns (Sarra, 2022). The Insurance Bureau of Canada reports that flooding 
in Canada causes annual average economic losses of over CA$1.2 billion, of which CA$800 
million are uninsured (IBC, 2021b). If acute events continue to rise pace, insurance will become 
prohibitively expensive for some retailers and there is risk that it may become unavailable in 
some high-risk areas in the future. A report in 2019 by S&P Global identified that weather is 
already a significant swing factor in a retail company’s results (Shoeb and Yoshimura, 2019).  
Retail businesses also face significant indirect impacts from supply chain disruption, uncertainty 
in the availability and pricing of raw materials (particularly those at risk), and changes in water 
quality and availability. Risks facing Canadian retailers are exacerbated when suppliers are in 
countries that are feeling climate impacts even more, as it alters the availability of raw material 
(Sarra, 2022). Depending on the region of Canada or globally from which retailers purchase 
their products, there are risks from drought and rising costs of inputs such as agricultural 
production and clean water for manufacture of food, drink, and apparel.  
Retail Trade activities could be impacted from climate change and lead to financial impacts in 
the Retail Trade industry in the following ways:  
- 
Loss and damage to assets/infrastructure, materials, and equipment 
- 
Disruption and/or impairment to service productivity 
- 
Supply chain or logistics delays 
- 
Changes or reduction of key industrial inputs and rising costs (e.g. materials, 
commodities, water, electricity, insurance) 
- 
Increased variability in consumer demand for seasonal goods and services 
- 
Health & safety impacts to staff and customers

Risk Results  
The risks associated with a typical retail company have been determined to be currently ‘low’ 
but increasing to ‘medium’ by the end of the century under a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5) 
in all regions except the Far North. It is anticipated that under a scenario with significant loss of 
contents and access or function to a retail company (but not total failure), disruption to services 
would be significant but for a short duration of time. Financial loss within one year could be 
considered relatively low compared to total annual revenues. Recall that these risk scores only 
reflect the risk of a climate scenario occurring for one typical–business - not cascading impacts 
between companies, supply chains across the entire industry. Under a scenario where 
electricity supply is disrupted and building performance is reduced to 0% (e.g. no service) from 
one climate event, this could result in a significant reduction in business service activity for a 
short period of time (e.g. a few days).  
More broadly speaking, evidence suggests that physical climate risks to retail trade are 
expected to grow in the future and retail companies will have to engage in adaptation 
strategies in addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In many instances, the long term 
chronic physical impacts on the retail market are not yet known, particularly longer-term 
changes in the availability of key inputs for supply chains (Sarra, 2022).  
One illustrative example of impacts and opportunities for a sub-sector within retail trade is food 
and beverage retail, which is where food production, distribution and consumption intersect. 
This is a sub-sector not only reliant upon supply chain systems to distribute commodities to 
market, but also one of the most energy intensive in the retail sector due to refrigeration and 
cooling needs (Putnam, 2021). Opportunities exist for the food and beverage retail industry to 
undertake corporate and supply chain risk assessments that focus on supply chain reliance and 
opportunities for resilience food systems. For example, the ice storm of 2003 resulted in power 
interruption of up to three days. Evidence suggests that most food retail stores in Toronto may 
only have three days of fresh food and up to 17 days of all food products in stock (Zeuli et al., 
2018b). There is therefore a need to examine food systems and food security across sectors and 
systems (see Section 10.1 for a discussion regarding food security). Ontario’s Food Terminal in 
Toronto, for instance, is the largest wholesale fruit and produce distribution centre in Canada, 
and the third largest in North America, supporting local farmers, independent and chain food 
retailers, restaurants and many others (Ontario Food Terminal Board, 2021). The reliance upon, 
or opportunities from, critical distribution centres, could be an important next step in 
characterizing increasing climate risks over time.

 Transportation Economy  
Overview 
The Transportation Economy broadly refers to the movement of people and products both 
within and across Ontario, as well as external to the province to international markets. The 
Transportation Economy can refer to movement by trucking on roads (both long distance and 
local freight), on rail corridors, through air transportation, or by water.  
Across Canada, there are three primary trade routes: the Western Corridor, the Atlantic 
Corridor, and the Continental Corridor. The latter, also referred to as the Ontario-Quebec 
Corridor, is the busiest of Canada’s three major transportation corridors, with primary modes of 
transportation being road, rail and water transportation. Air transportation is also a significant 
mode with Toronto Pearson International, Montreal-Mirabel International and Montreal-Pierre 
Elliott Trudeau International Airports accounting for 54% of Canadian air traffic cargo in 2016 
(TAC, 2021).  
The selection or rationale for the movement of goods depends on numerous factors (e.g. size 
and type of cargo, time, costs of shipping, destination, distance, availability of services, among 
others). Figure 9.3 illustrates considerations for which mode of transportation is best based on 
costs, volume, and value of time (TAC, 2021). As illustrated in the figure below, cost, value, and 
distance are interdependent. For example, time sensitive goods and low-volume goods such as 
medical equipment or precious gems will most likely be shipped by air, since their cost per unit 
is higher. These costs can be absorbed by the sale value of the cargo. On the other hand, the 
value of un-refined crude oil or iron ore will be lower per unit-weight and less time-sensitive 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 390  
but higher in volume, hence the use of the slower but higher-capacity transport modes (TAC, 
2021). 
Figure 9.3: Modal Choice in the Transportation Economy: Modal Choice based on Cost, 
Volume and Value of Time 
 
 
 
The transportation economy not only underpins numerous other sectors, but its infrastructure 
is in a deficit position and in need of maintenance, upgrades, and bolstered investment (see 
Section 6.7.5). Infrastructure ownership also varies, depending on the mode of transport: 
generally, roads are owned by governments, railways are private, airports are run as not-for-
profit, and ports have mixed ownership/operation. From a business perspective, half of the 
businesses in Ontario consider transportation infrastructure critical to ensuring their 
competitiveness within the market, but 58% rate the ability of transportation infrastructure as 
fair or poor in meeting their needs (OCC, 2018).  
Air Transportation  
Goods shipped by air are typically high-value and time-sensitive merchandise such as 
pharmaceuticals, medical and electronic equipment, and precious metals (TAC, 2021). This 
mode of transportation is also used to supply cargo to remote communities. Air transportation 
in Canada is managed by NAV CANADA, one of the largest air navigation service providers in the 
world by total instrument flight rules (IFR) flight hours, which manages the world’s third-largest 
aerospace sector, at over 18,000,000 kilometers (TAC, 2021). Airport authorities, as non-share 
and not-for-profit entities, have organizational structures that place the responsibility locally, 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 391  
rather than on the federal government. For instance, in Central Ontario, the Greater Toronto 
Airports Authority (GTAA) operates Toronto Pearson International Airport, and it has a board of 
directors comprised of community members such as local boards of trade, Professional 
Engineers Ontario, municipal representatives, among others. For commercial passengers using 
air transportation, Toronto Pearson is the busiest airport across Canada, handling over 47 
million passengers per year (Toronto Pearson, 2021). 
Deep Sea, Coastal and Great Lakes  
The Ontario-Quebec Corridor also provides critical connection points to the Great Lakes and St. 
Lawrence Seaway, providing direct access from the Atlantic Ocean inland and creating the 
shortest route between Europe and part of the U.S. Midwest (TAC, 2021). Approximately 
30,000 tonnes of freight originates in or is destined for Ontario by domestic waterways annually 
(Woudsma and Towns, 2017). Major ports within the Ontario-Quebec corridor include the Port 
of Montreal, Port of Thunder Bay, and Port of Sept-Iles. These ports compete with the Port of 
New York, as well as other Canadian ports for business in order to be the port of call in a 
specific corridor for the commodities that the specific port is capable of handling, since ports 
will vary based on the type of port (gateway, local, or transshipment), and commodities 
(container or liquid bulk) (Notteboom and Yap, 2018).  
From a regulatory perspective, water transportation often requires binational or international 
coordination and commitments to ensure safety, security and environmental protection of 
shipping within the vicinity of international coastlines (e.g. as per International Maritime 
Organization (IMO, 2022), the International Joint Commission (IJC, 2022), and/or the Great 
Lakes Water Quality Agreement between the U.S. and Canada). Hundreds of other lakes and 
rivers in Ontario, particularly in the Northwest, Northeast and Central regions, also provide 
shipping, tourism, recreation, and subsistence benefits (Woudsma and Towns, 2017). 
Local and Long-Distance Freight Trucking and Delivery Services 
The majority of goods transported by road in North America are moved by heavy-duty trucks 
(Wiginton et al., 2019). As described above, the Continental Corridor between Ontario and 
Quebec includes transportation via Highway 401, which is the busiest highway in North 
America. Highway 401 serves as the primary route for east-west travel within Ontario and 
serves as critical connection points to intermodal terminals, the four largest facilities are 
located within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and Montreal and serve as key hubs for the 
efficient movement of goods (TAC, 2021). Road networks and freight trucking also connects 
Ontario and Canada to the U.S. Midwest and Northeast.  
Goods movement by truck is critical to Ontario’s economy but contributes significantly to 
greenhouse gas pollution. A total of 38% of Ontario’s economy comes from freight-intensive 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 392  
industries, but heavy-duty trucks alone are now responsible for just under 10% of Ontario’s 
emissions. From 1990 to 2014, the volume of road freight activity in Ontario grew by 242% 
(Wiginton et al., 2019). As demand for goods increases and truck activity increases, it is 
anticipated that fewer vehicle efficiency gains will be made for heavy-duty trucks in comparison 
to light vehicles, and thus emissions from freight are expected to bypass those from passenger 
movement around 2030 in Canada (Wiginton et al., 2019). Furthermore, as needs increase for 
freight trucking and delivery, barriers such as congestion on Ontario roads, notably within the 
Greater Toronto Hamilton Area, will increase operating costs for trucking companies (Toronto 
Region Board of Trade, 2017). Congestion costs Canadian businesses and consumers between 
$500 and $650 million per year in higher prices for goods (OCC, 2021). 
In a survey of 23 upper, lower and single tier municipalities across Ontario, the Pembina 
Institute found that in larger urban areas, such as the Greater Golden Horseshoe, there is a 
need for region-wide authorities to take a stronger role to coordinate freight action to bolster 
data collection, establishing a goods movement network and setting standards (Wiginton et al., 
2019). At the municipal level across Ontario, there is a need for improved internal collaboration 
and to build deeper relationships with local industries (e.g. logistics, warehousing, retail, etc.). 
Rail Transportation  
Across Canada, there is approximately 41,700 route-kilometres of rail track, owned primarily by 
CN (52%) and CP (31%) rail companies, as well as 19 intermodal terminals and 27 border 
crossings with the U.S. (TAC, 2021). There are over 60 rail companies that operate on Canada’s 
rail network, and freight transportation specializes in bulk commodities and containerized 
traffic over long distances. Imports by rail tend to be automotive and chemical products, while 
primary exports are similar in addition to forest products and metals. Regionally across Ontario, 
rail transportation provides critical services to areas in Northeast and Northwest Ontario, such 
as through Ontario Northland. Ontario’s rail network also includes 10 local and regional freight 
operators, 11 tourist railways, three light rail and subway systems (e.g. Toronto, Ottawa and 
Kitchener-Waterloo), and the GO transit system, providing regional passenger services in 
Southwest and Central Ontario (Woudsma and Towns, 2017). 
Historically and over time, rail transportation faces several challenges in Ontario that can be 
exacerbated by climate impacts. Maintenance investment, for example, such as the grade of 
steel used, the condition of rail beds and the ties, has been limited (Woudsma and Towns, 
2017). Rail transportation networks between Canada and the United States and restrictive 
clearance limits Ontario’s ability to deliver significant volume of goods and food, resulting in 
more demand to move products by freight truck. A lack of direct connectivity to extra-regional 
intermodal hubs in Eastern Canada, Western Canada and the United States means products 
must move by truck through the Greater Toronto Area causing congestion, where 20% of trucks

moving through highways neither originate nor end in Ontario. Simply put, the transportation 
network is not balanced for import and export trade with 95% of food and consumer shipments 
exit Ontario by truck, whereas over 80% of consumer shipments enter Ontario by rail.  
Direct and Indirect Impacts 
Climate impacts to the Transportation Economy, both direct and indirect, can affect public and 
political perceptions of risk and lead to damage of infrastructure, disruption to goods 
movement, shut down of transportation and signal networks, and/or stranded travelers 
(Woudsma and Towns, 2017). Widespread climate impacts on transportation networks may not 
be felt uniformly across Ontario, with regions more dependent on roads and highways or with 
less redundancy for mobility being disproportionately impacted.  
Illustrative risk scenarios that were assessed for this Level 1 category can be found in Table 
9.24. Table 9.25 provides the risk profiles for each Level 2 category assessed under 
Transportation Economy, at the end of this section.

Air Transportation  
Much like the other industries described above, air transportation can be considered a network 
where impacts at one location (e.g. an airport) can have a negative ripple effect disrupting air 
travel and causing delays across Ontario, Canada or North America. Past climate impacts have 
been associated with extreme weather events (e.g. storms, high winds, fog), extreme cold (e.g. 
operational impacts on fueling or reducing the ability for chemical treatments to melt ice and 
snow on airplanes) (Woudsma and Towns, 2017). 
Climate change is expected to bring increased variability in extreme weather and rising 
temperatures, both of which can pose risks to air transportation and the ability of reliable 
timing and productivity of airlines and transportation companies. Warming temperatures may 
result in decreased air density providing less lift for aircraft, thereby increasing fuel 
requirements (costs) and the need for longer runways (Woudsma and Towns, 2017). Impacts to 
runway materials and safety due to extreme heat may also pose risks from safety and/or delay 
to aircraft. Rising rain on snow events, or more rain falling in the winter season, may also delay 
winter operations. Companies within this industry are expected to face risks related to rising 
prices for fuel, insurance and materials, and more frequent replacement of assets due to 
decreased serviceable life spans of assets. 
Deep Sea, Coastal and Great Lakes 
Deep sea, costal and Great Lakes transportation industries can be impacted due to a variety of 
weather events. Changes in extreme heat and cold, precipitation and drought can lead to 
longer term rising costs to businesses operating within this industry (e.g. increased for repair or 
replacement of assets due to shorter lifespans) or more acute impacts as a result of extreme 
weather conditions on the Great Lakes themselves (e.g. due to high or low water levels). For 
example, during years of lower water levels, coastal or harbour infrastructure can be exposed 
and damaged, and shipping routes can be disrupted due to issues of access (Woudsma and 
Towns, 2017). While significant uncertainty remains in modeling future water levels across the 
Great Lakes, preliminary results indicate higher variability in water levels – higher highs and 
lower lows (Seglenieks, 2020). Lower water levels in particular carry a higher potential for far 
reaching economic impacts, making this a key concern for Ontario’s economy (Woudsma and 
Towns, 2017). 
Increased variability poses a variety of risks to this industry more generally, such as 
infrastructure decay, requirements for additional dredging of navigational channels, flash 
flooding of inland watercourses due to ice jams, ship handling or navigation challenges, among 
numerous others (Woudsma and Towns, 2017). A shift in seasonal navigation may also pose 
operational risks in that construction and maintenance schedules for assets may fall out of 
alignment with operational demands (e.g. extended or year-round shipping shortening the lay-
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 395  
up period for operators) (Woudsma and Towns, 2017). Localized seiche impacts, resulting in 
rapidly changing water levels, can also pose risks to marine transportation in the Great Lakes. 
For example, in September 2014, seiche event on Lake Michigan changed water levels by more 
than three metres in under an hour, causing dry marinas beforehand to become flooded 
suddenly, destroying vessels and infrastructure (Woudsma and Towns, 2017). Additional risks 
posed to this industry include health and safety impacts to staff and customers, and in changes 
or increased prices of critical costs (e.g. fuel and insurance of vessels).  
Increasing air temperatures and changing climate conditions can also lead to impacts on water 
quality in the Great Lakes and in watercourses where transportation or transportation-reliant 
tourism occurs. For example, warmer waters, prolonged stratification, and increased nutrient 
loading can lead to the creation of harmful algal blooms (GLISA, 2022). These algal blooms pose 
health and safety risks in accessing, using, and enjoying water as well as can result in lack of 
access for transportation routes, lead to clogging of infrastructure and docks, and pose risks to 
any tourism-related activity requiring transportation. From an economic perspective, impacts 
could include delays, lost revenue and/or the inability to deliver people and goods to their 
destination. 
Local and Long-Distance Freight Trucking and Delivery Services 
Local and long-distance freight trucking and delivery services are reliant upon road networks 
and supporting infrastructure. Climate impacts, such as extreme precipitation, could lead to 
washouts of road segments, which can lead to stranded travelers, delayed emergency 
responders, and affect economic flows (Woudsma and Towns, 2017). Extreme heat and 
increased variability in climate conditions may result in roads requiring earlier or additional 
maintenance over their life spans. Warming temperatures may pose some opportunities in 
Ontario, such as longer construction seasons and reduced winter maintenance requirements, 
but also shorten and threaten the ability to operate winter roads in Northern regions of 
Ontario. Financial consequences of a shorter winter roads season could include less time for the 
movement of freight and people in some regions, higher maintenance costs, reduced load 
capacity and the failure of road embankments (Woudsma and Towns, 2017) 
 
From the perspective of local and long-distance freight companies, degradation and damage to 
roads and supporting infrastructure may worsen congestion drivers face, may increase delays 
and costs in shipments, and reduce the ability to pull over safely or stop throughout long-haul 
routes. Various weather events and conditions (e.g. heat, cold, extreme precipitation, wildfire) 
could lead to financial impacts to these businesses in the following ways: 
- 
Loss & damage to assets  
- 
Disruption and/or impairment in service quality, productivity, and timing  
- 
Health & safety impacts on staff  
- 
Variability or increases in costs (e.g. fuel, insurance) 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 396  
Trucks also face unique risks and opportunities as further investment, and adaptation occurs in 
Ontario’s energy systems. For example, Canada’s heavy-duty vehicle and engine greenhouse 
gas emissions regulations or other national programs cannot deliver the reductions to meet 
Canada’s commitments to reduce emissions internationally. To do so requires a major shift 
from diesel fuels that have long dominated the trucking industry by providing range, pulling 
power and reliability (Woudsma and Towns, 2017). Likewise, the capacity of Ontario’s existing 
energy systems requires significant investment to enable a shift towards fuel switching or low 
carbon opportunities (see Section 10.2). As research and actions continue to accelerate 
development and testing of new zero emissions heavy-duty truck technologies, such as working 
with utilities and the hydrogen industry (Wiginton et al., 2019), businesses may face changing 
regulatory requirements, technological change, and rising costs to maintain continuity of 
services.  
Rail Transportation  
The rail transportation industry, in many ways, has been on the front lines in terms of 
experiencing and managing climate impacts under the need for operations and transportation 
of people and goods across Ontario. Extreme precipitation events have already led to significant 
impacts on the GO train corridor in July 2013 (Chiotti, 2016). For example, a commuter 
passenger train was stranded, and resulted in more than 1,000 passengers awaiting hours for 
rescue. Extreme heat events have already led to steel rail lines buckling in Ontario and 
Manitoba (Woudsma and Towns, 2017), and rising extreme temperatures pose high risks to 
operational challenges such as in Southwest, Central and Eastern Ontario where extreme 
temperatures are projected to be highest.  
Rail transportation agencies and operators have been implementing measures to reduce risks 
throughout transportation routes. For example, Metrolinx, an Ontario agency with a mandate 
of improving the coordination and integration of all modes of transportation in the Greater 
Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA), has implemented several operational measures such as 
patrolling rail corridors, inspecting culverts underlying rail beds, speed restrictions or slow 
orders on hot days and rail adjustments where early problems may appear (Chiotti, 2016). 
However, climate change is anticipated to continue to increase risk for rail transportation, such 
as increased need for maintenance, decrease in serviceable life of track assets, disruptions or 
service that could lead to reputational challenges, productivity and timing in transportation 
routes, and health and safety impacts to staff and passengers.  
Risk Results  
The risk to the Transportation Economy was assessed by Level 2 category and by Region across 
Ontario. Risk scores were determined for current, 2050s and 2080s under a high emissions 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 397  
scenario (RCP8.5) and moderate emissions scenario (RCP4.5). Table 9.25 illustrates 
Transportation Economy risks by Level 2 category for each time period, operating under a 
RCP8.5 scenario (high emissions).  
The highest risks to the Transportation Economy are currently associated with marine 
transportation (deep sea, coastal and great lakes) across every region of Ontario. Risks 
associated with marine transportation are considered ‘high’ at current and remain ‘high’ in all 
future time periods. These results are in part due to the increasing variability and financial 
consequences of extreme weather and variability of the Great Lakes.  
Risks to rail transportation are classed as ‘medium’ under current climate conditions but rising 
to ‘high’ by mid-century and remaining high out until end of century. This increasing risk profile 
for rail companies and businesses in this industry reflects the increasing frequency or impacts 
associated with extreme heat, namely possible heat kinks or impacts to rail corridors resulting 
in disruptions to transportation schedules and reliability.  
Risks to air transportation were evaluated to be ‘low’ under current and 2050s conditions and 
rising to ‘medium’ by end of century. This increase in risk, albeit at a slow rate of increase 
compared to rail transportation, is largely associated with risks from extreme precipitation and 
winter conditions associated with increased variability and financial consequences on 
businesses. Notably, climate risks to air transportation are not expected to increase significantly 
if GHG emissions are able to be reduced to follow RCP4.5 (see Appendix 7).  
Lastly, climate risks to local and long-distance freight trucking were evaluated to be ‘low’ under 
current climate conditions but rise to ‘medium’ in all regions of Ontario, except the Far North, 
by end of century. These climate risk profiles for businesses are largely based upon extreme 
precipitation and the impacts associated with shorter duration extreme events causing flooding 
that may pose issues of access, delays, or inability of freight to travel to destinations. However, 
for certain transportation infrastructure, such as winter roads in northern Ontario, these risks 
may in fact be elevated as a result of increasingly variable conditions and rising temperatures. 
Section 6.7.5 characterizes the risk to roads on the assets themselves. Critically, cascading 
impacts of other infrastructure systems (e.g. if power outages were to cause fuel shortages and 
increasing prices) are not quantitatively evaluated as part of this score, and so it is plausible 
that scores may in fact be rising faster for this industry in the future.

 Utility Services 
Overview 
In the context of the PCCIA, Utility Services comprise establishments primarily engaged in 
operating electric and gas utilities. These establishments generate, transmit, control and

distribute electric power, distribute natural gas and provide related services through 
infrastructure such as power lines, pipes, and processing facilities.  
Illustrative risk scenarios are presented in Table 9.26. Four Level 2 categories are characterized 
briefly below, with the associated risk profiles by region and timeframe presented in Table 9.27, 
at the end of this section. For additional discussion regarding Ontario’s energy systems, and 
characterization of impacts to energy security, refer to Section 10.2.

Electrical Power Generation 
In 2020, Ontario generated 154.7 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, which represents the 
second largest producer of electricity in Canada and has an estimated generating capacity of 
38,644 megawatts (MW). (OEB, 2019; 2020; IESO, 2020). Just over 92% of this electricity in the 
province was produced from zero-carbon sources: 56.8% from nuclear, 24.4% from 
hydroelectricity, 8.7% from wind and 2.4% from solar. The remainder is primarily from natural 
gas and biomass (OEB, 2021). Three nuclear power plants provide the bulk of Ontario’s 
baseload generation: Bruce Power on the shores of Lake Huron is the largest, with eight 
generation units representing one of the largest nuclear power plants operating in the world 
(CER, 2022). Ontario also has over 200 hydroelectricity generation facilities, and the largest 
100% biomass-fueled plant in North America (e.g. the 205 MW Atikokan Generating Station 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 401  
converted from coal in 2014) (CER, 2022). The Ontario Energy Board (OEB) is involved in license 
approvals for generation companies (OEB, 2022a). 
Electrical Power Transmission, Control and Distribution 
Electrical power, once generated, requires transmission and distribution to consumers and for 
end use. The Ontario electricity grid includes high voltage transmission lines delivering 
electricity from generators to large customers (e.g. major industry) and to local distribution 
companies who distribute electricity at lower voltages to homes and businesses. The Ontario 
electricity grid is made up of transmission lines delivering electricity from generators to 
communities. The Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) directs the flow of electricity 
over these lines, while transmission companies (e.g. Hydro One) own, operate, and maintain 
the lines and towers (IESO, 2022a). Across Ontario, 60 local distribution companies (LDCs) own 
and operate additional assets (e.g. transformers) for business customers. Some larger industrial 
consumers connected to the high-voltage grid (transmission lines with equal or greater than 50 
kilovolts) purchase wholesale electricity from Ontario’s electricity market (IESO, 2022a). 
Ontario’s high-voltage system is also connected with neighbouring jurisdictions to enable 
importing and exporting from Ontario (e.g. with Manitoba, Quebec, New York, Michigan and 
Minnesota). The Ontario Energy Board (OEB) is involved in licensing transmission companies 
and reviewing and setting electricity rates across the province to protect the interests of 
consumers.  
Natural Gas Distribution 
As of 2019, Canada was the sixth larger producer of natural gas in the world, representing 4.3% 
of global supply (CER, 2022). While much discussion has focused on the phase-out of coal 
power and the existing electricity system being 92% greenhouse gas emissions free in 2020, 
natural gas is widely used across Ontario to produce electricity, to heat homes and facilities and 
for other fuels and purposes. Currently almost half (48%) of Ontario’s energy use comes from 
refined petroleum products, 28% from natural gas, 16% from electricity, 4% from biofuels and 
the remaining 4% from other fossil fuels (OEA, 2021). Natural gas is Ontario's most common 
heating source, servicing about 3.6 million homes and 160,000 businesses. Natural gas is also a 
major input for Ontario’s petrochemical industry, largely focused within Southwest Ontario and 
Sarnia and employing about 12,000 people (Ontario Ministry of Energy, 2017). Almost all of 
Ontario’s natural gas comes from outside the province and is delivered by interprovincial 
pipelines, which are under federal jurisdiction and regulated by the Canada Energy Regulator 
(CER) (MOE, 2017). In Ontario, the Ontario Energy Board regulates the natural gas sector and 
approves distribution rates and pricing, as well as providing licenses. Increasing reliance on 
natural gas-fired electricity runs counter to transitioning to net zero targets and in fact may 
weaken attractiveness for industries looking to shift to low carbon electricity (Canadian Climate 
Institute, 2022). 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report

Telecommunications 
The telecommunications industry provides critical transmission of information between sites 
either wirelessly or based on wired infrastructure. Regulated by the Canadian Radio-Television 
and Telecommunications Commission, this industry is reliant upon telecommunications 
infrastructure owned by five companies: Bell, Rogers, Shaw, Telus, and Quebecor. The CRTC 
regulates telecommunications companies operating the wired and wireless networks used by 
residents in the event of emergencies (e.g. connecting to 911 call centres), and in regulating 
business licenses based upon policy as it relates to market share, rates, and services.  
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the telecommunications sector’s contribution to GDP slowed in 
2020 but fared significantly better than Ontario’s economy as a whole (CRTC, 2022). GDP 
contribution and jobs supported by the telecommunications industry were estimated to be up 
to $70.7 billion in 2020, employing around 596,000 people (CWTA, 2022). This economic 
contribution was driven by the telecommunications industry’s sustained and significant capital 
investment in 2020, with more than $11 billion invested in wireless and wireline connectivity 
(CRTC, 2022). Despite declining revenues during the COVID-19 pandemic, wireless carriers, as a 
group, reported slightly higher earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization 
(EBITDA) margin, lower churn (subscriber turnover) rates, and increased capital investments on 
5G networks. Consumers also used more data than ever before, and subscriptions rose to larger 
data plans. In 2020, 84.4% of Canadians owned a smartphone, an increase of 4.1 percentage 
points since 2018 (Statistics Canada, 2022g). 
Direct and Indirect Impacts 
Electrical Power Generation and Transmission, Control and Distribution  
Electrical power generation can be impacted by climate change in a variety of ways and in part 
depends on the energy source being used for generation and where infrastructure is located. 
Generation processes more reliant upon natural resources, such as the volume of water 
required for hydropower and the temperature and availability of water used for cooling in 
nuclear power, can be considered be at relatively higher risk than those with more internal-
driven processes (e.g. natural gas power plants). Similarly, where electrical power generation 
occurs along shorelines and/or rivers, additional climate variability or relatively higher risk may 
be present (e.g. due to extreme weather, storm surge and/or erosion).  
Increases in water temperature are likely to reduce generation efficiency due to less thermal 
capacity for generation, especially where water availability is also affected. Hydropower 
generation may be particularly impacted by dry conditions or drought, should water availability 
be reduced. Similarly, warmer water resources that are used for cooling purposes (e.g. for 
nuclear power generation) constrain the cooling function in the generation process. Rising air 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 403  
temperatures may reduce technological or process efficiency (Burillo, 2018) and limit output 
(CRTC, 2022).  
Regardless of how electricity is generated, consumer demand for energy is expected to rise, 
particularly at peak times in the summer season, which will change the ability to produce and 
deliver it reliably (US EPA, 2017). Section 10.2 describes cross-sectoral considerations 
associated with energy security – including generation, transmission, control, and distribution.  
Electricity transmission, control, and distribution can be impacted by changes in extreme heat, 
changing Growing Degree Days, mean and extreme precipitation, wildfire, among other 
hazards. The following provides several examples of climate impacts on transmission, control, 
and distribution companies. Rising air temperatures and extreme heat can lead to decreased 
efficiency of thermal cooling and individual components of assets to become inoperable due to 
protection devices cutting off power flow if too high for the weather conditions (Burillo, 2018). 
Higher air temperatures can also result in reduced capacity for above ground power lines to 
safely carry electricity. If transmission or distribution system capacity is significantly reduced, 
this can lead to failures, brownouts, or blackouts (Burillo, 2018). Wildfires can lead to asset 
damage or total loss of infrastructure depending on their size and extent. For example, if 
wildfires burn under power lines, components can fail due to air ionization. Extreme 
precipitation and storms can blow trees or other objects into power lines and cause outages. 
Similarly, extreme precipitation can result in flooding of underground infrastructure (e.g. 
substations) or erode hardware and underground power lines. Lastly, climate hazards can 
disrupt supply chains, thereby leading to rising costs of materials, fuel, and important insurance 
in responding to climate impacts on transmission, control and distribution infrastructure 
(Burillo, 2018).  
These impacts on both generation, transmission, control, and distribution could lead to 
financial impacts such as decreased serviceable lifespan, reduction in generating station output, 
shifts in consumer demand daily or seasonally, and increased variability in, or rising costs to, to 
key industrial inputs (e.g. materials, water, ambient air, fuel, insurance). Health and safety 
impacts may also become increasingly frequent as a result of climate conditions hazards, such 
as downed power lines or infrastructure presenting a hazard, or power outages during extreme 
conditions (e.g. heatwaves) due a lack of cooling for more vulnerable populations such as 
seniors.  
Natural Gas Distribution  
Natural gas distribution impacts are dependent upon the state, condition, and location of 
infrastructure, and particularly whether it is below or above ground. The extent to which 
distribution may be impacted depends on the condition of individual assets (Antoniou et al., 
2020). Climate change is anticipated to influence (possibly worsen) the integrity or reliability of 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 404  
existing pipelines and their associated infrastructure upstream and downstream. For example, 
extreme precipitation may lead to flooding that can damage facilities or impact construction 
activities and the ability to upgrade assets, whereas wildfires could lead to gas venting from 
leaks in compressors or a higher risk of pipelines being ignited by sparks or embers from 
wildfires (Burillo, 2018). 
Broadly, impacts can be characterized as operational loss and damage, higher variability on 
consumer demand and on consumption that may lead to changes in costs for materials, fuel 
and insurance. Assets may experience a shortened serviceable lifespan, or have a reduced 
capacity in distribution (e.g. compressor ratings) and rising costs that could influence service 
disruptions or annual revenues. The natural gas distribution industry also faces rising transition 
risks as international, national, and provincial policies shift in accordance with achieving 
greenhouse gas emissions targets and achieving low carbon energy systems. Shifting regulation, 
policy and market share, and the uncertainty or rate of change surrounding it, may pose risks to 
companies and businesses (and it is in part for this reason, some companies are diversifying 
services and investments).  
Telecommunications 
Climate impacts to telecommunication companies are varied depending upon their 
infrastructure footprint and the climate variables that pose risks to these systems. A subset of 
physical climate impacts is described below. Increasing air temperatures, including extreme 
heat, is expected to add additional burden for cooling equipment, which may lead to increased 
operating temperatures of network equipment, malfunction, or failure. Rising temperatures are 
also expected to reduce the lifespans that telecommunication companies own and operate, or 
rely upon from other companies, and thus increased costs or replacement of asset components 
may be needed (Adams and Steeves, 2014).  
Changes in precipitation (e.g. rain in the winter season) or extreme precipitation may lead to 
flooding of low-lying areas or impacts to underground or ground-level assets. Increases in 
precipitation, coupled with rising air temperatures (or humidity), could also affect the radio 
spectrum on which wireless communications rely upon. Extreme precipitation events, for 
example, could disrupt some transmitted signals or require increased transmission power to 
withstand poorer weather conditions. As a result, this may restrict customers supported within 
a given region or spectrum band (Adams and Steeves, 2014). Extreme weather events can also 
disrupt materials supply, damage assets or transmitters, overhead cables or disrupt service 
delivery and lead to outages. Evidence also suggests that there needs to be additional research 
focused on the connection between climate risks to telecommunications companies and the 
information and communications technology (ICT) sector (see Section 6.7.6). Data centres, 
storage and network inputs, parts and services that are rely upon one another, or that are 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 405  
interdependent (Adams and Steeves, 2014) could be considered an important next research 
priority to characterize climate change risks and adaptation opportunities. 
Risk Results  
The risk to Utility Services was assessed by Level 2 category and by region across Ontario. Recall 
that these risk scores are representative of one typical company or business operating with the 
industry and based upon possible financial loss measured as a function of annual revenue. Risk 
scores were determined for current, 2050s and 2080s under a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5) 
and moderate emissions scenario (RCP4.5). Table 9.27 summarizes Utility Services risks by Level 
2 category for each time period, operating under a RCP8.5 scenario.  
Across the four Level 2 categories, the relatively higher current risk was determined to be 
within the electrical transmission, control, and distribution industry. This risk is currently 
evaluated to be ‘medium’ and rises to ‘high’ by mid-century. The relatively higher risk now is 
associated with impacts due to extreme heat particularly at times where demand is highest and 
can lead to infrastructure failure and associated financial losses with power outages. However, 
it is critical to emphasize that unchanging risk scores over time do not indicate that the absolute 
level of risk (e.g. driven by a rising frequency of extreme weather events) is anticipated to be 
unchanging out to the end of the century.  
Electrical power generation was determined to be at currently ‘low’ risk but this risk is expected 
to rise quickly by 2050s and 2080s reflecting rising extreme temperatures. For example, a 
scenario with electrical power generation that becomes significantly impaired as a result of a 
single extreme heat risk event, could lead to a significant reduction in business service activity 
for a short period of time (e.g. days) depending upon the mode of power generation. This could 
represent a low proportion of annual revenue loss. 
Risks associated with natural gas distribution are also anticipated to rise by end of century, 
though not as quickly as the risks to companies within the electrical power generation industry. 
This is reflective of ‘low’ risk currently and in the 2050s but rising to ‘medium’ risk by the 2080s. 
Natural gas distribution is similarly characterized and in the case of pipelines, buried 
infrastructure may be impacted somewhat less frequently than assets above or on-ground. 
However, it must be emphasized that these results are based upon a single climate hazard 
event occurring. Damage to pipelines due to other infrastructure (e.g. rupture due to digging, 
impact from ships where pipes are below water, etc.) and due to cascading climate events (e.g. 
flooding, followed by freezing and thawing, may undermine the structural ability of soil 
surrounding buried infrastructure) may be higher. Thus, operational processes, maintenance 
and inspection efforts by companies in natural gas distribution are critical to ensure safe and 
continued service delivery.  
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 406  
Climate risks to telecommunication businesses are expected to increase from ‘medium’ to 
‘high’ by end of century. Increasing heat events can impact assets (e.g. towers) and their 
capacity and performance, resulting in financial losses to companies that own and operate 
them. For telecommunications companies, for example, under a scenario with electricity supply 
disruption and infrastructure performance reduced to 0% (no service) as a result of a single 
climate event such as extreme precipitation, it could result in a significant reduction in business 
service activity for a short period of time (e.g. days), but that this is anticipated to be a very low 
proportion of annual revenue loss.

9.8 Climate Change Opportunities  
Evaluating all risk scores across Level 1 and 2 categories for the Business and Economy Area of 
Focus indicates that no industry has a decreasing risk profile into the future. In other words, 
climate change is not creating opportunities based upon existing conditions across Ontario’s 
businesses and economic system. This increases the imperative that Ontario’s businesses and 
economy must enable and be prepared to reduce and manage risks in the face of continued 
climate change. Section 9.2 notes that the economic conditions and the businesses driving 
Ontario’s economy are already within a period of rapid change due to technological 
advancements, globalization, and other external factors (OCC, 2019). Therefore, as businesses 
and industries across Ontario evolve and change, opportunities exist to take advantage of 
resilience-based investments, new technologies and expansion into new markets as global 
markets change in the face of climate disruptions. 
To achieve economic growth, prosperity and a resilient business ecosystem, investment 
decisions must strive to quantify and acknowledge benefits and costs. Globally, studies have 
found that the benefits in investing in resilient infrastructure, operations, preparedness, 
technologies, and other systems outweigh the costs with high benefit-cost ratios (OECD, 2018). 
Given the interdependencies and cascading impacts of climate change, measuring costs and 
benefits will be a critical source of evidence to support adaptation decisions. For this reason, 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommends that decisions consider the 
monetary value of costs and benefits along with less tangible outcomes. 
Businesses also stand a chance to benefit in the medium- to long-term from investments and 
upcoming infrastructure projects by the Governments of Ontario and Canada (OCC, 2021). 
These include investments in broadband, transportation infrastructure, digital, and green 
initiatives. These projects could help stimulate demand and set the stage for job creation, 
opportunities to innovate, and growth in real GDP that will pivot the province to remain 
sustainably competitive at the national and international levels (OCC, 2021). 
Similarly, Section 10.0 describes the opportunities that exist in adaptation among multiple 
sectors. For example, significant additional infrastructure investment is needed to meet 
greenhouse gas emissions targets and ensure a reliable, equitable and affordable energy 
system for Ontarians, which should be considered an opportunity to enable infrastructure and 
business resilience while minimizing service disruptions and keeping energy affordable. 
In other words, fostering resilient economic development is a climate change opportunity for 
Ontario and its businesses. In 2019, the Ontario Chamber Commerce also identified several key 
take-aways related to modern economic development to foster resilience (OCC, 2019):  
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 409  
- 
Modernize governance of economic development such as that it empowers a wide 
range of stakeholders outside government, including businesses, post-secondary 
institutions, and not-for-profit organizations 
- 
Foster regional collaboration and economic reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples, and 
the use of data to mobilize local assets 
- 
Cultivate ecosystems of talent, trade and infrastructure by fostering an environment 
conducive to business growth necessary to ensure the long-term success of both 
traditional and emerging sectors  
- 
Build regional capacity across Ontario for innovation to improve commercialization and 
technology adoption, strengthening and building regional innovation centres, expanding 
broadband internet access, and facilitating cluster development 
9.9 Adaptive Capacity of Ontario’s Business and Economy Area 
of Focus  
9.9.1 Adaptive Capacity Summary  
Industries within Ontario have widely varying levels of existing capacity to reduce industry and 
company-level risk to actual or anticipated climate change impacts. While an empirical stock-
take of how Ontario companies are prepared to deal with current and future climate-related 
extreme was not within the scope of this assessment, there are numerous examples of how 
businesses of all sizes and across industries are adopting measures that can support their 
resilience to climate change. There are also examples of Ontario businesses providing 
‘adaptation goods and services’ that can help to address barriers to adaptation, in particular for 
small to medium enterprises (SMEs).  
Adaptation measures and strategies to manage climate risks may be classified as anticipatory 
and planned, or autonomous and reactive. That is, measures may be designed and 
implemented to directly address anticipated future change, or they may be in place for other 
business reasons but with the co-benefit of enhancing resilience and Adaptive Capacity. 
Table 9.28 presents an assessment of the current level of Adaptive Capacity for each Level 1 
category, with key considerations regarding the level of Adaptive Capacity. Adaptive Capacity 
has been evaluated for each Level 1 category and consider technology, resource availability, 
sector complexity and governance. Each of these categories has been evaluated in more detail 
and is contained in Appendix 10. 
Adaptive Capacity, as described in Section 2.4 of this report, is an important component in 
considering relative climate change priorities. Ideally, an industry would have low climate risk 
and high Adaptive Capacity. Any Level 1 or 2 category with relatively lower Adaptive Capacity 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 410  
and relatively higher climate risk can be considered a priority. For example, a ‘very high’ risk 
posed to manufacturing can be considered a higher priority based on the current Adaptive 
Capacity of the industry compared to that of a ‘very high’ risk posed to the finance and 
insurance Industry. As another example, higher risks to arts, entertainment & recreation Level 2 
category that were determined as part of the PCCIA considered alongside this industry’s 
‘medium’ Adaptive Capacity imply additional requirements to build resilience for businesses in 
this industry.

 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 411  
9.9.2 Technology  
The level of technological Adaptive Capacity across many Industries is often highly dependent 
on the size and scale of a business. Larger organizations for example have more ability to 
conduct market research, evaluate technological solutions to meet their needs, and flexibility in 
testing potential technology in support of continued operations in the face of increasing climate 
risks. For the purposes of the PCCIA, technological Adaptive Capacity was evaluated to be ‘high’ 
across six industries, and ‘medium’ across five industries assessed.  
Highly Adaptive Industries  
Several industries are considered to have a ‘high’ technological Adaptive Capacity: construction; 
finance and insurance; forestry, fishing, and hunting economies; mining, quarrying and oil and 
gas extraction; transportation economy; and utility services. The rationale behind why capacity 
is considered high differs depending on the industry. For example, industry standard practices 
in finance and insurance companies indicate a high degree of flexibility, such as actuarial risk 
management for natural hazards and peril losses, and their ongoing efforts to improve climate 
risk data and modelling capabilities to assess and disclose risk and offset financial impacts. 
Utility companies have historically been involved in assessing climate impacts on electricity 
generation, transmission and distribution via vulnerability and risk assessments and identifying 
technology solutions to mitigate potential impacts. As another example, construction 
companies have been actively involved in evaluating and adopting climate-resilient engineering 
construction techniques and in responding to building code updates for climate-resilient 
infrastructure.  
Moderately Adaptive Industries  
Accommodation and food services; arts, entertainment, and recreation; information and 
cultural industries, manufacturing, and retail trade are all industries where Adaptive Capacity is 
considered ‘medium’. These industries all rely upon real estate and infrastructure for the 
continued delivery of services. Industry-owned and leased buildings are typically designed to 
code and engineering standards are based on the historical climate that existed when they 
were built. In other words, businesses relying upon real estate for continued operations are not 
necessarily equipped to cope with future climates. It is generally unclear as to the level of 
generalized adoption of onsite backup energy supply (e.g. generators) or technological 
solutions to reduce risks to operations or supply chains for materials and commodities. Larger 
organizations have begun to assess risk and identify risk mitigation measures based on 
technological solutions, but widespread industry-level investment is not yet sufficient to 
consider Adaptive Capacity high from a technological perspective.  
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 412  
9.9.3 Resource Availability  
Resource availability refers to the human, financial and natural resources available to support in 
preparing and responding to climate impacts. Resource availability was evaluated across all 
Leve 1 industries, and only three were found to have a ‘high’ level of Adaptive Capacity. The 
remaining industries are all considered to be ‘medium’. These are characterized below.  
Highly Adaptive Industries  
The three industries considered to have the most resources available to them in preparing and 
responding to climate impacts are finance and insurance; mining, quarrying and oil and gas 
extraction; and utility services. Organizations in the finance and insurance industry are making 
significant financial investments to build knowledge on climate science and risk modeling 
competencies via direct hires, acquisitions, and partnerships among technical firms and 
academia. Companies in mining, quarrying and oil and gas have historically assessed hazards 
and risk and have contracted or hired hydrology experts and experienced staff in understanding 
regulations and in applying for and managing permits to take and discharge water. Knowledge 
resources also exist in the form of guidance for companies in this industry, and include 
publications from the Mining Association of Canada. Utility companies manage assets that are 
long-lived and costly, with budgets approved by regulators based on accepted rate structures. 
In recent years, rates have risen significantly to enable investments in resources to harden 
assets and support the knowledge for resilient-informed decision making. 
Moderately Adaptive Industries  
All other industries assessed as part of the Business and Economy Area of Focus are considered 
to have ‘medium’ Adaptive Capacity as it relates to resource availability. In these industries, 
there is often emergency management resources, or staff involved in traditional business 
continuity planning. Similarly, arts, entertainment, and recreation industry associations are 
becoming more engaged and aware of climate change risks. While some progress has been 
made, smaller organizations and businesses often lack the resources needed to ensure 
resiliency. There is also insufficient evidence to fully characterize the extent to which resources 
are available or applied in many industries including manufacturing applications, and 
companies involved in transportation of goods. 
9.9.4 Governance  
Governance refers to the institutional support, policies, and networks available to enhance the 
implementation of adaptation measures. For the purposes of the PCCIA, all industries assessed 
within the Business and Economy Area of Focus are considered to have ‘medium’ Adaptive 
Capacity related to governance. In general, across most industries there are several factors that 
have led to this evaluation. These factors include:  
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 413  
- 
Emergency and crisis management structures are often in place in larger sized 
organizations, providing chain of command and reporting structures in the event of 
significant impacts or disruptions 
- 
An increasing number of organizations, policies and networks are available with climate 
risk-focused research efforts to support organizations and advocate for better risk-
informed regulations and decision making 
- 
Pilot initiatives and pilot projects are being initiated or are underway among networks 
and peer-to-peer learning is taking place across numerous industries 
- 
In regulated industries, regulators are beginning to consider climate science as part of 
guidance and rate structures to support resilient investments 
These considerations of governance reveal that no industry is considered to have a high 
Adaptive Capacity in this category. Significant work remains to be done to provide adequate 
guidance and robust governance systems to enable resilient operations and investments. 
9.9.5 Sector Complexity  
Sector complexity refers to the number of players, stakeholders, decision-makers within a 
particular industry and their ability to make decisions and change course. The higher an 
industry’s complexity, the lower the capacity to adapt. Among the 11 business and economy 
industries assessed, seven are considered to have ‘high’ complexity and four industries are 
considered to have ‘medium’ complexity.  
Industries with Medium Sector Complexity 
Four industries are considered to have a relatively moderate sector complexity, or medium 
Adaptive Capacity. These industries are construction; forestry, fishing and hunting economies; 
mining, quarrying, oil and gas extraction; and utility services. The construction industry for 
example tends to be dominated by a small number of large construction and engineering 
companies, whose main risk exposure is via supply chain disruption and material availability. In 
the forestry, fishing and hunting economies, there is a wide range of company sizes, but in 
general complexity is not as high with main climate risks via climate risks posed to terrestrial 
and aquatic ecosystems upon which their business activity depends. In mining, quarrying, oil 
and gas extraction, there are a moderate number of companies with differences between sub-
sectors. While water conservation and re-use technologies and practices are available, these 
approaches have limits in ability to mitigate disruption in availability of water for industrial 
production. Lastly, in utility services, the complexity is considered relatively low based on the 
handful of electricity generating corporations, Hydro One and local distribution companies. 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report         
 414  
Industries with High Sector Complexity 
All other industries assessed as part of the Business and Economy Area of Focus are considered 
to have high sector complexity – or ‘low’ Adaptive Capacity. All these industries are considered 
to have a significant number of organizations ranging in size. Significant heterogeneity is also 
present between different regions, size and the extent to which risk may impact services 
provided. For example, in manufacturing there are a large number of companies involved 
across numerous sub-sectors in wide-ranging sizes. In this industry, there is heavy reliance on 
third parties (e.g. electricity supply, leasing of buildings) to implement risk mitigation and 
resilience measures on behalf of industry companies. Complexity of local and global just-in-time 
supply chains also exacerbates the complexity and risk of supply chain disruption and impact to 
materials/inputs availability. 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        415  
9.10 Climate Adaptation Priorities 
Current Adaptation Priorities  
As described in Section 9.9, all Level 1 industries as part of Business and Economy have been 
assessed to have a ‘medium’ or ‘high’ Adaptive Capacity. In other words, no industry is 
considered to have a ‘low’ Adaptive Capacity based upon technology, resource availability, 
governance, and sector complexity. When combining these with the regional Adaptive Capacity 
ratings, industries in Central, Northeast and Northwest regions are found to have the lowest 
capacity rating for this Area of Focus, with a combined capacity rating of ‘medium’.  
This Area of Focus has the highest combined Adaptive Capacity ratings, with financial and 
insurance, mining, quarrying and oil/gas extraction and utility services within the Southwest 
and Eastern regions, exhibiting a ‘high’ combined capacity rating. These same industries in 
Central, Northeast, Northwest and Far North regions are deemed to have ‘higher’ capacity 
levels, compared to the industries listed as adaptation priorities  
Based on higher levels of Adaptive Capacity reflected throughout this sector, climate adaptation 
priorities for current and future timeframes can be considered a reflection of those with the 
highest risk profiles and ‘medium’ capacity levels. A summary of current adaptation priorities is 
provided in Table 9.29.

Advancing Adaptation  
The benefits of taking action to address climate risk via planned adaptation interventions are 
generally appreciated to outweigh the costs, over the medium to long term. The areas for 
building climate resilience comprise both actions that can be undertaken at the industry and 
firm-level, as well as actions that can be implemented by governing bodies to establish enabling 
conditions and/or incentives for adaptation.  
The PCCIA Adaptation Best Practices Report (External Resource – 2) categorizes adaptation 
options for industries within the Business and Economy Area of Focus. Ontario has the solutions 
and knowledge to act and lessen or avoid many climate risks that industries face. A high-level 
summary is provided in Table 9.31, with industry-specific adaptation options available in the 
PCCIA Adaptation Best Practices Report.

10.0 Cross-Sectoral Considerations  
Climate change impacts occur against the backdrop of complex and dynamic social and 
ecological systems. Most conventional risk assessments consider discrete themes or sectors 
with some recognition of interconnections. Climate change can cause cascading and 
compounding effects, depending on the exposure and Adaptive Capacity of systems. 
A systems approach to building resilience through adaptation can combat risks at multiple 
points within a system and achieve more than responses aimed at single themes. A cross-
sectoral assessment of climate change impacts and identification of areas where impacts 
cascade or amplify can help further prioritize resilience needs and target adaptation responses. 
Figure 10.1 illustrates how capacity building (e.g. equity improvements, policy coherence and 
improved decision-making etc.) can support effective adaptation to climate risks across the 
Area of Focus and cross-sectoral themes.  
The assessment of climate change impacts within each Areas of Focus has led to the 
identification of themes that encompass more than one (1) Area of Focus. There are 
interdependencies among the five Areas of Focus and therefore several pathways along which 
impacts can traverse. Indirect and cascading impacts identified within each Area of Focus have 
informed the components of the cross-sectoral analysis. Each theme conveys climate impacts 
relevant to Ontario. External influences, notably those outside (the control) of Ontario are 
identified, however, detailed characterization of those external factors has not been 
undertaken. The five cross-sectoral themes are: 
- 
Food Security  
- 
Energy Security  
- 
Water Security  
- 
Human Health, Safety and Well-being 
- 
Community Function 
These themes were identified through review of the climate change literature and were 
considered against a suite of criteria noted below:  
- 
Typical cross-sectoral information included in climate change impact and risk 
assessment reports at various scales across Canada, the United States and 
internationally; 
- 
Themes, priorities, or concepts raised or repeatedly identified as important in PCCIA 
literature review and PCCIA engagement sessions;  
- 
Topics identified in the PCCIA methodology framework as spanning across multiple 
Areas of Focus.

Figure 10.1: A conceptual framework outlining the interconnectedness between each Area of 
Focus and cross-sectoral theme, and the role of capacity building to effectively adapt and 
reduce climate risk across Ontario.  
 
 
 
Although people are not the only possible focus for impacts from climate change, a people-
centered approach to cross-sectoral impacts was adopted to demonstrate how impacts 
ultimately cascade from each Area of Focus into the People and Communities Area of Focus. 
Taking a people-centric approach labels a single and consistent end point and allows for 
consistent framing of the cascading impacts across every Area of Focus as they affect people.  
A diagram for each of the themes illustrates (from left to right), how climate impacts (light grey 
boxes) cascade through each Area of Focus (represented in green), to system components or 
impacts (represented in orange), and subsequently impact key theme dimensions (represented 
in purple). Interactions illustrated in the diagrams demonstrate direct climate impacts (dark 
solid line), cascading impacts between Areas of Focus, system components and key dimensions 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        421  
(lighter solid line), and interconnected linkages across Areas of Focus associated with the theme 
(light dotted line). See Figure 10.2 for a template.  
The following definitions provide additional context on each component included in each of the 
individual cross-sectoral diagrams.  
Direct impacts are defined as those resulting from climate variables on the Area(s) of Focus. 
The interaction between a climate variable and its direct impact has been quantified as part of 
the PCCIA. 
Cascading impacts can be understood as a direct climate impact triggering a series of impacts 
across several systems and sectors (e.g. domino or contagion effects).  
Interconnected linkages are a way to represent the inherent connectedness between all Areas 
of Focus, where components are intrinsically dependent, or rely upon, one another to provide a 
function under the context of each cross-sectoral theme. (e.g. linkages between the 
Infrastructure Area of Focus and Business and Economy Area of Focus under Food Security 
represent the interconnectedness between critical infrastructure systems and supply chain 
function). 
An Equity Lens has been applied to every diagram, which identifies unique factors or 
populations that may be disproportionately impacted associated with the cross-sectoral theme.

10.1 Food Security 
Overview 
Food security is achieved when “individuals have access to sufficient, safe, nutritious, and 
culturally appropriate food that meets their dietary needs” (Government of Ontario, 2017a). It 
is a multi-dimensional concept that can be influenced by various sectors and is affected by 
impacts that cascade through food systems.  
Food systems underpin food security, and are comprised of activities that span across all Areas 
of Focus in these areas: 
- 
Food production – encompasses commercial and non-commercial agriculture, livestock 
fisheries and aquaculture production, as well as the hunting, fishing and harvesting of 
traditional Indigenous foods  
- 
Food processing – involves the transformation of raw food inputs into retailed food 
products (e.g. washing, sanitizing and packaging)  
- 
Food distribution –involves the transportation of food products to users (e.g. grocery 
stores, restaurants etc.) 
- 
Food preparation and consumption – includes the preparation and consumption of food 
by the consumer  
Land use policy and food imports and exports have also been identified as system components. 
Their influence and role in food security is outlined below.  
This section outlines the linkages between climate risks within each Area of Focus, food systems 
and ultimately food security in Ontario. Climate change is expected to present several risks to 
provincial food systems, impacting key dimensions of food security such as: 
- 
Food Availability – production, distribution, and exchange of food  
- 
Food Accessibility – affordability, allocation, cultural preference 
- 
Food Utilization – nutritional value, social value, food safety  
- 
Food Stability – continuous and undisrupted availability and access 
Figure 10.3 below, illustrates how climate risks cascade through each Area of Focus 
(represented in green) to food system components (represented in orange), impacting the 
primary dimensions of food security (represented in purple).

Climate Risks to Ontario’s Food Systems and Food Security 
Food Production 
Food production is a foundational component of Ontario’s food system, encompassing all 
agricultural production activities (field crops, fruit and vegetable and livestock production), as 
well as fisheries, hunting and harvesting activities. Climate risks to food production in Ontario 
directly influence food security by impacting food availability (Schnitter and Berry, 2019; 
Campbell et al., 2014).  
As outlined in the Food and Agriculture Area of Focus climate change is expected to increase 
risks across Ontario’s agricultural sector, directly impacting field crop, fruit and vegetable and 
livestock production. Losses can be compounded by indirect climate impacts to soil health, 
water availability, pests and disease and livestock feed shortages. Climate risks to food 
production in Ontario could result in food availability implications should crop and produce 
yields and/or livestock production decline substantially (Schnitter and Berry, 2019; Mbow et al., 
2019). 
Infrastructure systems across Ontario play a critical role in food production, from the farm to 
provincial level. As described in the Infrastructure Area of Focus, utility and transportation 
systems are vulnerable to impacts of several climate variables, leading to service disruptions for 
food production. For example, transportation is critical for food production activities, ensuring 
that inputs (e.g. seed, fuel, fertilizers, and equipment) are delivered to producers in an efficient 
manner (Food and Agriculture Organization, 2018) Climate-related impacts to infrastructure 
could result in supply disruptions and shortages for agricultural producers and subsequently 
increase risks to food availability in Ontario.  
As illustrated in the figure above, the natural environment and associated services also play a 
critical role in food production for the province. The Natural Environment Area of Focus 
outlines how climate risks are expected to impact access to water quality and quantity, soil and 
ecosystem health, the role of pollinator species and shifting ranges of native species. These 
impacts threaten food availability, affect irrigation and field applications, soil productivity, 
pollination, and biocontrol of pests in agricultural production. Additionally, changes in species 
distribution and abundance impact food availability for communities that rely on subsistence 
hunting, fishing, and harvesting activities as primary food sources (Food and Agriculture 
Organization, 2018).  
Food Processing 
Food processing is another component of food security and refers to activities that transform 
raw food inputs into retail food products, including cleaning, sanitizing, packaging, and 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       425  
processing. Climate risks to food processing in Ontario impact multiple elements of food 
security, including food availability and accessibility. 
As outlined in the figure above, climate-driven impacts within several Areas of Focus can impact 
food processing activities. Limitations to water supply could adversely impact food processors 
and manufacturers that rely on water use for operations. Energy supply and distribution 
systems could also be impacted by several different climate variables hazards (extreme weather 
events and flooding, extreme heat etc.). Prolonged power outages in processing and storage 
facilities without sufficient backup power could result in significant inventory losses and 
increase food insecurity in certain regions (Mbow et al., 2019).  
Ontario’s food processing sector is also dependent on reliable transportation networks to 
ensure harvested crops and livestock products are efficiently delivered to food manufacturers, 
warehouses and other facilities (e.g. grain handling). As outlined in the Infrastructure and 
Business and Economy Areas of Focus, climate change presents a wide range of risks to 
transportation networks and economies in Ontario. Disruptions and delays of food inputs to 
processors and manufacturers can result in food availability shortages, and implications for 
food accessibility through increased food prices in response to supply chain disruptions 
(Schnitter and Berry, 2019).  
Food Distribution 
The distribution of food is another critical component of the food system, with direct linkages 
to availability, accessibility, and stability dimensions of food security. Reliable transportation 
networks and supporting economies are imperative for food distribution throughout the 
province and to maintain access to domestic and international export markets. As noted in the 
Infrastructure Area of Focus, climate change poses risks to the functionality of Ontario’s 
transportation system, resulting in implications for food distribution to markets, retailers, and 
consumers. Food distribution impacts are of particular concern for remote northern 
communities (e.g. the Far North), with lower capacity to produce and store food supplies 
locally. Additionally, prolonged disruptions to public transportation systems in developed 
regions can impact food accessibility, as many Ontarians rely on public transit to access food 
distribution sites (e.g. grocery stores).  
Climate-related impacts on energy supply and distribution can be impactful for food 
distribution facilities without sufficient backup power, resulting in significant inventory losses 
and impacts to food availability (Mbow et al., 2019). For example, the Ontario Food Terminal is 
in a flood-prone area within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), with no permanent backup energy 
source. In the event of a prolonged power outage to the terminal from extreme weather or 
flooding, there would be significant inventory losses, leading to food availability and stability 
challenges in several regions across the province (Zeuli, 2018b).  
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       426  
Climate risks to the Business and Economy Area of Focus, could compound impacts to Ontario’s 
food distribution systems due to the economic impacts linked to barriers in accessing domestic 
and international markets and local business disruptions (C40 Cities, 2018), These impacts 
would cause additional implications for food accessibility through increased food prices. 
Ultimately, climate risks to the food distribution sector could impact several dimensions of food 
security across the province.  
Food Preparation and Consumption 
Preparation and consumption are at the consumer end of the food system and directly relate to 
utilization considerations within food security. Availability and accessibility of sufficient, 
nutritious, safe and culturally appropriate food sources is desirable for all Ontarians (Schnitter 
and Berry, 2019; Government of Ontario, 2017a).  
Climate risks identified and assessed under the Food and Agriculture and the Natural 
Environment Area of Focus can have cascading implications for food safety and caninherently 
impact food utilization in Ontario. Climate change influences the growth, survival, abundance, 
and range of pathogens throughout food systems, including during food production, processing, 
distribution, preparation, and consumption. This could increase the likelihood of foodborne 
illnesses in Ontario, resulting in impacts to food utilization and ultimately human health (Harper 
and Schnitter, 2022).  
Evidence suggests that climate change could contribute to declines in nutritional content and 
density of some agricultural products which would lead to lower levels of nutritional diversity 
for consumers (Myers et al., 2017; Fanzo et al., 2018). Climate risks to biodiversity as noted in 
the Natural Environment Area of Focus affect availability of traditional food sources and 
nutrient access. These impacts would cause implications for food utilization as availability and 
accessibility of nutrient-rich and culturally appropriate foods declines across different regions of 
the province (Myers et al., 2017; Fanzo et al., 2018).  
Climate-related impacts to the food preparation and consumption components of the system 
was not assessed under the Food and Agriculture Area of Focus. The indirect economic impacts 
resulting from climate risks are highlighted throughout the Business and Economy Area of 
Focus. The impacts outlined above can indirectly impact restaurant and hospitality businesses 
across the province through increased costs and food safety risks. 
Equity 
Climate-related risks to food security vary across Ontario and stand to contribute to existing 
vulnerability and inequities. An equity lens has been applied to this analysis (see Figure 10.3) to 
demonstrate how climate risks to food security can be amplified for populations with pre-
existing vulnerability.  
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       427  
It is estimated that one in six (16.1%) households in Ontario are food insecure (Tarasuk et al., 
2022). A variety of social, cultural, and economic determinants can be used to identify pre-
existing vulnerability to food insecurity in Ontario. Low-income households, remote regions, 
and Indigenous Communities have been identified as those being at a disproportionate risk of 
food insecurity in Ontario. These factors are important to consider when assessing how climate 
risks on food security could be exacerbated for vulnerable populations (Government of Ontario, 
2017a).  
As climate change alters food availability (supply) which affects food prices, risks to food 
security will be amplified for low-income households. Neighbourhoods categorized as ‘food 
deserts’ are particularly vulnerable, as these regions face pre-existing challenges with accessing 
quality and affordable food products (Harper and Schnitter, 2022; Schnitter and Berry, 2019). 
Remote regions of the province (e.g. the Far North) have fewer food purchasing choices, limited 
transportation options (e.g. no public transit options), lower capacity to store food products 
locally, and generally experience higher retail food prices (Myers et al., 2017). Food availability 
becomes limited if transportation infrastructure is disrupted (e.g. shortened winter road access) 
from climate-related events, resulting in food access, availability, utilization, and stability issues, 
particularly for remote communities in the Far North region.  
Many Indigenous Communities rely on the land and water for sustenance and food security. 
Under a changing climate, these food sources are being threatened as the distribution and 
abundance of species changes. Indigenous Communities who rely on harvesting traditional 
foods as their main food source will be greatly impacted, as access to certain plant, fish (e.g. 
walleye and brook trout) and mammal species (e.g. moose) from their traditional territories 
may be limited or entirely lost in some areas. These ecological changes compound risks to food 
security, resulting in declines to diet quality and nutrient access and accompanying impacts to 
mental health, cultural well-being, and social cohesion (Harper and Schnitter, 2022). 
External Influences 
Food security stands to be affected by population growth in Ontario. Growth, particularly in 
urban centres as projected, will place two-fold pressure on agriculture. First, and simply, larger 
numbers of people will increase demand and place pressure on food supply. Second, some 
urban centres will expand their footprint to be able to provide housing for population increases 
thus putting pressure on adjacent agricultural land.  
As highlighted in Figure 10.3, land-use policy also has a significant influence on sustaining 
agricultural productivity and availability across the province. These considerations are 
necessary for building climate resilience and reducing vulnerability across Ontario’s food 
systems.  
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       428  
Both international and national dimensions, beyond Ontario’s borders influence provincial food 
systems significantly, and therefore play an important role in food security. As experienced 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, impacts to food and agriculture subsectors across the globe, 
can have detrimental impacts on Ontario’s food system and associated revenue, including 
impacts to food availability (supply chains), accessibility (cost), and stability (food shortages) 
(Sood, 2021). In addition, patterns of international trade, market conditions and drivers, supply 
chain impacts and disruptions, population dynamics, available labour force, as well as climate-
related impacts on agriculture production in other domestic (e.g. prairie region) and 
international regions (e.g. tropical countries), have significant influence on food security in 
Ontario. These types of external influences should be considered in provincial resilience and 
response planning (Mosnier et al., 2014; Food and Agricultural Association Organization, 2018).  
Summary  
To summarize, climate impacts as viewed through the lens of food security dimensions are 
exemplified through this cross-sectoral analysis for Ontario. Climate risks are evident within all 
the dimensions of food security and highlight how vulnerable populations and food insecure 
communities and regions stand to be disproportionately affected by climate change. 
Adaptation measures that enhance climate resilience and consider the linkages between 
agriculture and interconnected sectors, such as the natural environment (e.g. protection of 
pollinator habitats and water conservation measures), business and economy (e.g. increasing 
resilience of agricultural supply chain) and infrastructure systems (e.g. energy and 
transportation infrastructure redundancy), will reduce existing vulnerability and strengthen 
provincial food security (Zeuli, 2018a; C40 Cities, 2018).

10.2 Energy Security 
Overview 
Energy security includes many elements but can be defined as the uninterrupted availability of 
energy sources at an affordable price (IEA, 2022). At its simplest, energy security involves long-
term considerations of timely investments to supply energy in line with economy development 
and environmental needs, as well as short term considerations ensuring the energy system can 
react promptly to sudden changes in the supply-demand balance (IEA, 2022). Factors that 
influence energy security include appropriate infrastructure, intensity, diversification, market 
transparency, and links with the environment and political decision-making.  
Resilient energy systems underpin short- and long-term energy security and are comprised of 
activities that traverse through Areas of Focus in the following areas: 
- 
Energy sources and supply – refers to the various energy resources that comprise 
Ontario’s current energy mix, such as nuclear, hydroelectricity, wind, solar, natural gas, 
biomass, and refined petroleum products, as well as potential future energy supply 
options such as hydrogen. 
- 
Energy generation – refers to the process of generating power and electricity from 
sources of primary energy, including various generation facilities and associated 
infrastructure. 
- 
Energy transmission and distribution – includes technology and infrastructure (of 
various size), such as powerlines, transmission lines, pipelines, freight, and other forms 
of energy transport. 
- 
Energy consumption – refers to the activity that is supported by infrastructure to bring 
energy products to market and the ultimate use of energy in any technology, service, 
manufacturing, transportation, or any other form relying on energy such as inhabiting a 
building. 
This section outlines the linkages between climate risks within each Area of Focus, energy 
systems and ultimately energy security in Ontario. Climate change is expected to present 
several risks to provincial energy systems, impacting dimensions of energy security including: 
- 
Energy access – refers to limitations to adequate or sufficient energy sources and/or a 
lack of sufficient energy infrastructure to support alternative choices in more rural or 
remote communities. 
- 
Energy affordability – includes energy pricing, and the ability for Ontarians to afford 
energy in any context in which they may require it, including areas that could be 
considered to be fuel or energy “poor” relative to other areas across the province.  
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       430  
- 
Energy demand and consumption – considers consumer behavioural patterns, how and 
where energy is consumed, changes in energy demand and potential over-consumption 
of energy. 
Importantly, energy security also includes the significant transformation underway in the 
energy sector. Consumer behaviour and demand is driving a transition from fossil fuel-based 
resources to renewable energy sources including low carbon fuels and alternative forms of 
electricity production. The result is a dynamic energy system in a time of rapid change where 
the various components such as forms (of energy), security, prices and demand/consumption 
are all affected by climate change. 
Figure 10.4 below. illustrates how climate risks cascade through each Area of Focus 
(represented in green) to energy system components (represented in orange), impacting the 
primary dimensions of energy security (represented in purple).

 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        432  
Climate Risks to Ontario’s Energy Systems and Energy Security 
Energy Supply 
Ontario’s energy supply mix is comprised of various forms that are used to provide critical 
power and heat to homes, fuel transportation of people and goods across the province and 
power industry to bring various products and services to market. Currently almost half (48%) of 
Ontario’s energy use (primarily transportation) comes from refined petroleum products, 28% 
from natural gas, 16% from electricity, 4% from biofuels and the remaining 4% from other fossil 
fuels (OEA, 2021).  
Energy needs across Ontario are currently met by a variety of energy sources. For example, 
Ontario’s electricity system comprises only 16% of energy use while the Province’s natural gas 
system, by comparison, provides almost double the energy Ontarians get from electricity, with 
demand for natural gas heating in the winter season being even higher (OEA, 2021). Stated 
differently, Ontario has a very clean electricity system; however, its energy system remains a 
significant source of emissions (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022b). In response 
to shifting policy, consumer demand and investments to expand the electricity system, the 
energy system will continue to experience transformation which will have implications for 
energy security. 
Climate change can pose risks to the sources and supplies from which energy is generated. This 
is particularly important as Ontario shifts to low carbon sources and finds opportunities for 
alternative sources of energy and fuel (e.g. changing biomass availability). One specific example 
of how climate change can impact energy sources and supplies is through changes to water 
(generation) resources. Declines in precipitation, either through total annual or variations of 
seasonal amounts, combined with high summertime evaporation may yield lower surface water 
volume and thus limit the ability to generate electricity in hydropower generation (University of 
Cambridge and World Energy Council, 2014). The seasonal (summer) energy security 
implications of this impact are significant in that it comes at a time when energy demand for 
cooling peaks. The result is inability to meet peak demand periods which would limit or cancel 
the ability to cool homes and people. The obvious cascading impact is risks to public health, 
most notably in adaptation-priority populations that are already predisposed to poor health 
outcomes. This example of cascading climate change impacts demonstrates both the 
interconnectedness between energy and other societal systems, and the way that climate 
change can create multiple impacts through the chain as experienced by people in 
communities. Resilience in the diversity of forms of energy supply will provide multiple benefits 
across further layers of the energy system in Ontario. 
 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        433  
Energy Generation 
Ontario’s electricity generating capacity is mainly located in southern parts of the province, but 
large hydro generating stations are also located in eastern Ontario in the Ottawa River Basin 
and Northeast Ontario in the Moose River Basin (CER, 2021). Climate change poses risks to the 
processes, operation, and capacity of power generation in Ontario. Increasing air and water 
temperatures can lead to less thermal capacity for power generation and decrease the 
efficiency of combustion turbines (Beecher and Kalmbach, 2012). Similarly, where water bodies 
or watercourses are adjacent to power generation facilities and used for cooling or receiving, 
water resources limitations may pose risks to the cooling efficiency of generation processes 
(University of Cambridge and World Energy Council, 2014). Certain aquatic species with 
sensitive thermal niches may also be negatively affected by increases in water temperature. In 
this context, managing the natural water resources and incorporating adaptation and resilience 
to the extent possible will help secure energy generation operations in the future.  
Extreme climate or weather events will also create economic or financial impacts to generation 
operations in the form of increased costs for businesses, communities and people. Should 
Ontario’s ability to generate sufficient and consistent energy be impacted climate change 
hazards, energy security implications could include rising costs of access being borne by 
consumers, intermittent access to energy during peak periods where demand exceeds supply, 
and possible cascading health and safety risks. These implications would be particularly 
pronounced in remote communities or among those with a historical lack of infrastructure or 
energy investment to meet their existing needs, such as Indigenous Communities in northern 
and remote locations. 
Energy Transmission and Distribution 
Climate change is also expected to pose risks to energy transmission and distribution across 
Ontario. The province’s existing electricity grid is characterized by both centralized generating 
stations as well as a large transmission and distribution system that stretches across the 
province. Natural gas distribution in Ontario also relies on a large network of transmission 
pipelines and distribution infrastructure (AMO, 2021). In both cases, climate change and 
extreme weather events can increase system demand or cause damage to distribution 
infrastructure (e.g. due to falling trees on power lines or flooding-related washouts of soil 
supporting buried pipelines) ultimately leading to energy system outages. Flooding of 
distribution infrastructure, stations or components of the distribution networks can lead to 
damage and power loss with wide-reaching consequences.  
Reliability is a key component of energy security and is defined by the continuity of energy 
supply to meet consumer needs. Reliability of the energy system is monitored and assessed by 
the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) on a quarterly basis and forecast to the 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        434  
future through an 18-month window. In its latest publication, IESO indicates that in general, 
Ontario’s transmission system is expected to continue to reliably supply province-wide demand 
but combinations of transmission and/or generation outages could create operating challenges 
(IESO, 2022a). The Ontario Energy Board (OEB) uses a scorecard system to evaluate utilities 
across the province, reporting annually on 20 measures, including several that are focused on 
system reliability, asset management and safety (OEB, 2022b). These scorecards offer regional 
perspectives of shifting performance over the past five years. Both of these examples are 
unique assessment and reporting mechanisms within which climate change can be 
incorporated to better understand both short and long term impacts and related policy 
response. Evolving from assessing system reliability on an 18-month basis, to characterizing and 
building system resilience over a longer time horizon would serve Ontario’s energy distribution 
well, particularly in the context of accelerating electrification of transportation, buildings, and 
industrial sectors and subsequent additional demand pressures on electricity the system 
(Canadian Climate Institute, 2021). 
Energy Consumption 
Climate change poses significant risks to those using and consuming energy – people, 
communities, and businesses. Warming air temperatures are expected to further increase peak 
demand for cooling homes and facilities in summer months. The introduction of new 
technology, including electric vehicles and supporting infrastructure (e.g. charging stations) can 
shift the timing of demand for energy and when peak energy requirements may be needed. As 
investments are made in Ontario’s energy system to accommodate these changes and to repair 
damage to infrastructure due to future climate impacts, there is a risk that consumers may face 
even higher energy prices compared with today. Those already facing high energy prices, 
including lower income residents who are more vulnerable, may increasingly face fuel poverty 
as the impacts of climate change lead to increased costs across energy systems translating into 
rate hikes. From an economic perspective, risks could lead to shifting availability of industrial 
inputs and high energy costs depending upon reliance on supply chains within and external to 
Ontario. Food and Agriculture provides one unique sectoral perspective where the agriculture 
community may require more energy to support in the deployment of new, adaptive 
technologies (e.g. robotic equipment, temperature and moisture sensors, aerial imagery, GPS 
technologies, etc.), but also face intermittent loss of power due to higher demand in the 
growing season and capacity constraints, which in turn could affect livestock operations and 
crop and greenhouse production. 
Equity 
Individuals and communities that endure current challenges with energy security face the 
compounded effects of climate change along with an energy transition. The disproportionate 
impacts strike within a context where few options exist for redundancy and resilience and more 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        435  
affordable rates. Emission reduction targets – net zero emissions by 2050 - driven by Federal 
legislation will provide the impetus for changes to the energy supply mix. The OEA states that 
this transition will require a major transformation of the province’s energy system (OEA, 2021), 
primarily away from the refined petroleum products that account for almost half of the 
province’s energy use (OEA, 2021). 
The Ontario Energy Association identified that any increased demand at times of peak loads will 
require expansion of the electricity system. Forecasts for the increase in demand are significant 
and will thus drive expansion and significant changes to the energy mix. In this transition, 
considerations to climate change resilience are paramount. The financial costs of this transition 
loom large for those who already struggle with energy prices, thus equitable solutions are 
critical to ward off further energy-equity segregation within the population. 
An equitable energy transition involves international, national, and Ontario-based actions that 
acknowledge and incorporate the fact that climate change has different impacts on priority 
populations and that adjusting energy systems should account for these differences and issues. 
Many uncertainties remain regarding the speed at which low carbon technology is adopted and 
deployed in the market. Demand for electricity is expected to increase in Ontario and across 
Canada and costs continue to rise. As of 2018, Ontario was identified as having the fastest 
growing electricity costs in Canada and among the highest in North America. Between 2008 and 
2016, Ontario’s residential electricity costs increased by 71 percent, far outpacing the 34 
percent average growth in electricity prices across Canada (Aliakbari et al., 2018). These rising 
costs already placed a significant financial burden on communities, Ontarians, and certain 
economic sectors, such as Ontario manufacturing, hampering its competitiveness. A study by 
Aliakbari et al., (2018) stated that Ontario’s high electricity prices have already been 
responsible for approximately 75,000 job losses in the manufacturing sector between 2008 to 
2015 (Aliakbari et al., 2018). And while there are challenges associated with meeting growing 
demand, expansion projects across Ontario in support of rural and remote access and more 
affordable energy prices have been identified and are underway (Government of Ontario, 
2021c). 
An equitable transition towards a low carbon energy system requires acknowledging and 
managing improved reliability, access, and affordability particularly in rural or remote 
communities, Indigenous Communities, and for Ontarians with lower incomes. As Ontario’s 
energy systems are expanded consideration should be given to how costs affect price and 
ultimately the potential for disproportionate impacts to vulnerable communities or those that 
work in energy-related employment.  
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        436  
External Influences 
Provincial, national and international changes in regulations, standards, targets, and policy 
related to energy can lead to changes in how the Ontario Energy Board regulates the energy 
sector. This also includes approval or denial of energy license requests based on system 
reliance, capacity, or other criteria and rate pricing. Political and non-political agendas influence 
the growth of certain commodities or sectors and can affect energy demand in particular 
regions of the province. As an example, in their latest quarterly Reliability Outlook, the 
Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) identifies that significant growth in the 
greenhouse sector has led to several customer connection requests in the Windsor-Essex 
region and that a new switching station is being implemented to increase capacity but that 
outages may be difficult to accommodate in the interim (IESO, 2022b). International imports 
and reliance on demand and supply of fuel and gasoline also can have significant influence on 
energy prices, as is being experienced in the Spring of 2022 due to supply chain disruptions, 
international conflict and increased demand for fuel.  
Summary 
Climate change risks to Ontario’s energy systems, in tandem with external influences, are 
expected to continue and become increasingly impactful to energy system reliability, capacity, 
and pricing. Significant infrastructure investment is needed to not only meet greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction targets, but to ensure a reliable, equitable and affordable energy system 
for Ontarians. Investments in these technologies such as energy storage, smart grid 
technologies, electric vehicles, and distributed energy resources, increased system flexibility 
can enable energy systems to become more resilient to climate impacts and minimize service 
disruptions. Other adaptation and resilience opportunities for the Ontario energy system 
include reducing vulnerability among consumers during climate events by: enhancing energy 
efficiency, upgrading, burying infrastructure and implementing measures to support recovery.

10.3 Water Security 
Overview 
Direct and indirect impacts of climate change on water resources pose risks to water use and 
ultimately compromise water security for human health, livelihoods, and economic 
development in Ontario. Ensuring access to adequate quantities and acceptable quality of 
water is key for sustaining human well-being and socio-economic development, ensuring 
protection against water-borne pollution and water-related disasters. Preserving the 
functionality of natural ecosystems plays a vital role in maintaining water security. 
The impacts of climate change on water resources will manifest within each of the Areas of 
Focus as disruptions and changes in: 
- 
Water sources – refers to surface aquifers and groundwater that provide water to public 
drinking water supplies as well as private wells. 
- 
Water transmission – refers to the transport of treated water from storage facilities to 
distribution networks and sewer/storm water from the location of end-use to a water 
treatment facility, taking place through water transmission pipelines. 
- 
Water treatment – refers to any process that involves physical, chemical, 
physicochemical and biological operations to eliminate and/or reduce contamination or 
non-desirable characteristics of water to make it appropriate for a specific end-use. 
- 
Water storage – refers to holding water in a contained natural or artificial area for a 
period of time for later use for a variety of purposes. 
- 
Water distribution – refers to a provision of uninterrupted supply of water from a 
central location to a location of end-use.  
- 
Water consumption – refers to using withdrawn water for a variety of household and 
industrial purposes/activities without returning it to the source. 
This section outlines the linkages between climate impacts within each Area of Focus, water 
systems and water security in Ontario, focusing on critical community outcomes related to:  
- 
Water availability – described as a safe and reliable freshwater supply important for 
maintaining human, plant and animal populations and supporting economic 
development.  
- 
Water access – refers to the ability of community members to obtain water that factors 
in elements like available water quantity, distance to a water source and time required 
to reach it. 
- 
Water quality – refers to the chemical, physical and biological characteristics of water 
based on the standards of its usage.

Climate Risks to Ontario’s Water Systems and Water Security 
Water Sources 
Ontario is home to abundant surface and groundwater resources that are used for multiple 
purposes. A sufficient number of quality water sources is critical to provide for drinking water 
supplies, availability of water for fishing and recreational activities as well as agricultural 
operations, natural environment conservation, construction, manufacturing and more.  
Climate change poses risks to water sources affecting which affect supply and quality. Dry 
conditions and extreme hot temperatures change water balances and cause disruptions to the 
water flow regulation service, leading to reduced surface and groundwater levels, changes in 
intra-annual patterns of water availability, loss of available freshwater supplies for human use, 
wetland drying and loss, changes in distribution and abundance of animal and fish species and 
altered ecosystem function over a long term (Saarikoski et al., 2015). Limited water availability 
can affect crop and livestock production, food processing and other sectors of the economy 
that rely upon a reliable source of water, both potable and non-potable.  
Extreme precipitation events can directly affect the components of ecosystems that are most 
important in water flow regulation such as riparian areas and sensitive wetlands, reducing 
water flow regulation and causing greater peak flow risks (Kennedy and Wilson, 2009). 
Additionally, heavy rainfall events increase erosion and wash inorganic sediment and nutrients 
(e.g. phosphorus) and contaminants from agricultural fields into water bodies, resulting in 
degraded quality of surface and ground water sources (Lebelo-Almaw et al., 2019). 
Collaboration between individual landowners, not-for-profit environmental organizations, 
conservation authorities, Indigenous Communities and various levels of government plays a 
fundamental role in supporting natural environment and ensuring continued water security of 
Ontario’s people and communities. Policies, programs and regulations aimed at protecting 
water supply and quality such as the Environmental Protection Act (1990), the Ontario Water 
Resources Act (1990), provincial land use planning statutes including the Planning Act (1990), 
Ontario’s Clean Water Act (2006), Lake Simcoe Protection Plan (2009), the Water Opportunities 
and Water Conservation Act (2010), and Ontario’s Great Lake Strategy (2017) provide support 
for the protection of hydrologic features and areas and ultimately – water security in the 
province. 
Water Transmission 
Water transmission is a key component of the water system, and includes the delivery of clean 
water to businesses and communities and safe transport of sewer and stormwater to treatment 
facilities through water transmission pipelines. Disruptions to water transmission have direct 
implications for water security, especially water availability and quality. 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       441  
Climate-driven impacts within several Areas of Focus can affect water transmission that relies 
on a large network of transmission pipelines and distribution infrastructure. Flooding, droughts, 
storms and extreme heat events can damage or destroy water transmission infrastructure 
resulting in significant disruptions of service, high repair costs and dangerous conditions for the 
affected communities, including drinking water contamination and sewage backups (Andrey, 
2014). The risks are particularly significant for older infrastructure whose ability to withstand 
extreme weather events and provide adequate levels of service is reduced.  
In Ontario, clean water transmission has historically been, and continues to be, the 
responsibility of municipalities. Provincial legislation, including the Safe Drinking Water Act 
(2002), the Public Utilities Act (1990), the Ontario Water Resources Act (1990), the Municipal 
Act (2001) gives municipalities the power and responsibility to finance, build, own, and operate 
water works. Additionally, regulations and policies aimed at protecting wetlands and other 
green infrastructure in order to improve local stormwater management provide opportunities 
to increase the resilience of water systems to climate change and enhance water security in 
Ontario’s communities. 
Water Treatment 
Water treatment is an important component of the water system, referring to any process that 
involves physical, chemical, and biological operations to eliminate contamination and reduce 
non-desirable characteristics of water to make it appropriate for a specific end-use. Proper 
treatment of water both before and after use/consumption is critical for water quality and 
contributes to overall water security. 
Climate impacts within several Areas of Focus can cause challenges and disruptions to water 
and wastewater treatment activities. Extreme precipitation events and flooding may affect 
wastewater treatment plants that depend on unsaturated soil to store tanks and result in 
subsurface discharge, clogging, and cracking in tanks (Saarikoski et al., 2015). Contamination of 
drinking water sources by chemicals and waste in surface runoff is another impact related to 
extreme precipitation events, presenting challenges to the water treatment process and 
causing risks to water safety and human health. Droughts may cause disruptions in the 
wastewater treatment process resulting in unpredictable effluent concentrations which may 
exceed water quality limits, impacting the assimilative capacity of the receiving water body 
(Saarikoski et al., 2015). This will impact water accessibility and increase water costs to the 
consumer. 
Vulnerable communities with older essential infrastructure (sewers, water treatment facilities) 
are particularly vulnerable to such risks. Different types of treatment systems, such as sewage 
treatment plants and natural treatment sewage lagoons used in some Northern communities 
may be affected by the changing climate and extreme weather events in different ways. This 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       442  
has financial and infrastructure implications in retrofitting or replacing wastewater treatment 
facilities as well as human health and environmental implications if treatment systems are not 
performing adequately. 
Water Storage 
Water storage is a component of the water system that refers to holding water in a contained 
natural or artificial area for a period of time for later use for a variety of purposes. 
Climate impacts within several Areas of Focus can cause challenges and disruptions to water 
storage and lead to adverse outcomes in communities, natural environment, businesses and 
agricultural operations. Extreme precipitation could lead to flooding that can cause loss of 
reservoir storage and physical damages to dams and pump stations that will require 
replacement or maintenance and could lead to downtime or reduced capacity in the system 
(Feltmate & Moudrak, 2021). Additionally, extreme precipitation and large snowmelt may 
overwhelm existing stormwater management facilities, increase loads to pumping 
infrastructure or could cause electrical failure in pumping stations resulting in flooding, risks to 
human safety, property damage, and need for additional funds for repairs and maintenance of 
stormwater management facilities and other infrastructure. Less rainfall and longer dry periods 
mean groundwater recharge may be reduced and ponds, water-storage tanks and reservoirs 
may not fill enough to support agriculture, communities and businesses that are dependent on 
them, causing issues with water availability and accessibility (McCartney & Smakhtin, 2010). 
Impacts to water quality and ecosystem health caused by both dry and extreme rainfall 
conditions may be further exacerbated by climate change. Increased wildfire activity may result 
in elevated sediment load in water bodies causing loss of some hydro reservoir storage or 
additional cleaning requirements. 
Water storage provides a mechanism for dealing with water resources variability related to 
climate extremes by resolving the temporal disconnect between water supplies and demands 
from wet to dry periods (Scanlon & Smakhtin, 2016). Proper planning and management of 
water storage systems, with focus on their flexibility and unique characteristics, could increase 
water security and overall Adaptive Capacity of a community.  
Water Distribution 
Water distribution refers to the provision of an uninterrupted supply of water from a central 
location to a location of end-use and is closely linked to water supply and state of transmission 
infrastructure. Disruptions in water distribution have direct implications for water security, 
especially water availability and accessibility. 
Climate impacts within several Areas of Focus can cause challenges and disruptions to water 
distribution. Climate events such as storms and flooding can damage infrastructure and result 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       443  
in functional disruptions of underground water transmission and distribution systems. In some 
cases, consequences of these impacts include noxious substances being released into municipal 
drinking water supplies which threaten human health and compromise basic needs. Drought 
and flow limitations in surface waterways and groundwater cause reductions in water supply, 
and ultimately result in allocation challenges, distribution disruptions and increasing water 
costs.  
Rehabilitation of old infrastructure, policies and regulations aimed at improving water 
management and encouraging responsible stewardship (e.g. Safe Drinking Water Act) are some 
of the ongoing efforts to increase resilience of water management facilities, transmission and 
distribution infrastructure at the local level. 
Water Consumption 
Water consumption is a component of the water system that refers to using withdrawn water 
for a variety of household and industrial purposes and activities without returning it to the 
source. Water consumption directly relates to water availability, accessibility and quality 
considerations within water security. Availability and accessibility of sufficient, clean, and safe 
drinking water are essential for all Ontarians, while Ontario industries and businesses are 
similarly in need of ample and timely water inputs. 
Impacts of climate change within several Areas of Focus pose significant risks to those using and 
consuming water – people, communities, wildlife, livestock, industries, businesses and more. 
Extreme precipitation and flooding events may result in declining water quality from excessive 
run-off as nutrient and sediment could affect drinking water supplies and overall ecosystem 
health. Communities would need to find new water sources and could face compromised basic 
needs such as sanitation and hygiene as well as increased risks to human health. Drought, 
Moisture Deficits and extreme heat conditions may impact water supply and management, 
resulting in increased demand and requiring allocation restrictions. Industries such as 
construction, manufacturing and agriculture could experience water use limitations (e.g. for 
crop irrigation and livestock watering), causing disruptions to operations, impacts to 
productivity and revenue losses. This could be exacerbated based on the timing and magnitude 
of water use restrictions and drought conditions (Disch, J. et al., 2012).  
Equity 
Climate-related risks to water security vary across Ontario and often contribute to existing 
vulnerability and inequities. An equity lens has been applied to this analysis (see Figure 10.5) to 
demonstrate how climate risks to water security can be amplified for populations with pre-
existing vulnerability.  
 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       444  
As climate change alters water sources and reliable supply of clean drinking water, water safety 
risks and allocation challenges are amplified. Rural, remote, Indigenous and Northern 
communities are at greatest risk of water insecurity in Ontario. 
Eighteen percent (18%) of Ontario’s population live in areas that are not covered by the Clean 
Water Act (2006) and, therefore, do not have source water protection plans to prevent the 
contamination of their sources of drinking water. This number includes people living in 
communities that draw drinking water from domestic wells and over 40 municipal drinking 
water systems (such as the Village of Cobden in the Township of Whitewater region) that are 
not within a source water protection area and whose water quality is not assessed for drinking 
water threats with no policies in place to reduce the risks (Rees andMcClenaghan, 2022). 
Additionally, at present only a few First Nations have opted into the Clean Water Act and a 
limited number of Indigenous Communities are protected by the source water protection 
system.  
Those living in large mixed-use watersheds (e.g. the Grand River watershed) are most likely to 
be impacted by competing interests between communities, agriculture and industry. That said, 
the Provincial Policy Statement (Government of Ontario, 2020f) requires coordination between 
local municipalities, conservation authorities and other sectors in planning, development, 
conservation, and the management of resources, balancing the interests of multiple 
stakeholders in a single watershed. 
Investing in upgrades to water transmission infrastructure and construction of water and 
sewage services in rural, remote and Northern communities along with extending the 
protective coverage of the Clean Water Act to include all municipal drinking systems, 
Indigenous Communities and private wells would contribute to reducing inequities related to 
water safety and human health, minimize distribution disruptions and save costs in the long-
term.  
Summary 
Climate change is expected to present challenges to Ontario’s water systems through impacts 
on water resources, drinking water, stormwater, and wastewater infrastructure. High 
complexity of the water sector and interconnectedness of its elements stress the need for 
collaboration, improved decision-making processes and policy coherence. Opportunities for a 
shared vision and coordination of climate adaptation actions within the water sector include a 
holistic One Water Approach, a management framework that could integrate drinking water, 
wastewater, and stormwater into one entity, accounting for all water resources, at a river basin 
level, enhancing climate resilience, reducing existing vulnerabilities and strengthening Ontario’s 
water security.

10.4 Human Health, Safety and Well-Being 
Overview 
Public health, safety and well-being is a critical cross-sectoral theme considering the 
importance of a healthy human population in the face of climate change. Climate risks to 
health, safety and well-being are complex and mediated by a range of determinants of health 
and other situational, behavioural, and organizational factors, including health and safety-
related infrastructure. The management of climate risks and projected impacts to health, safety 
and well-being requires close partnerships with officials within and outside the health sector. 
Climate change can impact the health, safety, and well-being of Ontarians both directly, 
through different climate and weather events hazards (e.g. extreme heat), and indirectly 
through a range of environmental, built, and economic pathways. This section outlines how 
climate risks can cascade across each Area of Focus of this PCCIA, resulting in health, safety and 
well-being impacts and outcomes for Ontarians. The following impacts are summarized under 
the following categories and associated health outcomes:  
- 
Disease vectors and pathogens relates to infectious and vector-borne disease health 
outcomes.  
- 
Water quality and food safety relates to food and water borne disease and illness health 
outcomes.  
- 
Mental health and well-being relate to mental health, psychosocial illness and loss of 
cultural heritage health outcomes.  
- 
Declining air quality relates to respiratory morbidity and illness health outcomes. 
- 
Public safety and emergency response relate to injury and mortality outcomes 
associated with natural hazards. 
- 
Extreme temperature exposure relates to morbidity and mortality health outcomes 
associated with extreme heat and cold.  
Figure 10.6 illustrates how climate risks cascade through each Area of Focus (represented in 
green), causing impacts to public health, safety, and well-being (represented in orange), 
associated outcomes (represented in purple), and how determinants of health equity influence 
these outcomes.

by determinants of health and equity. 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       447  
Climate Risks to Human Health, Safety and Well-being across Ontario 
Disease Vectors and Pathogens 
Warming temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are increasing the likelihood of 
diseases carried by insect vectors in Ontario. As noted in the Food and Agriculture and Natural 
Environment Areas of Focus, disease vectors can impact not only human health, but also can 
adversely impact crop production and ecosystem health. When considering risks specific to 
human health, Lyme disease and West Nile virus are two diseases that are increasing in 
frequency and range across the province, due to an expansion of their vectors and more 
favourable conditions for transmission (Ogden et al., 2022). Ontario Public Health Units (PHUs) 
across the province have been increasing surveillance of insect-borne diseases, monitoring 
changes, and studying associated vectors to advance knowledge and inform responses (Buse et 
al., 2022; Levison et al., 2017; Grey Bruce Health Unit, 2017). 
Warming temperatures and shifting moisture conditions are also projected to impact the 
prevalence of diseases transmitted to humans by wildlife. For example, within the Natural 
Environment Area of Focus, it is noted that climate change is likely to increase the range and 
abundance of white-tailed deer in Ontario. However, deer are expected to experience higher 
pathogen loads and more disease outbreaks. This could result in cascading risks to human 
health and safety, especially for hunters and Indigenous Communities who rely on harvesting 
traditional foods as main food sources (Masood et al., 2017). Migratory birds, moose, coyotes, 
and foxes are other animals that have been observed with higher pathogen and parasite loads 
and disease outbreaks among populations, increasing risks to human health and safety under a 
changing climate. 
Water Quality and Food Safety 
Climate change in Ontario is also expected to pose risks to water quality and food safety in the 
province. As noted within the Natural Environment and People and Communities Areas of 
Focus, climate risks can affect the quality of drinking water, resulting in significant health, well-
being and safety of Ontarians.  
Extreme precipitation and rapid spring snowmelts carry bacteria and chemicals into 
surrounding watersheds and increase the risks associated with water-borne diseases. These 
impacts are intensified by surrounding development, industry, agricultural production, and 
land-use changes. Regulating ecosystem services, covered in the Natural Environment Area of 
Focus, provide natural filtering of contaminants, underlining the importance of protecting 
wetlands and ecosystems, especially within source water protection zones (Takaro et al., 2022).  
The Natural Environment Area of Focus identifies risks associated with warming temperatures 
and outbreaks of toxic algae and cyanobacteria (referred to as “harmful algal blooms”). 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       448  
Cyanotoxins within algal blooms can have significant human health impacts associated with 
exposure through drinking water systems and recreational water use (e.g. swimming at 
beaches).  
As highlighted in the Infrastructure Area of Focus, extreme precipitation and flooding can also 
cause disruptions to drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater infrastructure. For example, 
in the event of a wastewater facility failure, there is a heightened risk of water contamination 
and sewage overflows. The impacts to water quality cascade throughout different built and 
natural systems, resulting in an increased likelihood of water-borne disease and illness. Remote 
areas and households that rely on non-municipal groundwater sources and infrastructure (e.g. 
private wells) are at a higher risk of contaminated drinking water following extreme 
precipitation and flooding events, however larger municipal systems can still be impacted 
(Takaro et al., 2022). 
Access to safe drinking water is an ongoing issue for many Indigenous Communities across 
Ontario, leaving communities to rely on private water systems, treatment methods and 
sources. Impacts to water quality driven by climate change will be disproportionately felt in 
these communities with limited or inadequate drinking water infrastructure systems (Schnitter 
et al., 2022). 
Climate risks presented under the Food and Agriculture and Natural Environment Areas of 
Focus introduce implications for food safety in Ontario, covered in the Food Security Cross-
Sectoral section). Climate change influences the growth, survival, abundance, and range of 
pathogens throughout stages of the food system (production, processing, distribution, 
preparation, and consumption). Associated food safety impacts are likely to increase risks 
related to food-borne disease and illness in Ontario and ultimately to human health and safety 
(Harper and Schnitter, 2022).  
Mental Health and Well-being 
Over recent years, it has become clear that climate-related disasters can often lead to negative 
mental health outcomes (Decent and Feltmate, 2018). For example, the economic impacts and 
financial losses of flooding, wildfire, and other climate-related disasters, as highlighted in 
Business and Economy Area of Focus, can lead to increased levels of post-traumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD), general distress, depression, and anxiety. Additionally, personal losses, 
displacement, environmental degradation, and food and water insecurity after a disaster, can 
compound mental health impacts in affected communities and lead to increased stress, anxiety, 
and depression (Decent and Feltmate, 2018; Hayes et al., 2022).  
As noted throughout the Food and Agriculture Area of Focus, crop failures due to drought and 
other climate-related conditions can have cascading effects on the mental health of farmers 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       449  
and others in agricultural communities (Hayes et al., 2022). Changing climate conditions leading 
to ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss, can also lead to mental health problems such 
as stress, anxiety and depression, especially for individuals and communities with limited access 
to healthy ecosystems and quality natural spaces (e.g. provincial parks and protected areas) 
(Hayes et al., 2022; Reining et al., 2021). 
Finally, the threat of climate change itself can impact mental health and well-being among 
Ontarians as fear and worry surrounding future climate conditions and impacts can result in 
increased anxiety and depression rates (Galway et al., 2019; Hayes et al., 2022).  
Declining Air Quality 
Within the People and Communities Area of Focus, declining air quality is identified as a key 
health risk associated with increasing extreme heat, wildfire, and drought conditions. More 
frequent extreme heat events can increase smog and ground-level ozone, with urban areas 
being particularly vulnerable. In addition, wildfire smoke contains fine particulate matter that 
can cause the exacerbation of asthma and respiratory conditions. Drought conditions can also 
contribute to increased dust across the natural environment, affecting cardiovascular and 
respiratory health function (Egyed et al., 2022).  
In addition to outdoor air quality, climate change can also impact indoor air quality, leading to 
adverse health impacts (highlighted within the Infrastructure Area of Focus). Smoke from 
wildland fire is estimated health impacts of $5B to $21B annually in Canada ($190 million in the 
GTA alone). With the expected increase in wildland fire, this will be a significant impact on 
health (Matz et al., 2020). Changing climate conditions have been found to increase airborne 
allergens and lengthen pollen season, infiltrating into buildings. Additionally, impacts of 
flooding can result in mold growth, also affecting indoor air quality and causing implications to 
respiratory and overall health (Egyed et al., 2022). 
Public Safety and Emergency Response  
Climate-related events and disasters can amplify risks to public health and safety, especially 
when healthcare facilities and emergency response services are also affected. For example, 
extreme weather events (e.g. flooding, storms, wildfire etc.) can increase the likelihood of 
motor vehicle accidents and injuries, increasing the demand of emergency services. As noted in 
the Infrastructure Area of Focus, climate risks can lead to power outages and damage to critical 
infrastructure (e.g. washouts of emergency transportation routes, prolonged power outage in 
hospitals etc.), resulting in a disruption of critical services (e.g. delays in emergency response, 
evacuation of hospital patients etc.) (Clark, 2009).  
It is during these extreme events and disasters that emergency services and health care 
disruptions can have major effects on the health and safety of Ontarians. In the circumstance 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       450  
that health facilities and services remain operational during a climate-related disaster, they can 
be pushed beyond capacity thresholds because of related injuries, illnesses, and patient 
transfers from the event/disaster. Indirect impacts could lead to cascading risks for several 
health outcomes simultaneously. 
Extreme Temperature Exposure 
Extreme heat events are projected to continue to increase with climate change, leading to 
increased risks related to heat-related illness and mortality, affecting the health and safety of 
Ontarians and communities (Zhang et al., 2019; Berry et al., 2022). 
As highlighted within People and Communities Area of Focus, extreme heat directly impacts the 
health of Ontarians, with several factors increasing vulnerability of individuals and communities 
to heat stress. It has been observed that extreme heat events can increase mortality rates, 
cause heat-related illnesses, increase hospitalization rates, and exacerbate mental health 
illnesses and disorders (Gosselin et al., 2022). Certain populations may be a greater risk due to 
existing health conditions and social inequities associated with health care access, pre-existing 
health status, poverty, and housing considerations (e.g. access to air conditioning units) 
(Schnitter et al., 2022). 
Health impacts associated with extreme heat are exacerbated by the urban heat island effect, 
where higher temperatures are observed in areas with greater coverage of dark surfaces (e.g. 
concrete roadways and buildings) and less natural area and tree cover (demonstrated in Figure 
66 through direct impact from the Infrastructure Area of Focus). In absence of proactive 
adaptation measures, dense urban regions of the province are at greater risk from extreme 
heat, with health outcomes (e.g. illnesses and increased mortalities) being intensified, 
compared to surrounding rural areas (Buse et al., 2022; Levison et al., 2017). 
While extreme cold-related health issues and mortalities will likely decline under a warming 
climate, it is expected that health impacts associated with extreme heat will outweigh this 
decline in Ontario (Berry et al., 2022).  
When responding to the cumulative health and safety impacts associated with extreme heat, it 
is important to consider how cross-sectoral coordination is required to enable effective 
adaptation (e.g. incorporating green space into regional planning, designating and providing 
equitable access to public cooling centres etc.). 
Equity  
The primary determinants of health and health equity considerations play a crucial role when 
assessing how climate change will impact the health, safety and well-being of Ontarians. 
Determinants of health include conditions and characteristics that influence an individual’s 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       451  
health and well-being. Examples of determinants of health include, social and community 
contexts, education, working and living conditions, access to healthcare services, employment, 
and economic stability and ither identify factors (age, race, gender etc.) (Schnitter et al., 2022).  
Health inequity considerations tend to overlap with the determinants of poor health, including 
low socioeconomic status, poor living conditions (e.g. housing), and limited access to healthcare 
services. These determinants can be drivers of vulnerability to climate-related health, safety, 
and well-being outcomes, influencing individual and community exposure and sensitivity to 
climate risks, as well as associated capacity to adapt or cope. These factors and conditions can 
also present barriers for adaptation, amplifying vulnerability to climate-related impacts on 
human health, safety and well-being.  
As the understanding of health vulnerability under a changing climate evolves, the intersections 
of inequities across Ontario are crucial to integrate into adaptation and response planning.  
Summary 
To summarize, climate risks as viewed through the lens of human health and safety are 
exemplified through this cross-sectoral analysis. Climate risks will impact many of the primary 
determinants of health, highlighting how certain populations and regions across Ontario stand 
to be disproportionately affected by climate change.  
It is clear that health-related adaptation in Ontario requires several players both inside and 
outside of the health sector (e.g. water resource management, infrastructure, emergency 
management), as well as several levels of government (e.g. Indigenous, regional municipal etc.). 
Regional PHU assessments of climate change vulnerability and health equity have provided a 
foundation for collaborative and widespread adaptation action in Ontario (Grey Bruce Health 
Unit, 2017; Levison et al., 2017; Buse et al., 2022). Moving forward actions to address existing 
inequities and population vulnerability should be prioritized for interventions to minimize the 
health, safety and well-being outcomes that climate change poses to Ontarians and their 
communities.

10.5 Community Function 
Overview 
From a systems perspective, a community is comprised of different parts that represent 
specialized functions, activities, or interests, each operating within specific boundaries to meet 
community needs. For the community to function well, each part has to effectively carry out its 
role, and disruptions caused by climate change can significantly undermine this. 
Climate change can impact community function both directly, through different climate and 
weather events (e.g. extreme precipitation or wildfire), and indirectly through a range of 
environmental, built, and economic pathways. This section outlines how climate risks can 
cascade across each Area of Focus, resulting in multiple impacts and outcomes for Ontarians. 
Key elements of community function that can be impacted by the changing climate are:  
- 
Social support and inclusion – refer to help accessible to an individual through social ties 
to other individuals, groups, and the larger community and the process of improving the 
terms on which individuals and groups take part in society. 
- 
Economic stability – refers to the absence of excessive fluctuations in economy meaning 
that people have the resources essential to a healthy life. 
- 
Access and infrastructure redundancy – refers to available backup alternatives when 
other components are disrupted (e.g. due to flooding, landslides etc.). 
- 
Emergency response management – refers to the management of resources and 
responsibilities and organization of measures and actions for dealing with the 
consequences of emergencies (e.g. flooding, power failure etc.) to ensure safety and 
security of communities and minimize damage to infrastructure and disruptions to 
essential services. 
- 
Ecological stewardship – refers to responsible use and protection of the natural 
environment through conservation and sustainable practices. 
- 
Land use planning and development – refers to the process of regulating the use of land 
to promote desirable social and environmental outcomes and efficient use of resources. 
Critical community-specific outcomes include changes in: 
- 
Access to daily needs and support systems – refers to the ability of individuals to 
maintain social ties to others and the larger community and ensure that their daily 
needs are met. 
- 
Access to goods and services – refers to the ability of individuals to acquire tangible 
items and tasks performed for the benefit of the recipients. 
- 
Access to nature – refers to the ability to regularly use green spaces and amenities for 
recreation and other purposes. 
  
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report       453  
- 
Personal safety and security – refer to the general recognition and avoidance of possible 
harmful situations or persons in an individual’s surroundings. 
- 
Job security – refers to the probability of an individual to keep their job and is an 
important component in measuring the quality of life and well-being. 
- 
Land use planning and development practices – refer to sets of policies and procedures 
regulating the use of land, and specifically changes in these policies and procedures 
aimed at minimizing development risks to a municipality from natural hazards due to 
the changing climate. 
- 
Physical and mental health outcomes – refer to measurable changes in the health status 
of an individual. 
Figure 10.7 illustrates how climate risks cascade through each Area of Focus (represented in 
green), causing impacts to various community functions (represented in orange), associated 
outcomes (represented in purple), and how equity considerations influence these outcomes.

Climate Risks to Community Function across Ontario 
Social Support and Inclusion  
Social support and inclusion are important elements of the community function that include 
assistance that is accessible to an individual within the larger community through ties to other 
individuals and groups. It also includes the process of improving the terms on which individuals 
and groups take part in society and societal functions. 
Climate change can impact social support and inclusion in communities across Ontario through 
direct impacts on infrastructure, natural environment and economy. Extreme ice or snowstorm 
events can cause property damage and communications system failures, resulting in increased 
lack of access to support and daily needs, particularly exacerbated for people with disabilities, 
elderly populations, and people in more remote communities (Morss et al., 2011). Extreme 
weather events increase potential for localized and widespread power outages leading to 
service disruptions, greater demand for space in shelters and emergency community centers, 
and limited ability of residents to reach essential services for social assistance, or for service 
workers to reach them (Smoyer-Tomic et al., 2003). High temperatures result in altered 
distribution and abundance of species of importance for Indigenous Communities, impacting 
food security, daily activities and use of social spaces (Neufeld and Richmond, 2017). Increased 
number or pathogens, pests and diseases, and changes to air and water quality linked to the 
changing climate are likely to contribute to poor physical health outcomes, while climate 
anxiety and stress are strongly linked to mental health (Cianconi et al., 2020). 
Understanding the complexity of community outcomes and diverse stakeholders is key to 
improved decision-making and ensuring that social services can continue to operate, 
maintaining community function and resilience. 
Economic Stability  
Economic stability is a key component of community function that refers to the absence of 
excessive fluctuations in economy meaning that people have the resources essential to a 
healthy life. 
Changes in extreme heat, Growing Degree Days, mean and extreme precipitation, and wildfire 
may lead to financial impacts in multiple industries and sectors including telecommunication, 
electrical power generation, transmission and distribution, commercial transportation services, 
retail trade, manufacturing, agriculture as well as entertainment and recreation activities.  
Rainfall decreases and drought could result in shortage of water for construction and 
manufacturing use, leading to production delays (CMIC, 2017). Extreme rainfall could delay 
outdoor construction and cause loss to unprotected, on-site stored materials (CMIC, 2017). 
Additionally, extreme precipitation and flooding may result in water infiltration to 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        456  
accommodation, retail, manufacturing, financial and other buildings, leading to disruption of 
service. Extreme temperature events, particularly when combined with high humidity, may 
affect the storage and shelf life of material inputs as well as semi-manufactured and finished 
products (Moudrak and Feltmate, 2019). Changes to temperature and precipitation regimes, 
including extreme weather events, may lead to damage of farm infrastructure, agricultural 
production losses and supply chain disruptions, while increases in extreme precipitation may 
lead to poor driving conditions, resulting in accidents, disruptions to transportation and 
compromised delivery of goods and essential services (Woudsma and Towns, 2017).  
Industries could face impacts including asset and infrastructure loss and damage, decrease in 
asset serviceable lifespan, supply chain and logistics delays, changes in consumer demand for 
seasonal goods and services, health and safety impacts to staff, and changes in availability of 
key industrial inputs and costs (e.g. materials, fuel, insurance). The extent of impact will depend 
on the duration, persistence, extent, and intensity of the climate risk event and may cascade to 
community outcomes such as job security and access to goods and services. 
Economic prosperity and stability will be influenced by how businesses adapt to the changing 
climate. They may gain an advantage by investing in the resilience of their supply base, 
managing supply chain risks and acting to minimize negative impacts as much as possible to 
reduce the chances of paying higher costs later on to fix past oversights. Taking critical actions 
for planning, infrastructure and business management is needed to ensure availability of 
resources to support various sized communities in Ontario. 
Access and Infrastructure Redundancy 
Within community function components, access and infrastructure redundancy refer to 
available backup alternatives when other infrastructure components are disrupted (e.g. due to 
flooding, landslides etc.). Key community and public infrastructure include buildings, 
transportation, telecommunication, stormwater and waste management systems, impacts to 
which would affect multiple public services provided to the general public within communities. 
Importantly, green infrastructure within settlement areas is viewed as a key component and 
backup measure for critical community infrastructure. 
Continuous access to services in communities across Ontario can be compromised by severe 
weather events and conditions such as extreme temperature and precipitation, ice and 
snowstorms, wildfires, and heat waves. Extreme precipitation and flooding could cause damage 
to roads, property and infrastructure as well as power outages and shutdowns of facilities 
providing essential goods and services such as grocery stores and medical clinics. Additionally, 
damaged or flooded roads could block access for emergency vehicles and transport to 
healthcare and contribute to the disruption of supply chains for medicines, food and more 
(Tsang and Scott, 2020). Vulnerable populations including people with compromised health 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        457  
status, inadequate or no housing as well as those living along coasts and waterways or in 
rural/remote communities are likely to be the most affected.  
Incorporating redundancy and flexibility into community systems is important in order to 
ensure nimble responses to challenges and impacts caused by severe weather and climate 
events. For example, ensuring availability of backup generators in case of more frequent and 
prolonged power outages would ensure backup power exists for medical facilities, community 
centers and other locations used for emergency relief (Paterson et al., 2012). Such targeted 
redundancy would enable systems that are safe to fail in the event of a weather-related 
emergency. 
Emergency Response Management  
Emergency response management refers to the management of resources and responsibilities 
and organization of measures and actions for dealing with the consequences of emergencies 
(e.g. flooding, power failure etc.) to ensure safety and security of communities and minimize 
damage to infrastructure and disruptions to essential services. 
Large-scale climate events such as flooding, wildfire, extreme precipitation, and wind events 
lead to power outages, damages to critical infrastructure (e.g. emergency transportation 
routes, stormwater and sewer systems etc.) and disruption of critical services (e.g. healthcare 
etc.). Importantly, they affect organized response actions including evacuation measures, 
search and rescue missions, provision of basic needs and emergency services, and recovery or 
substitution of critical infrastructure (Government of Ontario, 2022g). Emergencies triggered by 
weather-related impacts on infrastructure and natural environment amplify risks to personal 
safety and security, access to daily needs and support systems as well as physical and mental 
health outcomes. 
Ontario municipalities are required to develop and implement emergency management 
programs tailored to local needs and priority risks and are supported by the province in 
delivering emergency services when their response capability is insufficient to deal with larger-
scale disasters (Government of Ontario, 2022g). To accommodate increased demand for 
emergency services and support community resilience, it is important to consider long-term 
planning tools and enhanced guidance for adaptive considerations in regulatory framework, 
such as asset management plans as well as maintaining sufficient reserves and appropriate 
insurance coverage to manage the costs of disasters.  
Ecological Stewardship 
Ecological stewardship refers to responsible use and protection of the natural environment 
through conservation and sustainable practices. It includes diverse actions such as creating 
protected areas, replanting trees, reducing pollution, restoring degraded areas, or purchasing 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        458  
more sustainable products, and supports nature-based solutions, green infrastructure, and 
renewable energy initiatives (Bennett et al., 2018). 
Climate impacts on the natural environment and agriculture (e.g. degradation of air and water 
quality, increased range of pathogens, pests and diseases, altered distribution and abundance 
of species and changes in ecosystem health and services etc.) affect overall environmental 
sustainability and, at the personal and community level, result in poor physical and mental 
health outcomes, limited access to nature and decreased quality of life. Additionally, failures of 
critical infrastructure (e.g. waste management plants) could have significant cascading impacts 
on surrounding ecosystems and, ultimately, communities that rely on them. 
Supporting efforts to develop ecological stewardship activities like community gardening, 
removal of invasive species and conservation of soil, water and green spaces can be an effective 
approach to improving community resiliency and integrating environmental, community and 
individual outcomes (Krasny and Tidball, 2012). In Ontario, ecological (or sometimes called 
environmental) stewardship programming is a key element identified in the commitments of 
Canada-Ontario Lake Erie Action Plan (Environment and Climate Change Canada and 
Government of Ontario, 2018), Ontario’s Agricultural Soil Heath and Conservation Strategy 
(Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2016c), Made-in-Ontario Environment 
Plan (Government of Ontario, 2020a), and other initiatives. Actions supported by these 
initiatives include adoption of management practices to improve soil health and water quality, 
wetland restoration and management, implementation of low-impact development practices, 
and more. These actions help inform evidence and data collection, increase awareness and 
understanding of key risks and opportunities to the environment, and enhance planning and 
decision-making tools to manage risks related to environmental sustainability at the ecosystem 
and community levels. 
Land Use Planning and Development 
Land use planning and development refers to the process of regulating the use of land to 
promote desirable social and environmental outcomes and efficient use of resources. Planning, 
capacity building and implementation are important elements of addressing adaptation and 
resilience issues in a holistic manner (Bajracharya et al., 2011). 
Changing climate and extreme weather events affect the natural environment and various 
sectors of Ontario’s economy, causing impacts on critical infrastructure, agricultural lands and 
production, ecosystem health and services, recreation, fishing and other economies as well as 
cultural heritage resources and assets. Coupled with socio-economic changes (e.g. population 
growth) these impacts result in the need to adjust land use planning and development 
approaches to achieve cross-sectoral resilience improvements. Importantly, the impacts of 
climate change and the consequences of land use planning and management decisions will be 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        459  
borne unequally by different communities and individuals, with those who are already 
vulnerable impacted most acutely. Issues of equity and environmental justice require special 
attention and considerations when seeking solutions to impacts of climate change (Canadian 
Institute of Planners, 2010). 
Ontario communities and municipal governments have traditionally used land use planning 
tools such as official plans, zoning, development permits, public awareness campaigns, 
management of public lands and buildings and others – to minimize risks to communities from 
floods, wildfires, landslides and other natural hazards and facilitate local adaptation to climate 
change (Richardson and Otero, 2012). Specifically, planning and development tools can reduce 
climate risks by limiting development in hazard-prone zones (e.g. on floodplains), ensuring that 
built infrastructure can withstand changing levels of environmental stress and retain, as 
applicable, key attributes, integrity, and heritage values, helping preserve natural environments 
and prime agricultural lands, and educating communities about climate risks while fostering 
dialogue about adaptation (Richardson and Otero, 2012).  
The Provincial Policy Statement (Government of Ontario, 2020f), issued under section three of 
the Planning Act, provides policy direction on matters of provincial interest related to land use 
planning and development, including the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and 
adaptation to a changing climate. The statement recognizes that Ontario’s long-term 
prosperity, environmental health and social well-being depend on protecting water, 
agricultural, natural and cultural heritage and resources for long-term benefits of all Ontarians. 
The statement includes a range of policies that require municipalities to prepare for the 
impacts of a changing climate, support climate resiliency and mitigate risks to public health or 
safety, or property damage from natural hazards, including the risks that may be associated 
with the impacts of a changing climate. It requires municipalities to incorporate climate change 
considerations in their local planning policies and in land use planning decision-making. 
Equity 
Climate-related impacts vary across Ontario and often contribute to existing vulnerability and 
inequities within and between communities, with rural, remote, Northern and Indigenous 
Communities being at greatest risk. An equity lens has been applied to this analysis (see Figure 
10.7) to demonstrate how climate risks to various elements of community function can be 
amplified for populations with pre-existing vulnerability. 
Climate change is expected to disproportionately affect certain groups of people, depending on 
where they live and their ability to cope with different climate-related issues. Exposure 
sensitivity to extreme weather conditions such as heat, cold and heavy rain is high among 
people living in community housing, low-income, inner city, and high homelessness areas 
where impacts to critical infrastructure, air and water quality have a pronounced effect on 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        460  
communities (Smoyer-Tomic et al., 2003). Inequitable provision and access to community and 
essential services is expected to increase in extreme weather conditions, with people relying on 
healthcare and home care supports, unable to access these due to increased demand and 
service disruptions. Disruptions to transportation and supply chains are expected to have 
dramatic effects on rural, remote, northern, and Indigenous Communities, who rely on 
materials and goods from weather-impacted transportation routes to support construction, 
manufacturing, retail, recreation and accommodation economies (Council of Canadian 
Academies, 2019). Significant impacts of stormwater and wastewater treatment infrastructure 
failure would affect communities, particularly those with combined sewage and rainwater 
sewer systems (Trudeau, 2018). 
Importantly, communities and individuals that are vulnerable in the current climate will only be 
more vulnerable in the future. It is therefore necessary to make sure that intersections of 
inequities across Ontario are integrated into adaptation and response planning. Increased 
networks between different levels of government and community groups coupled with 
knowledge sharing and better understanding of lived experiences and resource needs of 
diverse stakeholders will improve decision making and ensure better outcomes for people and 
communities across the province (World Bank, 2022).  
Summary 
In summary, climate risks will impact the resiliency of Ontario’s communities through impacts 
on various components of the Natural Environment, Business and Economy, Food and 
Agriculture and Infrastructure. A better understanding of risks and impacts and use of 
approaches that take into account future climate change considerations will provide 
opportunities for making policy decisions to improve infrastructure redundancy, emergency 
response management, foster social support and inclusion, economic stability and ecological 
stewardship. Collaboration and knowledge sharing are required to achieve resilience of 
community function while adequately considering equity issues in adaptation planning.

11.0 A Path Forward and Considerations for Future 
Assessments 
The depth and breadth of information developed from Ontario’s PCCIA is significant. Qualitative 
and quantitative risk characterizations offer insights into the extent to which various sectors 
and systems across the province may be at risk, as well as how they are at risk and what 
variables are driving impacts.  
Information produced through the PCCIA is actionable directly through adaptation and 
resilience best practices as well as through supplemental assessment can be completed at 
different scales. The PCCIA Technical Report, Adaptation Best Practices Report, and other 
products offer critical information to advance adaptation planning and action for a variety of 
different decision-makers. Practitioners and others engaged through the PCCIA process are 
stewards of the work and recognize how adaptation efforts can be mainstreamed as people, 
communities and sectors find ways to mitigate risks and build climate resilience.  
All participants identified aspects of the study that provide valuable topics and lessons for 
future iterations of an Ontario-wide climate change impact assessment. In some cases, regional 
and Area of Focus specific risks were congruent with those noted in published literature on 
climate change adaptation. The common and uniting theme that stretches across all the PCCIA 
work, was one of urgency that highlights the resilience gap in Ontario and the need for 
increased levels of adaptation as climate risks continue to be felt across the province. 
Conducting the assessment has led to the following seven themes for consideration in 
subsequent provincial scale climate change impact assessments. 
Engage Further 
Engagement throughout the PCCIA focused on updates on progress, and education and 
validation of information. Even with the addition of more interactions with external participants 
due to the pandemic, a more sustained and deeper engagement with external participants 
would have offered more details on the process and opportunities for local and regional 
knowledge to supplement literature and professional judgement. There is a need to engage 
Indigenous organizations and communities more meaningfully to consider and incorporate 
Indigenous ways of knowing into the assessment. The way in which engagement with 
Indigenous organizations was conducted (and necessarily), left room for a dis-connect with 
adaptation planning and implementation that is happening at the community level. In the same 
way, engaging with external participants through umbrella or member organizations and 
associations meant that some of the adaptation work being done at finer scale may have been 
missed or underrepresented. This is an inherent challenge in climate change assessment at this 
scale. Nonetheless, engagement for this PCCIA has undoubtedly improved awareness of the 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        463  
issue and risks, and stimulated efforts to build climate resilience in many participating 
organizations and their members.  
The Balance of Depth and Breadth 
Across all Areas of Focus and Geographic Regions, opportunities exist to undertake additional 
research, evaluation and produce more locally driven actionable information. Regional averages 
and regional representative conditions were characterized in the PCCIA, but each region of 
Ontario is unique with local context including current resilience action, capacity and local 
supports and constraints. For example, 1) farming within PCCIA regions occurs at different of 
scales, 2) different commodities are sensitive to different climate variables, 3) use of different 
technologies varies from region to region, 4) some regions, sub-themes or commodities are 
subject to different policy constraints and other external factors like water availability. 
Ecosystems within urban and semi-urban watersheds differ significantly than those in rural or 
more naturalized areas, and the impacts and strategies to adapt differ accordingly. The complex 
systems within which society operates creates a web of interdependencies within which climate 
change impacts cascade. For example, business function and continuity rely on well maintained 
and resilient infrastructure, and the health and safety of people depend on a resilient food 
system. The PCCIA sought to find a balance of assessment depth and breadth and while 
assessment depth into Level 2 categories achieved significant spatial resolution, the necessary 
roll up of information meant that some of the spatial nuances may be hidden and perceived to 
have been missed. Subsequent province-wide assessments will endure this challenge, but 
results have been positioned to assist with finer scale, deeper assessments. 
Climate Change Data 
Climate and climate change data are crucial to a climate change impact and risk assessment. 
The data establishes the baseline to help understand how climate has changed, but best 
science and modeling help paint the picture of future climate change upon which we build risk 
scenarios and understand consequences. The desire to have ‘perfect’ data that is at a fine 
spatial scale with limited uncertainty can distract from the overall goal of assessments and 
constrain adaptation. The dearth of data that is available to support assessments leaves 
assessors wondering which data (and methods) to adopt and which is most suitable for the 
context. The suite of climate variables chosen for the PCCIA are not inclusive of all possible 
hazards, but they are extensive, and indices for each give yield to known impacts. External 
participants pointed to certain hazards that were relevant to their area of expertise and the 
suite was expanded. Climate information could be expanded to include additional hazards, such 
as future sub-daily extreme precipitation, freeze-thaw cycles, among others. These hazards 
would expand the range of climate interactions and impacts and likely be most helpful for finer 
scaled assessments in regions or sectors.  
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        464  
The climate change modelling field is one of the fastest developing science interests ever and 
there will always be new sources of information available. For example, at the time of this 
PCCIA study, a recently released IPCC AR6 suite of models was available but in early release. 
Going forward climate models are improving both their spatial and temporal scales along with 
deeper understanding of the physics of the atmosphere which earlier were more simply 
considered. This includes the development of improved convective schemes, permafrost 
components, cloud development, and full carbon cycles. With improved resolutions, scaling of 
results will be more straightforward, but it still must be considered that even with 
improvements, uncertainty will always be present. Indeed, even current climate conditions 
contain uncertainties related to siting of observation, instrument error and range, and the 
sparsity of observations in the north. Additionally, in future assessments, observed impacts and 
historical climate could include more detailed remote sensing data as more data is collected 
and gaps are filled. 
Advance Implementation 
Through the engagement process, external, and some internal PCCIA participants strongly 
indicated the need to move from research and assessment/planning to action. Beginning with 
the “end in mind” is one way to approach implementation stemming from the PCCIA. Highest 
risks, climate change opportunities, and priorities are all identified in the PCCIA Technical 
Report. There are numerous ways to interpret results in order to mainstream climate resilience 
into policies and programs and to motivate or catalyze action. There are many domestic and 
international examples of frameworks that can help the transition from climate change 
assessment and planning to implementation, including some developed in Ontario and applied 
by regional and municipal governments. Establishing a consistent Ontario approach, including 
guidance, methods, best practice for adapting to climate change across Ministries and for 
external stakeholders and organizations would accelerate adaptation implementation and 
foster a network for peer-to-peer learning. 
Coordination and Strategic Investment 
Evaluation of adaptation measures and planning for implementation includes assignments and 
necessary human resources and financing details. Areas of high risks and opportunities as 
identified in this Technical Report and in other PCCIA products, should help prioritize 
adaptation investment. Ideally, adaptation actions that are considered for implementation are 
reviewed using multiple criteria and in a collaborative manner with those who have 
implementing mandates. Investment in adaptation is not the sole responsibility of the 
provincial government, but rather a series of partnerships to pool resources to support climate 
resilience. Investing in adaptation and resilience pays dividends over the long term which has 
been proven in Canada and around the world. It is recommended that investments take a 
precautionary (risk-informed) and equity-based approach such that people and systems that 
 
 Ontario Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment | Technical Report        465  
are more disproportionally impacted by climate impacts are prioritized alongside managing and 
reducing higher climate risks. Convening provincial ministries to discuss PCCIA outcomes and 
priorities and a strategic approach to resilience investment would foster a shared climate 
resilience vision and catalyze meaningful adaptation outcomes. Strategic investment in 
resilience is particularly important for plans for new infrastructure in Ontario. 
Bolster Monitoring 
Monitoring stations and data networks collect crucial information necessary to understand 
trends for numerous climate, environmental and sector-specific areas. Continued coordination 
of monitoring roles and sharing of data expands our knowledge of system response to climate 
change and other socio-economic factors. In addition to monitoring of climate variables and 
impacts, striving for a system to monitor adaptation is important. Establishing and tracking 
progress on climate adaptation is complex but there is a growing body of literature on 
indicators that measure progress on adaptation implementation as well as outcomes from 
adaptation (risk levels). Similarly, a system to monitor and evaluate adaptation is the important 
context in which adaptation indicators are mobilized. As adaptation expands and accelerates in 
Ontario, it would be valuable to identify performance indicators that are time-bound, 
actionable, and transparent and share the results externally across Ontario. These indicators 
can be aligned with priorities for implementation and with sectors, systems, and communities 
where adaptation efforts may be targeted. 
Learn and Adapt 
Climate adaptation is an iterative process, and there are no one-size-fit-all solutions. It requires 
ongoing learning, collaboration, and iterations of assessment to foster successful adaptation. A 
commitment from the province to undertake the next iteration of PCCIA would account for new 
priorities, changes within society and communities and gain insight into new adaptation 
technology. A formal provincial adaptation plan would coordinate action among various levels 
of implementation, prioritize investment in high-risk areas and enable an understanding of 
changing climate risks. Accounting for inequity and utilizing traditional knowledge would 
further strengthen the assessment of climate impacts to inform equitable adaptation that not 
only mitigates risk, but also improves economic productivity, social cohesion and health and 
well-being across Ontario communities. Regional considerations are imperative as part of 
learning across Ontario, and opportunities also exist to distinguish between adaptation 
discrepancies and differences that exist between Ontario’s north and the more urban and rural 
regions further south. And perhaps most important, is the consideration of climate change 
adaptation in the context of critical measures to reduce carbon emissions.
