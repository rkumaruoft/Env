Foreword 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
recently revealed that over half of all natural disasters since 
the 1970s have involved water. As the climate crisis intensifies, 
the threat posed to people by changes in water systems will 
only grow. As well as affecting livelihoods, social systems and 
individuals, these changes can also have a huge impact on 
economies. Data from the Emergency Event Database (EM-
DAT) revealed that drought, floods and storms led to global 
economic losses of approximately $224.2 billion in 2021,  
compared to the 2001 to 2020 annual average of $117.8 billion. 
 
Aquanomics uses a bespoke model to project the future 
economic impact of water risk in seven countries represent-
ing a diverse range of climates: Australia, Canada, China, the 
Philippines, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom 
and the United States. It reveals droughts, floods and storms 
could result in a total loss of $5.6 trillion to GDP across these 
countries between 2022 and 2050.  This risk will not be 
spread evenly across countries, and some sectors will be hit 
harder than others. 
 
To address this huge challenge, more directed investment, fo-
cused innovation, and integrated water management is needed 
in our global water systems and bringing communities along 
on this journey is key. The water sector has the opportunity to 
lead change, embracing new technologies, approaches and 
solutions to optimise assets. Recognising the role of water as a 
connector between sectors – that is, as central to the devel-
opment of a circular economy and a critical element of every 
business and supply chain on the planet – will also be part of 
the solution. We’ve seen governments already taking action to 
mitigate water risk, but more needs to be done. 
We need to reorient our relationship with water. It’s time to 
move away from viewing it as a commodity to be controlled, 
instead recognising its intrinsic value; water is part of a natural 
cycle, the balance of which must be restored and maintained 
if we are to live sustainably and prosperously. At GHD, we 
are focused on working with stakeholders to develop and 
implement integrated solutions to this challenge. This means 
understanding and optimising the infrastructure already in 
place and collaborating with our clients and industry peers to 
consider different kinds of assets that work in harmony with 
communities and nature. 
The water industry must take an agile approach, regenerating 
systems, and building resilience over time, while involving 
communities at every stage. This will require radical 
collaboration across industry and innovative policy solutions 
from government. Truly resilient water infrastructure will 
require close partnerships between the public and private 
sector to tackle this together – across borders, at a global 
level, as well as within countries and communities. We need to 
consider water by catchments, not by political or  
artificial boundaries.
By focusing on economic impacts, as we have done with 
this study, we aim to help identify and unlock the social and 
environmental benefits of tackling water risk head-on. As 
well as highlighting risk, this study explores some of the ways 
in which our focus countries can adapt to change and build 
resilience in their water systems. With water risk on the rise, we 
need to move to a proactive, holistic and inclusive approach in 
understanding and addressing fast-developing challenges.

1 Unless otherwise stated, all figures are in US dollars
Aquanomics: The economics of water risk and future resilience utilised a three-
phase methodology to estimate the direct losses, sector losses and GDP losses 
that will be attributed to water risk (droughts, floods and storms) between 2022 and 
2050. The study focuses on seven key countries across GHD’s footprint - Australia, 
Canada, China, the Philippines, the UAE, the UK and the US - and three US regions 
- Northeastern US, Southeastern US and Southwestern US.  
Phase 1: Projecting direct water risk losses at key dates between  
2022 and 2050
We used data from the global insurance sector to project the potential direct 
losses attributed to water risk (droughts, floods and storms) across our 10 focus 
geographies. This data is derived from Ortec Finance’s climate PREDICT model2 and 
includes both insured and uninsured losses. It is reported in currency terms (USD).
Phase 2: Estimating future losses from water risk by sector between  
2022 and 2050
We conducted a review of relevant literature into the effects of drought, flooding 
and water-related storm damage on five economic sectors. This was based on a 
total review of 19 research papers and focused on the agriculture; banking and 
insurance; energy and utilities; fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and retail; and 
manufacturing and distribution sectors. 
Phase 3: Modelling wider economic impact of water losses at key dates 
between 2022 and 2050
We then inputted the water risk loss data from stages 1 and 2 (estimated direct 
sector losses) into the E3ME economic model3 as ‘shocks’ to ascertain the total 
economic impact of water risk across the 10 focus geographies.  
These impacts included:
	–
Direct effects: from direct losses to different sectors and households  
(using data from Phase 2).
	–
Indirect effects: adjustments to price (including energy price) and government 
spending, as well as investment impacts caused by the capacity shocks. 
	–
Wider effects: impacts on supply chains, international competitiveness, 
employment, income, and consumption.
The outputs of the model are then reported in currency terms (total GDP USD losses 
between 2022 and 2050), a percentage of annual GDP and output at a sector level. 
Global climate change assumptions
As global warming intensifies, extreme weather events are expected to increase, 
resulting in greater water risk to countries and regions. The figures in this study 
assume a 2° C rise in global temperatures in line with the ‘absolute cap’ in global 
warming agreed by governments in the 2015 Paris Agreement (a threshold beyond 
which climate impacts become increasingly extreme).

From risk to resilience
→
The global water cycle is the most important component of 
our natural ecosystems – yet rising CO2 levels are causing it 
to change at an alarming rate. Weather patterns are changing, 
resulting in increasingly frequent and extreme water-related 
disasters. Rainfall events are becoming shorter and more 
intense, increasing storm and flood risks worldwide, while 
longer, hotter drought periods and associated wildfires are 
causing more damage to agriculture, buildings, infrastructure, 
and habitats. This rising variability means that using historical 
weather patterns to predict future conditions is becoming 
more unreliable.
Natural assets, which sustain and control the water cycle, are 
being lost at a rapid rate. Underground aquifers worldwide 
are being drawn down so that water has to be pumped from 
deeper levels, and the resulting water quality degradation 
is increasing the need for desalination. At the same time, 
large areas of forest and wetland continue to be cleared and 
drained, while rivers are modified for hydropower, irrigation, 
and water supply.
Global Aquanomics 
The social impact of water-related disasters on people and 
communities can be dramatic, especially for the poorest 
and most vulnerable members of the population. Levels of 
exposure and vulnerability can vary enormously between – 
and within – countries, depending upon location and income. 
Recent research from the Emergency Event Database  
(EM-DAT) revealed, in 2021, drought, flood and storm disasters 
affected close to 100 million people globally, through factors 
such as displacement, economic damage, food insecurity 
and injury4.  Although this number was below the 2001-2020 
average, 2021 was marked by an increased number of disaster 
events and extensive economic losses. 
Aquanomics across  
the globe
The economic risk of water by region
Our Aquanomics model estimates droughts, floods and storms 
could result in a total loss of almost $5.6 trillion to GDP for 
our eight focus countries between 2022 and 2050 – more 
than the combined annual GDP of the UK and Germany. While 
the economic shock of water risk will accelerate throughout 
the century, it is a pressing concern this decade: between 
now and 2030, water risk could cost global economies an 
estimated total of $1.3 trillion. 
This water risk is spread unevenly across the globe.  
The Philippines, Australia and the US are projected to 
experience an average economic decline of between 0.5% 
and 0.7% in annual GDP in the years up to 2050. For the UAE 
and the UK, despite having very different economies and 
water risk exposure, it is estimated the average yearly impact 
to GDP will be just 0.1%. 
In 2021, drought affected over 50 million people, floods affected 
some 30 million people, and storms affected  
17.6 million people worldwide.

Energy and utilities
The energy-water nexus means the availability of water 
resources can directly affect the productivity of energy 
systems, and vice-versa. Our Aquanomics model projects 
total output losses of $237bn to the energy and utilities 
sector by 2050.
Water risk in the energy and utilities sector 
Restricted access to water can limit energy production due 
to the shutdown of powerplants (such as hydro and nuclear), 
while flooding and storms can result in direct damage to 
energy and water infrastructure, as well as limiting solar 
power production. 
Direct losses attributed to floods, droughts and storms
The wider GDP and sector losses projected within this study 
are calculated using the direct losses attributed to floods, 
droughts and storms. Across the 10 focus geographies in this 
study, storms are likely to cause the largest direct losses to 
economies, followed by floods and then droughts.
Manufacturing and distribution
Our Aquanomics model predicts the manufacturing and 
distribution sector will be the most heavily affected by 
increasing water risk – facing total output losses of just over 
$4.2tn by 2050.
Water risk in the manufacturing and distribution sector
Manufacturing plays a fundamental role in the supply chains 
of all other sectors. Water scarcity can restrict industrial 
production processes, while flooding and storms can cause 
direct damage to assets (buildings, inventory and machinery) 
and energy supply. Water risk also impacts distribution; 
for example, extreme drought can cause disruption to 
waterborne transportation while flooding and storms can 
disrupt road and rail infrastructure.
Fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) and retail
The FMCG and retail sector is heavily reliant on water 
infrastructure throughout its interconnected and complex 
supply chains. Our Aquanomics model predicts the sector 
could face total output losses of just over $1.1tn by 2050  
due to water risk.
Water risk in the FMCG and retail sector 
Water-related disasters can cause direct damage to 
infrastructure and assets, including buildings, inventory and 
machinery. It can also cause disruptions to supply chains 
through transport infrastructure such as roads and railways 
and compounding delays in global shipping caused by 
geopolitical uncertainties.
Direct losses by event type
Agriculture
Agriculture is the world’s thirstiest industry – accounting for 
approximately 70% of global freshwater withdrawals. Our 
Aquanomics model estimates the sector could lose $332bn 
in economic output between 2022 and 2050.
Water risk in the agricultural sector
Droughts have devastating effects on crop cultivation and 
livestock farming, while flooding and storms can damage 
infrastructure, crop lands, livestock shelter and farming 
equipment. Water-related disasters can also have a long-
term impact on the productivity of agricultural land. 
Disruption to food production can impact imports and 
exports, which can affect global food security as well as 
impacting health and social equity within countries. 
Banking and insurance
As a proportion of overall output, the banking and insurance 
sector has a more optimistic outlook compared to the other 
sectors. However, our Aquanomics model projects it could 
still incur losses of  $514bn between 2022 and 2050.
Water risk in the banking and insurance sector
These losses will primarily come from the indirect wider 
disruption caused by droughts, floods and storms, such 
as reductions in productivity and economic activity in the 
aftermath of these events. Additional long-term impacts 
include the disruption of trade, increased insurance payouts 
and the disruption of vital infrastructure.
Aquanomics by sector
The economic risk of water at a sector level
All businesses are dependent on water; no matter their size 
or sector, they require water to function. This makes water 
a connector between sectors, crucial to enabling circular 
economies and global supply chains. It also means no sector 
is protected against operational disruption in the face of 
droughts, floods and storms.
Our Aquanomics model reveals the impact of water risk on 
five critical sectors within the global economy: agriculture; 
banking and insurance; energy and utilities; FMCG and retail; 
and manufacturing and distribution. While these sectors are 
diverse, with very different types and levels of water risk, they 
are all expected to face significant output losses in the years 
up to 2050.

Building future water resilience 
What steps can be taken to boost water resilience across the globe?
The diversity of water risk that exists across the globe means there is no one-size-fits-all solution for improving water resilience. 
Resilience in a region that is facing severe water scarcity can mean a very different thing when compared to a region where the 
greatest risk is posed by an over-abundance. Despite this, taking a long-term strategic view of the management of water assets 
and focusing on a few universal principles will help ensure resilience is improved across the globe.    
With the climate crisis increasing 
the frequency of extreme weather 
events, building resilience is no longer 
a case of implementing costly, large-
scale infrastructure interventions and 
expecting them to be effective for the 
next century. The industry needs to be 
able to rapidly adapt to evolving risk; it is 
about optimising assets and leveraging 
nature-based solutions that can be 
implemented quickly and efficiently for 
maximum effect.

Adopting a circular economy approach 
to water management is crucial. 
Focusing on water recycling and working 
within nature’s cycle can not only 
improve the long-term sustainability of 
water infrastructure but reduce costs as 
well. Nature-based solutions often do 
not demand huge capital upfront and 
can achieve the same results as more 
traditional forms of water infrastructure. 
Embracing advanced digital solutions 
and data to improve the management 
and efficiency of the water cycle will also 
play a major role in mitigating risk. Smart 
devices and sensors enable utilities to 
monitor the resilience of their assets 
in real-time – enabling more effective 
maintenance – and predictive modelling 
will allow water supply clients to be 
proactive toward climate stress, helping 
them make better-informed decisions 
about where to direct future investment.
Access to safe, affordable and reliable water 
is a fundamental human right and plays an 
increasingly crucial role in every part of the 
global economy, and yet it is one of our most 
undervalued resources. The water sector faces 
the twin issues of increasing requirements for 
water (both residential and commercial) and 
a potential reduction in supply due to climate 
change. The way in which the industry responds 
to these threats will be one of the most important 
challenges of the coming decades.

Australia
Land of droughts and flooding rains
Our Aquanomics model projects that droughts, floods, and 
storms could result in a total loss of $312 billion to Australia’s 
GDP between 2022 and 2050 – almost one third of Australia’s 
GDP in 2020. Storms are expected to have the greatest direct 
impact on the economy ($70 billion), followed by  
floods ($44 billion) and droughts ($28 billion).
As a land of ‘droughts and flooding rains’, Australia has more 
experience than most in the battle against water risk. Australia 
is the driest of all inhabited continents, experiencing varied 
and volatile weather patterns across the country. Australia’s 
east coast has experienced record rains and flooding in 2022; 
by the end of the first week in March, Southern Queensland 
and northern New South Wales had each received more 
than a year’s worth of rainfall in a week, leaving thousands 
displaced and destroying property, livestock and transport 
infrastructure.
Building future water resilience
With a growing population and increasing demand for water, the adoption of a 
circular economy approach by the Australian water industry is crucial to optimising 
resources and mitigating risk. At GHD, we are supporting this mission, helping water 
authorities design out waste and pollution and regenerate natural systems. 
Increasing supplies of manufactured water through water reuse and recycling offers 
a reliable source of water that is not climate-dependent. For Australia’s coastal 
cities – where 80% of the country’s population is concentrated – desalination will 
be crucial in easing water stress. Inland, wastewater treatment and recycling will 
become more important. These processes make purified recycled water available to 
power stations, industry, and agriculture for indirect potable reuse. 
In rural farming communities, where it is often impossible to manufacture the 
enormous quantities of water needed, the answer lies in the modernisation of 
inefficient systems. With irrigated agriculture currently using approximately three 
quarters of Australia’s natural water supply, upgrading to smarter irrigation systems 
will be central to mitigating the threat posed to the industry by water risk. Embracing 
sensible renewal and replacement programs and predictive digital solutions – like 
flood modelling and real-time monitoring systems – will also help to plan for future 
risk. There are already some great examples of where this has been successfully 
implemented such as the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Scheme.
The Government has a key role to play in managing the transition to new methods of 
water management. Investment programs, such as the National Water Grid Fund, are 
the first step, but infrastructure can only be part of the solution; moving to a circular 
economy means fundamental changes to deeply held attitudes around  
water management.
The agricultural 
industry will have to 
improve productivity 
more than previously 
planned.
Water risk in Australia
After more than 60,000 years of stewardship by Indigenous 
Peoples, the country’s fragile ecosystems reflect remarkable 
adaptation to dry conditions. However, post-industrial era 
climate variability is straining aquatic ecosystems and other 
living systems with profound consequences. For example, 
between December 2018 and January 2019, a combination 
of drought and harmful algal blooms resulted in the death 
of hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of fish in the 
Murray-Darling Basin. Disruption to these systems due to 
contamination and the risk of too much or too little water, 
exacerbated by climate change, is putting pressure on 
communities and livelihoods hardest hit by exposure. 
Australia’s agricultural sector will feel the most significant 
economic impact of climate change, with projected annual 
output losses of 5% by 2030 and 8% by 2050 – the largest 
in percentage terms in the entire study. Overall, water risk 
could result in the sector suffering $150 billion in total output 
losses between 2022 and 2050. These potential losses 
could mean the industry will have to improve productivity 
more than previously planned in order to achieve the 
Government’s ambition of growing Australian agriculture to 
AUD$100 billion by 2030.

A land of extremes
Our Aquanomics model projects that droughts, floods and 
storms could result in a total loss of $108 billion to Canadian 
GDP between 2022 and 2050 – an average of 0.2% of GDP 
per annum. Canada’s large land mass – combined with low 
population density – contributes to water risk having less of 
an impact than many of the other countries in the study, but 
there are still risks. Flooding alone is expected to cost the 
Canadian economy over $30 billion in the years leading up 
to 2050, making up almost half of the country’s estimated 
total direct losses.

Water risk in Canada 
Canada is a country of physical extremes and contrasts. 
Many of this vast country’s enormous forests, rivers, lakes 
and wetlands remain in relatively pristine condition due to 
the low population density and its high-water availability, 
although the Arctic region is changing rapidly due to the 
high rate of warming and melting permafrost. The Great 
Lakes region – which holds over 20% of the Earth’s surface 
fresh water – has been intensively managed over time in a 
collaborative way between Canada and the US.
Despite high levels of insurance and excellent disaster risk 
reduction systems in place, the Canadian population is 
still vulnerable to water-related hazards. The 2021 British 
Columbia floods saw the city of Vancouver cut off when 
the transport corridor linking it to the rest of the country 
was flooded out. For the First Nations, issues of inequitable 
access to clean, safe drinking water are an urgent priority.

Building future water resilience
Canada may not be a water-stressed country, but it is a country of extremes, and 
these extremes are getting more pronounced. With the Canadian government 
estimating the country is warming at double the global mean rate, a growing number 
of municipalities have declared climate emergencies and are implementing policies 
to boost resiliency. It is up to the engineering community to help clients adopt a risk-
based management approach to plan for increasing variability. 
Effective risk management means squeezing the maximum amount of value from 
assets – ideally replacing them just in time. The City of Toronto is currently losing 
103 million litres of water per day due to ageing pipes. To help mitigate this sort of 
wastage, we need to make better use of the growing volume of data being generated 
to enable predictive monitoring and maintenance of assets.
GHD’s recent project with the City of Calgary and the Calgary Airport Authority 
developed a data study to determine the impacts of climate change. The analysis 
revealed that, although the amount of precipitation is going to stay the same, that 
precipitation will change and become more extreme. The city has begun using this 
data to inform infrastructure design, operational planning and community decision-
making to eventually build more climate-resilient infrastructure.
Funding is available for these projects through the Investing in Canada plan. 
Launched in 2016, the Canadian government committed over CAD$180 billion to 
improve ageing infrastructure across the country. This includes funding to increase 
water infrastructure resilience, but further investment is needed too.

Continued investment
Although China has a similar land mass to other regions in the 
study, its high population and large economy would suggest 
that water risk will have a bigger impact. However, the 
region’s significant investment in infrastructure means that 
the predicted average yearly GDP loss from droughts, floods 
and storms is just 0.2%.
Although the average annual GDP impact of water risk is 
small, in real terms, the total losses are huge between 2022 
and 2050 with China projected to lose over $1.1 trillion in 
GDP over that period. The country’s mighty manufacturing 
and distribution sector is set to be worst hit, losing nearly 
$1.7 trillion to water-related natural disasters over the 
course of the next 30 years. 
The country’s mighty 
manufacturing and 
distribution sector is 
set to be worst hit.
Water risk in China 
China is a highly diverse country, both in geography and 
ethnography, bringing a high degree of vulnerability to 
climatic hazards. The country’s historic exposure to massive 
flooding in its two major river basins (the Yellow and the 
Yangtze), as well as in smaller catchments, has led to a focus 
on developing water infrastructure and canalising rivers to 
reduce the impact of flood disasters since ancient times. 
More recently, China has redefined itself as an “ecological 
civilisation” with priorities including reducing water pollution, 
protecting wetlands and building “sponge cities” that absorb 
water, while continuing to build water infrastructure apace.  
Large inter-basin water transfer projects and the creation of 
a national water grid build resilience against drought in water-
scarce regions of China. However, floods remain the major 
water-related threat with 14.5 million people affected and 
displaced in 2021, while the mortality rate was relatively low 
(352 people) due to improvements in early warning systems 
and emergency services. Poor rural households in China are 
disproportionately affected by floods.
However, the region has invested a significant amount in 
projects to build resilience, such as the Three Gorges Dam 
and the South-to-North Water Diversion project. Between 
2008 and 2019 there was a spectacular seven-fold increase 
in annual expenditure on water infrastructure projects. And, 
in January 2022 the Chinese government announced plans 
to further expand water investment during the 14th Five-Year 
Plan period (2021-2025).

Building future water resilience
China’s resiliency to past water risks has been primarily defined by their bold 
investments into greater infrastructure developments both in rural and urban 
areas. However, the number of summer floods in the southern regions of China’s 
manufacturing hub is predicted to increase as climate challenges worsen. 
China has begun to combine the successes of traditional and technological 
approaches to mitigating the effects of flash floods through an Asian Development 
Bank project, which utilises a community-level mobile app-enabled emergency 
response that collects and monitors measurements of rainfall remotely while making 
use of alarm systems to alert residents for evacuation in the Shewei and Kongmu 
river basins. 
Given the scale of the water risk in China, it is crucial that the Chinese government, 
with support from international development organisations and neighbouring 
countries, invests in greater preventive infrastructure through a combination of dry 
and wet floodproofing measures that would allow for floods to be diverted wherever 
possible, while at the same time developing infrastructure that can withstand 
frequent flood threats.

Water, water everywhere
Our Aquanomics model projects that droughts, floods 
and storms could result in a total loss of $124 billion to the 
Philippines’s GDP between 2022 and 2050. The Philippines 
is ranked as the fourth most affected country in the world 
for water-related disasters, with approximately 20 typhoons 
entering the country each year, often bringing torrential rain 
and flooding. Our data shows that floods and tropical storms 
are predicted to amount to over 90% of direct losses  
(around $89 billion) between 2022 and 2050
The Philippines is 
ranked as the fourth 
most affected country 
in the world for water-
related disasters.
Water risk in the Philippines   
The Philippines is a tropical archipelago with more than 
7,000 islands. Its extraordinary biodiversity is still preserved 
on many of the smaller islands, however over 70% of its 
forest cover was lost over the last century. Levels of water 
pollution are locally very high in many places due to a lack of 
wastewater treatment, affecting the health of communities 
and ecosystems. 
Major infrastructure and population centres are located 
on the coastal plains, exposing them to flooding and storm 
events. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan (known locally as Yolanda) 
killed 6,300 people and left 28,689 injured, 1.6 million 
homeless and more than six million displaced. Typhoon Rai in 
2021 displaced 10.6 million people, yet the death toll was 457 
people, showing the value of the early warning systems and 
other disaster risk reduction measures put in place. 
Although a minority have many options for avoiding these 
risks, adaptation options are limited for the majority 
of citizens, due to their lack of resources. Despite the 
devastation bought about by frequent natural disasters, 
inadequate and intermittent water supply remains a 
challenge across the country; around one in ten Filipinos 
do not have access to improved water sources, with poorer 
communities being disproportionately affected.

Building future water resilience
The Philippines is one of the world’s fastest growing emerging markets in terms 
of population, urbanisation and industrialisation. With the population expected 
to increase by around 50% by 2050, prioritising ongoing investment in water 
infrastructure will be crucial over the coming decades.
Water supply and sanitation services are a key focus, with three million Filipino 
citizens currently relying on unsafe water sources, and seven million lacking access 
to improved sanitation. The Philippine Water Supply and Sanitation Master Plan calls 
for a total investment of around 1.1 trillion pesos to achieve universal access to water 
and sanitation for all Filipinos by 2030. GHD partners with the country’s major water 
utility providers to achieve universal access to safe, sufficient, and sustainable  
water supply. 
When it comes to flood management, investment needs to be targeted to building 
infrastructure in the right areas and working with nature to channel water away. This 
means carrying out flood studies and building infrastructure out of flood zones 
where possible, but this can be challenging when retrofitting solutions in densely 
populated urban areas.

UAE
Turning risk into opportunity
Even though drought conditions are the baseline, and floods 
and storms are currently very rare, our Aquanomics model 
projects that the UAE will still face a degree of water risk 
(albeit low when compared to other countries and regions 
within this study). The country is expected to face a  
$27 billion total GDP loss between 2022 and 2050 due to 
changing droughts, floods, and storm conditions. The main 
sector-level threat to the UAE falls on its growing agricultural 
sector, which is projected to experience output losses of 
0.5% year-on-year due to water risk.
Due to its climate and 
developed economy, the 
UAE already has a highly 
advanced standard of 
water infrastructure 
across its regions, but 
the anticipated changing 
climate conditions – will 
require this baseline to be 
further transformed. 
Water risk in the UAE  
This cluster of Emirates contains a unique water risk profile 
across both the deserts and in the developed city oases. 
Apart from a few sparse wetland areas, the UAE’s meagre 
water resources consist mainly of groundwater eked out by 
the expensive and energy-intensive desalination process. 
Rising temperatures and a greater frequency and voracity of 
dust storms are the major climate threats to the UAE and its 
ecosystems. Despite the baseline challenges, potable water 
is comparatively cheap, which facilitates one of the world’s 
highest water usage rates per capita.
In recognition of these trends, the UAE Water Security 
Strategy 2036 was launched in 2017 and aims to boost 
sustainability and achieve a strategic set of water security 
goals. Due to its naturally inhospitable climate and developed 
economy, the UAE already has a highly advanced standard 
of water infrastructure across its regions, but the anticipated 
changing climate conditions – and ultimately ageing assets 
– will require this baseline to be further transformed to meet 
the desired future goals.

Building future water resilience
As one of the most water-scarce countries in the word, the UAE has become 
dependent on desalination to mitigate risk, with 42% of its potable water supply 
coming from the thermal desalination of seawater. But these processes come at 
a high economic and environmental price, and – looking to a future increasingly 
affected by the global climate crisis – this critical infrastructure is also at risk from 
rising sea levels. 
The UAE needs less and better desalination, which will ultimately enhance water 
processes and mitigate severe environmental impacts. Applying a long-term 
perspective and increasing the use of innovative technologies such as water 
recycling and the use of renewable energy for desalination will be key to building 
resiliency in the country and enable targeted demand management. The strategic 
use of precious groundwater resources will also be crucial, particularly for the 
agricultural sector.
Currently, a large proportion of the UAE’s infrastructure projects are funded by the 
region’s oil and gas exports. But this industry is undergoing a huge transition, and 
appropriate long-term planning is needed to set the country up for a sustainable 
future. Sustainable transition needs to be a focus across the broad spectrum – and 
water should not be immune from that.

Long-term flood risk
Our Aquanomics model projects that, in total, the UK could 
face a loss of $153 billion to GDP due to water risk between 
the years 2022 to 2050. It also estimates that it will lose over 
$100 billion over that period as a direct result of water risk, 
with flooding making up approximately 45% of that total. 
That said, all things being equal, the model also projects that 
the global threat of droughts, floods and storms could lead 
to the UK’s agricultural sector increasing its output slightly by 
2050 to make up for other countries’ reduction in output.
The global threat of 
droughts, floods and 
storms could lead to 
the UK’s agricultural 
sector increasing

Water risk in the UK  
With a temperate climate, the UK faces relatively low 
levels of water risk. Resilience is high, and most people are 
protected from loss of their existing homes, assets and 
livelihoods through insurance. But, while the majority of 
the population has low rates of exposure and vulnerability 
to hazards such as droughts, floods and storms, there are 
pockets of the country that are disproportionately affected. 
Climate change, population growth and the protection of 
delicate environments are leading to water shortages in parts 
of the Southeast. More than half the region’s water comes 
from underground aquifers that rely on sufficient winter 
rainfall to meet rising water demands in spring and summer. 
Climate change will have a big impact on the variability 
and volume of rainfall, making long term planning with any 
certainty harder. The Southeast region typically experiences 
more droughts than any other region in the UK and the 
predicted hotter, drier summers will put even more pressure 
on homes, business, and the natural environment.

The UK’s Aquanomics data dashboard 
In contrast, heavy rainfall across large swathes of the UK leads to flooding as 
rivers and sewers are unable to take away water quickly enough. Homes and 
businesses where sewer capacity is inadequate for the huge volumes, or where 
built on floodplains and vulnerable parts of the coastline, face increasing risks due 
to flooding and land erosion, with increasing social and economic pressures to 
relocate. Effective early warning systems and emergency services help to ensure 
that the risk of mortality and illness as a result of storms and floods remains low for 
the vast majority of the population.
The Water Services Regulation Authority, or Ofwat – the economic regulator of the 
privatised water sector in England and Wales – has pledged a spending package 
of £51 billion for 2020-2025. A quarter of this, £13 billion, is for new and improved 
services to help tackle challenges outside of day-to-day operations. This includes 
£1 billion to reduce the impact of future flooding and almost £500 million to help 
solve long-term drought resilience challenges. The Environment Agency has also 
promised investment of £5.2 billion to create around 2,000 new flood and coastal 
defences to better protect 336,000 properties in England by 2027, alongside 
support to help communities back on their feet more quickly after flooding.
Building future water resilience
The UK population is forecast to reach 75 million by 2050, with most of the rise 
expected to occur in areas already experiencing water stress. On a warming planet, 
extreme and irregular weather events such as floods and drought are expected to 
become more frequent, and the ecological health of our rivers is declining.
Building resilience and adaptability into our systems that collect, treat, store, and 
distribute water must be addressed now. Strategic water planning that ensures 
affordability, resilience and sustainability for the public, industry and the natural 
environment is urgently needed, but the scale and complexity present a real 
challenge for government, regulators, and water companies.
Effective infrastructure is critical for sustained economic growth and adequate 
well-being, but current investment levels are insufficient to repair our ageing 
water systems, expand systems to accommodate urban growth, meet stricter 
environmental regulations or adequately adapt to climate change.
The UK Government’s proposed legislation (in the Environment Bill) provisions 
on nature – including biodiversity net gain, local nature recovery strategies and 
protected site strategies – are complimenting the drive to use natural systems 
to slow storm flows, store water and cleanse runoff. Green bonds or debt raised 
specifically for environmental purposes are being used to finance related 
investment.
Water intensive sectors such as energy, agriculture and manufacturing tend to 
pursue individual plans, however collaboration across these parties would enable 
more efficient water use. Bringing together water stakeholders is critical to meet 
increasing demand for water while maintaining a sustainable, vibrant and resilient 
environment that can respond to the major impacts that climate change is having 
on this vital resource. Circular economy approaches are now in the spotlight to help, 
but it is abundantly clear that the urgency to adapt and transform in the face of 
immediate and future challenges has intensified to a new level.

US (overall)
Infrastructure investment signals a new era
Our Aquanomics model projects water risk could result in 
a total loss of $3.7 trillion to US GDP between 2022 and 
2050. For comparison, the recently passed Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act includes approximately $1.2 
trillion in spending on upgrading the nation’s physical 
and infrastructure systems, with a package that includes 
transportation, broadband access, clean water and electric 
grid renewal. When it comes to direct losses, storms are 
predicted to account for over half of the overall damage 
($1.4 trillion) followed by floods ($645 billion) and droughts 
($432 billion). Manufacturing and distribution could suffer 
total output losses of $2.2 trillion by 2050 – but that only 
works out to 0.7% of its average yearly loss. The agriculture 
industry, on the other hand – the most water-intensive 
industry – faces losses of $143 billion by 2050, but this is an 
average output loss of 1.2% each year. 
Storms are predicted to 
account for over half 
of the overall damage.
Water risk in the US
The United States is a highly diverse landscape, ranging 
from tropical conditions in the South to arctic and alpine 
conditions in Alaska and across the Rocky Mountains – 
this not only brings varying challenges for industry, supply 
chain and energy supply, but also means that water risk 
type varies greatly by location. Across the country, climate 
change is resulting in more frequent heat waves, extreme 
precipitation, larger wildfires, and water scarcity. When 
combined with outdated infrastructure, these catastrophes 
pose a significant threat to the economy and the wellbeing 
of its people. 
This diversity also extends to the management of water, 
which is largely devolved to the state level. Individual states 
have substantial authority to establish and implement 
laws, policies and programs on water, appropriate to local 
needs. However, no single governmental level has complete 
authority over water management and rights: policies must 
be coordinated among all levels of government,  
as well as administrative commissions and independent  
regional agencies.  
Collaboration to manage river basins and aquifers for water 
security becomes more complex, and many interstate 
water disputes are settled in the courts of law. However, 
widespread disasters can be declared at the federal level 
and thereby trigger federal funds for disaster relief. Coastal, 
riverine and urban flooding affects both communities and 
ecosystems. For instance, the Mississippi River Basin is the 
largest drainage system in the country, encompassing 31 of 
the 50 states.

Building future water resilience
The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) provides a much-needed injection 
of funding for the water sector, which has long been starved of the capital needed to 
maintain vital infrastructure.
Building future water resilience across the US will require solutions as diverse as the 
types of water risk the country faces. Managing water scarcity caused by drought in 
California will require an entirely different approach to mitigating the worst impact of 
storm surges in the Gulf of Mexico. In the Northeast, flooding is the biggest problem, 
although replacing lead pipes in the drinking water system is also a key priority. In the 
Southeast, flooding and coastal protection top the agenda. For these regions,  
a focus on flood mitigation should be at the centre of any water resilience strategy. 
However, what unites all these regions is the need to adopt innovative new solutions 
and technology – which the US has in abundance – and to pursue an approach of 
radical collaboration between all stakeholders.

Ageing assets due for an upgrade
With estimated total GDP losses of over $700 billion 
between 2022 and 2050, our Aquanomics model projects 
that the states that make up the Northeastern region of the 
US face a significant economic hit. The region also could 
face direct losses of $434 billion in the years leading up to 
2050, with well over half of that figure ($288 billion) attributed 
to flooding. 
In percentage terms, it is the region’s FMCG and retail and 
agriculture sectors that could be particularly affected, with 
projected annual output losses of nearly 3%. However, the 
Northeastern US’s huge financial sector (incorporating the 
financial hubs of New York City and Delaware) is predicted to 
be relatively unscathed with projected output losses of  
just 0.1%.
The Northeastern 
region of the US  
faces a significant  
economic hit. 
Water risk in the Northeastern US
The Northeastern region is characterised by a fairly diverse 
climate, with bitterly cold winters often bringing extreme 
weather in the form of ice storms and snowstorms (including 
the infamous ‘nor’easters’ – massive storms blowing from 
the northeast) and semi-humid summers, especially to the 
south. The region suffers from ageing infrastructure, with 
much of it having been constructed over a century ago. 
Many older cities’ sewer and stormwater systems simply 
cannot handle the volume of water produced by heavy 
storms, and many areas have toxic lead pipes supplying 
drinking water, which need to be replaced. 
However, the exposure and vulnerability of the population 
are relatively low due to effective and widespread early 
warning systems. While Hurricane Ida caused a huge amount 
of economic disaster losses in the Northeastern US  
(over $18 billion) due to flash flooding and tornados, the 
number of fatalities was relatively low. Emergency situations 
may lead to the temporary displacement or evacuation of 
large numbers of people; however, most are able to return 
home and rebuild due to high levels of insurance cover and 
federal support, as was notably the case following Hurricane 
Sandy in 2011.

Facing stormy weather
Our Aquanomics model projects that the Southeastern 
region of the US could face total GDP losses of over $400 
billion between 2022 and 2050 due to droughts, floods and 
storms – representing an average annual loss of 0.5% to  
the economy.  
At $176 billion, the greatest estimated direct losses faced 
by the Southeastern states in the years between 2022 and 
2050 is from storms – accounting for over 70% of total direct 
losses. In terms of industry, the region’s FMCG and retail 
sector will be hit hardest; it is projected that the sector will 
lose $227 billion due to water risk by 2050, representing an 
average annual output loss of 1.9%.  
Rapid urbanisation 
and growing, shifting 
populations are putting 
pressure on water 
supplies and water 
quality.
Water risk in the Southeastern US
The Southeastern US generally receives a lot of rain and 
is considered water rich. The region is also home to iconic 
wetlands and water environments including the Everglades in 
Florida. However, rapid urbanisation and shifting populations 
are putting pressure on water supplies and water quality. This 
is likely to be compounded by increasing coastal flooding 
threats. Not only does this pose a threat to communities, 
limiting safe water supply, but to fragile aquatic ecosystems 
and agriculture.  
In 2017, Hurricane Irma – and the ensuing heavy rains and 
storm surges – caused widespread destruction across 
the Southeast. The disaster resulted in over one hundred 
fatalities and an estimated $50 billion in damage – making 
it the fifth-costliest hurricane to hit the mainland US 
sinch 1900. Due to the increasing number of storms and 
hurricanes, flood protection is a high priority.

Building future water resilience
Water issues in the Southeast are complex and interconnected systems with 
diverse sets of stakeholders. Initiatives like resiliency are dictated by a myriad of 
considerations, impacted by growth, land use and environmental management. 
Because of these relationships, planning for water resilience in the Southeast is 
not simple nor straightforward. Organisations require new innovative approaches 
that help understand and navigate the process of building capacity to function in 
the face of water-related stresses to allow cities and citizens to survive and thrive. 
Digital solutions will be required to prioritise efforts and action, bring clarity to the 
vision of resilience, centralise knowledge and data, and leverage existing sensors and 
telemetry already embedded in systems and environments of these organisations. 
With the climate crisis increasing the frequency of extreme weather events, the 
water sector and local municipalities must ensure the long-term resiliency of water 
infrastructure. Taking stock of the current state of coastal water infrastructure 
and assessing which areas are vulnerable to flooding or storm surges should be 
the start of any water resiliency strategy. With this insight, recommendations for 
improvements can be made including “dry flood proofing” – reinforcing the structure 
to withstand floods – or “wet flood proofing” – allowing flood water to enter the 
building but protecting the contents of the building from water damage.
Real-time data analysis can also provide municipalities across Florida, Louisiana, 
Georgia and Virginia with improved flood risk intelligence. Combined with real-world 
network controls like valves and sluice gates, this is one of the most effective ways to 
improve the water resiliency in a region – such as Southeastern US – that is subject 
to extensive flood and storm damage.

Southwestern US
Home of the megadrought 
In less than 30 years (2022 to 2050), the Southwestern US is 
projected to face a total loss of over $1.4 trillion to GDP due 
to water risk. This means not only is the Southwest expected 
to face a greater economic hit than the other US regions 
in our study, but also than every country in the study, apart 
from the US overall. The region is particularly at risk from 
droughts, which account for $178 billion of estimated direct 
losses. On a sector level, the Southwestern US’s FMCG and 
retail sector could be particularly exposed, with a projected 
average annual output loss of 3.5% – representing total 
output losses of $819 billion by 2050.

The Southwest is 
currently experiencing 
a megadrought. 
Water risk in the Southwestern US
Although our Aquanomics model estimates that storms 
and floods will take a higher toll in terms of direct losses, 
the social and environmental impacts of drought are more 
widespread. The Southwestern US is the hottest and 
driest region, where the availability of water has defined its 
landscapes, people and economy. Its magnificent yet arid 
landscapes and ecosystems are increasingly under threat 
from water scarcity, compounded by a growing population 
and ageing infrastructure. 
Forested areas are subject to massive wildfires as the region 
continues to dry. Iconic rivers such as the Colorado River 
and the Rio Grande – shared with Mexico – are retreating as 
water overuse and drought take their toll. As of June 2022, 
water levels in Lake Mead were at their lowest since the 
Hoover Dam was built in the 1930s. Groundwater levels are 
also dropping, forcing a move across the region towards 
increasing levels of water management and conservation.
The Southwest is currently experiencing a megadrought 
(a drought lasting two decades or more) – the longest and 
most severe experienced by the region in 1,200 years. This 
is bringing disruption to agricultural production and affecting 
homes and businesses, with the poorest members of the 
population being the most vulnerable to loss of employment 
and lack of water supply.

The Southwestern US’s  Aquanomics data dashboard 
The Southwestern US is on the frontline of international drought pressures and, as 
the local population continues to increase and the demand for water rises, there is 
an urgent need for new water sources. 
With groundwater resources depleting, and PFAS and other emerging contaminants 
threatening the quality of these supplies in areas such as Southern California, water 
conservation, reuse and recycling must step in to fill the gap. The Southwestern 
region has long been at the forefront of drought mitigation innovation, with the 
largest, most technologically advanced and energy-efficient seawater desalination 
facility in the US being opened in California in 2015. Utilising wastewater and 
stormwater through methods such as indirect and direct potable reuse will also be 
essential for building resiliency across the region.
Digital solutions that incorporate data, advanced analytics, and intelligent 
asset management are opening up new ways to combat water risk. Utilities and 
governments are already using GIS mapping processes and digital tracking 
systems to increase the capability of groundwater systems to stop depletion and 
degradation.
Ultimately, what is needed is close partnerships between policymakers and industry 
to deliver an Integrated Water Management (IWM) approach. This must consider 
the entire water cycle, identifying a mix of solutions and bringing maximum benefit 
at an affordable cost to both consumers and commercial water users across the 
Southwestern US.

Methodology
The economics of water risk and future resilience utilised a 
three-phased methodology to estimate the direct losses, 
sector losses and GDP losses that will be attributed to water 
risk (droughts, floods and storms) between 2022 and 2050. 
The study focuses on seven key countries across GHD’s 
footprint – Australia, Canada, China, the Philippines, the UAE, 
the UK and the US – and three US regions – Northeastern 
US, Southeastern US and Southwestern US. This study has 
focused predominantly on countries within the developed 
world to show that they – alongside the developing world - will 
be affected by water risk. 
Global insurance data was used to project the potential direct losses attributed to water risk (droughts, floods and storms) across 
the 11 geographies. This data is derived from Ortec Finance’s climate PREDICT model6 which itself comprises several databases 
including the UN World Urbanization Program, NASA’s Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC), National Centers 
for Environmental Information’s NOAA climate data, and Munich Re disaster/loss data. This is reported as the total direct losses 
between the years 2022-2050 and in currency terms (USD) by water risk type for each region. 
The water risk loss data from stages 1 and 2 (estimated direct sector losses) was inputted into the E3ME economic model7 as 
‘shocks’ to ascertain the total economic impact of water risk across the 11 focus geographies. 
These impacts include:
	–
Direct effects – from direct losses to different sectors and households (using data from Phase 2)
	–
Indirect effects – adjustments to price (including energy price) and government spending, as well as investment impacts 
caused by the capacity shocks
	–
Wider effects – impacts on supply chains, international competitiveness, employment, income, and consumption
These impacts were then combined and reported in currency terms (total GDP USD losses between 2022 and 2050) and a 
percentage of annual GDP. 
Global heating assumptions
As global heating intensifies, extreme weather events are expected to increase, resulting in greater water risk to countries and 
regions. Unless otherwise stated, the figures in this study assume a 2-degree rise in global temperatures in line with the ‘absolute 
cap’ in global heating agreed by governments in the 2015 Paris Agreement.

Econometrics. Additional qualitative research into the environmental and social impact of water risk provided by Dr. Ania 
Grobicki, former Deputy Director of External Affairs at the Green Climate Fund and Executive Secretary of the Global 
Water Partnership.
We conducted a review of relevant literature into the effects of drought, flooding and water-related storm damage on five 
economic sectors. This was based on a total review of 19 research papers which provided model inputs into the impact of water 
risk by sector. The findings from the literature review were adjusted to reflect the sectoral composition of the selected regions.
