Plastic pollution and climate change have commonly been treated as two separate issues and sometimes are even
seen as competing. Here we present an alternative view that these two issues are fundamentally linked. Primarily,
we explore how plastic contributes to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the beginning to the end of its life
cycle. Secondly, we show that more extreme weather and ﬂoods associated with climate change, will exacerbate
the spread of plastic in the natural environment. Finally, both issues occur throughout the marine environment,
and we show that ecosystems and species can be particularly vulnerable to both, such as coral reefs that face disease
spread through plastic pollution and climate-driven increased global bleaching events. A Web of Science search
showed climate change and plastic pollution studies in the ocean are often siloed, with only 0.4% of the articles
examining both stressors simultaneously. We also identiﬁed a lack of regional and industry-speciﬁc life cycle
analysis data for comparisons in relative GHG contributions by materials and products. Overall, we suggest that
rather than debate over the relative importance of climate change or marine plastic pollution, a more productive
course would be to determine the linking factors between the two and identify solutions to combat both crises.

1. Introduction
Plastic, its uses and impacts as a pollutant, are often the focus of dis-
cussion within the spheres of research, media and policy; yet this is
mostly approached as a separate issue from the growing climate crisis.
Recently the public's eagerness to help solve marine plastic pollution
has intensiﬁed and sparked controversy as a distraction from the
greater and more pressing issue of climate change (Stafford and Jones,
2019). However, plastic pollution has an equally global distribution; it
is found across all regions of the ocean, from shallow coastal areas to
the deepest regions sampled to date and in the most remote and sensi-
tive locations on Earth (Free et al., 2014; Napper et al., 2020; Obbard
et al., 2014; Woodall et al., 2014). As marine plastic pollution is ubiqui-
tous and globally irreversible, it meets two of the three conditions for a
chemical pollution planetary boundary threat (Villarrubia-Gómez et al.,
2018) that can compromise biological and anthropogenic systems and
processes (Beaumont et al., 2019; McIlgorm et al., 2011; Rochman
et al., 2016). Climate change is a major global threat, already affecting
every region across the world and displaying increased ocean tempera-
tures, sea-level rise, ocean acidiﬁcation, and more frequent and extreme
weather events that are causing widespread ecological and socio-
economic harm that is predicted to intensify (IPCC, 2021, 2019;
Ummenhofer and Meehl, 2017; Vicedo-Cabrera et al., 2021; Vitousek
et al., 2017).
The ocean and its ecosystems and species are commonly the focus of
plastic pollution studies; however, most of these studies do not consider
the additional impact of climate change. Here we bring together evi-
dence to show that marine plastic pollution and climate change are fun-
damentally linked in three overarching ways. First, plastic production
relies heavily on fossil fuel extraction and the consumption of ﬁnite re-
sources. The end-of-life (EOL) processes for plastic waste have differing
and sometimes undetermined contributions to global greenhouse gas
emissions (GHG) and further, plastic alternatives like bio-based plastics
are set to increase in production, yet their sustainability and GHG contri-
bution is also in question. Second, climate currently inﬂuences the dis-
tribution of plastic pollution and will spread further with climate-
driven increased extreme weather events and ﬂooding. Third, global
warming alone has demonstrable catastrophic consequences for the
marine environment, while the impacts of plastic pollution are also
building evidence as being harmful to species and ecosystems. The pres-
ent and future impacts of the co-occurrence of both issues in marine
ecosystems is largely still unexplored, as they are in other systems,
such as terrestrial and freshwater. Here our review focuses on the
more abundant marine plastic pollution literature as a focus to unpack
the ways in which plastic pollution and climate change are linked and
offer solutions to combat both.
2. Plastic contributes to climate change
Plastics are largely derived from fossil fuels and continue to emit
greenhouse gases (GHGs) at each stage of their life cycle, from extraction
up to and including their EOL (Zheng and Suh, 2019). Plastic production
increased from two million metric tons (Mt) in 1950 to an estimated
380 million Mt in 2015, a compound annual growth rate of 8.4% (Geyer
et al., 2017). The demand for plastics illustrates the need for cheap, light-
weight materials in our day to day lives. However, global growth in de-
mand for plastics is set to continue as economies develop further. The
expansion of plastic production is estimated to emit over 56 billion Mt
of carbon-dioxide-equivalent (CO2e) in GHGs between 2015 and 2050,
which is 10–13% of the entire remaining carbon budget (Hamilton et al.,
2019). The contribution of plastic to climate change can be categorised
in three ways: 1) plastic production, transport and use; 2) plastic disposal,
mis-managed waste and degradation; and 3) bio-based plastics.
2.1. Production, transport and processing
In 2015, the primary production of plastic emitted the equivalent of
more than a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2), equal to over
3% of global fossil fuel emissions (Geyer, 2020). In comparison,
agriculture contributes 10–15% of GHG emissions (Houser and Stuart,
2020). Plastic reﬁning is also one the most GHG expensive industries in
the manufacturing sector and produced 184.3–213.0 million Mt CO2e
globally in 2015 (Hamilton et al., 2019). This is owing to the energy
intensive process of cracking, a petrochemical process in which
saturated
hydrocarbons
are
broken
down
into
smaller,
often
unsaturated, hydrocarbons known as oleﬁns, that are then made into
plastic resins (Hamilton et al., 2019; Ren et al., 2006). Indirect emissions
or potential savings during the plastic life cycle also need to be
considered (Fig. 1). For example, plastic items can enable greenhouse
gas (GHG) savings where their lightweight properties release lower CO2
emissions during transport, relative to other materials such as glass,
wooden or metal items (Andrady and Neal, 2009; Stefanini et al., 2020).
The extraction phase of fossil fuels contributes to GHG emissions through
indirect emissions such as methane leakage, land clearance for extraction
infrastructure, and the subsequent transport of the fuels to reﬁneries
(Hamilton et al., 2019). The extraction and transportation of natural gas
for plastic production is estimated to emit 12.5–13.5 million Mt CO2e in
the United States alone (Hamilton et al., 2019).
2.2. Plastic disposal, mis-managed waste and degradation
Life Cycle Assessments are increasingly used to evaluate environ-
mental and economic impacts of various plastic waste management

2
systems (Bernardo et al., 2016). One such assessment found that the
EOL section accounts for 9% of total GHG emissions of the entire life
cycle of plastic (Zheng and Suh, 2019). The EOL section, is commonly
comprised of recycling, landﬁll and incineration, which vary in the
amount of GHG emissions produced. For example, the comparison be-
tween incineration or landﬁll in terms of emissions depends on the efﬁ-
ciency of incineration and if it is carried out with or without energy
recovery in comparison with current energy grid portfolios (Eriksson
and Finnveden, 2009). While recycling is considered more sustainable,
it also faces a number of challenges such as large energy requirements,
costliness and can result in low-quality plastics (Al-Salem et al., 2009;
Denison, 1996; Rahimi and Garciá, 2017; Shen and Worrell, 2014).
When using 100% renewable energy throughout the process, recycling
of plastics could allow for a 77% reduction in GHG emissions from that
of virgin plastic production (Zheng and Suh, 2019). Out of the three
main disposal options, plastic waste incineration is generally considered
to have the largest climate impact (Eriksson and Finnveden, 2009). In
2015, US emissions from plastic incineration was 5.9 million Mt of CO2
and these are expected to increase to 91 million Mt by 2050
(Hamilton et al., 2019).
All conventional plastic ever made is still with us on the planet, ex-
cept if it has been burnt (Thompson et al., 2005). Almost a third of plas-
tic waste (32 million Mt) from 93% of the world's population was
classiﬁed as mismanaged in 2010 (e.g., entering the environment in
an uncontrolled fashion) and is predicted reach to up to 90 mil-
lion Mt/year entering aquatic systems by 2030 under business as
usual scenarios (Borrelle et al., 2020; Jambeck et al., 2015). Plastic de-
grades and fragments into smaller and smaller pieces over time to even-
tually form microplastics (<5 mm) and nanoplastics (<1000 nm)
(Napper and Thompson, 2020). Research into the degradation of
microplastic into micro- and nano-particles is still in its infancy, how-
ever attempts to quantify and extrapolate degradation rates have not
been published. The amount of time a plastic item takes to degrade is
highly dependent on polymer and typical thickness and mass. For ex-
ample, high density polyethylene (HDPE) has been estimated to have
a half-life of between 58 years (for a plastic bottle) and 1200 years
(for plastic piping) (Chamas et al., 2020). Plastic additives like
nonylphenol and bisphenol may leach from plastic during weathering
into the environment and be taken up by marine organisms
(Koelmans et al., 2014). The toxicity of these chemicals can vary and
has caused environmental and human health concerns (Bejgarn et al.,
2015; Gunaalan et al., 2020; North and Halden, 2013).
Degradation of plastic can be further retarded if plastic reaches
deeper marine environments due to lower temperatures, oxygen and
UV-B levels (Andrady, 2011). During degradation, both virgin and
aged plastic continue to emit direct and indirect GHGs indeﬁnitely,
with the most common plastics emitting methane and ethylene
(Royer et al., 2018). Polyethylene, accounting for 36% of all plastic
types (Geyer et al., 2017), is the most proliﬁc emitter of methane and
ethylene out of a number of plastics tested. Due to its relatively weaker
structure and exposed hydrocarbon branches, low density polyethylene
(LDPE) produced more GHGs than plastics with a more compact struc-
ture (e.g. HDPE) (Royer et al., 2018). While plastics release GHGs in
most environments, this rate of release can vary. For example, LDPE re-
leases ~76 times the amount of ethylene while incubated in air com-
pared to water (Royer et al., 2018). As plastic degrades into smaller
pieces and increases with greater surface-to-volume and edge length-
to-volume ratios, GHG production will accelerate (Royer et al., 2018).
2.3. Bio-based plastics
Increased awareness of mismanaged waste and its impact on the en-
vironment has led to a growing interest in creating a circular economy
for plastics and the use of alternatives to fossil fuels as raw materials
(Berriman, 2020; Nielsen et al., 2020). One of these pathways has
been the emergence of bio-based plastics as a more sustainable alterna-
tive to fossil fuel-based plastics. In 2019, the contribution of bio-based
plastics to global plastic production was ~1%, yet this is expected to
increase (European Bioplastics, 2019). Bio-based plastics are made
from renewable plant feedstocks and offer lower GHG emissions in
their overall life cycle compared to conventional plastics (Fig. 2)
(Zheng and Suh, 2019). However, this is highly dependent on their
raw materials, composition, EOL management and crucially, the
carbon storage potential lost from their associated land use change
(Hottle et al., 2013; Kakadellis and Rosetto, 2021; Piemonte and
Gironi, 2011; Zheng and Suh, 2019). Spierling et al. (2018) calculated
a potential saving of 241 to 316 million Mt CO2e annually by
substituting 65.8% of all conventional plastics with bio-based plastics.

As bio-based plastics are derived from biomass, land is needed to
cultivate and grow the raw materials needed for manufacture. To satisfy
the land requirement to replace plastics used for packaging globally,
61 million ha would be needed for planting bio-based plastic feedstock,
an area larger than France (Brizga et al., 2020). The land required would
also be damaging to biodiversity. Globally, land use change has been es-
timated to reduce the number of species by 13.6%, with agriculture as a
major driver (Newbold et al., 2015). A life cycle assessment that took
land use change from biofuels into consideration through GHG emission
equivalents, found total emissions to be comparable between plastic
made from both sugarcane (biofuel) and crude oil (fossil fuel) (Liptow
and Tillman, 2012). However, this is a rare example where bio-based
and fossil-based plastic have been compared, with the global warming
potential of land use change considered. Firmer guidelines on the meth-
odologies used to conduct LSAs across these various plastic products are
needed to allow for increased studies that can make stronger compari-
sons in sustainability and GHG contribution (Spierling et al., 2018).
Bio-based plastics are not necessarily biodegradable; some are, but
some only biodegrade under speciﬁc industrial conditions (Geyer,
2020) (Fig. 2). In fact, the term ‘bioplastics’ is often used to describe
both bio-based plastic and biodegradable plastic. Napper and
Thompson (2019) showed that when left in the natural environment
(marine, soil and outside), single use carrier bags (including those of
oxo-biodegradable, compostable and HDPE formulations materials), as
expected, did not demonstrate substantial biodegradation over a
three-year period. Polylactic acid (PLA), derived from renewable
sources like corn-starch, only will biodegrade under industrial
composting conditions, however as a pollutant in the marine environ-
ment, its degradation rate is similar to that of HDPE (Chamas et al.,
2020). However, just because something is biodegradable, does not
mean it can be thrown into the environment instead of managed prop-
erly – and clearer direction for disposal of biodegradable plastics is
needed. For example, in Germany 63% of consumers that disposed of
compostable bio-based plastic incorrectly (e.g. recycled instead of
composted), while only 10% of consumers disposed of fossil fuel-based
plastic packaging incorrectly (Tauﬁk et al., 2020). To dispose of bio-
based plastics correctly a consumer will need an understanding of the
item type, whether local authorities can and will collect that material
as organic for compost or as material for recycling, and its suitability
for home-composting or need for relocation to another facility (e.g. in-
dustrial composting).
Recent research shows biodegradable bio-based plastics stimulate
microbial metabolism, which can release CO2 into the water column
from buried carbon (Sanz-Lázaro et al., 2021). While biodegradable
plastics can mitigate issues related to persistence in the environment
by biodegrading, this biodegradation should occur under controlled
conditions in a compost setting to be able to reap the beneﬁts of the
compost produced. Alongside research on the impacts of traditional
plastics, biodegradable plastics should continue to be evaluated for
their impact on our waste management systems and impact on the
environment.
The EOL management for bio-based plastics is also highly varied in
the release of GHG emissions depending on whether they are biode-
gradable, compostable or non-biodegradable, and how they are man-
aged (Hottle et al., 2017; Zheng and Suh, 2019). It is therefore
important not to consider bio-based plastics as a “silver bullet” solution
to marine plastic pollution. Instead, a shift from a linear to a life-cycle
approach is needed when thinking about manufacture and design,
while encouraging reduced levels of consumption and waste at both in-
dividual and industrial levels.
3. Climate change impacts plastic pollution
Microplastics are now being transported through the atmosphere in
a manner similar to biogeochemical cycles (Brahney et al., 2021;
Evangeliou et al., 2020) and can be transported over tens of kilometres
to near-pristine and remote areas (Allen et al., 2019). Evidence is also
building of interconnectedness between the freshwater, terrestrial and
marine realms and is becoming established as a part of the carbon
cycle (Stubbins et al., 2021). For example, microplastic can be
Fig. 2. Differences and biodegradability of different types of plastics. Here we show the differences between bio-based and fossil fuel-based plastics and where they overlap in terms of
biodegradability.

transported from rivers to the ocean (Napper et al., 2021) and back onto
land from the marine environment via sea spray (Allen et al., 2020).
Studies show that climate change will further impact plastic pollution
ﬂuxes and concentrations in its global distribution. For example, Arctic
sea ice is a major microplastic sink, with densities of between 38 and
234 microplastic particles per cubic metre (Obbard et al., 2014;
Peeken et al., 2018). As sea ice volume is expected to decrease through
melting due to warming temperatures, microplastics will be released
into the marine environment (Obbard et al., 2014).
Climate change is already causing increased extreme weather events
(Coumou and Rahmstorf, 2012; IPCC, 2021, 2019), including tropical
storms, which can disperse mis-managed waste between terrestrial,
freshwater and marine environments (Lo et al., 2020; Wang et al.,
2019). After a typhoon in Sanggou Bay, China, the abundance of
microplastics increased within seawater and sediments by as much as
40% (Wang et al., 2019). Further inputs of terrestrial plastic into aquatic
environments is likely increased by stronger winds, more frequent rain
events and sea level rise may release plastics trapped in coastal sedi-
ments and increase the risk of ﬂooding (Galgani et al., 2015; Van
Sebille et al., 2020; Welden and Lusher, 2017). Roebroek et al. (2021)
demonstrated that ﬂooding of global rivers has the potential to further
worsen riverine plastic pollution, with ﬂood risk areas often becoming
sites with high plastic mobilisation during ﬂooding events. Increased
rainfall, associated with monsoons, is estimated to increase estimated
monthly river plastic inputs into the ocean. Napper et al. (2021) esti-
mated the microplastic concentration entering the Bay of Bengal from
the Ganges at approximately 1 billion microplastics per day during the
pre-monsoon season and 3 billion post-monsoon season.
4. Impacts of climate change and plastic pollutions co-occur in the
marine environment
Between 4.8 and 12.7 million Mt of plastic waste was estimated to
have entered the ocean in 2010 from coastal countries (Jambeck et al.,
2015). The impacts that this plastic pollution has on the marine envi-
ronment has been increasingly explored in recent decades (Derraik,
2002; Thushari and Senevirathna, 2020), yet there is a lack of studies
that predict how this might interact with the consequences of climate
change to cause harm to marine organisms and ecosystems. This is
clear from a simple Web of Science search; we show in the last
10 years 6327 papers addressed plastic pollution in the marine environ-
ment, 45,752 papers addressed climate change in the marine environ-
ment and only 208 addressed both (Fig. 3, search terms provided in
Supplementary Material). As both lines of research continue to develop,
plastic pollution research could beneﬁt from lessons learned from cli-
mate change research to aid in establishing a stronger understanding
on the current status and impacts of plastic pollution urgently needed
for decision-making (Fig. 3).
Although more pronounced in plastics studies, early climate studies
often manipulated stressors beyond anticipated projections, which help
identify worst-case scenario impacts, but are of limited relevance for
understanding proximate and foreseeable climate impacts (Wernberg
et al., 2012). Plastic studies are commonly conducting experiments
and showing lethal effects in organisms subjected to much higher con-
centrations of microplastics than how they presently occur in natural
environments (Burns and Boxall, 2018).
4.1. Marine species and ecosystems are presently vulnerable to both crises
An example of a species notably vulnerable from the effects of both
climate change and marine plastic pollution are marine turtles. Marine
turtles exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination at their
embryonic stage, during incubation on temperate and tropical beaches.
This raises concerns with regard to global warming, sea level rise and
increased storminess (Patrício et al., 2021). Some turtle rookeries
around the world are demonstrating the effects of increasing global
temperatures through skewed sex ratios towards females, which
threatens populations (Chatting et al., 2021; Laloë et al., 2016; de
Marcovaldi et al., 2016). Green turtles (Chelonia mydas) from warmer
nesting beaches on the northern Great Barrier Reef, showed extremely
biased sex ratios, with 99.1% of juvenile, 99.8% of subadult, and 86.8%
of adult-sized turtles being female (Jensen et al., 2018). Microplastics
have the potential to increase the temperatures of incubating clutches
(Beckwith, 2019). However, strategies to mitigate this are being ex-
plored with promising results (Clarke et al., 2021). Larger marine plastic
debris threaten marine turtles through direct ingestion, which can
cause debilitation and death through internal injury and intestinal
blockage (Nelms et al., 2016), entanglement (Duncan et al., 2017), and
can affect hatchling survival (Triessnig et al., 2012). Although all seven
species of marine turtle were demonstrated to have ingested synthetic
particles at concentrations higher than marine mammals (Duncan
et al., 2019), the population-level impacts of plastic pollution on marine
turtles is still largely unknown (Senko et al., 2020).
Marine plastic pollution
alongside climate
change
impacts
destabilises ecosystems vulnerable to climate change (Fig. 4). For exam-
ple on coral reefs, coral bleaching events, resulting from global warming
and increasing ocean temperatures are becoming more frequent
(Hughes et al., 2018a) and are predicted to become annual occurrences
on many reefs this century (Van Hooidonk et al., 2020). Coral bleaching
events are causing mass coral mortality (Hughes et al., 2017; Raymundo
et al., 2019; Sheppard et al., 2017), species assemblages shifts (Hughes
et al., 2018b; Stuart-Smith et al., 2018) and numerous local species ex-
tinctions (Graham et al., 2006; Bento et al., 2016). Coral reefs are
under pressure from a number of threats that combined, have proven
detrimental to coral reef resilience (Baumann et al., 2019; Ortiz et al.,
2018; Riegl et al., 2012). The extent to which climate change threats
to corals might be exacerbated by plastic pollution is currently un-
known, yet some studies have found plastic to be detrimental to coral
health. Laboratory experiments have shown plastic ingestion can nega-
tively affect gamete fertilisation (Berry et al., 2019), as well as inducing
other species-speciﬁc responses, such as reduced growth and photosyn-
thetic performance (Reichert et al., 2019). Field studies have shown that
the presence of plastic debris can increase direct physical damage
(Valderrama Ballesteros et al., 2018) and disease likelihood in corals
(Lamb et al., 2018). While the direct effects of plastic pollution to coral
reefs have not been shown to compare to population-scale climate-
driven impacts, plastics may act as an additional stressor, particularly
at local scales.

Other vulnerable and remote environments, rarely impacted by an-
thropogenic pressures in the past, are now under unavoidable threat
from climate change and marine plastic pollution. Marine Protected
Areas (MPAs) are a widespread tool used to protect such environments,
but are still and will increasingly be impacted by plastic pollution (Burt
et al., 2020; Liubartseva et al., 2019; Nelms et al., 2020; Ryan and
Schoﬁeld, 2020) and climate change (Andrello et al., 2015; Sheppard
et al., 2017). Although MPAs are ineffective in stopping the ﬂow of plas-
tic pollution in oceanic currents or the impacts of climate change, they
can be effective in mitigating climate change by protecting carbon as-
similation and storage habitats (Roberts et al., 2017; Sala et al., 2021).
Polar regions, considered a relatively pristine environment with a
highly sensitive ecosystem, now have substantial microplastics accu-
mulated in sea ice and sediments and are being consumed by sea bird
populations (Amélineau et al., 2016; Munari et al., 2017; Obbard et al.,
2014). The presence of microplastic particles in these environments is
an additional threat to the fragile, already climate-sensitive ecosystems
containing organisms with low genetic differentiation, making them
particularly vulnerable to environmental change (Rowlands et al.,
2021). Additionally, microplastics could also decrease surface albedo
of the snow and ice and accelerate melting, adding to another ramiﬁca-
tion of global warming (Evangeliou et al., 2020). There are also concerns
for poorly known deep sea ecosystems that are increasingly recognised
as sinks for plastic pollution (Woodall et al., 2014), with their key func-
tions in carbon storage and nutrient cycling threatened by climate
change (Sweetman et al., 2017). As with many of these remote and vul-
nerable environments, the combined impacts are not yet understood.
Changes to community composition, ecosystem function and even
biogeochemical cycles due to both climate change and marine plastic
pollution are occurring on global scales, the future consequences from
combinations of these effects are uncertain. Range shifts and the facilita-
tion of invasive species are already a demonstrable consequence of cli-
mate change. As temperate regions have become warmer, tropical
species shift their ranges poleward (Bates et al., 2014; Edwards et al.,
2013; Vergés et al., 2019). For example, in the shallow Mediterranean
Israeli shelf, non-native warmer water marine mollusc species have
colonised habitats to the detriment of native species and formed an irre-
versible novel ecosystem (Albano et al., 2021). Similarly, marine plastic
debris can facilitate trans-oceanic travel for invasive species as debris
items are commonly colonised by a diverse assemblages of encrusting
organisms like coralline algae, barnacles and bivalve molluscs
(Gregory, 2009). Marine plastic debris also hosts unique assemblages
of marine microbial communities known as the “Plastisphere”
(Cornejo-D'Ottone et al., 2020; Zettler et al., 2013), which will become
Fig. 4. Interactions between plastic and climate. A schematic illustrating points that we make throughout this article, whereby plastic will affect climate change through the contribution of
GHGs and interact with the impacts of climate change in the natural environment. Coloured shapes indicate how each component is connected to both plastic pollution and climate
change. The various stages of plastic production from extraction to waste management contribute to GHG emissions, while climate change can cause extreme weather events and
accelerate the spread of plastics to vulnerable and remote environments. Blue carbon habitats play an important role in sequestering carbon, but they can also bury and trap plastics,
preventing further spread.

more abundant with predicted increases in plastic production and mis-
managed waste (Borrelle et al., 2020). Increased coastal development
and climate change-driven storms have increased the frequency of bio-
logical rafting events, where storms can disperse colonised plastic mate-
rial from coasts into the open ocean (Carlton et al., 2017). Both climate
change and plastic pollution therefore enhance the mobility of invasive
species on a global scale, which can lead to altered community assem-
blages, native species extinctions and potentially further reaching con-
sequences.
The effects of both global warming and microplastics may addi-
tively impact ocean primary production. Research surrounding the
interactions of phytoplankton, marine microbes and marine plastic
pollution is in its early stages, but suggests that plastic can disrupt
biogeochemical cycles like the biological carbon pump, essential to
maintaining the ocean's role as a carbon sink (Stoett and Vince,
2019). Sjollema et al. (2016) showed that microplastics disrupt
microalgal (or phytoplankton) growth at very high concentrations
of microplastics yet did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant impacts on photosyn-
thetic rates. Other experiments show an interactive effect of temper-
ature and CO2 on the toxicity of nanoplastics to microalgae, with
toxicity attenuated under simultaneous increases in CO2 and
temperature (Yang et al., 2020). A climate change driven decline in
primary production has been projected under all emissions scenarios
(Couespel et al., 2021). Primary consumers, such as zooplankton will
be impacted by this reduction in phytoplankton, which directly re-
lates to predicted reductions in ﬁsh biomass (Couespel et al., 2021).
Gove et al. (2019) showed how coastal ocean surface convergence
features known as bio-slicks spatially concentrate phytoplankton
and zooplankton, but also microplastics. Zooplankton included larval
ﬁsh that ingest these non-nutritious prey-sized plastics, at a time
when food is critical for their survival. The projected decrease in pri-
mary production because of climate change and ingestion of
microplastics by higher trophic levels could therefore have signiﬁ-
cant additive impacts on the productivity of marine food webs and
should be a focus of future research.
4.2. Direct testing of the plastic pollution and climate change interaction
Studies that have directly tested the interaction of marine plastic
pollution and climate change-related impacts under controlled labora-
tory conditions found a range of outcomes. For example, Weber et al.
(2020) found no interaction upon exposing mussels to temperature
stress combined with microplastic exposure treatments. However, indi-
vidually the treatments caused detrimental effects to the organism, such
as thermal stress affecting energy reserves, oxidative stress, and im-
mune function (Weber et al., 2020). Wang et al. (2020) found signiﬁ-
cant inhibition of digestive enzymes in mussels, upon exposure to
microplastics, which was exacerbated by conditions that mimicked fu-
ture ocean acidiﬁcation (Wang et al., 2020). Litchﬁeld et al. (2020)
found that rates of decomposition of seagrass and kelp were enhanced
with thermal stress conditions under various climate change scenarios
but were slowed with exposure to more plastic pollution, while the
combination of the two displayed a neutralising effect.
McCormick et al. (2020) is a rare example of where plastic pollution
and climate change interactions were tested in the ﬁeld. The authors ex-
posed juvenile ﬁsh to microplastics and observed their behaviour
within coral reef habitat of varying levels of degradation, expected
under climate change conditions. The study found that ﬁsh consuming
microplastic and those experiencing habitat degradation exhibited
risk-prone behaviour, leading to reduced survival, with microplastic ex-
posure having the greater impact of the two (McCormick et al., 2020).
Evidently, further studies that directly test the interaction between cli-
mate change conditions and marine plastic pollution, both in the lab
and the ﬁeld, are needed to explore the extent of the impact that
these co-occurring conditions will have at the scale of individual, popu-
lation, and ecosystem scales.
5. Integrated approaches
Reduced demand for virgin polymers can reduce the sector's depen-
dency on fossil fuels, prioritising reuse and recycling of polymers.
Where reuse is not feasible, we should continue to recycle plastic until
the structural or chemical properties deteriorate (Lamberti et al.,
2020). The infrastructure around extraction, production and especially
the EOL stages of plastics must be addressed to reduce the general envi-
ronmental impacts of plastic. GHG emissions from plastics could be re-
duced through incorporating low-carbon energy throughout industrial
processes during their life cycle. While reducing global consumption of
virgin polymers, research should continue to explore whether an increase
in bio-based plastic production can be done sustainably (Lamberti et al.,
2020; Zheng and Suh, 2019). For example, using waste biomass and forest
residues to curb land-use requirements has been suggested to improve
GHG footprint for bio-based plastic (Lamberti et al., 2020; Repo et al.,
2012; Zheng and Suh, 2019). At both industrial and governmental levels
greater effort should be taken to minimise any leakage and/or waste at
any stage of the plastic life cycle.
The size of the societal, economic, and commercial shift needed to
avoid the worsening impacts of the climate and plastic pollution crises, re-
quires both a top-down and bottom-up approach. Both global and national
economies must shift to a circular economy, decoupling growth from the
use of ﬁnite resources. Despite the necessity of this shift, our global society
has become less circular over the past two years (from 9.1% to 8.6%; mea-
sured by divided global cycled materials with material inputs) (Haigh
et al., 2021). Further, re-emphasis of the importance of reducing or reusing
plastic and bio-based plastics is needed to reduce our reliance on single-
use products. If growth in single-use plastic continues, it could account
for 5 to 10% of global GHG emissions by 2050 (Charles et al., 2021).
By ﬁnding solutions to tackle climate change, we may also help in mit-
igating marine plastic pollution. For example, the conservation and resto-
ration of blue carbon coastal habitats, including salt marshes and seagrass
meadows that support high sediment accumulation rates and are also
able to bury and trap plastics, while sequestering large amounts of carbon
in their sediments (Martin et al., 2020). Mangroves are an example of a
blue carbon habitat efﬁcient in the burial and retention of plastic litter,
where the plastic can remain undegraded for decades, and also act as a
barrier against its dispersal into the marine environment (Martin et al.,
2020, 2019). The removal of these vital coastal blue carbon habitats glob-
ally would equate to 1 Pg of CO2 emissions annually (Duarte et al., 2013),
while also potentially losing a natural mechanism containing the spread
of plastic. Although recent evidence has shown marine debris can have
detrimental ecological effects on these ecosystems (Giles et al., 2021),
the burial of plastic prevents the spread of plastic to the wider ocean
and the dynamics of this novel ecosystem service requires further
investigation. Additionally, macroplastic can be ejected out of the sea via
seagrass “neptune balls”, showing another example of how these
coastal habitats could be key to beneﬁtting both issues (Martin et al.,
2019; Sanchez-Vidal et al., 2021).
Action on climate change has been compromised by uncertainty, as-
pects of human psychology (Ross et al., 2016), and the need for acts of
good global citizenship versus national interest. Plastic pollution is un-
equivocally due to human actions, decisions and behaviour (Pahl et al.,
2017), with few ‘plastics deniers’ that compare to ‘climate change de-
niers’. Marine litter is clearly visible in our coastal environments and
seeing it can have a measurable negative effect on an individual's
wellbeing (Wyles et al., 2016). People's commitment to tackle marine
plastic pollution through beach cleans is associated with increased envi-
ronmental awareness (Wyles et al., 2017). Therefore, engagement in
such activities can be a gateway to the issue of climate change. Further,
science-based solutions to marine conservation are often poorly docu-
mented, it is therefore important to highlight marine conservation suc-
cesses to inspire public action and provide exemplars to conservation
professionals and policy makers (Knowlton, 2021). There is consider-
able opportunity to build on the success in mobilising action on plastic

pollution for subsequent action on the impacts of climate change in the
ocean.
6. Conclusion
Despite being inherently linked, the plastic pollution and climate
change crises are often researched in isolation and even pitted against
each other in competition for engagement and funding. There is an in-
creasing co-occurrence of these global issues, along with other stressors
that threaten the resilience of species and habitats sensitive to both cli-
mate change and plastic pollution. Further research is needed to deter-
mine the mechanistic links between these two stressors, their roles in
our biogeochemical cycles and how both may interact to negatively im-
pact ecosystems. While we acknowledge that plastic production is not
the major contributor to GHG emissions and impacts are largely differ-
ent between the two crises, when simpliﬁed, the root cause is the same,
overconsumption of ﬁnite resources. A lack of region and industry-
speciﬁc data is currently limiting our ability to compare relative GHG
contributions by materials and products. We have also emphasised
that approaches for each can be beneﬁcial to both issues and lessen
the overall anthropogenic strain on our natural world. Solutions are un-
doubtedly complex, yet a coordinated effort to implement shifts to-
wards a circular economy is needed to ease current stressors on the
marine environment and avoid worst-case scenario environmental cri-
ses. Rather than debate whether climate change or plastic pollution is of
greater threat, a more productive course would be to recognise they are
fundamentally linked and take a systems approach to tackle both issues
to synergistically reduce GHG emissions.
