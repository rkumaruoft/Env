Background: Climate change has been deemed the biggest global health threat of the 21st century. One conse-
quence of climate change is the increasing frequency and severity of forest ﬁres. Smoke from wildﬁres has
the ability to negatively impact air quality over large distances. The aim of this study was to examine the
association that air quality had on emergency department visits for cardiac, respiratory and psychiatric/
behavioral health chief complaints during forest ﬁre season in Vancouver, British Columbia.
Methods: The study period was January 1, 2009 −December 31, 2019. Forest ﬁre season was deﬁned as April
1- September 30. Air quality (measured by PM2.5 in ug/m3) was obtained from the Vancouver International
Airport (YVR) Air Quality station. Emergency department visit data (CEDIS triage complaint) was acquired
from a regional emergency department database. A generalized linear mixed model with Poisson link func-
tion was used to determine the relative risk (as a percentage) for respiratory, cardiac and psychiatric/behav-
ioral health CEDIS triage complaints associated with a 10 unit increase in PM2.5.
Results: PM2.5 during forest ﬁre season was signiﬁcantly associated with emergency department visits for
respiratory chief complaints. For every 10 ug/m3 increase in PM2.5, there was a 4.61% (95% CI: 3.07, 6.17)
increase in relative risk of respiratory chief complaints presenting to emergency departments. No association
was found between PM2.5 and cardiac or psychiatric/behavioral health chief complaints during forest ﬁre
season or non-forest ﬁre season. During non-forest ﬁre season, PM2.5 was found to be negatively associated
with respiratory (-3.57, 95% CI: -5.44, -1.66) and cardiac chief complaints (-2.77, 95% CI: -4.16, -1.47).
Conclusion: Our results indicate a probable association between air quality during forest ﬁre season and
emergency department visits for respiratory chief complaints. This provides further illustration of the wide-
spread impact of climate change, and underscores the importance of efforts to address it.

Introduction
Climate change has been called the biggest global health threat of
the 21st century [1]. Climate change will directly negatively impact
health through several independent interactions. This includes
changing patterns of disease and mortality, food insecurity, access to
clean
water,
migration/displacement
and
increasing
extreme
weather events. All of these interactions combined are predicted to
place an extreme burden on an already stressed healthcare system.
One signiﬁcant consequence of climate change is the increasing fre-
quency and severity of forest ﬁres [2]. This increase has been linked
to changes in precipitation and temperature ﬂuctuations [3]. Wildﬁre
smoke contains high levels of particulate matter and toxins, in partic-
ular carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide and benzene, all of which are
known to have cardiovascular, respiratory, ophthalmic and psychiat-
ric implications [4]. Smoke from wildﬁres has the ability to negatively
impact air quality huge distances from the burning site [3].
Particulate matter (PM) in wildﬁre smoke is categorized by size in
microns and measured in ug/m3. PM10 and PM2.5 are the predomi-
nant air pollutants and PM10, the larger of the particles, passes
through the upper respiratory tract and deposits in the upper air-
ways. PM10 has been linked to increased respiratory admissions as
well cardiovascular and all-cause mortality [5]. PM2.5, the smaller
particulate matter most closely linked with forest ﬁres, deposits in
the terminal bronchi and alveoli. PM2.5 has been linked to chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma exacerbations as
well as cardiovascular and all-cause mortality [6,7].
Several American studies have found surges of cardiovascular and
respiratory presentations to emergency departments (EDs) during
wildﬁres when controlling for humidity, temperature, seasonal and
temporal effects [8,9]. A link between air quality and ED visits for psy-
chiatric presentations has also been suggested [10,11]. However, no

studies have speciﬁcally examined the effect of forest ﬁres on psychi-
atric/behavioral health presentations to EDs. The purpose of this
study was to examine the association of air quality on ED visits in
Vancouver for cardiac, respiratory and psychiatric/behavioral health
chief complaints during forest ﬁre season in British Columbia. Our
broader hope is to demonstrate the effect of forest ﬁres and air qual-
ity on already overcrowded and strained EDs and increase our under-
standing
of
climate

as
an
environmental
and
health
emergency.
Methods
Study period and location
The study location was the greater Vancouver area. Data for air
quality as measured by 24-hour mean PM2.5 in ug/m3 was obtained
from January 1, 2009 until December 31, 2019 from the Vancouver
International Airport (YVR) air quality monitoring station which is
roughly 10 km from the hospitals included in the study. Forest Fire
season was deﬁned as April 1 - September 30 of each year, as deﬁned
by the British Columbia Wildﬁre Service. ED visit data was acquired
from a regional database that includes 6 hospitals (Vancouver Gen-
eral Hospital, Mount Saint Joseph’s Hospital, St Paul’s Hospital, Lion’s
Gate Hospital, Richmond Hospital and the University of British
Columbia Hospital). This network has a catchment of roughly 1.2 mil-
lion people, approximately 25% of BC’s population with an average of
440,000 ED visits per year. The Canadian Emergency Department
Information System Complaints list was used to categorize triage
complaints. Complaints were grouped into cardiac (cardiac arrest,
chest pain cardiac, chest pain non-cardiac, palpitations, hypertension,
general
weakness,
syncope/presyncope),
respiratory
(stridor,
wheeze, shortness of breath, respiratory arrest, cough/congestion,
hyperventilation,
hemoptysis)
or
psychiatric/behavioral
health
(depression/suicidal/deliberate self-harm, anxiety/situational crisis,
hallucinations/delusions,
insomnia,
violent/homicidal
behavior,
bizarre behavior, pediatric/disruptive behavior, substance misuses/
intoxication, overdose ingestion, withdrawal). All other triage com-
plaints were excluded.
We aggregated ED visits by day and by the three pre-deﬁned chief
complaint categories. We used a generalized linear mixed model
(GLMM) with a Poisson link function to estimate the impact of PM2.5
during Forest Fire season on the daily count of ED visits. We ﬁt sepa-
rate models for each chief complaint category. To adjust for temporal
trends in ED visits, a three-level hierarchical cluster structure was
constructed based on calendar dates: data belonging to the same day
of the week, month, and year formed one cluster. Random intercepts
were applied to account for the heterogeneity of each cluster. The
independent variables were PM2.5 (ug/m), a dummy variable indicat-
ing Forest Fire season, and an interaction term between PM2.5 and
Forest Fire season. The annual population of Metro Vancouver was
included as an offset term to adjust for changes in the population
served by the EDs over time. We also examined the impact of lag 1
and lag 2 PM2.5 on the model ﬁt. We used model coefﬁcients to cal-
culate relative risks (%RR) with 95% conﬁdence intervals in relation to
each 10 ug/m increase in PM2.5. The model used was as follows:
log(Daily ED visit counts) = b0i + b1 * PM25i + b2 * Fire_season + b3 * PM25 *
Fire_season + log(Population)
Where b0i is the random effect, including day of the week, month, and year
For PM2.5 (b1) in non-ﬁre season, the percentage change in the relative risk (%RR)
is in relation to 10 unit increase of PM2.5
%RR = [exp(b1 * 10) - 1]*100%
For ﬁre season indicator variable (b2), the percentage change in the relative risk
(%RR) is in relation to 1 unit increase, namely, the indicator variable from 0 to 1
%RR = [exp(b2) - 1]*100%
(continued)
For PM 2.5 and its interaction with ﬁre season indicator, the percentage change in
the relative risk (%RR) is PM 2.5 during ﬁre season in relation to 10 unit increase
of PM2.5
%RR = [exp[(b1+ b3) * 10] - 1]*100%
The statistical software R (version 3.6.1) was used [12].
Results
Table 1 demonstrates the air quality in Vancouver as well as the
number of emergency department visits for respiratory, psychiatric/
behavioral health and respiratory chief complaints. The 24 hour
mean PM2.5 from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2019 was 5.4 ug/
m3. On average, the air quality in Vancouver is excellent. The lowest
recorded 24 hour mean PM2.5 was 0.2 ug/m3. The highest recorded
daily average PM2.5 (was 122.3 ug/m3) occurred during the forest
ﬁre season of 2018. This value is almost ﬁve times the WHO recom-
mended threshold of 25 ug/m3. The mean monthly ED visits to this
hospital network for cardiac chief complaints from 2009 to 2019 was
2931 (standard deviation 464). On average there were more cardiac
than psychiatric/behavioral health and respiratory presentations. The
mean monthly ED visits to this hospital network for psychiatric chief
complaints was 1592 (standard deviation 345). Finally, the mean
monthly ED visits for respiratory chief complaints was 1371 (stan-
dard deviation 321).
Fig. 1 shows the 24 hour mean PM2.5 levels at the Vancouver
International Airport Air Quality Station during the study period. For-
est ﬁre season (April 1 - September 30) is denoted in orange. The larg-
est spikes in air quality as measured in PM2.5 all occurred during
forest ﬁre season.
Fig. 2 illustrates monthly ED visits for cardiac, psychiatric/behav-
ioral health and respiratory chief complaints. Prior to one of the hos-
pitals switching to an electronic medical records system (data from
that hospital not available post switch), there was a trend towards
increasing cardiac visits to this ED hospital network during the study
period. Psychiatric/behavioral health chief complaints peaked around
the ﬁrst quarter of 2017; however, overall there is a trend toward
increasing psychiatric visits throughout the study period. Respiratory
chief complaints were found to have marked seasonal variability (as
has been noted previously), peaking during the winter months in cor-
relation with increased visits during inﬂuenza season.
Fig. 3 demonstrates the association between air quality as mea-
sured in PM2.5 and emergency department visits for cardiac, psychi-
atric and respiratory chief complaints. The model indicates that
PM2.5 during forest ﬁre season is signiﬁcantly correlated with ED vis-
its for respiratory chief complaints. For every 10 ug/m3 increase in
PM2.5, there is a 4.61% (95% CI: 3.07, 6.17) increase in relative risk of
respiratory chief complaints presenting to the ED was demonstrated.
There was no statistically signiﬁcant correlation between PM2.5 dur-
ing forest ﬁre season and cardiac or psychiatric/behavioral health
chief complaints presenting to the ED. During non-forest ﬁre season,
air quality was negatively associated with respiratory and cardiac
chief complaints. For every 10 ug/m3 increase in PM2.5 during non-
forest ﬁre season, there was a 2.77% (4.16 - 1.37) decrease in the

every 10 ug/m3 increase in PM2.5 during non-forest ﬁre season there
was a 3.57% (5.44 - 1.66) decrease in the relative risk of respira-
tory chief complaints presenting to the ED.
Discussion
One of the most striking examples of climate change in BC is the
increasing frequency and severity of forest ﬁres. Smoke from forest
ﬁres has the ability to negatively impact the air quality long distances
from the burning site. Our results indicate that PM2.5 during forest
ﬁre season is signiﬁcantly associated with ED visits for respiratory
chief complaints. For every 10 ug/m3 increase in PM2.5, there is a
4.61% (95% CI: 3.07, 6.17) increase in relative risk of respiratory chief
complaints presenting to the ED. This suggests that air quality, driven
by forest ﬁres, negatively impacts both EDs by increasing visit num-
bers as well as patients’ health by forcing patients to visit the ED. This
association between air quality and ED visits for respiratory issues
has been previously reported in the literature but not in a Canadian
metropolitan center [8,13].
Overall, metropolitan Vancouver has excellent air quality. The vast
majority (>99%) of days have an average PM2.5 below the WHO

threshold of 25 ug/m3. Our results indicate that the largest spikes in
PM2.5 recorded in Vancouver, during the ten-year study period,
occurred during forest ﬁre season. These spikes also correspond to
more severe forest ﬁre seasons. Given the sporadic nature of the
increases in PM2.5 and association with forest ﬁre season, our ﬁnd-
ings suggest that forest ﬁres are a signiﬁcant contributor to air quality
change in metropolitan Vancouver. This is noteworthy because forest
ﬁres are able to affect air quality and thereby the health of patients
over huge distances. The forest ﬁre season of 2018 provides a striking
example. Of the 2115 ﬁres that occurred during the 2018 forest ﬁre
season, only 5 occurred within the greater Vancouver area [14]. A
total of 1,354,300 hectares were burned that summer of which only
16 hectares were in the greater Vancouver area [15]. Despite
accounting for only 0.2% of all ﬁres and <0.001% of all hectares
burned, metropolitan Vancouver experienced signiﬁcant impacts on
air quality during forest ﬁre season −peaking with a PM2.5 roughly
5 times the WHO-recommend limit.
We found an overall trend towards increased ED visits during the
study period. This trend has been reported previously in Canada and
elsewhere [15]. This increase has been felt most acutely in urban, aca-
demic hospitals like those represented in this study. There is marked
seasonal variability in respiratory chief complaints presenting to the
ED. This likely corresponds to the traditional inﬂuenza season, prior
to the Covid-19 pandemic. Historical records from the BC Center for
Disease Control indicate that cases of inﬂuenza typically peak around
the 1st week in January −a trend that is reﬂected in our ED visits for
respiratory chief complaints [16]. Psychiatric/behavioral health chief
complaints peaked in the ﬁrst half of 2017 which may reﬂect changes
in outpatient access to resources, changes to mental health funding
models and/or a variety of external factors not captured by our data.
Our ﬁndings on the relationship between forest ﬁres, air quality
and ED visits may inform future primary care and public health prac-
tices. In previous studies, patients with chronic and underlying respi-
ratory conditions were most acutely affected by changes in forest
ﬁre-related air quality [5,6]. A system to identify and warn suscepti-
ble patients of impending changes to air quality during forest ﬁre sea-
son might positively impact patient morbidity and mortality and
reduce healthcare expenses. It is possible that widespread mask-
wearing during the Covid-19 pandemic may have the unintended
consequence of decreasing ED visits for respiratory chief complaints
during the corresponding forest ﬁre seasons. However, a Californian
study found that forest ﬁre-related degeneration in air quality was
associated with increased Covid-19 mortality [17]. Changes in air
quality during forest ﬁre season may in fact increase visits to the ED
for Covid-19-related respiratory chief complaints. This however,
remains an area for future study.
Interestingly, despite the well-established association between air
quality and cardiovascular health, we did not ﬁnd an association
between air quality and ED visits for cardiac chief complaints during
forest ﬁre season. Although not demonstrated in our study, this asso-
ciation has been elucidated previously [7]. This may be explained by
the fact that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is most strongly
associated with long-term exposure to poor air quality, and our
design investigated the impact of short-term exposure to forest ﬁre
smoke [18]. It has also been suggested that air quality may negatively
impact mental health. More speciﬁcally, long-term exposures to air-
borne particulate matter may result in central nervous system toxic-
ity and subsequently affect patients’ mental health. We did not ﬁnd a
relationship between air quality and psychiatric/behavioral health
chief complaints; however, our results do not refute prior reports
that long-term changes in air quality inﬂuence mental health.
The impact of forest ﬁres on air quality in British Columbia is pro-
jected to worsen, with more severe and frequent forest ﬁres as a
result of climate change. The resulting importance of identifying and
addressing climate change as a health emergency is self-evident.
Doing so will require an interdisciplinary and planetary health
approach - a new ﬁeld which focuses on understanding the health
impacts of human-caused disruptions to the planet [19]. Coordina-
tion between primary care, public health and government, as was
demonstrated during the Covid-19 pandemic will be required.
Strengths and limitations
This is a population level study with ten years of emergency
department and air quality data and includes adjustment for multiple
confounders, including the population ﬂuctuations in Vancouver over
the study period. Our results however should be interpreted with the
limitations of any population-level study, and the fact that the associa-
tions we found may not be causally linked or the result of confounding.
Further, chief complaints as per the CEDIS Triage protocol may include
mis-categorizations or fail to capture patient presentation nuances.
For example, a respiratory chief complaint may in fact be related to a
cardiac or endocrine problem. Our intent was not to establish causa-
tion, but to investigate the relationship between forest ﬁre-driven air
quality on ED visits and in doing so support the generation of hypothe-
ses regarding the impact of climate change on our population.
Our study also reported a negative association between respira-
tory chief complaints and air quality outside of forest ﬁre season. The

air quality during non-forest ﬁre season in Vancouver is generally
excellent and well below the WHO recommended cutoff of PM2.5.
This association may be explained by worsening air quality indoors
with decreased ventilation during colder months, increased damp-
ness, humidity, pets and allergens [20]. We were unable to capture
an explanation for this association in our data.
Conclusion and future directions
Our results indicate a probable association between air quality dur-
ing forest ﬁre season and emergency department visits for respiratory
chief complaints. This serves as a solitary example of the impact of cli-
mate change on human health, even in well-resourced countries. This
provides further illustration of the widespread impact of climate
change, and underscores the importance of efforts to address it. We
also hope this study serves as a call for adaptation to climate change.
At a community and population health level, this may support the sug-
gestion of masking during forest ﬁre season in Vancouver or increasing
access to high-efﬁciency particulate air ﬁlters (HEPA) [21]. At a
departmental level, this may support surge stafﬁng for increased
emergency department visits. Future work should be dedicated to
understanding and adapting the delivery of healthcare in the emer-
gency department in light of our changing climate.
