Minority influence in climate change mitigation
Jan Willem Bolderdijk1 and Lise Jans2
Abstract
While the majority of people care about environmental quality,
they keep engaging in carbon-intensive practices that exac-
erbate climate change. Can we expect humans to collectively
change by themselves, from the bottom up? Social change is
often initiated by minorities – individuals who challenge the
status quo. The dominant literature paints a rather pessimistic
picture about the ability of minorities to instigate change in the
environmental domain: environmental activists, vegans, and
other minority members often elicit social sanctions, thereby
ironically reinforcing the majority’s commitment to current,
environmentally harmful norms. Recent findings, however,
point towards more optimism: pro-environmental minorities can
pave the way towards ‘tipping points’ and spontaneous social
change. Policymakers can speed up this process by offering
top-down support for minorities – by giving them ‘voice’.

Human behaviour plays a key role in the rise and
severity of environmental problems, including climate
change. Dropping common but carbon-intensive prac-
tices such as eating red meat on a daily basis and ﬂying
across the ocean for holidays is, therefore, part and
parcel of the transition to a more sustainable society [1].
The majority of people see this need for social change.
They are aware of the environmental costs of their
current actions [2], value environmental quality [3,4],
and perceive protecting the environment as their moral
duty [5]. Yet, they keep engaging in practices that
exacerbate climate change. Acting sustainably is often-
times still the (descriptive) social norm [6e8]. Can we
expect more sustainable social norms to evolve from the
bottom up - emerging organically as a result of social
interactions between individuals?
Social change is often instigated by minorities e those
taking an anti-normative position, holding no position of
status [9]. As discussed below, recent literature paints a
rather pessimistic picture about minorities’ ability to
overthrow current, unsustainable norms: individuals
who publicly challenge normative but unsustainable
practices often run the risk of being ridiculed by ma-
jority members. Other ﬁndings, however, offer room for
optimism: minorities who go against current, unsus-
tainable norms may be able to pave the way for social
change in society at large. However, their inﬂuence is
often subtle and indirect, and thus easily overlooked,
both by policymakers and minorities themselves.
Why social change from the bottom up
seems unlikely
By challenging the status quo, minorities give exposure
to alternatives [10], thereby gradually ‘infecting’ others
in their social network [11]. Ultimately, such alterna-
tives may become adopted by the majority and thus
become the new social norm. Social change unfolds
more quickly when people anticipate they can reap
reputational beneﬁts by being among the ﬁrst to adopt
[12,13]. This dynamic helps to explain the rapid diffu-
sion of new technologies (e.g. smartphones) across
human networks e frontrunners are typically considered
‘savvy’.
However, the same reputational beneﬁts may not befall
frontrunners whose practices challenge an unsustainable
status quo, such as vegans, environmental activists, and
ethically conscious consumers. These individuals are
typically motivated by non-selﬁsh, moral concerns e e.g.
the conviction that meat consumption is exacerbating
climate change and thus harming future generations.
Their lack of self-interest could make them especially
effective change advocates [14,15], but recent research
found that such ‘do-gooders’ can also elicit hostile re-
sponses in others. When acting out of moral concern,

frontrunners may implicitly question the moral integrity
[16,17] and altruistic reputation [18] of those who stick
with the current, unsustainable status quo. As a result,
majority members can respond defensively when inter-
acting with environmentally conscious frontrunners;
they may derogate, ridicule, or even exclude individuals
who stand up to environmental disregard [19], refuse to
eat meat [20] or promote no-packaging stores [21*].
This sanctioning of do-gooders is not unique to the
environmental domain and appears to happen across
different cultures [22], but especially in ‘tight’ societies
[23*]. Importantly, by inviting social sanctions from
majority members [17], triggering negative stereotypes
[24,25], and by shaping exclusive social identities
[26**], environmentally conscious frontrunners have
even been argued to reinforce the majority’s commit-
ment to the current, environmentally damaging norms,
thus potentially slowing down social change.
In sum, recent literature seems to paint a rather pessi-
mistic
picture
of
the
ability
of
environmentally
conscious frontrunners (e.g. activists, vegans) to over-
throw current, unsustainable social norms and that of
social change to emerge in a bottom-up fashion. How-
ever, this interpretation overlooks another stream of
literature, one that documents the positive impact of
minorities on social change.
A more optimistic view on the impact of
minorities
Within a group, minorities are a source of intragroup
conﬂict, as they threaten the validity of the majority
opinion and thus prevent group consensus [9,27]. The
most obvious way to resolve this intragroup threat is for
majority members to pressure minority members to
change their public behaviour via social sanctions (i.e.
conformity) or to exclude or derogate those unwilling to
budge [28,29]. As reviewed above, this response has
been frequently documented in recent psychological
literature on responses to environmentally conscious
minorities. Conformity pressure and the social exclusion
of minorities are, however, not the only ways for groups
to deal with deviance [9,27e29]. Minorities, although
not always in obvious ways, can inﬂuence majorities.
Minorities can change private opinions
By introducing deviant views, minorities (especially
when consistently sticking to the same deviant position
on multiple occasions) can trigger majority members to
consciously reconsider their private opinion about the
status quo, a process called ‘conversion’ [9,27,28]. While
private conversion can occur directly as a result of expo-
sure to dissent, minority inﬂuence on publicly visible
actions tends to be indirect, as people want to avoid po-
tential social sanctions from the majority [9,27]. On a
societal level, this means that minorities initially only
affect others’ opinions and only later affect their public
behaviours [30]. Indeed, within human networks, atti-
tudes and opinions often spread before actions do [31].
The same process may hold in the context of pro-
environmental minorities. While many people, thanks
to the groundwork by minorities in the past, now pri-
vately have adopted the notion that climate change is an
urgent problem and that drastic change is needed, their
public actions often lag behind. This lag, at least partly,
may be driven by fear of social sanctions: people strongly
fear social exclusion when their deviant moral principles
are exposed to majority members [32], and fear of
stigma has been found to prevent aspiring vegans from
adopting a plant-based diet [33]. Indeed, particularly in
‘tight’ societies, in which conformity pressure is strong,
public behaviours often do not reﬂect private pro-
environmental
opinions
[34].
Thus,
while
pro-
environmental minorities may affect others’ private
opinions, their effect on others’ public actions is often
less visible. As a result, both minority and majority
members may underestimate the inﬂuence that minor-
ities can have.
Minorities can change norm perceptions
Norms tend to be self-fulﬁlling [35*,36]. An oft-cited
example is that of meat consumption: if most people
believe that most people eat meat, most people will
keep eating meat [37] without questioning the validity
of that practice. At the collective level, the pressure to
conform
to
current
majorities
can
create
a
self-
perpetuating feedback loop, whereby a network of in-
dividuals can end up getting ‘locked in’ [38**] by a
social norm that is societally disadvantageous [39].
One crucial effect of minorities is that they challenge
the self-fulﬁlling nature of current norms. By deviating
from the status quo, they show that an alternative path
is possible: an increase in the number of vegetarians, for
instance, signals to majority members that high levels of
meat consumption are not a ‘natural’ or lasting feature of
prosperous societies per se. Thus, the awareness that an
increasing minority is deviating from the norm (i.e. dy-
namic norms) can give majority members the feeling
that the current norm is ‘vulnerable’ [40], less ‘tight’
than previously thought [41,42], and will likely change
in the future [43**], thus motivating majority members
to deviate as well.
Recent studies have demonstrated this outcome in the
context of meat consumption [44]. Mentioning the fact
that a minority of Americans already limits their meat
consumption had little impact on non-vegan partici-
pants. They, however became more interested in eating
less meat themselves after reading a message indicating
that, although still a minority, more and more Americans
‘make an effort to reduce/limit their meat consumption’.
Communicating that an increasing number of people are

choosing meatless dishes may even increase the number
of vegetarian orders, provided that recipients perceive
that trend to apply to their own group [45].
Thus, pro-environmental minorities can inﬂuence ma-
jority members when they are perceived as frontrunners
of an emerging social norm. While summary statistics
[46*] and written messages (‘more and more people are
switching from to-go-cups to sustainable alternatives’)
can convey that change is imminent [47], physical dis-
plays of deviance are typically more powerful in inspiring
others [48,49]. Indeed, by organising pro-environmental
initiatives in public settings (e.g. jointly picking up
litter, community energy projects), minority members
can make majority members of the same overarching
group re-appraise their shared identity, strengthening
the perception of pro-environmental group norms and
identiﬁcation with this group [50**]. Minority mem-
bers’ public pro-environmental initiatives can thereby
motivate other members of the overarching group to also
display pro-environmental actions [50,51].
Minorities can offer social support for others
Asch [52] and others after him [53] demonstrated that
dissenters can facilitate others to also withstand major-
ity pressure, and liberate them to deviate as well. For
majority members who are privately uncomfortable with
existing environmentally harmful norms but whose be-
haviours lag behind due to fear of social sanctions, the
physical presence of ‘allies’ seems pivotal. During social
encounters with a unanimous majority of meat-eating
peers, many vegetarian participants chose to keep
their meat-free principles to themselves, thus silently
reinforcing the meat-eating norm [54**]. This pattern
disappeared,
however,
when
a
physically
present
moderator from the same overarching group showed
visible support for the minority position: vegetarian
participants now consistently displayed their meat-free
principles, despite the physical presence of a majority
of meat-eating peers.
In sum, by breaking the consensus, visible minority
members can give witnesses the feeling they would not
be alone when publicly challenging an environmentally
damaging practice as well, thus facilitating others to
follow suit.
Change may come
Without realising it, minority members can inﬂuence
the opinions and actions of majority members. Minor-
ities seem most inﬂuential when they are perceived as
representative of the larger group they share with the
majority [45, 50**, cf. 55], and when they ‘walk the talk’
[56] e when their words are supported by their actions
(e.g. joining a solar panel program themselves while
promoting it among majority members [57]). Impor-
tantly, those ‘infected’ majority members may, in turn,
start inﬂuencing other majority members as well [58].
By showing their deviant principles, minorities can
therefore help to create a vicious cycle [59,60] whereby
the magnetic force of the new norm increases over time,
up to the point where ‘critical mass’ is reached; when a
pro-environmental practice reaches a certain threshold,
the likelihood of it spreading throughout the entire
social network (i.e. the majority) increases dramatically.
However, when a minority is signiﬁcant but has not
reached critical mass (recently pinpointed to hover
around 25% of the population [61]) or fails to elicit
sufﬁcient ‘momentum’ [62], there is a chance that,
despite seeing the beneﬁts of behavioural change, the
majority will not change their behaviour. The lack of
visible change in behaviours, however, does not mean
that the majority has a different opinion than the mi-
nority or that the minority is not inﬂuential. Rather, it
may mean that the pro-environmental minority is not
inﬂuencing behaviours, i.e. descriptive norms, yet.
Concluding remarks
The fact that currently, carbon-intensive practices are
still commonplace (e.g. high levels of meat consump-
tion) and that minorities challenging those norms un-
dergo social sanctions does not mean that social change
is not happening, nor that minorities are ineffective in
instigating change from the bottom up. Rather, minority
inﬂuence is often more indirect: they initially change
majority opinions (e.g. more and more people consider
themselves ‘ﬂexitarian’) and often only later affect ma-
jority behaviours. Although subtle, their inﬂuence is
crucial: once majority members notice that norms are
shifting, sudden tipping points can ensue. Thus, we see
room for optimism.
To kickstart this process, however, existing minorities
need to share their desire for change with majority
members during social interactions. There is reason to
assume this will not happen readily: existing minorities
may
erroneously
believe
they
are
not
‘infecting’
others and merely risk social sanctions by deviating from
an unsustainable norm. We, therefore, believe that
policymakers may be able to speed up social change in
the environmental domain by encouraging (preferably
consistent and representative) minority members to
publicly challenge unsustainable norms during social
interactions. We see this as an important avenue for
future research.
Speciﬁcally, policymakers can introduce interventions
targeted at making it more socially comfortable for
vegans, environmental activists, and other minority
members to challenge the environmentally damaging
norms in their social network during interactions with
majority members [see e.g. 63]. The introduction of
vegetarian defaults, for instance, could make it more
comfortable for aspiring vegetarians to introduce plant-

based meals in more conservative social environments.
Further, policymakers can (ﬁnancially and logistically)
support
bottom-up
pro-environmental
initiatives,
thereby facilitating minority members to inﬂuence ma-
jority members through their visible, pro-environmental
actions [cf. 50**].
In sum, while social change can and does occur spon-
taneously in a bottom-up fashion (e.g. #MeToo and
#BlackLivesMatter), policymakers may be able to
speed up this process in the environmental domain by
giving existing minorities ‘voice’.

Using computer simulations, the authors demonstrate that the micro-
level tendency to conform to local norms leads to a more pro-

escape current norms, but once critical mass is reached, change un-
folds faster. The paper also convincingly explains how social simula-
tions can be used by psychologists to generate novel hypotheses.

Building on their earlier work, the authors explore the various reasons
why exposure to dynamic norms – information signaling that an
increasing minority is adopting a behaviour – influences majorities.
The authors conclude that dynamic norms give witnesses the feeling
they can personally change is possible, is compatible with desired
identities, and is valued by others.

This work adds empirical support to the notion that minorities, at least
when perceived as increasing in size, affect not only opinions, but also
non-publicly visible actions; reduced water consumption.

Three studies support the propostion that bottom-up pro-environmental
initiatives (i.e. formed by some regular members of a group them-
selves) can strenghten pro-environmental social identity (pro-environ-
mental norms and group identification) in members of the overarching
group, and thereby motivate pro-environmental actions.
