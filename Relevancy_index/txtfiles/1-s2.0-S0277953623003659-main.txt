Background: Climate change is a threat to the mental and emotional wellbeing of all humans, but young people 
are particularly vulnerable. Emerging evidence has found that young people’s awareness of climate change and 
the danger it poses to the planet can lead to negative emotions. To increase our understanding about this, survey 
instruments are needed that measure the negative emotions young people experience about climate change. 
Research questions: (1) What survey instruments are used to measure negative emotional responses to climate 
change in young people? (2) Do survey instruments measuring young people’s negative emotional responses to 
climate change have evidence of reliability and validity? (3) What factors are associated with young people’s 
negative emotional responses to climate change? 
Methods: A systematic review was conducted by searching seven academic databases on November 30, 2021, 
with an update on March 31, 2022. The search strategy was structured to capture three elements through various 
keywords and search terms: (1) negative emotions, (2) climate change, and (3) surveys. 
Results: A total of 43 manuscripts met the study inclusion criteria. Among the 43 manuscripts, 28% focused 
specifically on young people, while the other studies included young people in the sample but did not focus 
exclusively on this population. The number of studies using surveys to examine negative emotional responses to 
climate change among young people has increased substantially since 2020. Survey instruments that examined 
worry or concern about climate change were the most common. 
Conclusion: Despite growing interest in climate change emotions among young people, there is a lack of research 
on the validity of measures of such emotions. Further efforts to develop survey instruments geared to oper­
ationalize the emotions that young people are experiencing in relation to climate change are needed.   
1. Introduction 
Climate change is having a significant influence on human health, 
including both physical and mental health (World Health Organization, 
2021). While the physical health impacts of climate change have 
received more research attention, the mental health impacts are also 
profound (World Health Organization, 2022a). Recent years have seen 
an increase in studies examining how climate change has, and will, 
impact emotional and mental health, as well as a growing interest in the 
topic among policymakers, healthcare professionals, and the public 
(Charlson et al., 2021; Clayton et al., 2021). A turning point for this was 
in 2017, when the American Psychological Association and ecoAmerica 
produced a report (Clayton et al., 2017), updated in 2021 (Clayton et al., 
2021), underscoring climate change as a mental health issue. Addi­
tionally, the World Health Organization has recognized that risks exist to 
mental and psychosocial health due to the changing climate (World 
Health Organization, 2021). 
The effects of climate change on mental health and wellbeing can be 
direct, such as through the experience of an extreme weather event 
(characteristic of those that have increased due to the changing climate),

or more indirect, such as stress from migration or school shut-downs 
(Hayes et al., 2018). Further, negative emotions, such as anxiety, 
worry, and despair, due to an awareness of the threat posed to the planet 
by climate change may occur (Ojala et al., 2021). Such negative emo­
tions are the focus of this review. 
The literature on negative emotions and climate change illustrates 
the complexity of the issue (Heeren and Asmundson, 2023). On one 
hand, negative emotions stemming from climate change awareness are 
rational, and potentially adaptive, in that they can lead to 
pro-environmental action. This is an outcome that may benefit the 
planet as a whole, and consequently the collective health and wellbeing 
of human populations (Martin et al., 2022a). As stated by Ojala and 
Bengtsson (2019, p. 926), “climate change is one of the most serious 
environmental problems, and if it is not seen as a threat, people will 
hardly feel motivated to search for solutions to this problem and act”. On 
the other hand, negative emotional responses to an awareness of climate 
change, and its consequences, may also be overwhelming and hard to 
deal with (Royal College of Psychiatrists, 2020). This may have impli­
cations for an individual’s mental health and wellbeing, as well as 
impede pro-environmental action if people feel hopeless or paralyzed 
(Heeren and Asmundson, 2023; Stanley et al., 2021). It has been theo­
rized that despair about climate change can be as threatening to the 
planet as denial, in that both may lead to inaction (Pinsky et al., 2020). 
Research gaps on climate change emotions have prevented a fuller un­
derstanding of this issue, which is necessary to develop evidence-based 
strategies (Heeren and Asmundson, 2023). 
1.1. Climate change emotions and young people 
Climate change threatens the emotional and mental wellbeing of all 
persons, but young people are particularly affected (Berry et al., 2010; 
Coffey et al., 2021; Hayes et al., 2018). Younger populations are the 
group alive today that will see the most impact of climate change within 
their lifetime (McGushin et al., 2022). Moreover, they have been 
exposed to a high degree of media exposure, public discussion, and 
education on the issue (Gubler et al., 2019). This awareness of climate 
change and the threat it poses to the planet can lead to emotions such as 
despair, worry, and frustration (Ojala, 2012a; Ojala et al., 2021). 
Emerging evidence from several countries shows that negative emotions 
from climate change awareness are prevalent. For example, 84% of 
young people aged 16–25 years, in a global study of ten countries, re­
ported being at least moderately worried about climate change and 67% 
reported feeling sad (Hickman et al., 2021). Given evidence of a high 
prevalence of negative emotions in response to climate change and the 
potential links with both individual and collective health and wellbeing, 
there is an urgent need for research to better understand these emotional 
experiences among young people. 
1.2. Measuring the climate change emotions of young people 
Although concepts that address negative emotional responses to 
climate change (such as “climate anxiety” and “eco-anxiety”) have 
gained traction in the media (e.g., Taylor and Murray, 2020) and 
theoretical research (Burke et al., 2018; Charlson et al., 2022), gaps in 
data and inconsistent terminology have precluded a deeper under­
standing of how young people experience the threats and realities of 
climate change (Heeren and Asmundson, 2023). Studies of children 
have primarily focused on either anxiety or worry, yet are inconsistent in 
how these emotional constructs are operationalized (Martin et al., 
2022a; Wu et al., 2020). 
Furthermore, research on negative emotions in relation to climate 
change among young people has been hindered by methodological 
limitations, including poorly operationalized constructs relating to 
climate change and mental health and wellbeing (Charlson et al., 2022). 
Although a previous systematic review found that the concept of climate 
change anxiety can be reliably measured in adults, there is limited 
evidence on what are appropriate measures for use with young people 
(Coffey et al., 2021). Measurement instruments that show evidence of 
validity and reliability are therefore needed to better understand this 
phenomenon and appropriately support young people. In sum, consis­
tent evidence suggests that young people experience negative emotional 
responses in reaction to climate change; however, there is wide variation 
in how these emotional responses have been operationalized and 
measured. Given the increased interest in this topic across multiple 
disciplines and sectors, it becomes important that the research com­
munity strives towards using measurement tools which have strong 
evidence of validity and reliability for use among young people. 
1.3. Climate change emotions and associated factors 
Although studies are limited, there is some evidence that not all 
negative emotions about climate change are related to health and 
behavior outcomes in the same way. For example, a study of American 
adolescents (aged 11–14) found that despair about climate change was 
negatively related to pro-environmental behaviours; however, feeling 
concerned about climate change was positively associated with pro- 
environmental behaviours (Stevenson and Peterson, 2016). Addition­
ally, in a study of Americans aged 18+, different emotions about climate 
change (e.g., anger, depression, and anxiety) had differential relation­
ships with overall mental wellbeing and pro-environmental behaviours 
(Stanley et al., 2021). 
To better understand such relationships, a more nuanced under­
standing of the mental and emotional impacts of climate change is 
needed (Charlson et al., 2022). To support this, the aim of this review is 
to examine how survey instruments (defined here as any single, or set of 
question(s), used in survey research) measure negative emotional re­
sponses about climate change among young people (aged 10–24). Spe­
cifically, this systematic review seeks to address the following research 
questions:  
(1) What survey instruments are used to measure negative emotional 
responses to climate change in young people?  
(2) Do survey instruments measuring young people’s negative 
emotional responses to climate change have evidence of reli­
ability and validity?  
(3) What factors are associated with young people’s negative 
emotional responses to climate change? 
2. Method 
A systematic review was undertaken to answer the above research 
questions. The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Sys­
tematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines (Page 
et al., 2021) and was informed by the Consensus-based Standards for the 
Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) methodology 
for systematic reviews of patient-reported outcome measures (Mokkink 
et al., 2018). The review has been registered with PROSPERO (https:// 
www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/) and the protocol was published (Martin 
et al., 2022b). 
2.1. Search strategy 
The search strategy was developed building on previous reviews and 
commentaries on similar topics (Burke et al., 2018; Clayton, 2020; 
Martin et al., 2022a) and through consultation with a health information 
specialist librarian. The search strategy contains three elements: (1) 
negative emotions, (2) climate change, and (3) surveys. All database 
search strategies are presented in the review protocol (see Martin et al., 
2022b). 
Searches were conducted in seven academic databases (CINAHL, 
ERIC, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, and Environment 
Complete). Additionally, The Journal of Climate Change and Health was

hand-searched. The searches were conducted on the 30th of November 
2021 (with an update on the 31st of March 2022) by a health infor­
mation specialist librarian with expertise in conducting database- 
specific searches. Boolean and proximity operators were used, with 
the search strategy adapted to be database specific (Martin et al., 
2022b). Restrictions were set to only include articles written in English 
and published beginning in the year 2006. The year 2006 was chosen 
because a previous scoping review found that studies about climate 
change emotions among children were not found before this year 
(Martin et al., 2022a). Therefore, we felt that this was a suitable cutoff 
even for our extended age range (i.e., young people aged 10–24 versus 
children younger than 19 years of age) as the trend in research on this 
topic is likely to track among different populations. 
To be included, studies were (1) published in an academic book or 
journal and (2) reported the use, original development, or refinement of 
survey instruments that measure negative emotional responses to 
climate change awareness among young people. Study designs that were 
included were pilot, cross-sectional, longitudinal, mixed-methods, and 
measurement validation studies. To support a global review, we 
included studies from any geographic location. The study population 
was young people, defined as those aged 10–24 years (World Health 
Organization, 2022b); however, to be exhaustive, no exclusion criteria 
were applied based on age in the initial database search. Rather, given 
the emerging nature of this field of study, we included any studies that 
involved young people, even if the study’s sample also included older or 
younger populations. Studies that only examined mental health re­
sponses from experiencing a specific extreme weather event (e.g., 
post-traumatic stress after a specific flood event) were excluded, as this 
would be a context-specific direct effect and may not apply to the gen­
eral population of young people. Additionally, we excluded studies that 
focused on a specific sub-group even with some participants aged <25 in 
the sample as these reflected unique populations – for example, parents 
of young children and climate change experts. Studies were also 
excluded if they were specific to only one aspect of climate change (i.e., 
too focused) or were based on emotions about the environment in 
general versus climate change (i.e., not focused enough). See Supple­
mentary Table 1 for inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Search results were exported from academic databases into the 
reference management software Zotero (www.zotero.org) and dupli­
cates were removed. The studies were then imported to the review 
management software Covidence (www.covidence.org). In Covidence 
two researchers (TR & MA) independently screened manuscripts for 
eligibility at both the titles/abstract and full text phases. Disagreements 
on inclusion/exclusion were resolved through discussion, with a third 
reviewer brought in where agreement could not be met. 
2.2. Data extraction 
Studies were grouped by population under study (i.e., only younger 
participants, general population studies that included younger partici­
pants, university students, and other populations). Note that we 
included some studies (e.g., Reyes et al., 2023) in the young people 
specific category although the age range maximum was a few years 
above 24, however, we felt that this was a better categorization than the 
general population because of the considerable overlap in age ranges. 
Data were extracted into a predefined excel spreadsheet by GM and 
confirmed by AC. Data extracted included author, year of publication 
and data collection, country of the study, sample size, participant ages, 
study design, which negative emotion(s) were assessed in the study, and 
the number of items that were used to measure each climate change 
related emotion. 
Additionally, to answer Research Question 3, factors associated with 
young people’s negative emotions about climate change were extracted. 
Given the focus of this review on young people, we only examined 
associated factors for a subset of studies that either focused solely on 
younger people or reported results separately for young people. 
2.3. Quality assessment 
An evaluation of the methodological quality of survey instruments 
was conducted using the COSMIN checklist. The COSMIN checklist is 
module-based, meaning different “boxes” are used to evaluate various 
aspects of methodological quality regarding measurement properties 
(Mokkink et al., 2018). We used a subset of modules in our evaluation; 
specifically, Box 1: Development and Box 2: Content validity. Addi­
tionally, for multi-item scales, internal structure was evaluated using 
Box 3: Structural validity, Box 4: Internal consistency (an indicator of 
reliability of items), and Box 5: Cross-cultural validity and measurement 
invariance. If the study only included a single item measure, Boxes 3–5 
were deemed not applicable. If the study used a multi-item scale that 
was previously reported on in terms of development and content val­
idity, Boxes 1 and 2 were determined to be not applicable. 
Following the module-based quality evaluation, a grade for each 
survey instrument was applied using a modification of the Grading of 
Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) 
principles (Mokkink et al., 2018). This approach pools any studies that 
used the same instrument and applies a grade based on the factors 
addressed in the modules. In this case we focus on risk of bias (i.e., the 
methodological quality of the studies). In the current review we were 
interested in assessing the applicability of the survey instrument spe­
cifically for young people; therefore, studies that did not examine young 
people in particular were downgraded (see Table 1). The starting point 
was always the assumption that the study was of high quality. The 
quality was subsequently downgraded to moderate, low, or very low 
evidence when there was risk of bias. Table 1 gives the approach used, 
modified from Mokkink et al. (2018). It is important to note that the 
quality assessment only indicates the quality in terms of survey instru­
ment reporting and methodology specific to the survey instrument(s) 
that examine negative emotions regarding climate change, and not to 
other aspects of the research being reported in each manuscript. 
Two authors (GM & AC) independently undertook quality assess­
ment and agreed on a grade through discussion. 
2.3. Data synthesis 
Results were synthesized using a narrative synthesis approach 
(Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group, 2013). To 
determine how the various measurements are operationalized we 
examined the items (i.e., specific questions) that fell within each broader 
negative emotional construct as defined by the study author(s). To 
visualize this, we plotted the item questions against the broader concept 
that the study had stated it was trying to measure in an alluvial diagram 
(Lee et al., 2022).

3. Results 
The initial search retrieved 11,380 documents with a total of 5,912 
when excluding all duplicates. These studies were screened at the title 
and abstract phase. The two screeners (TR & MA) had high agreement at 
this phase (93%) and all disagreements were resolved through discus­
sion. At full text screening there were 160 papers identified as poten­
tially meeting the inclusion criteria; the two screeners had lower 
agreement at this phase (75%) with most of the disagreements resolved 
through discussion, however, 10 were resolved through review by a 
third researcher (GM). After the screening process, 35 studies met the 
inclusion criteria. An updated search yielded an additional 8 studies for 
inclusion, for a total of 43 studies (Fig. 1). 
Table 2 shows study characteristics. Among the 43 studies, 12 (28%) 
were focused specifically on young people only, while 19 (44%) were 
general population studies that included young people in the sample but 
did not report on survey instrument use specifically for young people; 
additionally, 9 (21%) were focused on university student populations, 
and 3 were from other populations that did not fall into the three pre­
viously described categories. The majority of studies were exclusively 
from Europe, North America, Australia, or New Zealand (81%–5 from 
the 2016/17 European Social Survey). Most studies used a cross- 
sectional design (77%), while five were specifically development and 
validation studies, three used a longitudinal design, and two were 
experimental. The number of studies that had used surveys to examine 
negative emotional responses to climate change among young people 
increased substantially beginning in 2019/2020, with more than half of 
the manuscripts included being from 2021/22 (Fig. 2). 
3.1. Measurement of negative emotional responses to climate change 
3.1.1. Types of survey instruments 
Survey instruments that measured negative emotional responses to 
climate change among young people fell into three general categories: 
(1) single items – one question was used to reflect an emotional construct, 
(2) multi-item scales – multiple questions were used to reflect a single 
construct, (3) multiple emotion checklists – multiple emotions are pre­
sented in a checklist with each emotion selected by the participant as a 
unique emotional construct. Of all the 43 studies, 24 used a multi-item 
scale (Acquadro Maran and Begotti, 2021; Brugger et al., 2016; Clayton 
and Karazsia, 2020; Feather and Williams, 2022; Gibson et al., 2020; 
Gubler et al., 2019; Hine et al., 2013; Hogg et al., 2021; Innocenti et al.,

Peterson, 2016; Stewart, 2021; Van Der Linden, 2014; Verplanken et al., 
2020; Wullenkord et al., 2021) (6 were validations or uses of the Climate 
Change Anxiety Scale originated by Clayton and Karazsia, 2020) and 
two were an adaptation of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Acquadro 
Maran and Begotti, 2021; Ogunbode et al., 2023) which combines 
questions of multiple states such as anxious or calm (reverse coded) 
(Spielberger et al., 1983) to create a mutli-item scale measure. Eighteen

2021; Swim et al., 2022; Temte et al., 2019; Wong-Parodi and Feygina, 
2021), of these five were using the same item from the European Social 
Survey Round 8 data (“how worried are you about climate change?"). 
Five of the 43 studies used a multiple emotions checklist (Hickman et al., 
2021; Iniguez-Gallardo et al., 2021; Pfautsch and Gray, 2017; Swim 
et al., 2022; Verplanken et al., 2020). For example, Hickman et al. 
(2021) asked, does climate change make you feel any of the following?.. 
sad, helpless, anxious, afraid, optimistic, angry, guilty, ashamed, hurt, 
depressed, despair, grief, powerless, indifferent, with a response option 
for each emotion of yes/no/prefer not to say. 
Of the 12 studies focused only on young people, all of them included 
a measure of worry and/or concern (except Reyes et al., 2023 who 
focused on climate change anxiety) (Table 2). Most of these studies used

a single item (e.g., “how concerned are you about climate change?“; 
“how much worry do you have about climate change?“, Sciberras and 
Fernando, 2022; Ojala, 2012a, respectively) to measure worry or 
concern, but there were also multi-item scales in studies of young people 
that were used (Gubler et al., 2019; Ojala, 2012b, 2013; Stevenson and 
Peterson, 2016). Only three papers included measures of other 
emotional responses beyond worry, concern, or anxiety. Specifically, 
Hickman et al. (2021) included a checklist of multiple emotions, in 
addition to a single item about worry. Lefkeli et al. (2018) identified two 
multi-item scales, that were considered a positive emotion multi-item 
scale (concern, fear, interest) and a negative emotion multi-item scale 
(optimism-reversed, anger, anxiety). Stevenson and Peterson (2016) 
utilized a multi-item scale of despair in addition to a multi-item measure 
of concern. 
Among the 19 studies of the general population, five were from the 
European Social Survey (ESS) which used a single item that asked about 
worry (Table 2). Of note, despite the same item being used, different 
authors used varying terminology for the concept they were examining 
(i.e., worry, concern, eco-anxiety) (Bodor et al., 2020; Bouman et al., 
2020; Gregersen et al., 2020, 2021; Hadarics, 2021). In several studies, 
multi-item scales were used to measure emotional constructs including 
anxiety (Clayton and Karazsia, 2020; Feather and Williams, 2022; 
Innocenti et al., 2021; Stanley et al., 2021; Wullenkord et al., 2021), 
distress (Gibson et al., 2020; Hine et al., 2013), depression (Stanley 
et al., 2021), anger (Stanley et al., 2021), worry (Verplanken et al., 
2020), and negative affect (Van Der Linden, 2014). Three studies 
included a checklist of multiple emotions (Iniguez-Gallardo et al., 2021; 
Swim et al., 2022; Verplanken et al., 2020). 
Of the nine studies of university student populations, four utilized 
multi-item anxiety scales (Acquadro Maran and Begotti, 2021; Hogg 
et al., 2021; Schwartz et al., 2022; Simon et al., 2022). Other emotions 
examined through multi-item scales included fear (Brugger et al., 2016), 
distress, hopelessness (Kulcar et al., 2022), and worry (Stewart, 2021). 
The majority of the studies used multi-item scales, with the exception of: 
a study using a checklist of multiple emotions (Pfautsch and Gray, 
2017), another study using a single item question about self-identified 
eco-anxiety (Hogg et al., 2021), and a study that used a single item of 
worry (Noth and Tonzer, 2022). 
Three studies included young people but did not fall into the cate­
gories above. One study measured negative climate-related emotions 
using a multi-item scale adapted from State-Trait Anxiety Inventory 
(Ogunbode et al., 2023). Another study examined climate change 
distress based on a multi-item scale (Searle and Gow, 2010). Finally, 
concern for climate change among patients (aged 18+) recruited at 
primary care services, was measured by asking a single item “are you 
concerned about global climate change?” (Temte et al., 2019) (see 
Table 2). 
3.1.2. Construct operationalization 
When looking at the items (questions) that were used to operation­
alize emotional constructs, the items that were most prevalent in studies 
addressed worry about climate change (Supplementary Figures 1 - 4). 
Questions about worry not only directly measured worry as a distinct 
construct, but also fed into the operationalization of other constructs, 
such as concern, anxiety, and distress. Questions about worry were also 
present in several multiple emotion checklists. 
Further, within the concepts of both anxiety and worry some studies 
identified separate sub-constructs. A sub-construct of habitual worry 
was identified (Verplanken et al., 2020) and measured using a scale that 
included many worry items (e.g., frequency, unintentional worrying 
thoughts). Several anxiety scales (the Climate Change Anxiety Scale and 
the Hogg Eco-Anxiety Scale) included sub-constructs of anxiety. The 
Climate Change Anxiety Scale included two sub-scales: (1) cognitive 
emotional impairment and (2) functional impairment, while the Hogg 
Eco-Anxiety Scale included sub-scales of rumination, behavioral symp­
toms, anxiety about personal impact on climate change, and affective 
symptoms. 
Measures of climate change distress tended to include a broader 
range of emotion items, including being: anxious, concerned, worried, 
sad, angry, scared, helpless, depressed, and tense, among others (See 
Supplemental Figures 1-4). 
Similar to distress, multiple emotion checklists also considered a 
wide range of negative emotions, including sadness, guilt, anger, 
powerlessness, confusion, isolation, to name a few. In some instances, 
cognitive attitudes, such as skepticism, were also included in the 
checklist of emotions (e.g., Iniguez-Gallardo et al., 2021). 
3.2. Quality assessment of survey instruments measuring young people’s 
negative emotions about climate change 
Using the adjusted COSMIN checklist, we evaluated 32 studies/sur­
vey instruments (see Table 2 for quality assessment and Supplementary 
Table 2 for rationale of assessment). In most cases we evaluated the 
reporting of the study; however, for some survey instruments we were 
able to pool studies – specifically, the Climate Change Anxiety Scale, 
adapted State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Searle & Gow two-factor 
distress and hopelessness scale, Ojala (2012b) worry scale, and the 
single worry item used in the European Social Survey Round 8. The 
majority of studies/survey instruments (18 of 32 evaluated survey 
instruments/studies) were low quality; followed by 10 measures of 
moderate quality, and 4 of very low quality. This was primarily due to a 
lack of reporting in terms of the development of the survey instrument 
and because only studies that reported specifically on young people 
could be rated as high quality. Of note, the studies specific to younger 
people tended to provide more detail on survey item design and use of 
qualitative development approaches than studies of the general popu­
lation or university students, while validity evidence of multi-item scales 
were most prevalent in studies of university students. 
Only one study addressed potential cross-cultural validity and mea­
surement invariance, i.e., whether a measure is in fact quantifying the 
same construct across different populations. Specifically, Stewart (2021) 
examined whether a ten-item scale of climate change worry was 
invariant for men and women among a university sample and found 
evidence that a single dimension construct functioned similarly for men 
and women. 
3.3. Factors associated with young people’s negative emotions about 
climate change 
Table 3 presents the factors that were examined for associations with 
climate emotions among young people. For the twelve studies that only 
included young people, the factors addressed in studies as potentially 
being associated with negative climate change emotions generally fell 
into five categories: (1) Coping strategies (Ojala, 2012b, 2013); (2) 
Overall mental health and wellbeing (Reyes et al., 2023; Sciberras and 
Fernando, 2022); (3) Environmental behaviors (Skamp et al., 2021; 
Stevenson and Peterson, 2016); (4) Environmental knowledge and be­
liefs (Gubler et al., 2019; Harker-Schuch et al., 2021; Hickman et al., 
2021; Li and Monroe, 2019; Skamp et al., 2021); and (5) Demographics, 
such as age/grade, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (Gubler 
et al., 2019; Harker-Schuch et al., 2021; Li and Monroe, 2019; Stevenson 
and Peterson, 2016). 
Coping: The two studies on coping, both with Swedish young people, 
found that worry about climate change was positively related to 
meaning and problem-focused coping but negatively related to de- 
emphasizing the issue (Ojala, 2012b, 2013). 
Overall mental health and wellbeing: Reyes et al. (2023) found a pos­
itive association between climate change anxiety and psychological 
distress. A longitudinal study (Sciberras and Fernando, 2022) found that 
depression at 18/19 was high among those with persistent worry about 
climate change from age 10/11 to 18/19; but findings differed by the 
trajectory of climate change worry during these years.

Environmental behaviours: Environmental behaviour relationships 
with climate change emotions varied based on the emotion. Concern and 
worry (Skamp et al., 2021; Stevenson and Peterson, 2016) were posi­
tively related to pro-environmental behaviours while despair was 
negatively related (Stevenson and Peterson, 2016). 
Environmental knowledge and beliefs: Studies that examined environ­
mental beliefs and knowledge varied widely in terms of how these were 
measured and had generally mixed results. 
Demographics: In terms of demographics, gender was the most 
examined for differences in negative emotions about climate change, 
with studies only examining binary gender differences. Most studies 
examining gender differences examined concern and found girls had 
more climate concerns than boys (Gubler et al., 2019; Li and Monroe, 
2019; Stevenson and Peterson, 2016), while one study found no signif­
icant difference between genders (Harker-Schuch et al., 2021). Only one 
study looked at a construct other than concern by gender, finding no 
significant difference between boys and girls on climate despair (Ste­
venson and Peterson, 2016). 
4. Discussion 
This study systematically brought together survey instruments that 
measured negative emotions about climate change and is the first, to our 
knowledge, to consider the content of these survey instruments, as well 
as how these emotions relate to other factors among young people. This 
review provides several new insights: first, although climate change 
emotions among young people have received interest in media and 
theoretical research, as well as increased attention in empirical studies, 
there is a dearth of research investigating the measurement of such 
emotions. Second, a narrower range of emotions was explored in studies 
that focused specifically on young people compared to university stu­
dents and general populations that included young people in the sample. 
Third, the majority of studies were assessed as low quality – this in­
dicates that more consideration and clearer reporting are needed when 
measuring climate change emotions in survey research of young people. 
Finally, most studies were exclusively from Europe, North America, 
Australia, or New Zealand, underscoring an opportunity to examine if 
these survey instruments are valid for use in other regions. 
We found that the concepts of worry and anxiety were most preva­
lent in studies that examined negative emotions about climate change, 
and that among studies that only examined young people, this was even 
more so the case. This may be because most previous studies have 
focused on feelings about environmental consequences of climate 
change that have yet to occur (i.e., ‘prospective consequentialist emo­
tions’) (Stewart, 2021). Yet, like studies of the general population and 
university students that focused on a wider range of emotions, there is 
scope to consider other climate change emotions for young people. 
Young people are sensitive to issues relating to the natural environment 
(Lefkeli et al., 2018); therefore, the emotions they experience when 
developing an awareness of climate change may be complex. Examining 
if, and how, varying emotions may be indicators of latent constructs is 
an area that could yield insights into the diversity of emotions young 
people experience. The youngest of young people, i.e., early adolescents 
(approximately aged 10–14), are particularly vulnerable to the impacts 
of climate change due to being in formative phases of physical and 
cognitive development (Ojala, 2022) where they are forming world­
views and a sense of self-efficacy (Harker-Schuch et al., 2021; Ojala, 
2012a). Further, emotions about climate change may vary for younger 
adolescents compared to their older peers (≥18 years of age) as they will 
have different levels of agency, for example regarding household pur­
chasing and voting. Therefore, ensuring appropriate measures that fully 
address experiences across different age spectrums of young people is 
important. 
Most studies presenting validity evidence of multi-item scales were 
conducted in university student populations. More work is needed to 
ensure validity evidence of multi-item scales used in studies of younger 
participants outside of the university student population. Further, when 
multi-item scale items are used in studies, the factor structure should be 
examined to ensure that the measures are indeed measuring the latent 
construct under study for the sample. Additionally, addressing the 
suitability of measurement tools across key sub-groups (measurement 
invariance) was only present in one study (Stewart, 2021), which 
examined measurement equivalence for men and women. Examining 
the invariance of measures across key sub-groups, such as countries, 
urban/rural residence, different genders, ethnicity, and age, is impor­
tant to make meaningful comparisons between groups. 
When examining what factors are associated with young people’s 
negative emotional responses to climate change, few studies examined 
the dual, and potentially complex, relationships with pro-environmental 
behaviour and mental wellbeing. Such studies are needed to better un­
derstand how emotions about climate change are related to mental 
wellbeing as well as environmental sustainability. Further, the potential 
role of concurrent mental health symptoms should also be a consider­
ation to avoid tautology, as measures of climate change emotions could 
also be tapping into other concepts; for example, a measure of climate 
change worry could be an indicator of high general worry if this isn’t 
considered in the design of the survey instrument and the study (Ojala 
et al., 2021). More empirical work in this area will better inform both 
theory and practice. In terms of demographics, gender was the most 
examined demographic factor. Findings for gender generally indicated

that girls had increased concern about climate change compared to boys, 
indicating that gender is an important factor to consider in studies of 
climate change emotions. Future work that looks at other 
socio-demographic characteristics (e.g., culture, ethnicity), geography 
(e.g., urbanicity, community, experience of extreme weather events), 
and intersecting identities is needed. Additionally, coping strategies 
were related to worry in Swedish studies (Ojala, 2012b, 2013); there­
fore, research on the coping strategies used to deal with negative emo­
tions beyond the Swedish context is needed. 
Based on the findings of this review we have four key recommen­
dations for future studies: 
(1) Consideration should be given to invariance of measurement in­
struments across key groups (e.g., age, gender, culture, race/ 
ethnicity, urbanicity, region). This is needed to ensure rigor in 
studies that make comparisons across groups. 
(2) Longitudinal and repeated cross-sectional studies will be impor­
tant moving forward as exposure to extreme weather events and 
environmental changes will likely increase over time. Conse­
quently, understanding how young people experience this 
emotionally over time (within and across cohorts) is an important 
area for future inquiry. In such instances, measurement invari­
ance, see recommendation 1, between time-points should be 
considered.  
(3) Multiple emotions should be addressed. This study found that 
worry and concern were the most studied negative emotions 
about climate change in surveys of young people. However, there 
is evidence that other negative emotions such as sadness, grief, 
and anger are also experienced (Hickman et al., 2021; Stanley 
et al., 2021), and that different climate change emotions may 
vary in how they are associated with factors such as, general 
anxiety, stress, and pro-environmental behaviors (Stanley et al., 
2021).  
(4) Finally, we recommend that more research be undertaken that 
addresses survey instrument development specifically for young 
people. Studies developing and testing the validity of measures of 
negative climate change emotions were focused on university 
samples and, to a lesser degree, general population studies that 
included young people. Therefore, work focused on young people 
is needed to support the growing research on climate change 
emotions among this population. 
4.1. Limitations 
There are several limitations to the present review to consider. First, 
emotional and mental wellbeing in the context of climate change is an 
emergent area of study. As such, terminology is being established 
regularly, meaning the search strategy employed in this study may have 
missed some terms. Studies in languages other than English were not 
included. Gray literature and theses were also not included in the search 
strategy. Due to this, some relevant studies may have been missed. 
Owing to the small number of studies addressing factors related to 
negative emotions about climate change, it is not suitable to draw broad 
conclusions about these relationships. Future systematic reviews will be 
needed to examine this once more research evidence is available. 
4.2. Conclusions 
This systematic review examined survey instruments that measured 
negative emotions about climate change among young people. Despite 
growing interest in climate change emotions among this population, 
there is a lack of research on the validity of the measures of such emo­
tions. The number of studies that utilize surveys to study negative 
emotions about climate change among young people has substantially 
increased since 2020, but most survey instruments were not of high 
quality. More efforts are needed to develop and test the validity and 
reliability of survey instruments geared to measure the emotions that 
young people are experiencing in relation to climate change.
